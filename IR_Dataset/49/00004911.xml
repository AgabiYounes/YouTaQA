Located where the Swiss, French and German borders meet, Basel also has suburbs in [[France]] and [[Germany]]. {{Asof|2016}}, the Swiss Basel agglomeration was the third-largest in Switzerland, with a population of 541,000&lt;ref name=Agglomeration&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/en/home/statistics/cross-sectional-topics/city-statistics/agglomeration-portraits/basel.html &lt;!--|type=Statistics--&gt; |title=Agglomeration portraits: Basel |publisher=Federal Statistical Office FSO |location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland |type=official site |date=2017 |accessdate=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 74 municipalities in Switzerland (municipal count as of 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/querschnittsthemen/raeumliche-analysen/raeumliche-gliederungen/analyseregionen.html |title=Analyseregionen |publisher=Federal Statistical Office FSO |date=21 February 2018 |type=official site |location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland |language=de, fr |accessdate=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative ''Trinational Eurodistrict Basel (TEB)'' of 62 suburban communes including municipalities in neighboring countries, counted 829,000 inhabitants in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.are.admin.ch/are/de/home/raumentwicklung-und-raumplanung/programme-und-projekte/modellvorhaben-nachhaltige-raumentwicklung/modellvorhaben-nachhaltige-raumentwicklung-2002-2007/trinationaler-eurodistrict-basel--teb-.html |title=Trinationaler Eurodistrict Basel (TEB) |publisher=Bundesamt für Raumentwicklung ARE |date=2007 |type=official site |location=Berne, Switzerland |language=de, fr, it |accessdate=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official language of Basel is (the Swiss variety of Standard) [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local [[Basel German]] dialect.

The city is known for its many internationally renowned museums, ranging from the [[Kunstmuseum Basel|Kunstmuseum]], the first collection of art accessible to the public in Europe (1661) and the largest museum of art in the whole of Switzerland, to the [[Fondation Beyeler]] (located in [[Riehen]]). The [[University of Basel]], Switzerland's oldest university (founded in 1460), and the city's centuries-long commitment to [[humanism]], have made Basel a safe haven at times of political unrest in other parts of Europe for such notable people as [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]], the [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] family, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and in the 20th century also [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Karl Jaspers]].

The city of Basel is Switzerland's second-largest economic centre after the city of Zürich &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Guides|first=Rough|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=paCcDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT437&amp;lpg=PT437&amp;dq=The+city+of+Basel+is+Switzerland's+second-largest+economic+centre+after+the+city+of+Z%C3%BCrich&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yYPDHgl5dY&amp;sig=ACfU3U1YsYPpZkpC4jLz1-3B6t3xQxCrVA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJ2N39tvTnAhUjwcQBHd-yCCIQ6AEwE3oECBMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20city%20of%20Basel%20is%20Switzerland's%20second-largest%20economic%20centre%20after%20the%20city%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich&amp;f=false|title=Insight Guides Western Europe|date=2018-05-01|publisher=Apa Publications (UK) Limited|isbn=978-1-78919-601-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the highest [[GDP per capita]] in the country, ahead of the cantons of [[Zug]] and [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/442774/umfrage/bruttoinlandsprodukt-bip-pro-kopf-in-der-schweiz-nach-kantonen/&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of value, over 94% of Basel City's goods exports are in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors. With production facilities located in the neighboring Schweizerhalle, Basel accounts for 20% of Swiss exports and generates one third of the [[Gross national income|national product]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20160603054722/http://www.credit-suisse.com/media/mediarelease-assets/pdf/2009/03/000000021763.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Basel has been the seat of a [[Prince-Bishopric of Basel|Prince-Bishopric]] since the [[11th century]], and joined the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]] in 1501. The city has been a commercial hub and an important cultural centre since the [[Renaissance]], and has emerged as a centre for the [[Chemical industry|chemical]] and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical industries]] in the 20th century. In 1897, Basel was chosen by [[Theodor Herzl]] as the location for the first [[World Zionist Congress]], and altogether the congress has been held there ten times over a time span of 50 years, more than in any other location. The city is also home to the world headquarters of the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. The name of the city is internationally well-known through institutions like the [[Basel Accords]], [[Art Basel]] and [[FC Basel]].

In 2019 Basel, was ranked among the ten most liveable cities in the world by [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] together with [[Zürich]] and [[Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;https://mobilityexchange.mercer.com/Insights/quality-of-living-rankings&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Basel}}

=== Early history ===
[[File:Theater Kaiseraugst.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]] in Augusta Raurica ]]
There are traces of a settlement at the [[Rhine knee]] from the early [[La Tène period]] (5th century BC). In the 2nd century BC, there was a village of the [[Raurici]] at the site of ''Basel-Gasfabrik'', to the northwest of the Old City, likely identical with the town of ''Arialbinnum'' mentioned on the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;René Teuteberg: ''Basler Geschichte,'' p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The unfortified settlement was abandoned in the 1st century BC in favour of an ''[[Basel oppidum|oppidum]]'' on the site of [[Basel Minster]], probably in reaction to the [[Gallic War|Roman invasion of Gaul]].

In [[Roman Gaul]], [[Augusta Raurica]] was established some {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Basel as the regional administrative centre, while a ''[[castra]]'' (fortified camp) was built on the site of the Celtic ''oppidum''. The city of Basel eventually grew around the ''castra''. In AD 83, Basel was incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Germania Superior]]. Roman control over the area deteriorated in the 3rd century, and Basel became an outpost of the ''[[Provincia Maxima Sequanorum]]'' formed by [[Diocletian]].

The Germanic confederation of the [[Alemanni]] attempted to cross the Rhine several times in the 4th century, but were repelled; one such event was the [[Battle of Solicinium]] (368). However, in the great invasion of AD 406, the Alemanni appear to have crossed the Rhine river a final time, conquering and then settling what is today [[Alsace]] and a large part of the [[Swiss Plateau]]. From that time, Basel has been an Alemannic settlement.

The [[Duchy of Alemannia]] fell under [[Francia|Frankish]] rule in the 6th century, and by the 7th century, the former bishopric of Augusta Raurica was re-established as the [[Bishopric of Basel]]. Based on the evidence of a third ''solidus''{{clarify|date=August 2018}}{{Fix|text=Does this mean a coin worth one third of a solidus?}} with the inscription ''Basilia fit'', Basel seems to have minted its own coins in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmb.ch/en/collection/object/basel-kopie-vom-gold-triens-des-muenzmeisters-gunso-anfangs-7-jh-vs.html |title=Basel. Kopie vom Gold-Triens des Münzmeisters Gunso, Anfangs 7.

At the partition of the [[Carolingian Empire]], Basel was first given to [[West Francia]], but it passed to [[East Francia]] with the [[treaty of Meerssen]] of 870.

The city was plundered and destroyed by a [[Magyar invasion]] in 917. The rebuilt city became part of [[Upper Burgundy]], and as such was incorporated into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1032.

===Prince-Bishopric of Basel===
{{main|Prince-Bishopric of Basel }}
[[File:Basler - Basler Münster Westfassade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Basel Minster]], built between 1019 and 1500]]

From the donation by [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]]{{sfnb|Wood|2006|pp=285-286, 313}} of the [[Moutier-Grandval Abbey]] and all its possessions to Bishop [[Adalbero II of Metz]] in 999 until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Basel was ruled by [[Prince-Bishop|prince-bishop]]s (see [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Basel|Bishop of Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica'', [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1993, p.659&lt;/ref&gt; whose memory is preserved in the [[crosier]] shown on the Basel [[coat of arms]] – see above).

In 1019, the construction of the [[Basel Minster|cathedral of Basel]] (known locally as the ''Münster'') began under [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;Franz Kugler, ''[[Kleine Schriften]] und Studien zur Kunstgeschichte'', 1853, p. 486&lt;/ref&gt; In 1225–1226, a bridge, now known as the [[Middle Bridge, Basel|Middle Bridge]], was constructed by Bishop [[Heinrich von Thun]] and Lesser Basel ([[Kleinbasel]]) founded as a bridgehead to protect the bridge. The bridge was largely funded by Basel's Jewish community who had settled there a century earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;habicht&quot;&gt;Habicht, Peter, ''Basel - A Center at the Fringe '' (Basel: Christoph Merian Verlag, 2006) pp. 43, 55, 70, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; For many centuries to come Basel possessed the only permanent bridge over the river &quot;between [[Lake Constance]] and the sea&quot;.

The Bishop also allowed the [[furriers]] to establish a [[guild]] in 1226. Eventually about 15 guilds were established in the 13th century. They increased the town's, and hence the bishop's, reputation, influence, and income from the taxes and duties on goods in Basel's expanding market.&lt;ref name=&quot;habicht&quot;/&gt; The [[Crusade of 1267]] set out from Basel.

[[Black Death|The plague came to Europe]] in 1347, but did not reach Basel until June 1349. The guilds, asserting that the Jews were responsible—several had been tortured and confessed—demanded they be executed, which the Council did in January 1349, except for a few who escaped to Alsace.&lt;ref name=&quot;habicht&quot;/&gt; During the [[Basel massacre]], 600 Jews were murdered. They were shackled inside a wooden barn on an island in the Rhine, which was set afire. The few survivors - young orphans - were forcibly converted to Christianity. The council then forbade Jews in Basel for 200 years, except that their money was helpful in rebuilding after the [[1356 Basel earthquake|Basel earthquake of 1356]] which destroyed much of the city along with a [[Rötteln Castle|number of castles]] in the vicinity. The city offered courts to nobles as an alternative to rebuilding their castles, in exchange for the nobles' military protection of the city.

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - BASILEA.png|thumb|right|1493 woodcut of Basle, from the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]]]]
In 1412 (or earlier), the well-known [[Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen]] was established. Basel became the focal point of western Christendom during the 15th century [[Council of Basel]] (1431–1449), including the 1439 election of [[antipope Felix V]]. In 1459, [[Pope Pius II]] endowed the [[University of Basel]], where such notables as [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]] and [[Paracelsus]] later taught. At the same time the new craft of [[printing press|printing]] was [[Global spread of the printing press##Switzerland|introduced to Basel]] by apprentices of [[Johann Gutenberg]].

The [[Schwabe publishing house]] was founded in 1488 by [[Johannes Petri]] and is the oldest publishing house still in business. [[Johann Froben]] also operated his printing house in Basel and was notable for publishing works by Erasmus.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Nadler, ''Literaturgeschichte der deutschen Schweiz'', Grethlein 1932&lt;/ref&gt; In 1495, Basel was incorporated into the [[Upper Rhenish Circle|Upper Rhenish Imperial Circle]]; the Bishop of Basel was added to the Bench of the Ecclesiastical Princes of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. In 1500 the construction of the [[Basel Münster]] was finished. In 1521 so was the bishop.{{clarify|date=August 2018}} The Council, under the supremacy of the guilds, explained that henceforth they would only give allegiance to the Swiss Confederation, to whom the bishop appealed but in vain.&lt;ref name=&quot;habicht&quot;/&gt;

===As a member state in the Swiss Confederacy===
{{main|Canton of Basel}}
[[File:Merian Basel 1642.jpg|thumb|Map of Basel in 1642, engraved by [[Matthäus Merian]], oriented with SW at the top and NE at the bottom.]]
The city had remained neutral through the [[Swabian War]] of 1499 despite being plundered by soldiers on both sides. The [[Treaty of Basel (1499)|Treaty of Basel]] ended the war and granted the Swiss confederates exemptions from the emperor Maximillian's taxes and jurisdictions, separating Switzerland ''de facto'' from the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rappard&quot;&gt;Rappard, William, '' Collective Security in Swiss Experience 1291–1948'' (London, 1948) p. 85 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 1501, Basel joined the Swiss Confederation as its [[Canton of Basel|eleventh canton]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Strupp, ''Wörterbuch Des Völkerrechts'', De Gruyter 1960, p.225&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only canton that was asked to join, not the other way round. Basel had a strategic location, good relations with [[Strasbourg]] and [[Mulhouse]], and control of the corn imports from Alsace, whereas the Swiss lands were becoming overpopulated and had few resources. A provision of the Charter accepting Basel required that in conflicts among the other cantons it was to stay neutral and offer its services for mediation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Habicht, Peter, ''Basel - A Center at the Fringe'' (Basel 2006) p. 65 ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bonjour&quot;&gt;Bonjour, Edgar ''et al.'' ''A short History of Switzerland'' (Oxford, 1952) p. 139 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1503, the new bishop [[Christoph von Utenheim]] refused to give Basel a new constitution; whereupon, to show its power, the city began to build a new city hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;habicht&quot;/&gt;

In 1529, the city became Protestant under [[Johannes Oecolampadius|Oecolampadius]] and the bishop's seat was moved to [[Porrentruy]]. The bishop's crook was however retained as the city's coat of arms. For centuries to come, a handful of wealthy families collectively referred to as the [[Daig (Switzerland)|&quot;Daig&quot;]] played a pivotal role in city affairs as they gradually established themselves as a ''de facto'' [[Aristocracy|city aristocracy]].

The first edition of ''Christianae religionis institutio'' (''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' – [[John Calvin]]'s great exposition of [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] doctrine) was published at Basel in March 1536.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Rudolph Elton, Harold Fullard, Henry Clifford Darby, Charles Loch Mowat, ''[[The New Cambridge Modern History]]'', 1990, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1544, Johann von Brugge, a rich Dutch Protestant refugee, was given citizenship and lived respectably until his death in 1556, then buried with honors. His body was exhumed and burnt at the stake in 1559 after it was discovered that he was the Anabaptist [[David Joris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;habicht&quot;/&gt;

In 1543, ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'', the first book on human anatomy, was published and printed in Basel by [[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564).&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrations from the Works of Andreas Vesalius of Brussels'', Courier Dover Publications 1973, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

There are indications [[Joachim Meyer]], author of the influential 16th-century [[martial arts]] text ''Kunst des Fechten'' (&quot;The Art of Fencing&quot;), came from Basel. In 1662 the ''Amerbaschsches Kabinett'' was established in Basel as the first public museum of art. Its collection became the core of the later Basel Museum of Art.

The Bernoulli family, which included important 17th- and 18th-century mathematicians such as [[Jakob Bernoulli]], [[Johann Bernoulli]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]], were from Basel. The 18th-century mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] was born in Basel and studied under Johann Bernoulli.

===Modern history===
In 1792, the [[Rauracian Republic|Republic of Rauracia]], a revolutionary [[French client republic]], was created. It lasted until 1793.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Zschokke, Emil Zschokke, ''The History of Switzerland, for the Swiss People'', S. Low, Son &amp; Co. 1855, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of political agitation and a short civil war in 1833 the disadvantaged countryside seceded from the Canton of Basel, forming the half canton of [[Basel-Landschaft]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Türler, Marcel Godet, Victor Attinger, ''Historisch-biographisches Lexikon der Schweiz'', 1934, p.307&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 1874, Switzerland's first zoo, the [[Zoo Basel]], opened its doors in the south of the city towards [[Binningen, Switzerland|Binningen]].
[[File:THEODOR HERZL ADDRESSING THE FIRST OR SECOND ZIONIST CONGRESS IN BASEL, SWITZERLAND IN 1897-8.jpg|thumb|First [[World Zionist Congress]] in Basel, 1897 (Stadtcasino)]]
In 1897 the first [[World Zionist Congress]] was held in Basel. Altogether the World Zionist Congress was held in Basel ten times, more than in any other city in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Erster Zionistenkongress 1897 - Die Idee eines Judenstaates |url=http://www.domradio.de/radio/sendungen/anno-domini/die-idee-eines-judenstaates-erster-zionistenkongress-1897 |date=31 August 2015 |author=Ina Rottscheidt |publisher=domradio.de |location=Cologne, Germany |language=German |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 1938, the psychedelic drug [[LSD]] was first synthesized by Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] at [[Sandoz]] Laboratories in Basel.

In 1967, the population of Basel voted in favor of buying three works of art by painter [[Pablo Picasso]] which were at risk of being be sold and taken out of the local museum of art, due to a financial crisis on the part of the owner's family. Therefore, Basel became the first city in the world where the population of a political community democratically decided to acquire works of art for a public institution. Pablo Picasso was so moved by the gesture that he subsequently gifted the city with an additional three paintings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.srf.ch/kultur/kunst/legendaerer-volksentscheid-das-picasso-wunder-von-basel&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basel as a historical, international meeting place===
Basel has often been the site of peace negotiations and other international meetings. The [[Treaty of Basel (1499)]] ended the [[Swabian War]]. Two years later Basel joined the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. The [[Peace of Basel]] in 1795 between the French Republic and Prussia and Spain ended the [[First Coalition]] against France during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. In more recent times, the [[World Zionist Organization]] held its first congress in Basel from August 29 through August 31, 1897. Because of the [[Balkan Wars]], the (Socialist) [[Second International]] held an extraordinary congress at Basel in 1912. In 1989, the [[Basel Convention]] was opened for signature with the aim of preventing the export of [[hazardous waste]] from wealthy to [[developing country|developing nations]] for disposal.

==Name==
{{anchor|Name}}
The origin of the name of Basel is uncertain. It may be derived from the Roman-era toponym ''Basilia'', which originally meant a public building and later a church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://search.ortsnamen.ch/de/|title= Basel |date= |website= ortsnamen.ch| access-date= 10 February 2020 |quote=einem nordgalloromanischen Ortsnamentypus *basilia (Fellmann 1981: 48s) gestellt. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that it comes through the from the personal [[Greek language|Greek]] name [[Basilius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristol&quot;&gt;''Basileam applicuerunt'' (AD 237 or 238). Andres Kristol: ''Basel BS (Basel Stadt)'' in: ''Dictionnaire toponymique des communes suisses – [[Lexikon der schweizerischen Gemeindenamen]] – Dizionario toponomastico dei comuni svizzeri (DTS|LSG).'' Centre de dialectologie, Université de Neuchâtel, Verlag Huber, Frauenfeld/Stuttgart/Wien 2005, {{ISBN|3-7193-1308-5}} und Éditions Payot, Lausanne 2005, {{ISBN|2-601-03336-3}}, S.&amp;nbsp;125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Old French form ''Basle'' was adopted into English, and developed into the modern French ''Bâle''. The Icelandic name ''Buslaraborg'' goes back to the 12th century ''[[Leiðarvísir og borgarskipan]]'' chronicle.

===Language===
Most of the population ({{as of|2000|lc=on}}) speaks [[German language|German]] (129,592 or 77.8%), with [[Italian language|Italian]] being second most common (9,049 or 5.4%) and [[French language|French]] being third (4,280 or 2.6%).

===Religion===
[[File:Basler Synagoge(ws) retouched.jpg|thumb|The main [[synagogue]] of Basel]]
From the {{as of|2000|alt=2000 census}}, 41,916 or 25.2% were [[Roman Catholic]], while 39,180 or 23.5% belonged to the [[Swiss Reformed Church]]. Of the rest of the population, there were 4,567 members of an [[Orthodox church]] (or about 2.74% of the population), there were 459 individuals (or about 0.28% of the population) who belonged to the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland|Christian Catholic Church]], and there were 3,464 individuals (or about 2.08% of the population) who belonged to another Christian church. There were 12,368 individuals (or about 7.43% of the population) who were Muslim. There were 1,325 individuals (or about 0.80% of the population) who were [[Judaism|Jewish]], however only members of religious institutions are counted as such by the municipality, which makes the actual number of people of Jewish descent living in Basel considerably higher.

===Transport===
Basel's airport is set up for airfreight; heavy goods reach the city and the heart of [[continental Europe]] from [[North Sea|the North Sea]] by ship along the Rhine. The main European routes for the highway and railway transport of freight cross in Basel. The outstanding location benefits logistics corporations, which operate globally from Basel. Trading firms are traditionally well represented in the Basel Region.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Port====
[[File:Middle Bridge, Basel, Switzerland.JPG|thumb|The [[Rhine]] as Switzerland's gateway to the sea]]
Basel has Switzerland's only cargo port, through which goods pass along the navigable stretches of the [[Rhine]] and connect to ocean-going ships at the [[port of Rotterdam]].

====Air transport====
[[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg]] is operated jointly by two countries, France and Switzerland, although the airport is located completely on French soil. The airport itself is split into two architecturally independent sectors, one half serving the French side and the other half serving the Swiss side; prior to [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] there was an immigration inspection point at the middle of the airport so that people could &quot;emigrate&quot; to the other side of the airport.

====Railways====
[[File:Basel, station Basel SBB foto1 2013-07-20 10.31.jpg|thumb|[[Basel SBB railway station|Basel Bahnhof SBB]], self-proclaimed &quot;world's first international railway station.&quot;]]
Basel has long held an important place as a rail hub. Three railway stations—those of the German, French and Swiss networks—lie within the city (although the Swiss ([[Basel SBB railway station|Basel SBB]]) and French ([[Basel SBB railway station|Bâle SNCF]]) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and [[Immigration]] facilities). [[Basel Badischer Bahnhof]] is on the opposite side of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the [[Basel Regional S-Bahn]]. The largest goods railway complex of the country {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new highspeed ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the [[LGV Rhin-Rhône|TGV Rhin-Rhône]] line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infolignes.com/recherche.php?date_num_train=2012|05|14&amp;type_heure=1&amp;train_horaire_depart=14|00&amp;next_horaire=14|00&amp;num_train=9218 SNCF website, TGV Lyria 9218] accessed 14 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roads====
Basel is located on the [[A3 motorway (Switzerland)|A3 motorway]].

Within the city limits, five bridges connect Greater and Lesser Basel (downstream):

* Schwarzwaldbrücke (built 1972)
* Wettsteinbrücke (current structure built 1998, original bridge built 1879)
* Mittlere Rheinbrücke (current structure built 1905, original bridge built 1225 as the first bridge to cross the Rhine River)
* Johanniterbrücke (built 1967)
* Dreirosenbrücke (built 2004, original bridge built 1935)

====Ferries====
A somewhat anachronistic yet still widely used system of [[reaction ferry]] boats links the two shores. There are four ferries, each situated approximately midway between two bridges. Each is attached by a cable to a block that rides along another cable spanning the river at a height of {{convert|20|to|30|m|abbr=off}}. To cross the river, the ferryman orients the boat around 45° from the current so that the current pushes the boat across the river. This form of transportation is therefore completely hydraulically driven, requiring no outside energy source.

[[File:River ferry (Basel, Switzerland).jpg|thumb|Cable ferry across the Rhine in Basel]]

====Public transport====
[[File:Basel - Straßenbahnnetzplan.png|thumb|Basel tram network]]
Basel has an extensive public transportation network serving the city and connecting to surrounding suburbs, including a large [[Basel Trams|tram network]]. The green-colored local [[light rail|trams]] and buses are operated by the [[Basler Verkehrs-Betriebe]] (BVB). The yellow-colored buses and trams are operated by the [[Baselland Transport]] (BLT), and connect areas in the nearby half-canton of Baselland to central Basel. The BVB also shares commuter bus lines in cooperation with transit authorities in the neighboring Alsace region in [[France]] and [[Baden]] region in [[Germany]]. The [[Basel Regional S-Bahn]], the commuter rail network connecting to suburbs surrounding the city, is jointly operated by [[Schweizerische Bundesbahnen|SBB]], [[SNCF]] and [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]].

====Border crossings====
Basel is located at the meeting point of France, Germany and Switzerland; because it is so near other countries and is beyond the [[Jura Mountains]], many within the [[Swiss military]] reportedly believe that the city is indefensible during wartime.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcphee19831031&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&amp;startpage=page0000103#folio=050 | title=La Place de la Concorde Suisse-I | work=The New Yorker | date=31 October 1983 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | author=McPhee, John | pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has numerous road and rail crossings between Switzerland and the other two countries. With Switzerland joining the [[Schengen Area]] on 12 December 2008, immigration checks were no longer carried out at the crossings. However, Switzerland did not join the [[European Union Customs Union]] (though it did join the [[EU Single Market]]) and customs checks are still conducted at or near the crossings.

Additionally there are many footpaths and cycle tracks crossing the border between Basel and Germany.

===Health===
[[File:Basel 2012-10-05 Batch (61).JPG|thumb|University Children's hospital Basel]]
As the biggest town in the Northwest of Switzerland numerous public and private health centres are located in Basel. Among others the [[University Hospital of Basel|Universitätsspital Basel]] and the Universitätskinderspital Basel. The [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophical]] health institute Klinik-Arlesheim (formerly known as Lukas-Klinik and Ita-Wegman-Klinik) are both located in the Basel area as well. Private health centres include the Bethesda Spital and the Merian Iselin Klinik. Additionally the [[Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute]] is located in Basel too.

===Energy===
Basel is at the forefront of a national vision to more than halve [[energy|energy use]] in Switzerland by 2050. In order to research, develop and commercialise the technologies and techniques required for the country to become a [[2000-watt society|2000 Watt society]], a number of projects have been set up since 2001 in the Basel metropolitan area. These include demonstration buildings constructed to [[Minergie]] or ''[[Passive house|Passivhaus]]'' standards, [[electricity]] generation from [[renewable energy]] sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/swissinfo.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=7407138|title=Geothermal project shakes Basel again|work=SWI swissinfo.ch|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vehicles using [[natural gas]], [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]] and [[biogas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basel.ch/en/basel/urban_development/2000_watt_society The Basel pilot region of the 2000 Watt Society]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111061314/http://www.basel.ch/en/basel/urban_development/2000_watt_society |date=11 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A building construction law was passed in 2002 also which stated that all new flat roofs must be greened leading to Basel becoming the world's leading green roof city. This was driven by an energy saving programme.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, J.G. 2011, &quot;Climate change adaptation in European cities&quot;, Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 193-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Enhanced geothermal systems|hot dry rock geothermal energy]] project was cancelled in 2009 since it caused [[induced seismicity in Basel]].

===Banking===
Banking is important to Basel:
* [[UBS AG]] maintains central offices in Basel,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://apps2.ubs.com/locationfinder/search.do?GeoEntityId=29&amp;GeoEntityType=6 UBS AG in Basel, Aeschenvorstadt 1]{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&quot; ([https://apps2.ubs.com/locationfinder/search.do?GeoEntityId=6592&amp;GeoEntityType=7&amp;EntityTypeId=0&amp;Type=pdf PDF version]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) [[UBS AG]]. Retrieved on 2 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bank for International Settlements]] is located within the city and is the central banker's bank. The bank is controlled by a [[board of directors]], which is composed of the elite central bankers of 11 different countries (US, UK, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden).
:According to the BIS, &quot;The choice of Switzerland for the seat of the BIS was a compromise by those countries that established the BIS: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. When consensus could not be reached on locating the Bank in London, Brussels or Amsterdam, the choice fell on Switzerland. An independent, neutral country, Switzerland offered the BIS less exposure to undue influence from any of the major powers. Within Switzerland, Basel was chosen largely because of its location, with excellent railway connections in all directions, especially important at a time when most international travel was by train.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/about/origins.htm|title=Origins|publisher=Bank for International Settlements|accessdate=23 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100609010907/http://www.bis.org/about/origins.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2010 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Created in May 1930, the BIS is owned by its member [[central bank]]s, which are private entities. No agent of the Swiss public authorities may enter the premises without the express consent of the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/about/headquart-en.pdf|title=Agreement between the Swiss Federal Council and the Bank for International Settlements to determine the Bank's legal status in Switzerland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank exercises supervision and police power over its premises. The bank enjoys immunity from criminal and administrative jurisdiction{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, as well as setting recommendations which become standard for the world's [[commercial bank]]ing system.
* Basel is also the location of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]], which is distinct from the BIS. It usually meets at the BIS premises in Basel. Responsible for the [[Basel Accord]]s ([[Basel I]], [[Basel II Accord|Basel II]] and [[Basel III]]), this organization fundamentally changed [[Risk management|Risk Management]] within its industry.
* Basel also hosts the headquarters of the [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]], which is active in the field of sustainable infrastructure (financing).

===Museums===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of museums]] --&gt;
[[File:Basel - 2017 - Kunstmuseum Basel - Altbau.jpg|thumb|The [[Kunstmuseum Basel]], oldest public museum of art in Europe]]
The [[Museums in Basel|Basel museums]] cover a broad and diverse spectrum of [[collection (museum)|collections]] with a marked concentration in the [[fine art]]s. They house numerous holdings of international significance. The over three dozen institutions yield an extraordinarily high density of museums compared to other cities of similar size and draw over one million visitors annually.&lt;ref name=Museums&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bs.ch/en/Portrait/Kultur/Museen.html |title=A lot to see in such a small city |publisher=Canton of Basel-Stadt |type=official site |website=Kanton Basel-Stadt |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constituting an essential component of Basel culture and cultural policy, the museums are the result of closely interwoven private and public collecting activities and promotion of arts and culture going back to the 16th century. The public museum collection was first created back in 1661 and represents the oldest public collection in continuous existence in Europa. Since the late 1980s, various private collections have been made accessible to the public in new purpose-built structures that have been recognized as acclaimed examples of [[avant-garde]] [[museum architecture]].

===Events===
The city of Basel is a centre for numerous fairs and events all year round. One of the most important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the [[Art Basel]] which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. [[Baselworld]], the watch and jewellery show (''Uhren- und Schmuckmesse'') one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. Live marketing company and fair organizer [[MCH Group]] has its head office in Basel.

[[File:Top Secret Drum Corps.jpg|thumb|[[Top Secret Drum Corps]] at the 2009 Basel Tattoo]]
The [[carnival]] of the city of Basel (''[[Carnival of Basel|Basler Fasnacht]]'') is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, despite the fact that it starts at exactly four o'clock in the morning (''Morgestraich'') on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after [[Ash Wednesday]] and continuing exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.

[[Basel Tattoo]], founded in 2006 by the local [[Top Secret Drum Corps]], has grown to be the world's second largest military tattoo in terms of performers and budget after the [[Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo|Edinburgh Military Tattoo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;swissinfo&quot;&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Basels_tattoo_spins_to_success.html?cid=995834 Basel's tattoo spins to success]. swissinfo.ch, written 2008-7-15, retrieved 2012-7-13&lt;/ref&gt; The Basel Tattoo annual parade, with an estimated 125,000 visitors, is considered the largest event in Basel. The event is now sponsored by the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport|Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS)]], making it the official [[military tattoo]] of Switzerland.

===Cuisine===
There are a number of culinary specialties originating in Basel, including ''[[Basler Läckerli]]'' cookies and ''[[Mässmogge]]'' candies. Being located in the meeting place between Switzerland, France and Germany the culinary landscape as a whole is very varied and diverse, making it a city with a great number of restaurants of all sorts.

===Zoo===
[[File:ZolliAntelopeHouse2.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Antelope]] House at [[Zoo Basel]]]]
''[[Zoo Basel]]'' is, with over 1.7 million visitors per year,&lt;ref name=&quot;2011 visitors&quot;&gt;[http://bazonline.ch/basel/stadt/Trotz-Grossbaustelle-Besucherrekord-beim-Zolli/story/10759447 {{in lang|de}} Besucherrekord beim Zolli].

[[20 Minuten|20min.ch]], published 23 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1874, Zoo Basel is the oldest zoo in Switzerland and, by number of animals, the largest. Through its history, Zoo Basel has had several breeding successes, such as the first worldwide [[Indian rhinoceros]] birth&lt;ref name=&quot;Panzernashornhaus&quot;&gt;[http://www.zoobasel.ch/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=37 {{in lang|de}} Eröffnung des Panzernashornhauses] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221003315/http://www.zoobasel.ch/aktuell/detail.php?NEWSID=37 |date=21 February 2014 }}.

These and other achievements led [[Forbes]] Travel to rank Zoo Basel as one of the fifteen best zoos in the world in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;[http://www.getlisty.com/preview/worlds-best-zoos/ Forbes Travel]. GetListy, retrieved 26 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its international fame, Basel's population remains attached to Zoo Basel, which is entirely surrounded by the city of Basel. Evidence of this is the millions of donations money each year, as well as Zoo Basel's unofficial name: locals lovingly call &quot;their&quot; zoo &quot;''Zolli''&quot; by which is it known throughout Basel and most of Switzerland.

===Sport===
Basel has a reputation in Switzerland as a successful sporting city. The [[association football|football]] club [[FC Basel]] continues to be successful and in recognition of this the city was one of the Swiss venues for the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 European Championships]], as well as [[Geneva]], [[Zürich]] and [[Bern]]. The championships were jointly hosted by [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. [[BSC Old Boys]] and [[Concordia Basel]] are the other football teams in Basel.

[[File:R federer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Roger Federer]] at the 2010 Australian Open]]
Among the most popular sports in Switzerland is [[ice hockey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info/|title= Popular sports in Switzerland | publisher=popular-swiss-sports.all-about-switzerland.info | accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basel is home to the [[EHC Basel]] which plays in the [[1. Liga (ice hockey)|MySports League]], the third tier of the Swiss ice hockey league system. They play their home games in the 6,700-seat [[St. Jakob Arena]]. The team previously played in the [[National League (ice hockey)|National League]] and the [[Swiss League]], but they had to fill a bankruptcy case after the [[2013-14 National League B season|2013-14 Swiss League season]].

Basel features a large [[St. Jakob-Park|football stadium]] that has been awarded four stars by [[UEFA]], a modern ice hockey hall, and an admitted sports hall.

A large indoor tennis event takes place in Basel every October. Some of the best [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]]-professionals play every year at the [[Davidoff Swiss Indoors|Swiss Indoors]], including Switzerland's biggest sporting hero and frequent participant [[Roger Federer]], a Basel native who describes the city as &quot;one of the most beautiful cities in the world&quot;.

The annual [[Basel Rhine Swim]] draws several thousand visitors to the city to swim in or float on the Rhine river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swimming in the Rhine in Basel|url=http://www.lifeinbasel.com/2014/06/09/swimming-in-the-rhine-in-basel/|publisher=Life in Basel|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While football and ice hockey are by far the most popular sports, basketball has a very small but faithful fan base. The top division, called [[Swiss Basketball League|SBL]], is a semi-professional league and has one team from the Basel region, the &quot;Birstal Starwings&quot;.
Two players from Switzerland are currently active in the NBA, Thabo Sefolosha and Clint Capela. 
As in most European countries, and contrary to the U.S., Switzerland has a club-based rather than a school-based competition system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unibaselbasket.ch/english.html|title=English|website=Uni Basel Basket - Der Basketball Verein aus Basel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Starwings Basel]] are the only first division basketball team in [[German-speaking Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indoorsports.ch/de/alle/detail-alle-sportarten/news/detail/News/starwings-die-exoten-aus-basel/ Starwings - die Exoten aus Basel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924162534/http://www.indoorsports.ch/de/alle/detail-alle-sportarten/news/detail/News/starwings-die-exoten-aus-basel/ |date=24 September 2016 }}, indoorsports.ch {{in lang|de}}, accessed 5 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
