'''Charles William Mumy Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|uː|m|i}}; born February 1, 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Miller| first=John Jackson| authorlink=John Jackson Miller| url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays| title=Comics Industry Birthdays| work=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]| date=June 10, 2005| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218031356/http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays| archivedate=February 18, 2011| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American actor and musician and a figure in the science-fiction community/comic book fandom. He came to prominence in the 1960s as a child actor, when he was credited as '''Billy Mumy'''{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}—an era which included his appearing on television in ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and on film in ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'', followed by an iconic three-season role as Will Robinson in the 1960s [[CBS]] sci-fi series ''[[Lost in Space]]''.

He later appeared as lonely teenager [[Sterling North]] in the Disney film ''[[Rascal (film)|Rascal]]'' (1969) and Teft in the film ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]'' (1971).

In the 1990s, he performed the role of [[Lennier]] in all five seasons of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] sci-fi TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and narrated [[A&amp;E Network]]'s [[Emmy Award]]-winning series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. 

Mumy is also known for his musical career as a guitarist, singer, songwriter and composer: he is an Emmy nominee for original music in ''[[Adventures in Wonderland]]'' (1991). As a musician Mumy performs as a solo artist, an occasional guest performer, and as half of the duo [[Barnes &amp; Barnes]]. From 1988 through the 90s he performed at the [[San Diego Comic-Con]] and other comics related events as part of the band Seduction of the Innocent (named after the [[Seduction of the Innocent|book]] by [[Fredric Wertham]]) along with [[Miguel Ferrer]], [[Steve Leialoha]], [[Max Allan Collins]] and John &quot;Chris&quot; Christensen. The band released one CD, The Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxallancollins.com/blog/2010/04/20/still-offensive-after-all-these-years/ Still Offensive After All These Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Mumy was born in [[San Gabriel, California]] to Charles William Mumy, a cattle rancher, and Muriel Gertrude Mumy (née Gould).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bill Mumy profile| url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/10/Bill-Mumy.html| publisher=[[Film Reference Library]]| accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his professional career at age six, and has worked on more than four hundred television episodes, eighteen films, various commercials, and scores of voice-over projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMovie bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last1=Erickson| first1=Hal| title=Bill Mumy: Biography| url=http://www.allmovie.com/artist/bill-mumy-p51302| publisher=[[AllMovie]]| accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked as a musician, songwriter, recording artist, and writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last1=Ankeny| first1=Jason| title=Bill Mumy: Biography| url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-mumy-mn0000071570/biography| website=[[AllMusic]]| accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and film career==
Among Mumy's earliest television roles was six-year-old Willy in the &quot;Donald's Friend&quot; (1960) episode of the [[NBC]]-TV family drama [[television series|series]] ''[[National Velvet (TV series)|National Velvet]]'', starring [[Lori Martin]]. He starred in three episodes of [[CBS]]-TV's [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|original ''Twilight Zone'']]: &quot;[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]&quot; (November 1961), as a child who terrorizes his town with [[psychic]] powers (a role he later reprised along with his daughter [[Liliana Mumy|Liliana]] in the ''[[It's Still a Good Life]]'' episode of [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|the second revival series]]); &quot;[[In Praise of Pip]]&quot; (September 1963), as a vision of [[Jack Klugman]]'s long-neglected dying son; and &quot;[[Long Distance Call]]&quot; (March 1961) as Billy Bayles, who talks to his dead grandmother through a toy telephone.

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Presents Billy Mumy 1961.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Mumy in the ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' episode ''Bang! You're Dead'', 1961]]
In 1961, Billy was cast on CBS-TV's ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' series in &quot;The Door Without a Key&quot;, featuring [[John Larch]], who played his father in &quot;It's a Good Life&quot;. The same year, Mumy starred as little Jackie in the episode &quot;Bang! You're Dead&quot;, featuring [[Marta Kristen]], who later played his sister Judy on ''Lost in Space''. Mumy was cast as Mark Murdock in the &quot;Keep an Eye on Santa Claus&quot; (1962) episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] drama series ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'', starring [[Gene Kelly]]. His fellow guest stars were [[Cloris Leachman]] (who played his mother in &quot;It's a Good Life&quot;), [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]], and [[Frank McHugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0937698| title=&quot;Keep an Eye on Santa Claus&quot;, ''Going My Way'', December 12, 1962| publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]| accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At age eight, Mumy appeared in [[Jack Palance]]'s ABC-TV [[circus]] drama ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1963); he was cast as Miles, a parentless boy, in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode &quot;The Case of the Shifty Shoebox&quot; (1963); and he portrayed Freddy in the &quot;End of an Image&quot; (1963) episode of NBC-TV's modern Western series ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]]'', starring [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]].

In 1964, he was cast as [[Richard Kimble]]'s nephew in ABC-TV's ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' episode, &quot;Home Is the Hunted&quot;; as Barry in the [[NBC]]-TV medical drama ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' episode &quot;Sunday Father&quot;; as himself three times in the ABC sitcom ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''; in the [[Walt Disney|Disney]] film ''For the Love of Willadena''; and as a troubled orphan taken in by the Stephenses in the ''[[Bewitched]]'' fantasy sitcom episode &quot;[[List of Bewitched episodes#Season 1 (1964-1965)|A Vision of Sugarplums]]&quot; (December 1964), on ABC-TV.

Mumy was reportedly the first choice to portray [[Eddie Munster]] in the 1964 CBS situation comedy ''[[The Munsters]]'', but his parents objected to the extensive makeup requirements. The role instead went to [[Butch Patrick]]. Mumy appeared in one episode as a friend of Eddie's.

Mumy guest starred in an episode of NBC-TV's ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', &quot;Whatever Became of Baby Custer?&quot; (1965). That same year, he also appeared in an episode of ''[[Bewitched]]'' entitled &quot;Junior Executive&quot; (1965), in which he played a young Darrin Stevens.

[[File:Brigitte_Bardot_-_1965.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Billy Mumy with [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'', 1965.]]
Mumy starred in ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965), a film adaptation of the novel ''Erasmus with Freckles'', as Erasmus Leaf, a child mathematical genius who develops a crush on [[Brigitte Bardot]] (played by herself in the film). His parents, played by [[James Stewart]] and [[Glynis Johns]], attempt to manage his obsession.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dear Brigitte&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last1=Mark Deming| first1=Mark| title=Dear Brigitte (1965)| url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/dear-brigitte-v12846| publisher=AllMovie| accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lost in Space'' and beyond===

While noted for several roles as both a child and adult actor, Mumy is perhaps best known for his iconic television role the 60s science fiction series. From 1965 to 1968, Mumy portrayed Will Robinson in ''[[Lost in Space]]'', who was the recipient of numerous warnings, (most famously &quot;Danger, Will Robinson&quot;) from the show's [[Robot B-9|robot character]], voiced by [[Dick Tufeld]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Danger Will Robinson&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last1=Noland| first1=Claire| title=Dick Tufeld dies at 85; actor who intoned 'Danger, Will Robinson!'| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/25/local/la-me-dick-tufeld-20120125| accessdate=January 11, 2015| work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]| date=January 25, 2012| quote=Besides warning young Will Robinson of impending danger, Tufeld's Robot uttered other lines that became catchphrases for faithful viewers — including &quot;That does not compute&quot; — and needled the antagonistic Dr. Zachary Smith with barbs like &quot;Dr. Smith is a bubble-headed booby.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumy was later cast in ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]'' (1971) as Teft, a leader in a group of misfit teenage boys resolved to save a herd of bison from hunters. He also played a musician friend of [[Cliff DeYoung]]'s character in the TV movie ''[[Sunshine (1973 film)|Sunshine]]'' (1973), and later reprised the role in ''[[Sunshine Christmas]]'' and in the TV series ''[[Sunshine (American TV series)|Sunshine]]''. In 1974, he played Nick Butler in the pilot episode of NBC's ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' and also made an appearance in a later episode in season 1, as a sidewalk artist. In 1988, he played Ben Matlock's genius nephew, Dr. Irwin Bruckner, on Matlock.

In 1996, Mumy was a writer and co-creator of ''[[Space Cases]]'', a [[Nickelodeon]] television show with themes similar to those of ''Lost in Space''.  Between 1994–1998 he played the ambassadorial aide [[Lennier]] in the syndicated science fiction series ''[[Babylon 5]]''. In November 1998, he played Kellin, a [[Starfleet]] officer, in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode &quot;[[The Siege of AR-558 (DS9 episode)|The Siege of AR-558]]&quot;, in which he assists in defeating a [[Jem'Hadar]] detachment. To Mumy's delight,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Mumy|first=Bill|interviewer=Amy Harrington|title=The Interviews: An Oral History of Television|work=The Television Academy Foundation’s The Interviews|publisher=[[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]]|location=North Hollywood|date=September 3, 2013|quote=YouTube title:Bill Mumy discusses appearing on 'Star Trek Deep Space Nine'}}&lt;/ref&gt; his character was human this time; while playing [[Lennier]] in Babylon 5, he was required to wear prosthetic makeup. He was more recently seen in a 2006 episode of ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'' and in the [[Sci Fi]] original film ''[[A.I. Assault]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes bio&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last1=Erickson| first1=Hal| title=Biography: Bill Mumy| url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/51302/Bill-Mumy/biography| accessdate=January 11, 2015| work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Mumy appeared in the pilot episode of the [[Netflix]] remake series, ''[[Lost in Space (2018 TV series)|Lost in Space]]''. His character's name is Dr. Z. Smith, in homage to the character played by [[Jonathan Harris]] in the 1965 television series.

==Voice acting career==
Mumy has narrated over 50 episodes of the [[A&amp;E Network|Arts &amp; Entertainment Channel]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' series, as well as hosted and narrated several other documentaries and specials for A &amp; E, [[Animal Planet]] network, [[Syfy|The Sci-Fi Channel]], and [[E!]]. His voice acting talents can be heard on animated shows like ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''Little Wizard Adventures'', ''[[The Oz Kids]]'' and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' and ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''. He has done voice over work in national commercials for such businesses as [[Bud Ice]], [[Farmers Insurance Group|Farmers Insurance]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Blockbuster (movie rental store)|Blockbuster]], [[Twix]], [[Oscar Mayer]] and [[McDonald's]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Mumy has released a number of solo CDs, including ''Dying to Be Heard'', ''In the Current'', ''Pandora's Box'', ''After Dreams Come True'', ''Los Angeles Times'' and ''Ghosts'', as well as nine albums with music partner [[Robert Haimer]] as [[Barnes and Barnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last1=Lapka| first1=Larry| title=Barnes &amp; Barnes: Biography| url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/barnes-barnes-mn0000784261/biography| website=AllMusic| accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their most famous hit is the song &quot;[[Fish Heads (song)|Fish Heads]]&quot;, which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named one of the top 100 videos of all time.

Mumy produces and hosts ''The Real Good Radio Hour'', a weekly series on KSAV Internet Radio focusing on various styles of music and the artists who pioneered them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

==''Lost in Space'' activities in later years==
In 1996, Mumy and his ''Lost in Space'' costar [[Jonathan Harris]] were reunited at a [[Walt Disney]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Mumy worked again with Harris on the retrospective special ''Lost In Space: Forever'' (1998), where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (Harris rewrote his own lines). This occurred the year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy and Harris) stated in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' article that the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] planned to do a ''Lost in Space'' marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, ''Lost in Space: The Journey Home'', but died before production was scheduled to start, in 2002, and it was subsequently cancelled. Mumy read the eulogy at Harris' funeral and was asked to narrate an account of his longtime friend's life on [[A&amp;E Biography|A&amp;E ''Biography'']] that year.

In a 2010 interview on ''Blog Talk Radio'''s ''Lessons Learned'', Rick Tocquigny was asked if Mumy was a Jonathan Harris fan before they appeared together on ''Lost in Space''. Tocquigny said that at age five, Mumy was too young to watch his mentor's show ''[[The Third Man (TV series)|The Third Man]]'', which would have been aired late at night, but he was old enough to see ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifelessonsnetwork/2010/09/22/bill-mumy-of-lost-in-space-fame-shares-his-life-lessons| title=Bill Mumy of Lost in Space fame shares his life lessons| publisher=[[BlogTalkRadio]]| date=September 22, 2010| accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2006, Mumy got to work with Harris one last time, though posthumously. Years before Harris died, he recorded voice work for the animated short ''[[The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas]],'' narrating the film and playing the part of The Bolt. As a tribute to Harris, writer-director [[John Wardlaw]] added a scene that reunited ''Lost in Space'' cast members Mumy, [[Marta Kristen]], and [[Angela Cartwright]] as the animated Ratchett family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas Director Talks Crude Humor and Working with the Late Jonathan Harris| url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2011/07/the_bolt_who_screwed_christmas.php| work=[[Miami New Times]]| date=July 1, 2011| last=Herrera| first=Margaux| accessdate=2017-08-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, 11 years after Harris' death in November 2002, Mumy commented on his connection with his friend and acting mentor offscreen and their onscreen connection while working in character as Will Robinson and Dr. Smith onscreen, in ''Lost in Space''. Mumy noted: &quot;I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It's just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do—and I think this is a very big reason [for] the way it went—they’d get us done in a couple of takes. Nobody screwed up. It was easier for the crew and it was easier for us, and people seemed to like it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=&quot;Danger!
