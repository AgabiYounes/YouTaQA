'''Bipolar I disorder''' (BD-I; pronounced &quot;type one bipolar disorder&quot;) is a type of [[bipolar spectrum disorder]] characterized by the occurrence of at least one [[manic episode]], with or without mixed or psychotic features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/the-two-types-of-bipolar-disorder/000612|title=The Two Types of Bipolar Disorder|work=Psych Central.com|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people also, at other times, have one or more [[depression (mood)|depressive]] episodes, and all experience a [[Hypomania|hypomanic]] stage before progressing to full mania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bipolar Disorder: Who’s at Risk?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bipolar Disorder: Who's at Risk?|url=http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/bipolar-disorder-whos-at-risk|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a type of [[bipolar disorder]], and conforms to the classic concept of manic-depressive illness, which can include [[psychosis]] during mood episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;What are the types of bipolar disorder?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the types of bipolar disorder? |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/bipolar_disorder/page2.htm#types |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The essential feature of bipolar I disorder is a clinical course characterized by the occurrence of one or more manic episodes or mixed episodes (DSM-IV-TR, 2000). Often, individuals have had one or more [[major depressive episode]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;DepressionD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depressiond.org/bipolar-test/|title=Online Bipolar Tests: How Much Can You Trust Them?|publisher=DepressionD|accessdate=7 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One episode of mania is sufficient to make the diagnosis of bipolar disorder; the person may or may not have a history of [[major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DepressionD&quot;/&gt; Episodes of substance-induced mood disorder due to the direct effects of a [[medication]], or other [[somatic psychology|somatic]] treatments for depression, [[drug abuse]], or [[toxin]] exposure, or of mood disorder due to a general medical condition need to be excluded before a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder can be made. Bipolar I disorder requires confirmation of only 1 full manic episode for diagnosis, but may be associated with hypomanic and depressive episodes as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5.|others=American Psychiatric Association., American Psychiatric Association. DSM-5 Task Force.|isbn=978-0-89042-559-6|edition=Fifth|location=Arlington, VA|oclc=847226928|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis for bipolar II disorder does not include a full manic episode; instead, it requires the occurrence of both a hypomanic episode and a major depressive episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Bipolar I disorder (and bipolar II disorder) is often comorbid with other disorders including [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], substance use disorders and a variety of mood disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerimele|first=Joseph M.|last2=Bauer|first2=Amy M.|last3=Fortney|first3=John C.|last4=Bauer|first4=Mark S.|date=May 2017|title=Patients With Co-Occurring Bipolar Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Rapid Review of the Literature|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=78|issue=5|pages=e506–e514|doi=10.4088/JCP.16r10897|issn=1555-2101|pmid=28570791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Glenn E.|last2=Malhi|first2=Gin S.|last3=Cleary|first3=Michelle|last4=Lai|first4=Harry Man Xiong|last5=Sitharthan|first5=Thiagarajan|date=December 2016|title=Prevalence of comorbid bipolar and substance use disorders in clinical settings, 1990-2015: Systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|volume=206|pages=331–349|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2016.07.011|issn=1573-2517|pmid=27476137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 40% of people with bipolar disorder also present with PTSD, with higher rates occurring in women and individuals with bipolar I disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; In addition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by [[schizoaffective disorder]] or superimposed on [[schizophrenia]], [[schizophreniform disorder]], [[delusional disorder]], or a [[psychotic disorder]] not otherwise specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pchtreatment.com/bipolar-treatment-center/|title=Bipolar Disorder Residential Treatment Center Los Angeles|work=PCH Treatment|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Medical assessment===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
Regular medical assessments are performed to rule-out secondary causes of mania and depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; These tests include [[complete blood count]], [[Glucose test|glucose]], serum chemistry/electrolyte panel, [[Thyroid function tests|thyroid function test]], [[Liver function tests|liver function test]], [[Renal function|renal function test]], [[Clinical urine tests|urinalysis]], [[vitamin B12]] and [[folate]] levels, [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV screening]], [[Syphilis serodiagnosis|syphilis screening]], and [[pregnancy test]], and when clinically indicated, an [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]] (ECG), an [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG), a [[CT scan|computed tomography]] (CT scan), and/or a [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance imagining]] (MRI) may be ordered.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobo|first=William V.|date=October 2017|title=The Diagnosis and Management of Bipolar I and II Disorders: Clinical Practice Update|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|volume=92|issue=10|pages=1532–1551|doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.06.022|pmid=28888714|issn=0025-6196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug screening includes [[recreational drug]]s, particularly [[synthetic cannabinoid]]s, and exposure to toxins.

===DSM-5===
{{update|section|date=November 2015}}
The fifth edition of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] ([[DSM-5]]) was released in May 2013. There are several proposed revisions to occur in the diagnostic criteria of Bipolar I Disorder and its subtypes. For Bipolar I Disorder 296.40 (most recent episode hypomanic) and 296.4x (most recent episode manic), the proposed revision includes the following specifiers: with [[Psychosis|psychotic]] features, with [[Mixed affective state|mixed]] features, with [[Catatonia|catatonic]] features, with rapid cycling, with [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]] (mild to severe), with [[Suicide risk assessment|suicide risk severity]], with [[Seasonal affective disorder|seasonal pattern]], and with [[Postpartum period|postpartum]] onset.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=American Psychiatric Association|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bipolar I Disorder 296.5x (most recent episode depressed) will include all of the above specifiers plus the following: with [[Melancholia|melancholic]] features and with atypical features.&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt; The categories for specifiers will be removed in DSM-5 and criterion A will add or there are at least 3 symptoms of major [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] of which one of the symptoms is [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] mood or [[anhedonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt; For Bipolar I Disorder 296.7 (most recent episode unspecified), the listed specifiers will be removed.''&lt;ref name=&quot;:03&quot; /&gt;''

The criteria for manic and hypomanic episodes in criteria A &amp; B will be edited. Criterion A will include “and present most of the day, nearly every day,” and criterion B will include “and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior.” These criteria as defined in the DSM-IV-TR have created confusion for clinicians and need to be more clearly defined.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Issues pertinent to a developmental approach to bipolar disorder in DSM-5|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. text revision)|year=2000|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, DC|pages=345–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been proposed revisions to criterion B of the diagnostic criteria for a Hypomanic Episode, which is used to diagnose For Bipolar I Disorder 296.40, Most Recent Episode Hypomanic. Criterion B lists &quot;inflated self-esteem, flight of ideas, distractibility, and decreased need for sleep&quot; as symptoms of a Hypomanic Episode. This has been confusing in the field of child psychiatry because these symptoms closely overlap with symptoms of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Note that many of the above changes are still under active consideration and are not definite. For more information regarding proposed revisions to the DSM-5, please visit their website at [https://web.archive.org/web/20081119150242/http://www.dsm5.org/ dsm5.org].

[[Antidepressant]]-induced mania occurs in 20–40% of people with bipolar disorder. Mood stabilizers, especially lithium, may protect against this effect, but some research contradicts this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldberg|first=Joseph F|last2=Truman|first2=Christine J|date=2003-12-01|title=Antidepressant-induced mania: an overview of current controversies|journal=Bipolar Disorders|volume=5|issue=6|pages=407–420|doi=10.1046/j.1399-5618.2003.00067.x|pmid=14636364|issn=1399-5618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Psychosocial interventions can be used for managing acute depressive episodes and for maintenance treatment to aid in relapse prevention.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; This includes [[Psychoeducation|psycho education]], [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy]] (CBT), family-focused therapy (FFT), [[Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy|interpersonal and social-rhythm therapy]] (IPSRT), and [[peer support]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yatham|first=Lakshmi N.|last2=Kennedy|first2=Sidney H.|last3=Parikh|first3=Sagar V.|last4=Schaffer|first4=Ayal|last5=Bond|first5=David J.|last6=Frey|first6=Benicio N.|last7=Sharma|first7=Verinder|last8=Goldstein|first8=Benjamin I.|last9=Rej|first9=Soham|last10=Beaulieu|first10=Serge|last11=Alda|first11=Martin|date=2018|title=Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder|journal=Bipolar Disorders|volume=20|issue=2|pages=97–170|doi=10.1111/bdi.12609|issn=1399-5618|pmc=5947163|pmid=29536616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information on the condition, importance of regular [[sleep]] patterns, routines and eating habits and the importance of [[medication compliance|compliance with medication]] as [[medical prescription|prescribed]]. [[Behavior modification]] through [[mental health counselor|counseling]] can have positive influence to help reduce the effects of risky behavior during the manic phase. Additionally, the lifetime prevalence for bipolar I disorder is estimated to be 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merikangas|first=Kathleen R.|last2=Akiskal|first2=Hagop S.|last3=Angst|first3=Jules|last4=Greenberg|first4=Paul E.|last5=Hirschfeld|first5=Robert M.A.|last6=Petukhova|first6=Maria|last7=Kessler|first7=Ronald C.|date=1 May 2007 |title=Lifetime and 12-Month Prevalence of Bipolar Spectrum Disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|volume=64|issue=5|pages=543–552|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.64.5.543|issn=0003-990X|pmc=1931566|pmid=17485606}}&lt;/ref&gt;
