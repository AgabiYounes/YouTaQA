Although there is no definite proof of the date of Khmelnytsky's birth, Ukrainian historian [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]] suggests that it is likely 27 December 1595 ([[St. Theodore (died 820)|St. Theodore]]'s&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Житие и страдание святого преподобномученика и исповедника Феодора и брата его преподобного Феофана1 начертанных&quot; [https://web.archive.org/web/20071219202936/http://www.pravoslavie.uz/Jitiya/12/27FeodorNachertanniy.htm pravoslavie.uz] and [http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=736 catholic.org]&lt;/ref&gt; day). As was the custom in the [[Orthodox Church]], he was baptized with one of his middle names, Theodor, translated into Ukrainian as Bohdan. A biography of Khmelnytsky by Smoliy and Stepankov, however, suggests that it is more likely he was born on 9 November (feast day of St Zenoby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monar.ru/index.php?download/saints/Oct/30/life01.html|script-title=ru:Страдание святого священномученика Зиновия епископа Эгейского, и сестры его Зиновии|trans-title=The suffering of the Holy Martyr St. Zinovy the Bishop of the Aegean, and his sister Zenova|language=ru|publisher=monar.ru|accessdate=10 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406134427/http://monar.ru/index.php?download%2Fsaints%2FOct%2F30%2Flife01.html|archivedate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30 October in [[Julian calendar]]) and was baptized on 11 November (feast day of [[St. Theodore (died 820)|St. Theodore]] in the Catholic Church).&lt;ref&gt;Смолій В.А., Степанков В.С. &quot;Богдан Хмельницький&quot;, Альтернативи, {{ISBN|966-7217-76-0}}, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Khmelnytsky was probably born in the village of [[Subotiv]], near [[Chyhyryn]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] at the estate of his father [[Mykhailo Khmelnytsky]].&lt;ref&gt;While Subotiv or Chyhyryn are most commonly identified as alternative places for his birth, historian [[Stanisław Barącz]] believes that he was born in [[Zhovkva]] (''Żółkiew'').&lt;/ref&gt; He was born into the Ukrainian lesser nobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohdan Khmelnytsky Article&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CK%5CH%5CKhmelnytskyBohdan.htm|title=Bohdan Khmelnytsky Article|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a [[courtier]] of [[Great Crown Hetman]] [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]], was of noble birth and belonged to the [[Clan]] [[Massalski coat of arms|Massalski]], [[Abdank coat of arms|Abdank]] or [[Syrokomla coat of arms|Syrokomla]], but there has been controversy as to whether Bohdan belonged to the szlachta (Polish term for noblemen).&lt;ref&gt;Whether Khmelnytsky was or was not a noble is still uncertain. He claimed nobility when it suited him, and it was not often disputed by his contemporaries. Khmelnytsky/Chmielnicki once wrote in a letter to King [[Jan Kazimierz]] that he was &quot;born Chmielnicki;&quot; however, that surname was never associated with the [[Abdank coat of arms]] hesed. His father, a noble, was married to a [[Cossack]] woman and, according to the [[Polish Statute of 1505]], his mother's status might have prevented Bohdan from being considered a nobleman. Other historians' theories suggest that his father or grandfather was stripped of noble status. Most controversially, 19th-century Polish historian [[Tomasz Padura]] claimed (without giving sources) that Khmelnytsky's father was a Jewish convert to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] (and therefore not of the nobility).&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources state that in 1590 his father Mykhailo was appointed as a [[sotnyk]] for the Korsun-Chyhyryn starosta [[Jan Mikołaj Daniłowicz|Jan Daniłowicz]], who continued to colonize the new Ukrainian lands near the [[Dnieper]] river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohdan Khmelnytsky&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727000659/http://kraevid.org/lviv/history/personalities/hetmans/bohdan_khmelnytsky/ru/ Bohdan Khmelnytsky] {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the above-mentioned-source, Mykhailo established [[Chyhyryn]] and later his own family estates of Subotiv (5 miles from Chyhyryn) and [[Novoseltsi]]. Khmelnytsky identified as a noble, and his father's status as a deputy [[Starosta]] ([[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]) of Chyhyryn helped him to be considered as such by others. During the Uprising, however, Khmelnytsky would stress his mother's Cossack roots and his father's exploits with the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Cossacks of the Sich]].

Khmelnytsky's early education cannot be documented, however it is speculated that he received his elementary education in Ukrainian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohdan Khmelnytsky Article&quot;/&gt; Several historians believe he received his elementary schooling from a church clerk until he was sent to one of [[Kiev]]'s Orthodox fraternity schools. He continued his education in Polish at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college, possibly in [[Jarosław]], but more likely in [[Lviv]] in the school founded by hetman Żółkiewski. He completed his schooling by 1617, acquiring a broad knowledge of world history and learning Polish and Latin. Later he learned Turkish, [[Crimean Tatar language|Tatar]], and French. Unlike many of the other Jesuit students, he did not embrace Roman Catholicism but remained [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]].

===Marriage and family===
Bohdan Khmelnytsky married Hanna Somkivna, a daughter of a rich [[Principality of Pereslavl|Pereyaslavl]] Cossack; the couple settled in [[Subotiv]]. By the second half of the 1620s, they had three daughters: Stepanyda, Olena, and Kateryna. His first son [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Tymish (Tymofiy)]] was born in 1632, and another son [[Yuriy Khmelnytsky|Yuriy]] was born in 1640.

==Service with Cossacks==
{{Cossacks}}
Upon completion of his studies in 1617, Khmelnytsky entered into service with the Cossacks. As early as 1619, he was sent together with his father to [[Moldavia]], when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth entered into war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. His first military engagement was a tragic one. During the [[Battle of Cecora (1620)|battle of Cecora]] (Țuțora) on 17 September 1620, his father was killed, and young Khmelnytsky, among many others including future hetman [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]], was captured by the Turks. He spent the next two years in captivity in [[Constantinople]] as a prisoner of an [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] [[Kapudan Pasha]] (presumably [[Parlak Mustafa Pasha]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;SS51&quot;&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. ''Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret.'' page 51. Lebid. Kiev. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources claim that he spent his slavery in [[Ottoman Navy]] on [[galley]]s as an [[oarsman]], where he picked up a knowledge of [[Turkic languages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bohdan Khmelnytsky&quot;/&gt;

While there is no concrete evidence as to his return to Ukraine, most historians believe Khmelnytsky either escaped or was ransomed. Sources vary as to his benefactor – his mother, friends, the Polish king – but perhaps by [[Krzysztof Zbaraski]], ambassador of the Commonwealth to the [[Ottomans]]. In 1622 he paid 30,000 [[thaler]]s in ransom for all [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] captured at the Battle of Cecora. Upon return to Subotiv, Khmelnytsky took over operating his father's estate and became a [[Registered Cossacks|registered Cossack]] in the [[Chyhyryn Regiment]]. He was later promoted to [[pysar]] (a historical officer title among Cossacks). From 1625, he participated in several sea raids on [[Constantinople]] together with [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]]. In those raids he earned his title of [[sotnyk]] (a leader of a hundred).

During this period his widowed mother remarried, to [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] noble Vasyl Stavetsky, and moved to his estate, leaving Khmelnytsky in charge of Subotiv. Within year she gave birth to another son, Hryhoriy; later he took his mother's name, becoming known as Hryhoriy Khmelnytsky. For a short time, the senior Khmelnytsky served as a [[koniuszy]] to hetman [[Mikołaj Potocki]] but departed relatively quickly after a personal conflict.

Khmelnytsky ran his estate and advanced in rank in his regiment. He first became a [[sotnyk]] and later advanced to the rank of a regiment scribe. He had significant negotiation skills and commanded respect of his fellow Cossacks. On 30 August 1637, he was included in a delegation to [[Warsaw]] to plead the Cossacks' case before the Polish King [[Władysław IV]]. Serving in the army of a Polish magnate and respected commander, hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, he participated in a successful campaign when the Commonwealth army (and his regiment) scored a decisive victory over the [[Crimean Khanate]] in 1644. According to archival documents, he also had a meeting in Warsaw with the French ambassador Count De Bregie, during which he discussed the possibility of Cossack participation in war in France. Sources vary as to whether in April 1645 he travelled to France (to [[Fontainebleau]]) to discuss further details of Cossack service in France; this claim is supported by Ukrainian historiography but disputed by Polish scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS70&quot;&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. ''Sotsialno-politychnyi portret''. page 70, Lebid, Kiev. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1644 around 2,000 (two thousand) Polish infantry soldiers (some scholars think they were Cossacks, but the French sources do not identify them as such) went to France by sea via [[Gdańsk]] and [[Calais]], where they participated in the siege and capture of [[Dunkirk]].&lt;!-- On whose behalf? --&gt;

==Czapliński Affair==
Upon the death of magnate [[Stanisław Koniecpolski]], an advocate of fair treatment of [[Cossacks]], his successor, [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620–1659)|Aleksander]], redrew the maps of his possessions. He laid claim to Khmelnytsky's estate, claiming it as his. Trying to find protection from this grab by the powerful magnate, Khmelnytsky wrote numerous appeals and letters to different representatives of the Polish crown but to no avail. At the end of 1645 the Chyhyryn [[starosta]] [[Daniel Czapliński]] officially received authority from Koniecpolski to seize Khmelnytsky's Subotiv estate.

Khmelnytsky obtained ready-made garments from the East.&lt;ref name=Biedronska&gt;{{cite book|last=Biedrońska-Słotowa|first=Beata|title=Polski ubiór narodowy zwany kontuszowym: dzieje i przemiany opracowane na podstawie zachowanych ubiorów zabytkowych i ich części oraz w świetle źródeł ikonograficznych i literackich|language=pl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RWCAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA76|year=2005|publisher=Muzeum Narodowe w Krakowie|isbn=978-83-89424-28-0|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1651 message, Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] sent to him &quot;a [[samite]] [[Kaftan|caftan]], one of his honorable royal caftans.&quot;&lt;ref name=Biedronska/&gt;]]

In the summer of 1646, Khmelnytsky arranged an audience with King Władysław IV to plead his case, as he had favourable standing at the court. Władysław, who wanted Cossacks on his side in the wars he planned, gave Khmelnytsky a royal charter, protecting his rights to the Subotiv estate. But, because of the structure of the Commonwealth at that time and the lawlessness of Ukraine, even the King was not able to prevent a confrontation with local magnates. In the beginning of 1647, Daniel Czapliński started to harass Khmelnytsky in order to force him off the land. On two occasions the magnate had Subotiv raided: considerable property damage was done and Khmelnytsky's son Yuriy was badly beaten. Finally, in April 1647, Czapliński succeeded in evicting Khmelnytsky from the land, and he was forced to move with his large family to a relative's house in Chyhyryn.

In May 1647, Khmelnytsky arranged a second audience with the king to plead his case but found him unwilling to confront a powerful magnate. In addition to losing the estate, Khmelnytsky suffered the loss of his wife Hanna, and he was left alone with their children. He promptly remarried, to Motrona ([[Helena Czaplińska]]), the so-called &quot;[[Helen of Troy|Helen]] of the steppe&quot;. He was less successful in real estate, and was unable to regain the land and property of his estate or financial compensation for it. During this time, he met several higher Polish officials to discuss the Cossacks' war with the Tatars, and used this occasion again to plead his case with Czapliński, still unsuccessfully.

While Khmelnytsky found no support from the Polish officials, he found it in his Cossack friends and subordinates. His Chyhyryn regiment and others were on his side. All through the autumn of 1647 Khmelnytsky travelled from one regiment to another, and had numerous consultations with Cossack leaders throughout Ukraine. His activity raised suspicion among the local Polish authorities already used to Cossack revolts; he was promptly arrested. Koniecpolski issued an order for his execution, but the Chyhyryn Cossack [[polkovnyk]], who held Khmelnytsky, was persuaded to release him. Not willing to tempt fate any further, Khmelnytsky headed for the [[Zaporozhian Sich]] with a group of his supporters.

==Uprising==
{{Main|Khmelnytsky Uprising}}

While the Czapliński Affair is generally regarded as the immediate cause of the uprising, it was primarily a catalyst for actions representing rising popular discontent.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://andrikyrychok.wordpress.com/tag/chyhyryn-starosta-daniel-czaplinski/|title=Chyhyryn starosta Daniel Czapliński {{!}} Looking Through The Lens|language=English|access-date=19 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion, ethnicity, and economics factored into this discontent. While the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] remained [[Union of Lublin|a union]] of nations, a sizable population of Orthodox [[Ruthenians]] were ignored. Oppressed by the Polish magnates, they took their wrath out on Poles, as well as the Jews, who often managed the estates of Polish nobles. The advent of the [[Counter-Reformation]] worsened relations between the Orthodox and Catholic Churches. Many Orthodox Ukrainians considered the [[Union of Brest]] as a threat to their Orthodox faith.

==Initial successes==
At the end of 1647 Khmelnytsky reached the [[estuary]] of the [[Dnieper]] river. On 7 December, his small detachment (300–500 men), with the help of registered Cossacks who went over to his side, disarmed the small Polish detachment guarding the area and took over the Zaporozhian Sich.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Poles attempted to retake the Sich but were decisively defeated as more registered Cossacks joined the forces. At the end of January 1648, a [[Cossack Rada]] was called and Khmelnytsky was unanimously elected a [[hetman]]. A period of feverish activity followed. Cossacks were sent with hetman's letters to many regions of Ukraine calling on Cossacks and Orthodox peasants to join the rebellion, [[Khortytsia]] was fortified, efforts were made to acquire and make weapons and ammunition, and emissaries were sent to the [[Khan of Crimea]], [[İslâm III Giray]].

Initially, Polish authorities took the news of Khmelnytsky's arrival at the Sich and reports about the rebellion lightly. The two sides exchanged lists of demands: the Poles asked the Cossacks to surrender the mutinous leader and disband, while Khmelnytsky and the Rada demanded that the Commonwealth restore the Cossacks' ancient rights, stop the advance of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], yield the right to appoint Orthodox leaders of the Sich and of the Registered Cossack regiments, and to remove Commonwealth troops from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. ''Sotsialno-politychnyi portret''. page 91, Lebid, Kiev. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish magnates considered the demands an affront, and an army headed by Stefan Potocki moved in the direction of the Sich.

Had the Cossacks stayed at Khortytsia, they might have been defeated, as in many other rebellions. However, Khmelnytsky marched against the Poles. The two armies met on 16 May 1648 at [[Battle of Zhovti Vody|Zhovti Vody]], where, aided by the Tatars of [[Tugay Bey]], the Cossacks inflicted their first crushing defeat on the Commonwealth. It was repeated soon afterwards, with the same success, at the [[Battle of Korsuń]] on 26 May 1648. Khmelnytsky used his diplomatic and military skills: under his leadership, the Cossack army moved to battle positions following his plans, Cossacks were proactive and decisive in their manoeuvrers and attacks, and most importantly, he gained the support of both large contingents of registered Cossacks and the [[Giray dynasty|Crimean Khan]], his crucial ally for the many battles to come.

===Establishment of Cossack Hetmanate===
[[File:Herb Viyska Zaporozkogo (Alex K).svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]]]
At Christmas in 1648, Khmelnytsky made a triumphant entry into Kiev, where he was hailed as &quot;the [[Moses]], saviour, redeemer, and liberator of the people from Polish captivity... the illustrious ruler of Rus.&quot;{{citation needed|reason=quote needs cite|date=August 2017}} The [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] Paiseus, who was visiting Kiev at this time, referred to Khmelnytsky as the Prince of Rus, the head of an independent Ukrainian state, according to contemporaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hrushevsky,M 2003&quot;&gt;[[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Hrushevsky,M.]] ''History of Ukraine-Rus''. New ed. Bao. Donetsk, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1649, during negotiations in [[Pereiaslav]] with a Polish delegation headed by Senator [[Adam Kysil]], Khmelnytsky declared that he was &quot;the sole autocrat of Rus&quot; and that he had &quot;enough power in Ukraine, [[Podilia]], and [[Volhynia]]... in his land and principality stretching as far as Lviv, [[Chełm]], and [[Halych]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret, p. 203, Lebid, Kiev. 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish envoys recognized that Khmelnytsky claimed to be leader of the Zaporozhian Cossacks but also of Ukraine and the heritage of the Rus. A [[Vilnius]] [[panegyric]] in Khmelnytsky's honour (1650–1651) said: &quot;While in Poland it is King [[Jan II Casimir Vasa]], in Rus it is Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\K\H\KhmelnytskyBohdan.htm &quot;Bohdan Khmelnytsky&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the period of initial military successes, the [[state-building]] process began. His leadership was demonstrated in all areas of state-building: military, administration, finance, economics and culture. Khmelnytsky made the [[Zaporozhian Host]] the supreme power in the new Ukrainian state and unified all the spheres of Ukrainian society under his authority. Khmelnytsky built a new government system and developed military and civilian administration.

A new generation of statesmen and military leaders came to the forefront: [[Ivan Vyhovsky]], [[Pavlo Teteria]], [[Danylo Nechai]] and [[Ivan Nechai]], [[Ivan Bohun]], [[Hryhoriy Hulyanytsky]]. From Cossack polkovnyks, officers, and military commanders, a new elite within the Cossack Hetman state was born. Throughout the years, the elite preserved and maintained the autonomy of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] in the face of Russia's attempt to curb it. It was also instrumental in the onset of the period of [[Ruin (period of history)|Ruin]] that followed, eventually destroying most of the achievements of the Khmelnytsky era.

===Complications===
[[File:Bohdan-banner.jpg|thumb|Bohdan Khmelnytsky's banner that was taken at the [[battle of Berestechko]]. It was later taken by the Swedes in Warsaw 1655 and is now to be seen at Armémuseum, Stockholm, Sweden.]]
Khmelnytsky's initial successes were followed by a series of setbacks as neither Khmelnytsky nor the Commonwealth had enough strength to stabilise the situation or to inflict a defeat on the enemy. What followed was a period of intermittent warfare and several peace treaties, which were seldom upheld. From spring 1649 onward, the situation turned for the worse for the Cossacks; as Polish attacks increased in frequency, they became more successful. The resulting [[Treaty of Zboriv]] on 18 August 1649 was unfavourable for the Cossacks. It was followed by another defeat at the [[battle of Berestechko]] on 18 June 1651 in which the Tatars betrayed Khmelnytsky and held the hetman captive. The Cossacks suffered a crushing defeat, with an estimated 30,000 casualties. They were forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bila Tserkva]], which favoured the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Warfare broke open again and, in the years that followed, the two sides were almost perpetually at war. Now, the [[Crimean Tatars]] played a decisive role and did not allow either side to prevail. It was in their interests to keep both Ukraine and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from getting too strong and becoming an effective power in the region.&lt;ref name = &quot;Subtelny&quot;&gt;[[Orest Subtelny]]. ''Ukraine. A history.'' University of Toronto Press, p. 133. 1994. {{ISBN|0-8020-0591-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khmelnytsky started looking for another foreign ally. Although the Cossacks had established their ''[[de facto]]'' independence from Poland, the new state needed legitimacy, which could be provided by a foreign monarch. In search of a protectorate, Khmelnytsky approached the [[Ottoman sultan]] in 1651, and formal embassies were exchanged. The Turks offered vassalship, like their other arrangements with contemporary [[Khanate of Crimea|Crimea]], [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. However, the idea of a union with the Muslim monarch was not acceptable to the general populace and most Cossacks.

The other possible ally was the Orthodox [[tsar of Moskovia]]. That government remained quite cautious and stayed away from the hostilities in Ukraine. In spite of numerous envoys and calls for help from Khmelnytsky in the name of the shared Orthodox faith, the tsar preferred to wait, until the threat of a Cossack-Ottoman union in 1653 finally forced him to action.&lt;ref name = &quot;Subtelny&quot; /&gt; The idea that the tsar might be favourable to taking Ukraine under his hand was communicated to the hetman and so diplomatic activity intensified.

==Treaty with tsar==
{{Main|Treaty of Pereyaslav}}
[[File:Alex K Bohdan Chmelnickyi prapor.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Bohdan (Б) Khmelnytsky (Х), hetman (Г) of Army (В) of Zaporozhia (З) and of his (Е) king's (К) majesty (МЛС) of Rzecz Pospolita.]]
After a series of negotiations, it was agreed that the Cossacks would accept overlordship by the Tsar [[Alexei Mikhailovich]]. To finalize the treaty, a Russian embassy led by [[boyar]] [[Vasily Buturlin]] came to [[Pereyaslav]], where, on 18 January 1654, the Cossack Rada was called and the treaty concluded. Historians have not come to consensus in interpreting the intentions of the tsar and Khmelnytsky in signing this agreement. The treaty legitimized Russian claims to the capital of [[Kievan Rus']] and strengthened the tsar's influence in the region. Khmelnytsky needed the treaty to gain a legitimate monarch's protection and support from a friendly Orthodox power.

Historians have differed in their reading of Khmelnytsky's goal with the union: whether it was to be a military union, a [[suzerainty]], or a complete incorporation of Ukraine into the [[Tsardom of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\P\E\PereiaslavTreatyof1654.htm &quot;Treaty of 1654&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences were expressed during the ceremony of the oath of allegiance to the tsar: the Russian envoy refused to reciprocate with an oath from the ruler to his subjects, as the Cossacks and Ruthenians expected since it was the custom of the Polish king.

Khmelnytsky stormed out of the church and threatened to cancel the entire treaty. The Cossacks decided to rescind the demand and abide by the treaty.

==Final years==
As a result of the 1654 [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], the geopolitical map of the region changed. Russia entered the scene, and the Cossacks' former allies, the Tatars, had gone over to the Polish side and initiated warfare against Khmelnytsky. [[Tatar invasions|Tatar raids]] depopulated whole areas of Ukraine. Cossacks, aided by the Tsar's army, took revenge on Polish possessions in [[Belarus]], and in the spring of 1654, the Cossacks drove the Poles from much of the country. Sweden entered the mêlée. Old adversaries of both Poland and Russia, they occupied a share of Lithuania before the Russians could get there.

The occupation displeased Russia because the tsar sought to take over the Swedish Baltic provinces. In 1656, with the Commonwealth increasingly war-torn but also increasingly hostile and successful against the Swedes, the ruler of [[Transylvania]], [[George II Rákóczi]], also joined in. [[Charles X of Sweden]] had solicited his help because of the massive Polish popular opposition and resistance against the Swedes. Under blows from all sides, the Commonwealth barely survived.

Russia attacked Sweden in July 1656, while its forces were deeply involved in Poland. That war ended in status quo two years later, but it complicated matters for Khmelnytsky, as his ally was now fighting his overlord. In addition to diplomatic tensions between the tsar and Khmelnytsky, a number of other disagreements between the two surfaced. In particular, they concerned Russian officials' interference in the finances of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] and in the newly captured Belarus. The tsar concluded a separate treaty with the Poles in [[Vilnius]] in 1656. The Hetman's emissaries were not even allowed to attend the negotiations.

Khmelnytsky wrote an irate letter to the tsar accusing him of breaking the Pereyaslav agreement. He compared the Swedes to the tsar and said that the former were more honourable and trustworthy than the Russians.&lt;ref name = &quot;Subtelny&quot; /&gt;

In Poland, the Cossack army and Transylvanian allies suffered a number of setbacks. As a result, Khmelnytsky had to deal with a Cossack rebellion on the home front. Troubling news also came from Crimea, as Tatars, in alliance with Poland, were preparing for a new [[invasion]] of Ukraine. Though already ill, Khmelnytsky continued to conduct diplomatic activity, at one point even receiving the tsar's envoys from his bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS591&quot;&gt;V. A. Smoliy, V. S. Stepankov. ''Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Sotsialno-politychnyi portret.'' page 591. Lebid. Kiev. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monument dedicated to Bogdan Khmelnytsky.jpg|thumb|Monument dedicated to Bogdan Khmelnytsky in Kiev, Ukraine. The authors are [[Boris Krylov]] and Oles Sydoruk.]]
On 22 July, he suffered a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and became paralysed after his audience with the Kiev Colonel Zhdanovich. His expedition to [[Halychyna]] had failed because of mutiny within his army.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Hrushevsky, M.]] ''Illustrated History of Ukraine''. &quot;BAO&quot;. Donetsk, 2003. {{ISBN|966-548-571-7}} page 330&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week later, Bohdan Khmelnytsky died at 5 a.m. on 27 July 1657. His funeral was held on 23 August, and his body was taken from his capital, Chyhyryn, to his estate, at Subotiv, for burial in his ancestral church. In 1664 a Polish hetman [[Stefan Czarniecki]] recaptured Subotiv, which according to some Ukrainian historians, ordered the bodies of the hetman and his son, [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky|Tymish]], to be exhumed and desecrated, while others claim that is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Some Ukrainian historians dispute that his grave was desecrated. In 1973, an expedition investigated the site of the church and discovered remains of people, not been found before.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Khmelnytsky had a crucial influence on the history of Ukraine. He not only shaped the future of Ukraine but affected the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] in Europe, as the weakening of Poland-Lithuania was exploited by Austria, Saxony, Prussia, and Russia. His actions and role in events were viewed differently by different contemporaries, and even now there are greatly differing perspectives on his legacy.

In Ukraine, Khmelnytsky is generally regarded as a national hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalton2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalton|first=Meredith|title=Culture Shock!: Ukraine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGhaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA56|year=2000|publisher=Graphics Arts Center|isbn=978-1-55868-420-1|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinlauf1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinlauf|first=Michael C.|authorlink=Michael C.

His image is prominently displayed on Ukrainian [[banknote]]s and his [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky Monument, Kiev|monument]] in the centre of Kiev is a focal point of the Ukrainian capital. There have also been several issues of the [[Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] – one of the highest decorations in Ukraine and in the former Soviet Union.

However, with all this positive appreciation of his legacy, even in [[Ukraine]] it is far from being unanimous. He is criticised for his union with Russia, which in the view of some, proved to be disastrous for the future of the country. Prominent Ukrainian poet, [[Taras Shevchenko]], was one of Khmelnytsky's very vocal and harsh critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Konoval|first=Oleksiy|url=http://universum.lviv.ua/previous-site/archive/journal/2002/konovo_7.html|script-title=uk:Чи варто відзначати річницю Переяславського договору?|trans-title=Is it worth celebrating the anniversary of the Treaty of Pereyaslav?|language=uk|publisher=universum.lviv.ua|date=2002|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others criticize him for his alliance with the Crimean Tatars, which permitted the latter to take a large number of Ukrainian peasants as slaves. (The Cossacks as a military caste did not protect the ''[[kholop]]y'', the lowest stratum of the Ukrainian people). Folk songs capture this. On the balance, the view of his legacy in present-day Ukraine is more positive than negative, with some critics acknowledging that the union with Russia was dictated by necessity and an attempt to survive in those difficult times.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In a 2018 Ukraine's [[Sociological group &quot;RATING&quot;|Rating Sociological Group]] poll, 73% of Ukrainian respondents had a positive attitude to Khmelnytsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Survey shows Ukrainians most negatively regard Stalin, Lenin and Gorbachev |url=https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/survey-shows-ukrainians-most-negatively-regard-stalin-lenin-and-gorbachev.html |work=Kyiv Post |date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish assessment===
Khmelnytsky's role in the history of the Polish State has been viewed mostly in a negative light. The rebellion of 1648 proved to be the end of the [[Golden Age]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] and the beginning of its demise. Although it survived the rebellion and the following attacks, within 100 years it was divided among Russia, [[Prussia]], and [[Austria]] in the [[partitions of Poland]]. Many blamed Khmelnytsky for the decline of the Commonwealth. Polish historians such as [[Ludwik Kubala]] compared Khmelnytsky with the influence of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Володимир|last=Голобуцький|url=http://litopys.org.ua/holob/hol13.htm|script-title=uk:Запорозьке Козацтво – Розділ XI.

Khmelnychchyna and Zaporozhian Cossackdom|language=uk|publisher=Litopys|date=1994|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khmelnytsky has been a subject to several works in the 19th century Polish literature, but the most notable treatment of him in [[Polish literature]] is found in [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s ''[[With Fire and Sword]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser2015-110&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Roman|last=Koropeckyj|chapter=The Image of Bohdan Khmelnytsky in Polish Romanticism and Its Post-Romantic Reflex|editor=Amelia Glaser|title=Stories of Khmelnytsky: Competing Literary Legacies of the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack Uprising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onsxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110|date=19 August 2015|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-9382-7|pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rather critical portrayal of him by Sienkiewicz has been moderated in the [[With Fire and Sword (film)|1999 movie adaptation]] by [[Jerzy Hoffman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaser2015-208&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first1=Izabela|last1=Kalinowska|first2=Marta|last2=Kondratyuk|chapter=Khmelnytsky in Motion: The Case of Soviet, Polish, and Ukrainian film|editor=Amelia Glaser|title=Stories of Khmelnytsky: Competing Literary Legacies of the 1648 Ukrainian Cossack Uprising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onsxCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208|date=19 August 2015|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-9382-7|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Douglas D.|authorlink=Douglas D.

===Russian and Soviet history===
The official Russian [[historiography]] stressed the fact that Khmelnytsky entered into union with Moscow's Tsar [[Alexei Mikhailovich]] with an expressed desire to &quot;re-unify&quot; Ukraine with Russia. This view corresponded with the official theory of Moscow as an heir of the [[Kievan Rus']], which appropriately gathered its former territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeroRosSov&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Georgiy Kasianov|editor2=Philipp Ther|title=A Laboratory of Transnational History: Ukraine and Recent Ukrainian Historiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjFjTRL5O_4C&amp;pg=PA54|year=2009|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-26-5|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khmelnytsky was viewed as a national hero of Russia for bringing Ukraine into the &quot;eternal union&quot; of all the Russias – Great, Little and White Russia. As such, he was much respected and venerated in Imperial Russia. His role was presented as a model for all Ukrainians to follow: to aspire for closer ties with Great Russia. This view was expressed in a monument commissioned by the Russian nationalist [[Mikhail Yuzefovich]], which was installed in the centre of [[Kiev]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CE%5CM%5CEmsUkase.htm|title=Ems Ukase|work=Encyclopedia of Ukraine|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Yuzefovich was also known for his contribution to the [[Ems Ukase]], which restricted the use of Ukrainian in [[Ukraine]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian authorities decided the original version of the monument (created by Russian sculptor [[Mikhail Mikeshin]]) was too [[xenophobic]]; it was to depict a vanquished Pole, Jew, and a Catholic priest under the hoofs of the horse. The inscription on the monument reads &quot;To Bohdan Khmelnytsky from one and indivisible Russia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Viktor|last=Kyrkevych|url=http://www.oldkiev.info/pamyatniki_kieva/pamyatnik_Bogdanu_Xmelnickomu.html|script-title=ru:Памятник Богдану Хмельницкому|trans-title=Monument to Bohdan Khmelnytsky|language=ru|publisher=oldkiev.info|accessdate=11 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416002235/http://www.oldkiev.info/pamyatniki_kieva/pamyatnik_Bogdanu_Xmelnickomu.html|archive-date=16 April 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikeshin also created the Monument to the [[Millennium of Russia]] in [[Novgorod]], which has Khmelnytsky shown as one of Russia's prominent figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novgorod.ru/english/read/information/architecture/millennium-russia/|title=The Monument to the Millennium of Russia|publisher=novgorod.ru|date=2007|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soviet historiography]] followed in many ways the Imperial Russian theory of re-unification while adding the [[class struggle]] dimension to the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;HeroRosSov&quot;/&gt; Khmelnytsky was praised not only for re-unifying Ukraine with Russia, but also for organizing the class struggle of oppressed Ukrainian peasants against Polish exploiters.

===Jewish history===

The assessment of Khmelnytsky in [[Jewish history]] is overwhelmingly negative because he used Jews as scapegoats and sought to eradicate Jews from Ukraine. The [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] led to the deaths of an estimated 18,000–100,000 Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stampfer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|author-link=Shaul Stampfer|title=What Actually Happened to the Jews of Ukraine in 1648?|journal=Jewish History|publisher=Springer Nature|volume=17|issue=2|year=May 2003|issn=0334-701X|doi=10.1023/a:1022330717763|pages=207–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sources estimating 100,000 Jews killed:

*&quot;Is there not a difference in nature between Hitler's extermination of three million Polish Jews between 1939 and 1945 because he wanted every Jew dead and the mass murder 1648–49 of 100,000 Polish Jews by General Bogdan Chmielnicki because he wanted to end Polish rule in the Ukraine and was prepared to use Cossack terrorism to kill Jews in the process?&quot; Colin Martin Tatz.
