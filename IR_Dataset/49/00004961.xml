'''Bovril''' is the trademarked name of a thick and salty [[meat extract]] paste similar to a [[yeast extract]], developed in the 1870s by [[John Lawson Johnston]].  It is sold in a distinctive, bulbous jar, and also as cubes and granules.  Bovril is owned and distributed by [[Unilever]] UK.

Bovril can be made into a drink by diluting with hot water or, less commonly, with milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1302&amp;dat=19310701&amp;id=CV0RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=P5YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3083,128400 |title=Try Bovril and milk (advert) |newspaper=[[The Sydney Mail]] |date=1 July 1931 |page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be used as a flavouring for soups, broth, stews or porridge, or as a spread, especially on toast in a similar fashion to [[Marmite]] and [[Vegemite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wainwright|first1=Martin|title=Bovril drops the beef to go vegetarian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/19/foodanddrink|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=28 May 2018|quote=In Malaysia they stir it into porridge and coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first part of the product's name comes from [[Latin]] ''bovīnus'', meaning &quot;ox&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;OED entry at ''bovine''.&lt;/ref&gt;   Johnston took the ''-vril'' suffix from [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s then-popular novel, ''[[The Coming Race]]'' (1870), whose plot revolves around a superior race of people, the Vril-ya, who derive their powers from an electromagnetic substance named &quot;Vril&quot;. Therefore, Bovril indicates great strength obtained from an ox.&lt;ref name=&quot;patent-law-42&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Thompson| first=William Phillips| title=Handbook of patent law of all countries| publisher=Stevens| location=London| year=1920| page=42| url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofpatent00thomiala| accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bovril poster c1900.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Poster for Bovril, about 1900; [[V&amp;A Museum]] no. E.163-1973]]
[[File:The Pope and Bovril.jpg|thumb|right|upright|&quot;The Two [[Papal infallibility|Infallible Powers]]: The Pope &amp; Bovril&quot;; poster for Bovril, c. 1900]]

In 1870, in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], [[Napoleon III]] ordered one million cans of beef to feed his troops. The task of providing all this beef went to John Lawson Johnston, a [[Scotsman]] living in Canada. Large quantities of beef were available across the British Dominions and South America, but its transport and storage were problematic. Therefore, Johnston created a product known as 'Johnston's Fluid Beef', later called Bovril, to meet the needs of Napoleon III.&lt;ref name=&quot;uni&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Bovril| url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/brands-in-action/detail/Bovril/293591/| publisher=Unilever.co.uk| accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1888, over 3,000 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] [[public house]]s, grocers and [[dispensing chemist]]s were selling Bovril. In 1889, Bovril Ltd was formed to develop Johnston's business further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Money-Market and City Intelligence |work=The Times |issue=32638 |date=5 March 1889 |location=London |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bovril continued to function as a &quot;war food&quot; in [[World War I]] and was frequently mentioned in the 1930 account ''[[Not So Quiet: Stepdaughters of War]]'' by [[Helen Zenna Smith]]. One account from the book describes it being prepared for the casualties at [[Mons, Belgium#Battle of Mons|Mons]] where &quot;the orderlies were just beginning to make Bovril for the wounded, when the bearers and ambulance wagons were shelled as they were bringing the wounded into the hospital&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramc-99&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivian|first=Evelyn Charles|title=With the Royal army medical corps (R.A.M.C.) at the front|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1914|page=99|url=https://archive.org/details/withroyalarmymed00vivirich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thermos of ''beef tea'' was the favoured way to fend off the chill of matches during the winter season for generations of British [[Association football|football]] fans; Bovril dissolved in hot water is still sold in stadiums all over the [[United Kingdom]]. Bovril beef tea was the only hot drink that [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s team had to drink when they were marooned on [[Elephant Island]] during the [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|Endurance Expedition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1916/09/11/104690619.pdf|title=Shackleton's men kept hope of rescue high; Marooned Scientists, Living on Penguin and Seaweed, Watched Daily for Relief.|date=1916-09-11|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When John Lawson Johnston died, his son [[George Lawson Johnston, 1st Baron Luke|George Lawson Johnston]] inherited and took over the Bovril business. In 1929, George Lawson Johnston was created [[Baron Luke]], of Pavenham, in the county of Bedford.

Bovril's instant beef stock was launched in 1966 and its &quot;King of Beef&quot; range of instant flavours for stews, casseroles and gravy in 1971.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In 1971, [[James Goldsmith]]'s [[Cavenham Foods]] acquired the Bovril Company but then sold most of its dairies and [[South America]]n operations to finance further take-overs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ketupa.net/goldsmith.htm Goldsmith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105040319/http://www.ketupa.net/goldsmith.htm |date=5 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand is now owned by Unilever.&lt;ref name=&quot;uni&quot;/&gt;

Bovril holds the unusual distinction of having been advertised with a [[Pope]]. An advertising campaign of the early 20th century in Britain depicted [[Pope Leo XIII]] seated on his throne, bearing a mug of Bovril. The campaign slogan read: ''The Two Infallible Powers – The Pope &amp; Bovril.''

==Licensed production==
Bovril is also produced in [[South Africa]] by the Bokomo division of Pioneer Foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pioneerfoods.co.za |title=Pioneer Foods |publisher=pioneerfoods.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Siege of Ladysmith]] in the [[Second Boer War]], a Bovril-like paste was produced from horse meat within the garrison. Nicknamed ''Chevril'' (a portmanteau of Bovril and ''cheval'', French for horse) it was produced by [[boiling down]] horse or [[mule]] meat to a jelly paste and serving it as a &quot;beef tea&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=S|title=Intombi Military Hospital and Cemetery|journal=Military History Journal|publisher=Die Suid-Afrikaanse Krygshistoriese Vereniging|volume=5|issue=6|url=http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol056sw.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacson|first=M|title=The Record of a Regiment of the Line|publisher=Hutchinson &amp; Co. |year=1908 |page=88 |chapter=II |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/15972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipe changes==
In 2004, Unilever removed beef ingredients from the Bovril formula, rendering it vegetarian. This was mainly due to concerns about decreasing sales, particularly from exports due to an export ban on British beef, as a result of the growing popularity of [[vegetarianism]], religious dietary requirements, and public concerns about [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/19/foodanddrink|title=Bovril drops the beef to go vegetarian|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|date=18 November 2004|website=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301134505/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/nov/19/foodanddrink|archive-date=1 March 2017|url-status=live|access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, Unilever reversed that decision and reintroduced beef ingredients to their Bovril formula once sales increased and the beef export bans were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/01/lifeandhealth.foodanddrink|title=Unilever puts the beef back into Bovril|date=1 September 2016|website=The Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301140333/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/01/lifeandhealth.foodanddrink|archive-date=1 March 2017|url-status=live|access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unilever now produces Bovril using beef extract and a chicken variety using chicken extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unilever.co.uk/brands/foodbrands/bovril.aspx |title=Bovril Unilever food brands |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411060207/http://www.unilever.co.uk/brands/foodbrands/bovril.aspx |archivedate=11 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its invention, Bovril has become an [[cultural icon|icon]] of [[culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]]. It is commonly associated with [[football culture]], since during the winter British football fans in stadium terraces often drink it from [[Thermos]] flasks; or from [[disposable cup]]s in Scotland, where thermoses are [[Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995#Part II - Sporting Events: Control of Alcohol etc.|banned]] from football stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/bovril-it-s-a-drink-a-spread-even-a-crisp-flavouring-and-it-was-created-in-edinburgh-1-814491 | title=Bovril: It's a drink, a spread, even a crisp flavouring, and it was created in Edinburgh | work=[[The Scotsman]] | date=8 June 2010 | accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.deadlinenews.co.uk/2009/08/07/8176-1549/ | title=Tribute to Scots Bovril inventor | work=Deadline News | date=7 August 2009 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Alexander Lawrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[In Which We Serve]]'', the officers on the bridge are served &quot;Bovril rather heavily laced with sherry&quot; to warm them up, after being rescued during the [[Operation Dynamo|Dunkirk evacuation]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]].

During a 2011 episode of ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'', [[James May]] drank from an urn of Bovril while driving a snowplough in [[Norway]] and commented: &quot;We all know that when it's snowing and it's cold you have Bovril.  That's a rule of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x31w1/episodes/2011 |title=Top Gear: series 16, episode 5 |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bovril reappeared in another episode of ''Top Gear'' in the form of [[Jeremy Clarkson]]'s V8 Food Blender, wherein it was used to make a &quot;Man's V8 Smoothie&quot; complete with raw beef, chilies, hot sauce, and a [[brick]].

On ''[[Frasier]]'' in Season 6, Episode 7, Daphne is upset when Niles throws away a jar of Bovril because it smelled rancid. Daphne exclaims: &quot;That's how it's supposed to smell; it's English!&quot;

In [[Steve Coogan]]'s 2016 [[Alan Partridge]] [[mockumentary]] ''Scissored Isle'', the Partridge character offers Bovril to some teenagers, describing it as &quot;beef tea&quot;.

[[Douglas Adams]], author of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', stated that he relied on frequent baths, Bovril sandwiches and very loud guitar playing as excuses to avoid writing.

British mountaineer [[Chris Bonington]] appeared in TV commercials for Bovril in the 1970s and 1980s in which he recalled melting snow and ice on Everest to make hot drinks.
