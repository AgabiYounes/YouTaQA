{{nihongo foot|'''''Bubble Bobble'''''|バブルボブル|Baburu Boburu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[platform game]] by [[Taito]], first released in arcades in 1986&lt;ref name = &quot;klov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7222 |title=Bubble Bobble Video Game by Taito (1986)| publisher=The International Arcade Museum|accessdate=2009-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[porting|ported]] to home systems by [[Toei Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/bubble-bobble-rainbow-islands-games | title=Bubble Bobble &amp; Rainbow Islands games | website=Mobygames.com | accessdate=2014-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game, starring the twin Bubble Dragons Bub and Bob, tasks players with traveling through one hundred stages, blowing and bursting bubbles, jumping on and off blown bubbles to navigate level obstacles, dodging and eliminating enemies, and collecting a variety of items including some that carry [[power-up]]s and significant bonuses.&lt;ref name = &quot;klov&quot;/&gt; For example, the red shoe allows Bub and Bob to move faster, while wrapped candies cause Bub and Bob to blow bubbles faster, and blow bubbles at greater distances.  Other items, such as umbrellas, allow to skip numerous levels, moving closer to the final level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble/Special_items|title=Bubble Bobble/Special items — StrategyWiki, the video game walkthrough and strategy guide wiki|website=Strategywiki.org|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game became popular and led to a long series of sequels and spin-offs. The main goal of the game is to rescue Bub and Bob's girlfriends from the Cave of Monsters. The game has [[multiple endings]], which depend on the player's performance and discovery of secrets.&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer08&quot;&gt;{{citation | title=Bubble Trouble | journal=Retro Gamer | issue=8 | pages=36–41 | url=http://www.adamdawes.com/retrogaming/rg_08_bubblebobble.html | first=Adam | last=Dawes | date= September 2004 |publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]| accessdate=2013-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creator of ''Bubble Bobble'', the late [[Fukio Mitsuji]] (MTJ), went on to create other games such as ''[[Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2|Rainbow Islands]]'', ''[[Syvalion]]'', and ''[[Volfied]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=dreamkatcha|title=Remembering Fukio Mitsuji|url=https://www.everythingamiga.com/2016/04/remembering-fukio-mitsuji.html|website=Everythingamiga.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Gameplay ==
[[File:Bubblebobble.png|thumb|320px|left|Arcade screenshot]]
In the game's plot, &quot;Baron Von Blubba&quot; has kidnapped the brothers Bubby and Bobby's girlfriends and turned the brothers into Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. Bub and Bob have to finish 100 levels in the Cave of Monsters in order to rescue them.&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer95&quot;&gt;{{citation | title=Bubble Memories | journal=Retro Gamer | issue=95 | pages=26–35 | date= October 2011 |publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the game, each player controls one of the two dragons. Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer08&quot;/&gt; Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form ''extend'', a bonus life is earned and both players immediately advance to the next level.

A player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles).  Enemies turn &quot;angry&quot;—turning pink in color and moving faster—if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.

In the 100th and final level, players face a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer08&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer95&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer28&quot;&gt;{{citation | title=The Definitive - Bubble Bobble | journal=Retro Gamer | issue=28 | pages=58–68 | date= July 2006 | first = Stuart | last = Campbell | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the first games to feature multiple endings. Completing Level 100 in single-player mode reveals a message stating that the game has not truly ended and a hint to the player: &quot;Come here with your friend.&quot; If two players complete the game, they see a &quot;happy end&quot;, in which the brothers are transformed to their human selves and reunited with their girlfriends. This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult &quot;super&quot; mode. If this mode is completed with two players, a second &quot;happy end&quot; is displayed in which Super Drunk (the defeated boss) is revealed to be the brothers' parents under the control of some outside influence. The brothers return to normal and are reunited with their parents and girlfriends.&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer95&quot;/&gt;

==Development==
''Bubble Bobble'' was designed by [[Fukio Mitsuji]], a Japanese game designer at [[Taito]]. A fan of arcade games by [[Namco]], specifically ''[[Xevious]]'', Mitsuji felt that Taito's output by comparison were lackluster and of poor quality, hoping that he could help push the company to produce higher-quality arcade titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Fukio &quot;MTJ&quot; Mitsuji - 1988 Developer Interview |url=http://shmuplations.com/bubblebobble/ |accessdate=8 November 2019 |agency=BEEP! |date=1988 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008222008/http://shmuplations.com/bubblebobble/ |archivedate=8 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first game was the four-screen racer ''Super Dead Heat'' in 1985, followed by the shoot'em up ''[[Halley's Comet (video game)|Halley's Comet]]'' the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;/&gt; After work on these two games was completed, Mitsuji set out to make his next project a platform game, featuring cute characters and a more comical setting compared to his previous works.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG Interview&quot;/&gt;

Mitsuji wanted the game to exhilarating and to appeal towards a female audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;/&gt; Thinking about what kind of things women like to draw or sketch, Mitsuji created an extensive list of over 100 ideas, and after a process of elimination selected bubbles as the core game mechanic.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;/&gt; He liked the idea of the screen being filled with bubbles, and thought that popping them would provide a thrilling sensation to the player, fueling them to keep going.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVG Interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;/&gt; The player originally controlled a robot with a spike on its head to pop bubbles — Mitsuji disliked it for not being &quot;cool&quot;, instead replacing them with dinosaurs due to them possessing rigid plates along their back.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;/&gt; He liked to write down ideas on paper as soon as he thought of them, often flooding his office with stacks of paper filled with potential ideas for game mechanics.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;/&gt;

Mitsuji constantly tried to think of new ways to make the game better than it was before, saying to have lost sleep while trying to figure out how he could improve it.&lt;ref name=&quot;BEEP!&quot;/&gt; He often worked on holidays and late at night to come up with new ideas for the game and to perfect it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taito Memories&quot;/&gt; Several of the enemies were taken from ''[[Chack'n Pop]]'' (1983), an older Taito game that is often considered a precursor to ''Bubble Bobble''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chack 'N Pop - Videogame by Taito |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7302 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |accessdate=18 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925224549/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7302 |archivedate=25 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsuji intended the game to be played by couples, leading to the creation of the multiple endings, which differ based on player performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taito Memories&quot;&gt;Mitsuji, Fukio (28 July 2005).

===Conversions===

''Bubble Bobble'' was ported to many home video game consoles and computers, including the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[MSX2]] and [[Sega Master System]] — the last of these has two hundred levels as opposed to the arcade version's 100 levels, and was released in Japan as ''Final Bubble Bobble''.&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer28&quot;/&gt; A version for the [[Sharp X68000]] was developed by Dempa and released in 1994, which includes a gamemode paying homage to Mitsuji's later arcade game ''[[Syvalion]]'', titled ''Sybubblun''. Conversions for the [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] were respectively released in 1991 and 1996, the GBC port being named ''Classic Bubble Bobble''.&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer28&quot;/&gt; A version of ''Bubble Bobble'' was also produced for the unreleased Taito WOWOW console.&lt;ref name=&quot;Szczepaniak&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Szczepaniak |first1=John |title=The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers |date=11 August 2014 |isbn=978-0992926007 |pages=363 |edition=Firstition |url=https://archive.org/details/TheUntoldHistoryOfJapaneseGameDevelopersVol.2JohnSzczepaniak/page/n361?q=cutie+q |accessdate=12 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Taito announced that the source code for ''Bubble Bobble'' had been lost, leading to all subsequent home conversions to be reverse-engineered from an original arcade board.&lt;ref name = &quot;rgamer28&quot;/&gt;
