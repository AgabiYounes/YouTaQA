'''Beryl''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛr|əl}} {{respell|BERR|əl}}) is a [[mineral]] composed of [[beryllium]] [[aluminium]] [[Silicate minerals#Cyclosilicates|cyclosilicate]] with the [[chemical formula]] Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.minerals.net/mineral/beryl.aspx|title=Beryl|website=www.minerals.net|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known varieties of beryl include [[emerald]] and [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]]. Naturally occurring,  [[Hexagonal crystal system|hexagonal]] [[crystal]]s of beryl can be up to several meters in size, but [[double terminated crystal|terminated crystals]] are relatively rare. Pure beryl is colorless, but it is frequently tinted by impurities; possible colors are green, blue, yellow, red (the rarest), and white. Beryl is also an ore source of [[beryllium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Manual of Mineral Science : (after James D. Dana) |last=Klein |first=Cornelis |date=2007 |publisher=J.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;beryl&quot; is derived (via {{lang-la|beryllus}}, {{lang-fro|beryl}}, and {{lang-enm|beril}}) from [[Greek language|Greek]] βήρυλλος ''beryllos'' which referred to a &quot;precious blue-green color-of-sea-water stone&quot;; akin to [[Prakrit]] ''verulia'', ''veluriya'' (&quot;beryl&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=beryl |dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]] |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beryl |accessdate=January 27, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131009130722/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beryl |archivedate=October 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later adopted for the mineral beryl more exclusively.

When the first eyeglasses were constructed in 13th century Italy, the lenses were made of beryl (or of [[rock crystal]]) as glass could not be made clear enough. Consequently, glasses were named ''Brillen'' in German&lt;ref&gt;Kluge, Alexander, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache''. 21 ed. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; (''bril'' in Dutch and ''Briller'' in Danish).

==Deposits==
Beryl of various colors is found most commonly in [[granite|granitic]] [[pegmatite]]s, but also occurs in [[mica]] [[schist]]s in the [[Urals|Ural Mountains]], and [[limestone]] in [[Colombia]]. Beryl is often associated with [[tin]] and [[tungsten]] ore bodies. Beryl is found in Europe in [[Norway]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] (especially morganite), [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Russia]], as well as [[Brazil]], Colombia, [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[South Africa]], the [[United States]], and [[Zambia]]. US beryl locations are in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Connecticut]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Utah]].

[[New England]]'s [[pegmatites]] have produced some of the largest beryls found, including one massive crystal from the [[Bumpus Quarry]] in [[Albany, Maine]] with dimensions {{convert|5.5|by|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} with a mass of around 18 [[Tonne|metric tons]]; it is New Hampshire's state mineral. {{As of|1999}}, the world's largest known naturally occurring crystal of any mineral is a crystal of beryl from Malakialina, Madagascar, {{convert|18|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, and weighing {{convert|380,000|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;G. Cressey and I. F. Mercer, (1999) ''Crystals'', London, Natural History Museum, page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crystal habit and structure ==
[[File:Beryl Crystal Structure.png|alt=Beryl crystal structure with view down C axis|thumb|left|Beryl crystal structure with view down C axis]]
Beryl belongs to the [[Hexagonal crystal family|hexagonal crystal system]]. Normally Beryl forms hexagonal columns but can also occur in massive habits. As a [[Silicate minerals#Cyclosilicates|cyclosilicate]] beryl incorporates rings of silicate tetrahedra of &lt;chem&gt;Si6O18&lt;/chem&gt; that are arranged in columns along the C axis and as parallel layers perpendicular to the C axis, forming channels along the C axis.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; These channels permit a variety of ions, neutral atoms, and molecules to be incorporated into the crystal thus disrupting the overall charge of the crystal permitting further substitutions in [[Aluminium]], [[Silicon]], and [[Beryllium]] sites in the crystal structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; These impurities give rise to the variety of colors of beryl that can be found. Increasing alkali content within the silicate ring channels causes increases to the [[Refractive index|refractive indices]] and [[birefringence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An introduction to the rock-forming minerals |last=Deer |first=W.

== Human health impact ==
{{Main|Acute beryllium poisoning|Berylliosis}}
Beryl is a beryllium compound that is a known carcinogen with acute toxic effects leading to pneumonitis when inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website |title=Concise International Chemical Assessment Document 32, Beryllium and Beryllium compounds |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/cicads/cicads/cicad32.htm | access-date=2019-07-16 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Care must thus be used when mining, handling, and refining these gems.

==Varieties==

===Aquamarine and maxixe===
[[File:Beryl-209736.jpg|thumb|left|Aquamarine]]

Aquamarine (from {{lang-la|aqua marina}}, &quot;[[sea water]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=aquamarine |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aquamarine |dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]] |access-date=2017-02-05 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206103438/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aquamarine |archive-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a blue or [[cyan]] variety of beryl. It occurs at most localities which yield ordinary beryl. The gem-gravel [[Placer mining|placer]] deposits of [[Sri Lanka]] contain aquamarine. Green-yellow beryl, such as that occurring in Brazil, is sometimes called ''chrysolite aquamarine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Owens |first=George |date=1957 |title=The Amateur Lapidary |journal=Rocks &amp; Minerals |volume=32 |issue=9–10 |page=471 |doi=10.1080/00357529.1957.11766963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deep blue version of aquamarine is called ''maxixe''. Maxixe is commonly found in the country of Madagascar. Its color fades to white when exposed to sunlight or is subjected to heat treatment, though the color returns with irradiation.

[[File:Aquamarin cut.jpg|thumb|Faceted aquamarine]]
The pale blue color of aquamarine is attributed to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions produce golden-yellow color, and when both Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; are present, the color is a darker blue as in maxixe. Decoloration of maxixe by light or heat thus may be due to the charge transfer between Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=color&gt;{{cite web| publisher= California Institute of Technology| url = http://minerals.caltech.edu/FILES/Visible/BERYL/Index.htm| title = Color in the Beryl group| accessdate = 2009-06-06| website= Mineral Spectroscopy Server| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110822012424/http://minerals.caltech.edu/FILES/Visible/BERYL/Index.htm| archivedate = 2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ibragim&gt;{{cite journal| doi =10.1134/S0020168509020101| title =Correlations between admixtures and color centers created upon irradiation of natural beryl crystals| year =2009| author =Ibragimova, E.

In the United States, aquamarines can be found at the summit of [[Mount Antero|Mt. Antero]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] in central Colorado. In [[Wyoming]], aquamarine has been discovered in the [[Big Horn Mountains]], near [[Powder River Pass]].  Another location within the United States is the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Range]] near [[Stanley, Idaho]], although the minerals are within a wilderness area which prevents collecting. In Brazil, there are mines in the states of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Espírito Santo]], and [[Bahia]], and minorly in [[Rio Grande do Norte]]. The mines of Colombia, Zambia, Madagascar, [[Malawi]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]] also produce aquamarine.

The largest aquamarine of gemstone quality ever mined was found in Marambaia, Minas Gerais, Brazil, in 1910. It weighed over {{cvt|110|kg|0}}, and its dimensions were {{cvt|48.5|cm|frac=4}} long and {{cvt|42|cm|frac=4}} in diameter.{{sfnp|Schumann|2009|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=V9PqVxpxeiEC&amp;pg=PA110 110]. {{Retrieved|access-date=2018-05-22}}}} The largest cut aquamarine gem is the [[Dom Pedro aquamarine]], now housed in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vastag |first=Brian |title=The Dom Pedro aquamarine’s long and winding path to the Smithsonian |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-02/national/35584555_1_gem-aquamarine-hope-diamond |accessdate=2012-12-07 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=December 2, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208000531/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-02/national/35584555_1_gem-aquamarine-hope-diamond |archivedate=2012-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Romans believed that aquamarine would protect against any dangers while travelling at sea, and that it provided energy and cured laziness.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Superstitions By Richard Webster, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emerald ===
{{Main|Emerald}}
{{see also|Colombian emeralds}}
[[File:Béryl var. émeraude sur gangue (Muzo Mine Boyaca - Colombie) 15.jpg|thumb|left|Rough emerald on matrix]]
Emerald is green beryl, colored by trace amounts of [[chromium]] and sometimes [[vanadium]].&lt;ref name=color/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurlbut&gt;{{cite book|author=Hurlbut, Cornelius S. Jr |author2=Kammerling, Robert C. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1991|title=Gemology|page=203|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|place=New York|isbn=978-0-471-42224-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most emeralds are highly [[inclusion (mineral)|included]], so their brittleness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor.

The modern English word &quot;emerald&quot; comes via [[Middle English]] ''Emeraude'', imported from modern French via [[Old French]] ''Ésmeraude'' and [[Medieval Latin]] ''Esmaraldus'', from [[Latin]] ''smaragdus'', from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] σμάραγδος ''smaragdos'' meaning ‘green gem’, from Hebrew ברקת ''bareket'' (one of the twelve stones in the [[Hoshen]] pectoral pendant of the Kohen HaGadol), meaning ‘lightning flash’, referring to ‘emerald’, relating to Akkadian ''baraqtu'', meaning ‘emerald’, and possibly relating to the [[Sanskrit]] word मरकत ''marakata'', meaning ‘green’.&lt;ref name=Fernie&gt;{{cite book | last = Fernie M.D. |first = W.T.|title = Precious Stones for Curative Wear|publisher = John Wright. &amp; Co.|year = 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] word אזמרגד ''izmargad'', meaning ‘emerald’, is a back-loan, deriving from Greek smaragdos.

[[File:Smaragd-G-EmpireTheWorldOfGems.jpg|thumb|right|Faceted emerald, 1.07ct, Colombia]]
Emeralds in antiquity were mined by the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] and in what is now [[Austria]], as well as [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] in contemporary [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.631| title=Oxygen Isotopes and Emerald Trade Routes Since Antiquity| year=2000| last1=Giuliani |first1=G.| journal=Science| volume=287| pages=631–633| pmid=10649992| last2=Chaussidon| first2=M| last3=Schubnel| first3=HJ| last4=Piat| first4=DH| last5=Rollion-Bard| first5=C| last6=France-Lanord| first6=C| last7=Giard| first7=D| last8=De Narvaez| first8=D| last9=Rondeau| first9=B| issue=5453|bibcode = 2000Sci...287..631G }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rare type of emerald known as a [[trapiche emerald]] is occasionally found in the mines of [[Colombia]]. A trapiche emerald exhibits a &quot;star&quot; pattern; it has raylike spokes of dark carbon impurities that give the emerald a six-pointed radial pattern. It is named for the ''[[trapiche]]'', a grinding wheel used to process [[sugarcane]] in the region. [[Colombian emeralds]] are generally the most prized due to their transparency and fire. Some of the rarest emeralds come from the two main emerald belts in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]]: [[Colombian emeralds#Western belt|Muzo and Coscuez]] west of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], and [[Colombian emeralds#Western belt|Chivor and Somondoco]] to the east. Fine emeralds are also found in other countries, such as [[Zambia]], [[Brazil]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Madagascar]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Russia]]. In the US, emeralds can be found in [[Hiddenite, North Carolina]]. In 1998, emeralds were discovered in [[Yukon]].

Emerald is a rare and valuable gemstone and, as such, it has provided the [[incentive]] for developing synthetic emeralds.

Gilson's emeralds are usually grown on natural colorless beryl seeds which become coated on both sides. Growth occurs at the rate of {{convert|1|mm|in}} per month, a typical seven-month growth run producing emerald crystals of 7&amp;nbsp;mm of thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nassau |first=K |date=1980 |title=Gems Made By Man |publisher=Gemological Institute of America |isbn=978-0-873-11016-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The green color of emeralds is widely attributed to presence of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=ibragim/&gt;&lt;ref name=viana1/&gt;&lt;ref name=blak/&gt; Intensely green beryls from Brazil, Zimbabwe and elsewhere in which the color is attributed to [[vanadium]] have also been sold and certified as emeralds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Arthur |year=2008 |title=Gemstones: Properties, Identification and Use |location=London |publisher=New Holland |pages=77–78 |isbn=978-1-845-37602-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Behmenburg |first1=Christa |last2=Conklin |first2=Lawrence |last3=Giuliani |first3=Gaston |last4=Glas |first4=Maximilian |last5=Gray |first5=Patricia &amp; Michael |editor1-last=Giuliani |editor1-first=Gaston |editor2-last=Jarnot |editor2-first=Miranda |editor3-last=Neumeier |editor3-first=Gunther |editor4-last=Ottaway |editor4-first=Terri |editor5-last=Sinkankas |editor5-first=John |display-editors=1 |date=January 2002 |title=Emeralds of the World |series=ExtraLapis |volume=2 |location=East Hampton, Connecticut |publisher=Lapis International |pages=75–77 |isbn=978-0-971-53711-8 |display-authors=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Deer |first1=W.A. |last2=Zussman |first2=J. |last3=Howie |first3=R.A. |year=1997 |title=Disilicates and Ring Silicates |series=Rock-forming Minerals |volume=1B | edition=2 |location=Bath |publisher=Geological Society of London |pages=393–394 |isbn=978-1-897-79989-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Golden beryl'' can range in colors from pale yellow to a brilliant gold. Unlike [[emerald]], golden beryl generally has very few flaws. The term &quot;golden beryl&quot; is sometimes synonymous with ''heliodor'' (from Greek ''hēlios – ἥλιος'' &quot;sun&quot; + ''dōron – δῶρον'' &quot;gift&quot;) but golden beryl refers to pure yellow or golden yellow shades, while heliodor refers to the greenish-yellow shades.

Colorless beryl is called ''goshenite''. The name originates from [[Goshen, Massachusetts]], where it was originally discovered. In the past, goshenite was used for manufacturing eyeglasses and lenses owing to its transparency. Nowadays, it is most commonly used for gemstone purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.galleries.com/minerals/gemstone/goshenit/goshenit.htm| title = Goshenite, the colorless variety of beryl| accessdate = 2009-06-06| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090630132542/http://www.galleries.com/minerals/gemstone/goshenit/goshenit.htm| archivedate = 2009-06-30| publisher = Amethyst Galleries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://opticalmineralogy.com/the-silicates-mineral-class/goshenite-gem/| title = Goshenite Gem| date = March 2, 2009| website = Optical Mineralogy.Com| accessdate = 2009-06-06| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090709230558/http://opticalmineralogy.com/the-silicates-mineral-class/goshenite-gem/| archivedate = 2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gem value of goshenite is relatively low. However, goshenite can be colored yellow, green, pink, blue and in intermediate colors by irradiating it with high-energy particles. The resulting color depends on the content of Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Fe, and Co impurities.&lt;ref name=ibragim/&gt;

===Morganite===
[[File:Beryl-Quartz-morganite brazil1.jpg|thumb|left|Morganite]]
[[File:Morganit-G-EmpireTheWorldOfGems.jpg|thumb|right|Faceted morganite, 2.01 ct, Brazil]]
Morganite, also known as &quot;pink beryl&quot;, &quot;rose beryl&quot; &quot;pink emerald&quot; (which is not a legal term according to the new Federal Trade Commission Guidelines and Regulations), and &quot;cesian (or ''caesian'') beryl&quot;, is a rare light pink to rose-colored [[Gemstone|gem]]-quality variety of beryl. Orange/yellow varieties of morganite can also be found, and color banding is common. It can be routinely heat treated to remove patches of yellow and is occasionally treated by irradiation to improve its color. The pink color of morganite is attributed to Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=color/&gt;
 
Pink beryl of fine color and good sizes was first discovered on an island off the coast of Madagascar in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/12/06/102052382.pdf | work=The New York Times | title=Gem Named for Morgan; Newly Discovered Pink Beryl Is to be Known as Morganite | date=1910-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known, with other gemstone minerals, such as [[tourmaline]] and [[kunzite]], at [[Pala, California]]. In December 1910, the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] named the pink variety of beryl &quot;morganite&quot; after financier [[J. P. Morgan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;
 
On October 7, 1989, one of the largest gem morganite specimens ever uncovered, eventually called &quot;The Rose of Maine&quot;, was found at the Bennett Quarry in Buckfield, [[Maine]], US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/EcoNatRes/EcoNatRes-idx?type=turn&amp;id=EcoNatRes.MinYB1990v2&amp;entity=EcoNatRes.MinYB1990v2.p0245&amp;isize=text 237] |publisher=US Bureau of Mines |title=Minerals yearbook 1990 |year=1990 |volume=2 |last1=Harrison |first1=Donald K. |last2=Anderson |first2=Walter |last3=Foley |first3=Michael E. |chapter=The Mineral Industry of Maine |isbn=978-0-160-38183-6 |url-status=live |chapter-url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/EcoNatRes/EFacs2/MineralsYearBk/MinYB1990v2/reference/econatres.minyb1990v2.dharrison3.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427015434/http://images.library.wisc.edu/EcoNatRes/EFacs2/MineralsYearBk/MinYB1990v2/reference/econatres.minyb1990v2.dharrison3.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crystal, originally somewhat orange in hue, was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} long and about {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} across, and weighed (along with its matrix) just over {{convert|50|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=October 6, 2005 |publisher=Maine Geological Survey |url=http://maine.gov/doc/nrimc/mgs/explore/minerals/guide/chapter5/bennett-3.htm |title=The Rose of Maine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710012613/http://maine.gov/doc/nrimc/mgs/explore/minerals/guide/chapter5/bennett-3.htm |archive-date=2009-07-10 }} Image of &quot;The Rose of Maine&quot; at the site of its discovery.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red beryl===
[[File:Beryl-235618.jpg|thumb|left|Red beryl]]
Red beryl (formerly known as &quot;bixbite&quot; and marketed as &quot;red emerald&quot; or &quot;scarlet emerald&quot; but note that both latter terms involving &quot;Emerald&quot; terminology are now prohibited in the United States under Federal Trade Commission Regulations) is a red variety of beryl. It was first described in 1904 for an occurrence, its [[Type locality (geology)|type locality]], at Maynard's Claim (Pismire Knolls), Thomas Range, [[Juab County, Utah|Juab County]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=Mindat690&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/min-690.html|title=Red Beryl |website=www.mindat.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203010036/http://www.mindat.org/min-690.html |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ege/&gt; The old synonym &quot;bixbite&quot; is deprecated from the [[World Jewellery Confederation|CIBJO]], because of the risk of confusion with the mineral [[bixbyite]] (both were named after the mineralogist [[Maynard Bixby]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.minerals.net/mineral/beryl.aspx |title=The Mineral Beryl |website=Minerals.net |access-date=2017-08-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828185252/http://www.minerals.net/mineral/beryl.aspx |archivedate=2017-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dark red color is attributed to Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions.&lt;ref name=color/&gt;

Red beryl is very rare and has been reported only from a handful of locations: [[Wah Wah Mountains]], [[Beaver County, Utah]]; [[Black Range|Paramount Canyon]] and [[Black Range|Round Mountain]], [[Sierra County, New Mexico]], although the latter locality does not often produce gem grade stones;&lt;ref name=Mindat690/&gt; and Juab County, Utah. The greatest concentration of gem-grade red beryl comes from the Ruby-Violet Claim in the Wah Wah Mountains of mid-western Utah, discovered in 1958 by Lamar Hodges, of [[Fillmore, Utah]], while he was prospecting for [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Red Emerald History | url=http://www.redemerald.com/history.html | website=Red Emerald.Com | accessdate=2007-11-21 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203052138/http://www.redemerald.com/history.html | archivedate=2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red beryl has been known to be confused with [[pezzottaite]], a [[caesium]] analog of beryl, that has been found in Madagascar and more recently Afghanistan; cut gems of the two varieties can be distinguished from their difference in [[refractive index]], and rough crystals can be easily distinguished by differing crystal systems (pezzottaite trigonal, red beryl hexagonal). Synthetic red beryl is also produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gemstoneslist.com/bixbite.html |title=Bixbite |website=The Gemstone List |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312090712/http://www.gemstoneslist.com/bixbite.html |archivedate=2016-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like emerald and unlike most other varieties of beryl, red beryl is usually highly included.

While gem beryls are ordinarily found in pegmatites and certain metamorphic stones, red beryl occurs in topaz-bearing [[rhyolite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gemsociety.org/article/red-beryl-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |title=Red Beryl Value, Price, And Jewelry Information |publisher=International Gem Society |access-date=2017-08-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828192834/https://www.gemsociety.org/article/red-beryl-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |archivedate=2017-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is formed by crystallizing under low pressure and high temperature from a pneumatolytic phase along fractures or within near-surface [[miarolitic cavities]] of the rhyolite. Associated minerals include bixbyite, [[quartz]], [[orthoclase]], [[topaz]], [[spessartine]], [[pseudobrookite]] and [[hematite]].&lt;ref name=Ege&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Survey Notes |volume=34 |issue=3 |date=September 2002 |url=http://geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/gladasked/gladberyl.htm |title=What gemstone is found in Utah that is rarer than diamond and more valuable than gold? |first=Carl |last=Ege |accessdate=2011-07-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108170752/http://www.geology.utah.gov/surveynotes/gladasked/gladberyl.htm |archivedate=2010-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
