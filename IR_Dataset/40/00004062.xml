      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bilskirnir''' ([[Old Norse]] &quot;lightning-crack&quot;&lt;ref name=ORCHARD20&gt;Orchard (1997:20).&lt;/ref&gt;) is the hall of the god [[Thor]] in [[Norse mythology]]. Here he lives with his wife [[Sif]] and their children. According to ''[[Grímnismál]]'', the hall is the greatest of buildings and contains 540 rooms, located in [[Asgard]], as are all the dwellings of the [[Æsir|gods]], in the kingdom of [[Þrúðheimr]] (or [[Þrúðvangar]] according to ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' and ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'').

==Modern influence==
*The hall inspired the name of an [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] [[starship]] commanded by [[Thor (Stargate)|Supreme Commander Thor]], in the television series [[Stargate SG-1]] named Beliskner.
*There is a [[National Socialist black metal|NS]] / [[pagan black metal]]  band from [[Hesse]], [[Germany]] named Bilskirnir.
