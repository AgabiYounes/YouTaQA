This is a '''list of the Byzantine emperors''' from the foundation of [[Constantinople]] in 330 AD, which marks the conventional start of the [[Byzantine Empire]] (or the Eastern Roman Empire), to [[Fall of Constantinople|its fall]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453 AD. Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors (''symbasileis'') who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the [[List of Byzantine usurpers|various usurpers or rebels]] who claimed the imperial title.

Traditionally, the line of Byzantine emperors is held to begin with the [[Roman emperor|Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of [[Byzantium]] as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later emperors as the model ruler. It was under Constantine that the major characteristics of what is considered the Byzantine state emerged: a Roman polity centered at Constantinople and culturally dominated by the [[Greek East and Latin West|Greek East]], with Christianity as the [[state religion]].

The Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the [[Roman Empire]] following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. Emperors listed below up to [[Theodosius I]] in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The [[Western Roman Empire]] continued until 476. Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be rightful Roman emperors in direct succession from [[Augustus]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hooker |first=Richard |title=European Middle Ages: The Byzantine Empire |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/BYZ.HTM |url-status=dead |date=1 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990224072609/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MA/BYZ.HTM |archive-date=24 February 1999 |website=[[Washington State University]] |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term &quot;Byzantine&quot; was coined by Western [[historiography]] only in the 16th century. The use of the title &quot;Roman Emperor&quot; by those ruling from Constantinople was not contested until after the [[Pope|Papal]] coronation of the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Charlemagne]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (25 December 800 AD), done partly in response to the Byzantine coronation of [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]], whose claim, as a woman, was not recognized by [[Pope Leo III]].

The [[Style (manner of address)|title]] of all Emperors preceding [[Heraclius]] was officially &quot;''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''&quot;, although other titles such as ''[[Dominus (title)|Dominus]]'' were also used.  Their names were preceded by ''[[Imperator]] [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and followed by ''Augustus''. Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'' (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant [[Monarch|sovereign]], though ''Augustus'' continued to be used in a reduced capacity. Following the establishment of the rival [[Holy Roman Empire]] in Western Europe, the title &quot;''[[Autokrator]]''&quot; (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the &quot;Emperor of the Greeks&quot;. Towards the end of the Empire, the standard imperial formula of the Byzantine ruler was &quot;[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans&quot; (cf. [[Names of the Greeks#Romans (Ῥωμαῖοι)|Ῥωμαῖοι]] and [[Rûm]]). When on occasion rendering their names and titles in Latin in the centuries following the adoption of ''Basileus'' and Greek language, Byzantine rulers used ''Imperator'' for senior emperors and ''[[Rex (title)|Rex]]'' for junior emperors, as seen in coins of [[Michael III]] and his junior emperor [[Basil I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In the medieval period, [[dynasty|dynasties]] were common, but the principle of [[hereditary succession]] was never formalized in the Empire,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;p. 183, Karayannopoulous, Yanis, &quot;State Organization, Social Structure, Economy, and Commerce,&quot; ''History of Humanity – Scientific and Cultural Development from the Seventh to the Sixteenth Centuries, Vol. IV,'' M. A. Al-Bakhit, L. Bazin, S. M. Cissoko and M. S. Asimov, Editors, UNESCO, Paris (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and hereditary succession was a custom rather than an inviolable principle.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated72&quot;/&gt;

In 324, he defeated the eastern ''Augustus'' [[Licinius]] and re-united the empire under his rule, reigning as sole emperor until his death. Constantine completed the administrative and military reforms begun under [[Diocletian]], who had begun ushering in the [[Dominate]] period. Actively interested in Christianity, he played a crucial role in its development and the Christianization of the Roman world, through his convocation of the [[First Ecumenical Council]] at [[Nicaea]]. He is said to have received baptism on his deathbed. He also reformed coinage through the introduction of the gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'', and initiated a large-scale building program, crowned by the re-foundation the city of [[Byzantium]] as &quot;New Rome&quot;, popularly known as [[Constantinople]]. He was regarded as the model of all subsequent Byzantine emperors.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Morrisson, Cécile (2013) &quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-UuoDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT78&amp;lpg=PT78&amp;dq=michael+imperator+basilius+rex&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ugqyv_kYSI&amp;sig=YsWFJnoB40jtiTpyksaMDp5w7DI&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=michael%20imperator%20basilius%20rex&amp;f=false Displaying the Emperor's Authority and Kharaktèr on the Marketplace]&quot; in Armstrong, Pamela.

He was the first emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of Constantinople. His reign was marked by the pacification of the Danube frontier and peace with Persia, which allowed him to intervene in the affairs of the [[Western Roman Empire|western empire]], supporting candidates for the throne and dispatching an [[Battle of Cape Bon (468)|expedition]] to recover [[Carthage]] from the [[Vandals]] in 468. Initially a puppet of Aspar, Leo began promoting the [[Isaurians]] as a counterweight to Aspar's Goths, marrying his daughter [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]] to the Isaurian leader [[Tarasicodissa]] (Zeno). With their support, in 471 Aspar was murdered and Gothic power over the army was broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|last=Gregory|first=Timothy E.|last2=Cutler|first2=Anthony|title=Leo I|pages=1206–1207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named co-emperor by his son on 9 February 474, and became sole ruler upon the latter's death, but had to flee to his native country before [[Basiliscus]] in 475, regaining control of the capital in 476. Zeno concluded peace with the [[Vandals]], saw off challenges against him by [[Illus]] and [[Verina]], and secured peace in the [[Balkans]] by enticing the [[Ostrogoths]] under [[Theodoric the Great]] to migrate to Italy. Zeno's reign also saw the end of the [[Western Roman Empire|western line of emperors]]. His pro-[[Monophysite]] stance made him unpopular and his promulgation of the [[Henotikon]] resulted in the [[Acacian Schism]] with the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB|last=Gregory|first=Timothy E.|title=Zeno|page=2223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anastasius reformed the tax system and the [[Byzantine coinage]] and proved a frugal ruler, so that by the end of his reign he left a substantial surplus.
