      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[Norse mythology]], '''Breiðablik'''&lt;ref&gt;The name can be Anglicized as '''Breidablik''', '''Breithablik''' or '''Breidhablik'''.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Broad-gleaming'') is the home of [[Baldr]]. It is briefly described in [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''Gylfaginning'' as one of the halls of [[Asgard]]:

:&quot;Then there is also in that place the abode called Breidablik, and there is not in heaven a fairer dwelling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Gylfaginning'' XVII, Brodeur's translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the work, when Snorri describes Baldr, he gives a longer description, citing ''[[Grímnismál]]'', though he does not name the poem:

:&quot;He dwells in the place called Breidablik, which is in heaven; in that place may nothing unclean be, even as is said here:

::Breidablik 't is called, | where Baldr has
:::A hall made for himself:
::In that land | where I know lie
:::Fewest baneful [[runes]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Gylfaginning'' XXII, Brodeur's translation. The strophe is ''Grímnismál'' 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breiðablik is not otherwise mentioned in the Eddic sources.
