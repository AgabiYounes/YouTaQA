In  [[Folklore of the United States|North American folklore]], '''Bigfoot''' or '''Sasquatch''' are said to be hairy, upright-walking, [[ape]]-like creatures that dwell in the wilderness and leave footprints. Depictions often portray them as a missing link between humans and [[Hominidae|human ancestors or other great apes]]. They are strongly associated with the [[Pacific Northwest]] (particularly [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[British Columbia]]), [[Northern California]], and individuals claim to see the creatures across [[North America]]. Over the years, these creatures have inspired numerous commercial ventures and hoaxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ENCYCLOPEDIA-OF-AMERICAN-FOLKLORE-39&quot;&gt;Watts, Linda S. &quot;Bigfoot&quot;. 2007. ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', p. 39. Facts on File. {{ISBN|1438129793}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plural nouns 'Bigfoots' and 'Bigfeet' are both in use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigfoot Merriam-Webster Dictionary - Bigfoot]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Folkloristics|Folklorists]] trace the figure of Bigfoot to a combination of factors and sources, including folklore surrounding the European [[wild man]] figure, folk belief among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[Lumberjack|loggers]], and a cultural increase in [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMERICAN-FOLKLORE-AN-ENCYCLOPEDIA-158-159&quot;&gt;Walls, Robert E. 1996. &quot;Bigfoot&quot; in Brunvand, Jan Harold (editor). ''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia'', p. 158-159. Garland Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of scientists have historically discounted the existence of Bigfoot, considering it to be a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, rather than living animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tracking key trends in biodiversity science and policy: based on the proceedings of a UNESCO International Conference on Biodiversity Science and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkvFDkFzcC8C&amp;pg=PA50|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-001118-5|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Regal2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=B.

==Description==
[[File:Pikes Peak Bigfoot P4160515.jpg|thumb|&quot;Bigfoot&quot; carving at the [[Crystal Creek Reservoir]]]]
People who claim to have seen it describe Bigfoot as large, muscular, bipedal ape-like creatures, roughly {{convert|6|-|9|ft}} tall, covered in hair described as black, dark brown, or dark reddish.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/bigfoot.html|title=Bigfoot [a.k.a.

==History==
According to [[David Daegling]], the legends predate the name &quot;Bigfoot&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dae04_p28&quot;&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; They differ in their details both regionally and between families in the same community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dae04_p28&quot; /&gt;

Ecologist [[Robert Michael Pyle|Robert Pyle]] says that most cultures have accounts of human-like giants in their folk history, expressing a need for &quot;some larger-than-life creature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodavage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodavage |first=Maria |title=Hunt for Bigfoot Attracts True Believers |publisher=USA TODAY/bz050 |date=May 24, 1996 |url=http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/HomePage.usatbf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each language had its own name for the creatures featured in the local version of such legends. Many names meant something along the lines of &quot;wild man&quot; or &quot;hairy man&quot;, although other names described common actions that it was said to perform, such as eating [[clam]]s or shaking trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mil07&quot; /&gt;  Chief Mischelle of the [[Nlaka'pamux]] at [[Lytton, British Columbia]] told such a story to [[Charles Hill-Tout]] in 1898; he named the creature by a [[Salishan]] variant meaning &quot;the benign-faced-one&quot;.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Members of the [[Lummi]] tell tales about ''Ts'emekwes'', the local version of Bigfoot. The stories are similar to each other in the general descriptions of ''Ts'emekwes'', but details differed among various family accounts concerning the creatures' diet and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rasmus|first1=Stacy M.|title=Repatriating Words: Local Knowledge in a Global Context|journal=[[American Indian Quarterly]]|date=2002|volume=26|issue=2|pages=286–307|doi=10.1353/aiq.2003.0018|jstor=4128463}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regional versions tell of more threatening creatures. The ''stiyaha'' or ''kwi-kwiyai'' were a nocturnal race. Children were warned against saying the names, lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a person, sometimes to be killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rigsby&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Rigsby |first=Bruce |title=Some Pacific Northwest Native Language Names for the Sasquatch Phenomenon |publisher=Bigfoot: Fact or Fantasy? |url=http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/papers/rigsby.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205183546/http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/papers/rigsby.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847 Paul Kane reported stories by the Indians about ''[[Skookum#Monsters|skoocooms]]'', a race of [[cannibalistic]] wildmen living on the peak of [[Mount St. Helens]] in southern Washington state.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;

Less-menacing versions have also been recorded, such as one in 1840 by [[Elkanah Walker]], a Protestant missionary who recorded stories of giants among the Indians living near [[Spokane, Washington]]. The Indians said that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole [[salmon]] from the fishermen's nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/walker.htm |title=The Diary of Elkanah Walker |publisher=Bigfoot Encounters |accessdate=August 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, Indian Agent J. W. Burns compiled local stories and published them in a series of Canadian newspaper articles. They were accounts told to him by the [[Sts'Ailes people]] of [[Chehalis, British Columbia|Chehalis]] and others. The Sts'Ailes and other regional tribes maintained that the Sasquatch were real. They were offended by people telling them that the figures were legendary. According to Sts'Ailes accounts, the Sasquatch preferred to avoid white men and spoke the [[Lillooet language]] of the people at [[Port Douglas, British Columbia]] at the head of [[Harrison Lake]]. These accounts were published again in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/legends/jwburns.htm|title=Hairy Giants of BC -J W Burns Bigfoot Sasquatch|website=www.bigfootencounters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/jwburns2.htm|title=Bigfoot: J.W. Burns says &quot;Shouldn't be Captured...&quot; 1957|website=www.bigfootencounters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns borrowed the term Sasquatch from the [[Halkomelem]] ''sásq'ets'' ({{IPA-sal|ˈsæsqʼəts|IPA}})&lt;ref name=&quot;Bright&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright|first=William|authorlink=William Bright|title=Native American Place names of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=November 10, 2014|year=2004|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|isbn=978-0-8061-3598-4|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used it in his articles to describe a hypothetical single type of creature portrayed in the local stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mil07&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Meldrum |first=Jeff |title=Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007|page=50 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ggeQHFa5E7AC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=salish%20sasquatch#v=onepage&amp;q=salish%20sasquatch |accessdate=February 19, 2010 |isbn=978-0-7653-1217-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sasquatch |title=Sasquatch |accessdate=August 7, 2007 |dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sightings==
About one-third of all claims of Bigfoot sightings are located in the [[Pacific Northwest]], with the remaining reports spread throughout the rest of North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ |title=Geographical Database of Bigfoot/Sasquatch Sightings and Reports |publisher=Bigfoot Field Research Organization |accessdate=August 19, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080819051923/http://bfro.net/GDB/| archivedate= August 19, 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Car08_p118&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;Car08&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cartmill |first=Matt |title=Bigfoot Exposed: An Anthropologist Examines America's Enduring Legend/Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=135 |issue=1 |page=118 |date=January 2008 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.20691 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bigfoot has become better known and [[Bigfoot in popular culture|a phenomenon in popular culture]], and sightings have spread throughout North America. Rural areas of the [[Great Lakes region]] and the [[Southeastern United States]] have been sources of numerous reports of Bigfoot sightings, in addition to the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ |title=Geographical Database of Bigfoot/Sasquatch Sightings &amp; Reports |publisher=Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization |accessdate=April 10, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228213753/http://www.bfro.net/GDB/| archivedate= February 28, 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Bigfoot Casebook'', authors Janet and Colin Bord, document the sightings from 1818 to 1980, listing over 1,000 sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unexplained Mysteries of the 20th Century|last=Bord|first=Janet and Colin|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=1989|isbn=0-8092-4113-7|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=[https://archive.org/details/unexplainedmyste00bord/page/26 26]|url=https://archive.org/details/unexplainedmyste00bord/page/26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate over the legitimacy of Bigfoot sightings reached a peak in the 1970s, and Bigfoot has been regarded as the first widely popularized example of [[pseudoscience]] in American culture,&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeod 2009 4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Anatomy of a Beast: Obsession and Myth on the Trail of Bigfoot|last=McLeod|first=Michael|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-25571-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6FmjJYd13wC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|year=2009|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; so much so that, according to an [[Associated Press]] 2014 poll, more Americans believe in Bigfoot than the [[Big Bang]] Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=The enthusiastic life of a happy skeptic |url=https://voicesofmontereybay.org/2018/08/23/the-enthusiastic-life-of-a-happy-skeptic/ |website=Voices of Monterey Bay |accessdate=23 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed explanations for sightings==
Various explanations have been suggested for the sightings and to offer conjecture on what type of creature Bigfoot might be. Some scientists typically attribute sightings either to hoaxes or to misidentification of known animals and their tracks, particularly [[American black bear|black bears]].&lt;ref name=Holmes2009&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holmes|first1=Bob|title=Bigfoot's likely haunts 'revealed'|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17415-bigfoots-likely-haunts-revealed/|website=New Scientist|accessdate=2 January 2016|date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misidentification===
[[File:Croped BFRO image.jpg|thumb|A 2007 photo of an unidentified animal that the Bigfoot Field Research Organization claims is a &quot;juvenile Sasquatch&quot;&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfro.net/avevid/jacobs/jacobs_photos.asp|title= Jacobs Photos |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 2007 the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization put forward some photos which they claimed showed a juvenile Bigfoot. The [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]], however, said that the photos were of a bear with [[mange]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ap_bigfoot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490638/Is-Bigfoot---bear-bad-skin.html|title=Is this Bigfoot ... or is it a bear with bad skin?|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21518056 |title=Hunter's pics revive lively Bigfoot debate |publisher=NBC News |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, anthropologist [[Jeffrey Meldrum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gimletmedia.com/episode/bigfoot/|title=Bigfoot - Science Vs by Gimlet Media|website=gimletmedia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180110173258/https://gimletmedia.com/episode/bigfoot/|archive-date=January 10, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ohio scientist Jason Jarvis said that the limb proportions of the creature were not bear-like, they were &quot;more like a chimpanzee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthfiles333.com/earthfiles/Episode27mp3.html |title=Young Sasquatch?

===Hoaxes===
Both Bigfoot believers and non-believers agree that many of the reported sightings are hoaxes or misidentified animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Radford&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bigfoot_at_50_evaluating_a_half-century_of_bigfoot_evidence |title=Bigfoot at 50 Evaluating a Half-Century of Bigfoot Evidence |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|date=March–April 2002|accessdate=August 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Jerome Clark argues that the [[Jacko hoax|Jacko Affair]] was a hoax, involving an 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured in British Columbia. He cites research by John Green, who found that several contemporaneous British Columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as highly dubious, and notes that the ''Mainland Guardian'' of [[New Westminster]], [[British Columbia]] wrote, &quot;Absurdity is written on the face of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=[https://archive.org/details/unexplained347st00clar/page/195 195] |last=Clark |first=Jerome |title=Unexplained! 347 Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences and Puzzling Physical Phenomena |publisher=Visible Ink |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-8103-9436-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/unexplained347st00clar/page/195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Biscardi]] is a long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and CEO of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. He appeared on the ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' [[paranormal]] radio show on July 14, 2005 and said that he was &quot;98% sure that his group will be able to capture a Bigfoot which they had been tracking in the [[Happy Camp, California]] area.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biscardi_C2C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oregonbigfoot.com/georgia_bigfoot_dead_body_in_freezer_dyer_whitton_biscardi.php |title= Georgia Bigfoot body in freezer |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, he announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured Bigfoot and was arranging a [[pay-per-view]] event for people to see it. He appeared on ''Coast to Coast AM'' again a few days later to announce that there was no captive Bigfoot. He blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him, and said that the show's audience was gullible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biscardi_C2C&quot; /&gt;

On July 9, 2008, [[Rick Dyer (Bigfoot)|Rick Dyer]] and Matthew Whitton posted a video to [[YouTube]], claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate. Dyer and Whitton received [[US$]]50,000 from Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. as a [[good faith]] gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/search/content/metro/clayton/stories/2008/08/20/bigfoot_hoax_lawsuit.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206031312/http://www.ajc.com/search/content/metro/clayton/stories/2008/08/20/bigfoot_hoax_lawsuit.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 6, 2008 |title=Searching for Bigfoot group to sue Georgia hoaxers |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=August 20, 2008 |first=Christian |last=Boone |author2=Kathy Jefcoats |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was covered by many major news networks, including [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7564635.stm | work=BBC News | title=Americans 'find body of Bigfoot' | date=August 15, 2008 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/bigfoot.body/ |title= Body proves Bigfoot no myth, hunters say | work=CNN |date=August 15, 2008 | accessdate=March 31, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100318004729/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/bigfoot.body/| archivedate= March 18, 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://a.abcnews.com/Technology/story?id=5590180 |title= Legend of Bigfoot: Discovery or Hoax? |work=ABC News |date=August 15, 2008 |author= Ki Mae Heusser |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Aug16/0,4670,BigfootClaim,00.html |title= Georgia men claim hairy, frozen corpse is Bigfoot |date=September 16, 2008 |first= Malia |last= Wollan |accessdate=April 1, 2010 | work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after a press conference, the alleged Bigfoot body was delivered in a block of ice in a freezer with the Searching for Bigfoot team.

In January 2014, Rick Dyer, perpetrator of a previous Bigfoot hoax, said that he had killed a Bigfoot creature in September 2012 outside San Antonio, Texas.

===''Gigantopithecus''===
[[File:Gigantopithecus blacki mandible 010112.jpg|thumb|Fossil jaw of the extinct primate ''Gigantopithecus blacki'']]
Bigfoot proponents [[Grover Krantz]] and [[Geoffrey H. Bourne]] believed that Bigfoot could be a [[relict (biology)|relict population]] of ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''. All ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils were found in Asia, but according to Bourne, many species of animals migrated across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] and he suggested that ''Gigantopithecus'' might have done so, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gentle Giants: The Gorilla Story |last=Bourne |first=Geoffrey H. |author2=Cohen, Maury |year=1975 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=978-0-399-11528-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/gentlegiantsg00bour/page/296 296] |url=https://archive.org/details/gentlegiantsg00bour/page/296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils have not been found in the Americas. The only recovered fossils are of [[mandible]]s and teeth, leaving uncertainty about ''Gigantopithecus'''s locomotion. Krantz has argued that ''Gigantopithecus blacki'' could have been bipedal, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible. However, the relevant part of the mandible is not present in any fossils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]]; its enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

[[Matt Cartmill]] criticizes the ''Gigantopithecus'' hypothesis:

{{quote|The trouble with this account is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was not a hominin and maybe not even a [[crown group]] hominoid; yet the physical evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted [[hallux]]. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that ''Gigantopithecus'' would have evolved these uniquely [[hominini|hominin]] traits in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car08|Cartmill 2008]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bernard G. Campbell writes: &quot;That ''Gigantopithecus'' is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the Yeti of the Himalayas and the Sasquatch of the north-west American coast. But the evidence for these creatures is not convincing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Humankind Emerging |last=Campbell |first=Bernard G.|year=1979 |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |id=Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 78-78234 |page=100 |isbn=978-0-673-52170-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinct hominines===
[[Primatology|Primatologist]] [[John R. Napier]] and anthropologist Gordon Strasenburg have suggested a species of ''[[Paranthropus]]'' as a possible candidate for Bigfoot's identity, such as ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'', with its gorilla-like crested skull and bipedal gait&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm |title=Scientific Names for Bigfoot |last=Coleman |first=Loren |publisher=BFRO |accessdate=August 19, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080909091922/http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm| archivedate= September 9, 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; —despite the fact that fossils of ''Paranthropus'' are found only in Africa.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Michael Rugg of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum presented a comparison between human, ''Gigantopithecus,'' and ''[[Meganthropus]]'' skulls (reconstructions made by [[Grover Krantz]]) in episodes 131 and 132 of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php |title=Bigfoot Discovery Project Media |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419030214/http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php |archivedate=April 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He favorably compares a modern tooth suspected of coming from a Bigfoot to the ''Meganthropus'' fossil teeth, noting the worn enamel on the [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] surface.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The ''Meganthropus'' fossils originated from Asia, and the tooth was found near Santa Cruz, California.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Some suggest [[Neanderthal]], ''[[Homo erectus]]'', or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' to be the creature, but no remains of any of those species have been found in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific view==
[[File:Pie Grande.jpg|thumb|Artist representation of a Bigfoot]]

===Recognition===
Scientists do not consider the subject of Bigfoot to be a fertile area for credible science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A84nAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22in%20this%20case%20demonstrates%22|title=Intelligent design: William A. Dembski &amp; Michael Ruse in dialogue|author=Robert B. Stewart|page=83|isbn=9780800662189|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been a limited number of formal scientific studies of Bigfoot.

Evidence such as the 1967 [[Patterson–Gimlin film]] has provided &quot;no supportive data of any scientific value&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3z5VVbGfbgC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=pyle+bigfoot+-inauthor:pyle#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific|title=Bigfoot exposed: an anthropologist examines America's enduring legend|author=[[David Daegling|David J. Daegling]]|isbn=9780759105393|date=October 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Great apes have not been found in the fossil record in the Americas, and no Bigfoot remains are known to have been found. Phillips Stevens, a [[cultural anthropologist]] at the [[University at Buffalo]], summarized the scientific consensus as follows:

{{quote|text=It defies all logic that there is a population of these things sufficient to keep them going. What it takes to maintain any species, especially a long-lived species, is you gotta have a breeding population. That requires a substantial number, spread out over a fairly wide area where they can find sufficient food and shelter to keep hidden from all the investigators.&lt;ref name=&quot;breedingpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html |title= Bigfoot hunting |author= Earls, Stephanie |accessdate= January 2, 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100129061319/http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html |archivedate= January 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1970s, when Bigfoot &quot;experts&quot; were frequently given high-profile media coverage, Mcleod writes that the scientific community generally avoided lending credence to the theories by debating them.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeod 2009 4&quot;/&gt;

===Formal studies===

The first scientific study of available evidence was conducted by John Napier and published in his book, ''Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality,'' in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Napier, John. ''Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality.'' 1973, {{ISBN|0-525-06658-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napier wrote that if a conclusion is to be reached based on scant extant &quot;'hard' evidence,&quot; science must declare &quot;Bigfoot does not exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Napier, 197&lt;/ref&gt; However, he found it difficult to entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, &quot;scattered over 125,000 square miles&quot; (325,000&amp;nbsp;km²) or to dismiss all &quot;the many hundreds&quot; of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, &quot;I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is cracked up to be is another matter altogether. There must be ''something'' in north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Napier, 205&lt;/ref&gt; However, anthropologists such as [[George Gaylord Simpson]] rejected Napier's conclusion noting that much of the data cited by Napier were hoaxes and since his book had been published, no evidence for Bigfoot was found.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord (1984). ''Mammals and Cryptozoology''. ''[[Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society]]'' 128 (1): 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] funded a field study seeking Bigfoot evidence. No formal federation members were involved and the study made no notable discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, Geoffrey H, ''The Gentle Giants: The Gorilla Story'' 1975, {{ISBN|0-399-11528-5}}, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Few qualified anthropologists have written on the subject. The few that did have included [[Grover Krantz]], [[Carleton S. Coon]], George Allen Agogino and [[William Charles Osman Hill]], although they came to no definite conclusions and later drifted from this research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Regal2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Regal |first=Brian |date=June 2008 |title=Amateur versus professional: the search for Bigfoot |journal=Endeavour |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=53–7 |doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2008.04.005 |url=http://www.kean.edu/~bregal/docs/Bigfoot%20article.Endeavour.pdf |accessdate=September 11, 2009 |pmid=18514914 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528021504/http://www.kean.edu/~bregal/docs/Bigfoot%20article.Endeavour.pdf |archivedate=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 1970s, physical anthropologist [[Grover Krantz]] published several articles and four book-length treatments of Sasquatch. However, his work was found to contain multiple scientific failings including falling for hoaxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buhs|first=Joshua Blu|title=Bigfoot: The Life and Times of a Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RI4SlHwH7h0C&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=November 10, 2014|date=August 1, 2009|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-50215-1|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''[[Journal of Biogeography]]'' in 2009 by J.D. Lozier et al. used ecological niche modeling on reported sightings of Bigfoot, using their locations to infer Bigfoot's preferred ecological parameters. They found a very close match with the ecological parameters of the [[American black bear]], ''Ursus americanus''. They also note that an upright bear looks much like Bigfoot's purported appearance and consider it highly improbable that two species should have very similar ecological preferences, concluding that Bigfoot sightings are likely sightings of black bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lozier2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozier|first1=J.

In the first systematic genetic analysis of 30 hair samples that were suspected to be from Bigfoot, yeti, sasquatch, almasty or other anomalous primates, only one was found to be primate in origin, and that was identified as human. A joint study by the [[University of Oxford]] and [[Musée Cantonal de Zoologie|Lausanne's Cantonal Museum of Zoology]] and published in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]'' in 2014, the team used a previously published cleaning method to remove all surface contamination and the [[ribosomal]] [[mitochondrial DNA]] 12S fragment of the sample was sequenced and then compared to [[GenBank]] to identify the species origin. The samples submitted were from different parts of the world, including the United States, Russia, the Himalayas, and Sumatra. Other than one sample of human origin, all but two are from common animals. Black and brown bear accounted for most of the samples, other animals include cow, horse, dog/wolf/coyote, sheep, goat, raccoon, porcupine, deer and tapir. The last two samples were thought to match a fossilized genetic sample of a 40,000 year old polar bear of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sykes |first1=B |last2=Mullis |first2=R |last3=Hagenmuller |first3=C |last4=Melton |first4=T |last5=Sartori |first5=M |title=Genetic analysis of hair samples attributed to yeti, bigfoot and other anomalous primates |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=281 |issue=1789 |pages=20140161 |date=2 July 2014 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0161|pmid=24990672 |pmc=4100498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, a later study disputes this finding. In the second paper, tests identified the hairs as being from a rare type of brown bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Scientists challenge 'Abominable Snowman DNA' results |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-30479718 |author=Steven McKenzie |work=[[BBC News]] |date=December 17, 2014 |accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Yeti Debate Swirls: Study Reveals Origin of Mysterious Hairs |url=http://www.livescience.com/50148-yeti-genetics-questioned.html |author=Laura Geggel |publisher=[[Live Science]] |date=March 16, 2015 |accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bigfoot claims==

After what ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' described as &quot;a five-year study of purported Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) DNA samples&quot;,&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost&gt;{{cite news|last=Speigel|first=Lee|title=Bigfoot DNA Tests: Science Journal's Credibility Called Into Question|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/bigfoot-dna-results-final_n_2681135.html|date=February 14, 2013|work=Huffington Post|access-date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but prior to [[peer review]] of the work, DNA Diagnostics, a veterinary laboratory headed by [[veterinarian]] Melba Ketchum, issued a press release on November 24, 2012, claiming that they had found proof that the Sasquatch &quot;is a human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago as a hybrid cross of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' with an unknown primate species.&quot; Ketchum called for this to be recognized officially, saying that &quot;Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]al rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a 'license' to hunt, trap, or kill them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Eric|title=A Texas Geneticist Apparently Invented a Science Journal to Publish Her DNA Proof of Bigfoot |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2013/02/a_texas_geneticist_apparently.php |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |newspaper=Dallas Observer|date=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Ketchum registered the name ''[[Homo sapiens]] cognatus'' to be used for the reputed [[hominid]] more familiarly known as Bigfoot or Sasquatch with [[ZooBank]], a [[non-governmental organization]] adjunct to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN). According to Ari Grossman of Midwestern University, the lack of formal differential diagnosis, type specimen, or designated location of a type specimen to verify the organism named, leaves the registered name open to challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hill2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Sharon A. |title=Homo sapiens cognatus posited as new name for Bigfoot |url=https://doubtfulnews.com/2013/10/homo-sapiens-cognatus-posited-as-new-name-for-bigfoot/ |website=Doubtfulnews.com |publisher=Doubtful News |accessdate=19 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Failing to find a [[scientific journal]] that would publish their results, Ketchum announced on February 13, 2013, that their research had been published in the ''DeNovo Journal of Science''. ''The Huffington Post'' discovered that the journal's domain had been registered anonymously only nine days before the announcement. This was the only edition of ''DeNovo'' and was listed as Volume 1, Issue 1, with its only content being the Ketchum paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ketchum |first=M.

Shortly after publication, the paper was analyzed and outlined by [[Sharon A. Hill|Sharon Hill]] of [[Sharon A. Hill#Doubtful News|Doubtful News]] for the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]. Hill reported on the questionable journal, mismanaged DNA testing and poor quality paper, stating that &quot;The few experienced [[geneticists]] who viewed the paper reported a dismal opinion of it noting it made little sense.&quot;&lt;ref name=CFI&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Sharon|authorlink = Sharon A.

''[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]'' magazine also analyzed the paper, reporting that:

{{quote|text=Geneticists who have seen the paper are not impressed. &quot;To state the obvious, no data or analyses are presented that in any way support the claim that their samples come from a new primate or human-primate hybrid,&quot; Leonid Kruglyak of [[Princeton University]] told the [[Houston Chronicle]]. &quot;Instead, analyses either come back as 100 percent human, or fail in ways that suggest technical artifacts.&quot; The website for the DeNovo Journal of Science was setup {{sic}} on February 4, and there is no indication that Ketchum's work, the only study it has published, was peer reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cossins|first1=Dan|title=Bigfoot DNA is Bunk|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/34395/title/Bigfoot-DNA-is-Bunk/|website=[[The Scientist (magazine)|The Scientist]]|accessdate=8 February 2017|date=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Claims about the origins and characteristics of Bigfoot have crossed over with other paranormal claims, including that Bigfoot and [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] are related or that Bigfoot creatures are psychic or even completely supernatural. The evidence advanced supporting the existence of such a large, ape-like creature has often been attributed to hoaxes or delusion rather than to sightings of a genuine creature.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot; /&gt; In a 1996 ''[[USA Today]]'' article, Washington State zoologist John Crane said, &quot;There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material that's clearly been fabricated has ever been presented.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodavage&quot;/&gt; In addition, scientists cite the fact that Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized apes are found in the [[tropics]] of Africa and Asia.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Bigfoot organizations==
There are several organizations dedicated to the research and investigation of Bigfoot sightings in the United States. The oldest and largest is the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO).&lt;ref name=&quot;BFRO&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/finding-bigfoot/about-bigfoot/bigfoot-field-researchers-organization.htm | title=BFRO Animal Planet | publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC | accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BFRO also provides a free database to individuals and other organizations. Their website includes reports from across North America that have been investigated by researchers to determine credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bigfoot!:The True Story of Apes in America |last=Coleman |first=Loren |year=2003 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=233|isbn=978-1439187784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the University of New Mexico at Gallup held a two-day Bigfoot conference, at a cost of $7,000 in university funds.&lt;ref&gt;Fernanda Zamudio-Suaréz, &quot;U. of New Mexico at Gallup Spent $7,000 on Bigfoot Conference&quot; ''Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; Nov.3, 2016 [http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/u-of-new-mexico-at-gallup-spent-7000-on-bigfoot-conference/115378?elqTrackId=d5e577627ee44a4abb2917643d0e3c64&amp;elq=7618b7229fe446da93239e9f28ebb5f8&amp;elqaid=11364&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=4421]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Bigfoot has had a demonstrable impact as a [[popular culture]] phenomenon.

When asked for her opinion of Bigfoot in a September 27, 2002, interview on [[National Public Radio]]'s &quot;[[Science Friday]]&quot;, [[Jane Goodall]] said &quot;I'm sure they exist&quot;, and later said, chuckling, &quot;Well, I'm a romantic, so I always wanted them to exist&quot;, and finally, &quot;You know, why isn't there a body?
