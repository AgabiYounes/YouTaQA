Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as &quot;[[Spaceship Earth]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dymaxion]]&quot; ([[dymaxion house|house]], [[dymaxion car|car]], [[dymaxion map|map]]...), [[ephemeralization]], [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetic]], and &quot;[[tensegrity]]&quot;. He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known [[geodesic dome]]. Carbon molecules known as [[fullerene]]s were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres.

== Life and work ==
[[File:BuckminsterFuller cropped.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Fuller in {{circa|1910}}]]

Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of [[Margaret Fuller]], an American journalist, critic, and [[women's rights]] advocate associated with the American [[transcendentalism]] movement. The unusual middle name, Buckminster, was an ancestral family name. As a child, Richard Buckminster Fuller tried numerous variations of his name. He used to sign his name differently each year in the guest register of his family summer vacation home at Bear Island, Maine. He finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work|last=Sieden|first=Steven|year=2000|isbn=978-0738203799|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller spent much of his youth on [[Bear Island (Maine)|Bear Island]], in [[Penobscot Bay]] off the coast of Maine. He attended [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}  He disagreed with the way [[geometry]] was taught in school, being unable to experience for himself that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented an &quot;empty&quot; mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that a line  could stretch off to [[infinity]]. To him these were illogical, and led to his work on synergetics. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the [[transom (nautical)|transom]] with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term &quot;invention&quot;.

Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a [[machinist]]'s certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade.&lt;ref name=pawley&gt;{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=Martin |title=Buckminster Fuller |location=New York |publisher=Taplinger |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8008-1116-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/buckminsterfulle00pawl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===

Fuller attended [[Milton Academy]] in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [[Harvard College]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]]. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a [[vaudeville]] troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his &quot;irresponsibility and lack of interest&quot;. By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt;

=== Wartime experience ===

Between his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile [[factory|mill]], and later as a laborer in the [[meat-packing]] industry. He also served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as commander of the [[crash rescue boat]] [[USS Inca (SP-1212)|USS ''Inca'']]. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the [[Stockade Building System]] for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately fail&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt; in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p84-85&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden |title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work |location=New York |publisher=[[Perseus Books Group]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7382-0379-9 |pages=84–85 |quote=However, in 1927 his own financial difficulties forced Mr. Hewlett to sell his stock in the company. Within weeks Stockade Building Systems became a subsidiary of Celotex Corporation, whose primary motivation was akin to that of other conventional companies: making a profit. Celotex management took one look at Stockade's financial records and called for a complete overhaul of the company. The first casualty of the transition was Stockade's controversial president [Buckminster Fuller, who was fired].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depression and epiphany ===

Buckminster Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. His daughter Alexandra had died in 1922 of complications from [[polio]] and [[spinal meningitis]]&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R. Buckminster, ''Your Private Sky'', p.27&lt;/ref&gt; just before her fourth birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-7382-0379-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford historian, Barry Katz, found signs that around this time in his life Fuller was suffering from depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/arts/music/15ster.html|title=The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller|newspaper=The New York Times|author=James Sterngold|date=June 15, 2008 |accessdate=January 24, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller dwelled on his daughter's death, suspecting that it was connected with the Fullers' damp and drafty living conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe&quot; /&gt; This provided motivation for Fuller's involvement in [[Stockade Building System|Stockade Building Systems]], a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe&quot; /&gt;

In 1927, at age 32, Fuller lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller drank heavily and reflected upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide by drowning in Lake Michigan, so that his family could benefit from a life insurance payment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p87&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-7382-0379-9 |page=87 |quote= ... during 1927, Bucky found himself unemployed with a new daughter to support as winter was approaching. With no steady income the Fuller family was living beyond its means and falling further and further into debt. Searching for solace and escape, Bucky continued drinking and carousing. He also tended to wander aimlessly through the Chicago streets pondering his situation. It was during one such walk that he ventured down to the shore of Lake Michigan on a particularly cold autumn evening and seriously contemplated swimming out until he was exhausted and ending his life.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:

{{quote|From now on you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth. You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to Universe. Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p87-88&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-7382-0379-9 |pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on &quot;an experiment, to find what a single individual could contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/automobiles/collectibles/15BUCKY.html |title=Design – A Three-Wheel Dream That Died at Takeoff – Buckminster Fuller and the Dymaxion Car |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 15, 2008 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would regularly recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe&quot; /&gt; Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's [[Chronofile]] archives, housed at [[Stanford University]]. Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed later in life, to summarize this formative period of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008-NYTimes-Fuller-Whitney-Museum-of-American-Art&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/arts/music/15ster.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Love Song of R.

=== Recovery ===

In 1927 Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to &quot;the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them ... finding ways of ''doing more with less'' to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more&quot;.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} By 1928, Fuller was living in [[Greenwich Village]] and spending much of his time at the popular café [[Romany Marie]]'s,&lt;ref name=&quot;HaberGlueck&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haberarts.com/fuller.htm |title= Before Buckyballs |author-link= John Haber |first=John |last= Haber |publisher= Review of [[Noguchi Museum]] Best of Friends exhibit (May 19, 2006 – October 15, 2006) |quote= [[Isamu Noguchi|Noguchi]], then twenty-five, had already had enough influences for a lifetime&amp;nbsp;— from birth in Los Angeles, to childhood in Japan and [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]], to premedical classes at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], to academic sculpture on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], to [[Brancusi's circle]] in Paris. Now his exposure to [[American Modernism|Modernism and &quot;the American century&quot;]] received a decidedly New York influence.&lt;br/&gt; &quot;Only two years before, on the brink of suicide, Fuller had decided to remake his life and the world. Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around [[Dymaxion house|his first major design]], plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others air-lift right where desired. Now, in exchange for meals, he took on the interior decoration and chairs for Marie's new location. He must have stood out in person, too, ever the talkative, handsome visionary in tie and starched collar.&quot; &lt;br/&gt; See also: {{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/19/arts/design/19nogu.html |title= The Architect and the Sculptor: A Friendship of Ideas |first= Grace |last=Glueck |authorlink=Grace Glueck |newspaper=The New York Times |date= May 19, 2006 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and [[Eugene O'Neill]] several years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p74&quot;&gt;Lloyd Steven Sieden.

=== Geodesic domes ===

Fuller taught at [[Black Mountain College]] in [[North Carolina]] during the summers of 1948 and 1949,&lt;ref name=&quot;ExhibitBMC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |title=IDEAS + INVENTIONS: Buckminster Fuller and Black Mountain College, July 15 – November 26, 2005 |work=Black Mountain College Museum and Arts Center |date=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115004344/http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |archivedate=January 15, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. Fuller had been shy and withdrawn, but he was persuaded to participate in a theatrical performance of [[Erik Satie|Erik Satie's]] [[Le piège de Méduse|The Ruse of Medusa]], put on by [[John Cage]], who was also teaching at Black Mountain.  During rehearsals, under the tutelage of [[Arthur Penn]], then a student at Black Mountain, Fuller broke through his inhibitions to become confident as a performer and speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Segaloff | first = Nat | title = Arthur Penn : American director | publisher = University Press of Kentucky | location = Lexington, Ky | year = 2011 | page = 27–28 | isbn = 0813129761 }} Available as a .pdf at https://epdf.pub/arthur-penn-american-director-screen-classics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At Black Mountain, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the [[geodesic dome]]. Although the geodesic dome had been created 26 years earlier by Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]], Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.

One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he lectured often. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was {{convert|4.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an [[icosahedron]]. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Within a few years, there were thousands of such domes around the world.

Fuller's first &quot;continuous tension – discontinuous compression&quot; geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dymaxion world of Buckminster Fuller |first1=Robert W. |last1=Marks |first2=R. Buckminster |last2=Fuller |location=Garden City, N.Y. |publisher=Anchor Books |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-385-01804-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members (no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were 'suspended' by the tensional members.

=== Dymaxion Chronofile ===
[[File:Dynamaxion 1933.jpg|right|thumb|220px|A 1933 Dymaxion prototype.]]

For half of a century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily [[diary]] (later called the ''[[Dymaxion Chronofile]]''), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the [[Dymaxion car]] project.

=== World stage ===

[[File:Preserved R Buckminster Fuller and Anne Hewlitt Dome Home.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[R. Buckminster Fuller and Anne Hewlett Dome Home|Fuller's home]] in Carbondale.]]

International recognition began with the success of huge [[geodesic dome]]s during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at [[North Carolina State University]] in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies.  [[Richard Lewontin]], a new faculty member in [[population genetics]] at [[North Carolina State University]], provided Fuller with computer calculations for the lengths of the domes' edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | author=Jerry Coyne and Steve Jones| title = 1994 Sewall Wright Award:  Richard C. Lewontin|  year = 1995| journal = The American Naturalist| volume = 146| issue = 1 | pages=front matter  |  jstor=2463033 | publisher = University of Chicago Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller began working with architect [[Shoji Sadao]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wrsc.org&quot;/&gt; in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller &amp; Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large [[geodesic dome]] for the [[Montreal Biosphere|U.S. Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wrsc.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wrsc.org/people/shoji-sadao |title=Shoji Sadao |work=World Resource Simulation Center |year=2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This building is now the &quot;[[Montreal Biosphère]]&quot;.
In 1962, the artist and searcher [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]] wrote the first monograph on Fuller, published by George Braziller in New York.

From 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (SIU). Beginning as an assistant professor, he gained full professorship in 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]]. In 1965, they inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the [[International Union of Architects]] in Paris, which was, in Fuller's own words, devoted to &quot;applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity&quot;. Later in his SIU tenure, Fuller was also a visiting professor at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville|SIU Edwardsville]], where he designed the dome for the campus Religious Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/center-spirituality-sustainability.shtml |title=The Center for Spirituality &amp; Sustainability |publisher=Siue.edu |accessdate=October 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313014223/http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/center-spirituality-sustainability.shtml |archive-date=March 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of &quot;omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity&quot;. Fuller referred to himself as &quot;the property of universe&quot; and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work &quot;the property of all humanity&quot;. For his lifetime of work, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.

In 1976, Fuller was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements.

=== Death ===
[[File:Bucky TRIMTAB.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Gravestone (see [[Trim tab#Trim tab as a metaphor|trim tab]]).]]

Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a Los Angeles hospital&lt;!-- What was the name of this hospital? --&gt;, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: &quot;She is squeezing my hand!&quot; He then stood up, suffered a heart attack, and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Philosophy and worldview ==

Buckminster Fuller was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], like his grandfather [[Arthur Buckminster Fuller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/arthurbuckminsterfuller.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019224827/http://www.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/arthurbuckminsterfuller.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-10-19 |title=Arthur Buckminster Fuller }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/biographies/buckminster-fuller-3/ |title=Buckminster Fuller: Designer of a New World, 1895-1983 |work=Harvard Square Library |year=2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806065007/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/fuller.html |archivedate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  a Unitarian minister. Fuller was also an early [[environmental activist]], aware of the Earth's finite resources, and promoted a principle he termed &quot;[[ephemeralization]]&quot;, which, according to futurist and Fuller disciple [[Stewart Brand]], was defined as &quot;doing more with less&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brand |first=Stewart |title=The Clock of the Long Now |location=New York |publisher=Basic |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-465-04512-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/clockoflongnow00bran }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources and waste from crude, inefficient products could be recycled into making more valuable products, thus increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also coined the word [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]], a catch-all term used broadly for communicating experiences using geometric concepts, and more specifically, the empirical study of systems in transformation; his focus was on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components.

Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and explored [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy]] and [[material efficiency]] in the fields of architecture, engineering and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R.

Though Fuller was concerned about [[sustainability]] and human survival under the existing socio-economic system, he remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the &quot;technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life,&quot; his analysis of the condition of &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities had become unnecessary. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. He declared: &quot;selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable ... War is obsolete.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fuller |first= R.

Fuller was influenced by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s idea of [[general semantics]]. In the 1950s, Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the [[Institute of General Semantics]], and he delivered the annual [[Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Individuals Influenced by General Semantics|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/the-general-semantics-learning-center/overview-of-general-semantics/notable-individuals/|publisher=The Institute of General Semantics|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)|Synergetics]]''. The two shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drake|first=Harold L.|title=The General Semantics and Science Fiction of Robert heinlein and A.

Lee Award in General Semantics offered by the International Society for General Semantics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1970 book ''I Seem To Be a Verb'', he wrote: &quot;I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.&quot;

Fuller wrote that the natural [[analytic geometry]] of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous [[truss]] is cyclically tetrahedral.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Amy, &quot;A Fuller Explanation&quot;, Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet truss&lt;/ref&gt;

He had become a [[guru]] of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as [[Drop City]], the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 &quot;Dymaxion Award&quot; for &quot;poetically economic&quot; domed living structures.

== Major design projects ==
[[File:Géode V 3 1.gif|thumb|right|220px|A geodesic sphere.]]

=== The geodesic dome ===

Fuller was most famous for his [[thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]] – [[geodesic dome]]s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by [[Walther Bauersfeld]] for the [[Planetarium Jena|Zeiss-Planetarium]], built some 28 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235; awarded in 1954) is the same design as Bauersfeld's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telacommunications.com/geodome.htm |title=Geodesic Domes and Charts of the Heavens |publisher=Telacommunications.com |date=1973-06-19 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple &quot;[[tensegrity]]&quot; structures (tetrahedron, [[octahedron]], and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of [[Manhattan]], and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-4.html#ss4.1 |title=The R.

Fuller associated the word ''Dymaxion'' with much of his work, a [[portmanteau]] of the words '''''dy'''namic'', '''''max'''imum'', and ''tens'''ion'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rG__1rhIzE0C&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Dymaxion+dynamic |title= Buckminster Fuller's Universe |page= 132 |first= Lloyd Steven |last= Sieden |year= 2000 |publisher= Basic Books |isbn= 978-0-7382-0379-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to sum up the goal of his study, &quot;maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.anb.org/articles/13/13-02560.html |title= R.

The Dymaxion was not an automobile ''per se'', but rather the 'ground-taxying mode' of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly, land and drive &amp;mdash; an &quot;Omni-Medium Transport&quot; for air, land and water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marks 1973 104&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller |last=Marks  |first=Robert |year=1973 |publisher=Anchor Press / Doubleday |isbn= |pages=104
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuller focused on the landing and taxiing qualities, and noted severe limitations in its handling.  The team made constant improvements and refinements to the platform,&lt;ref name=&quot;universe&quot;/&gt; and Fuller noted the Dymaxion &quot;was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;universe&quot;/&gt;

The bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and speed as well as light weight, and its [[Automobile platform|platform]] featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-drive and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90° [[steering|steering lock]]. Thus able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation,  bringing nearby traffic to a halt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kleiner&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The Age of Heretics | publisher = Jossey Bass, Warren Bennis Signature Series | author = Art Kleiner | date = April 2008 | quote = In 1934, Fuller had interested auto magnate Walter Chrysler in financing his Dymaxion car, a durable, three-wheeled, aerodynamic land vehicle modeled after an airplane fuselage. Fuller had built three models that drew enthusiastic crowds wherever. Like all Fuller's other projects (he was responsible for refining and developing the geodesic dome, the first practical dome structure) it was inexpensive, durable and energy efficient; Fuller worked diligently to cut back the amount of material and energy used by any product he designed. &quot;You've produced exactly the car I've always wanted to produce,&quot; the mechanically apt Chrysler told him. Then Chrysler noted ruefully, Fuller had taken one-third the time and one fourth the money Chrysler's corporation usually spent producing prototypes &amp;mdash; prototypes Chrysler himself usually hated in the end. For a few months, it had seemed Chrysler would go ahead and introduce Fuller's car. But the banks that financed Chrysler's wholesale distributors vetoed the move by threatening to call in their loans. The bankers were afraid (or so Fuller said years later) that an advanced new design would diminish the value of the unsold motor vehicles in dealers' showrooms.  For every new car sold, five used cars had to be sold to finance the distribution and production chain, and those cars would not sell if Fuller's invention made them obsolete. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=YDQgqe4lpLQC&amp;pg=PT26&amp;dq=the+age+of+heretics+dymaxion+like+all+other+of+fuller%27s#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20age%20of%20heretics%20dymaxion%20like%20all%20other%20of%20fuller%27s&amp;f=false| isbn = 9780470443415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marks 1973 29&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller |last=Marks  |first=Robert |year=1973 |publisher=Anchor Press / Doubleday |isbn= |pages=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Housing ===

[[File:Dymaxion house.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A Dymaxion house at [[The Henry Ford]].]]

Fuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive [[Dymaxion house]] garnered much interest, but only two prototypes were ever produced. Here the term &quot;Dymaxion&quot; is used in effect to signify a &quot;radically strong and light tensegrity structure&quot;. One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened &quot;bell&quot; of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.

Conceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Jonathan|year=2012|title=Buckminster Fuller's Reflexive Modernism|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=325–344|via=|doi=10.2752/175470812X13361292229159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design included a &quot;Go-Ahead-With-Life Room&quot; stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel &quot;through time and space&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Planetary Homeboy|last=Wigley|first=M|date=1997|work=Any|access-date=|pages=16–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It looked ultramodern at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed {{convert|90|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.

In 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named [[Triton City]] and published a report on the design the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A study of a prototype floating community|author=R. Buckminster Fuller|publisher=Triton Foundation|year=1968|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models of the city aroused the interest of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] who, after leaving office, had them placed in the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1971dec04-00080 |title=Cities on the Sea? |first=John |last=Lear |journal=The Saturday Review |volume=54 |date=December 4, 1971 |page=90 |accessdate=January 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in [[Otisco, New York]]. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.

The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[U.S. Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.

=== Dymaxion map and World Game ===

Fuller, along with co-cartographer [[Shoji Sadao]], also designed an alternative projection map, called the [[Dymaxion map]]. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.

In the 1960s, Fuller developed the [[World Game]], a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Perry|first=Tony|title=This Game Anything but Child's Play: Buckminster Fuller's creation aims to fight the real enemies of mankind: starvation, disease and illiteracy|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-02/local/me-52516_1_buckminster-fuller|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=October 2, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which players attempt to solve world problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Allen|title=R.

== Appearance and style ==

Buckminster Fuller wore thick-lensed [[spectacles]] to correct his extreme [[hyperopia]], a condition that went undiagnosed for the first five years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VWF_6f0UCkYC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;dq=farsighted+buckminster+fuller+zung&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w8w5TmCBcz&amp;sig=i-DHjruCVOwKkpnPODfQoHhYvyE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiS96KTlqbNAhWjxYMKHRK7C-sQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=farsighted%20buckminster%20fuller%20zung&amp;f=false Thomas T.

Writer [[Guy Davenport]] met him in 1965 and described him thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He's a dwarf, with a worker's hands, all callouses and squared fingers. He carries an ear trumpet, of green plastic, with WORLD SERIES 1965 printed on it. His smile is golden and frequent; the man's temperament is angelic, and his energy is just a touch more than that of [Robert] Gallway (champeen runner, footballeur, and swimmer). One leg is shorter than the other, and the prescription shoe worn to correct the imbalance comes from a country doctor deep in the wilderness of Maine. Blue blazer, Khrushchev trousers, and a briefcase full of Japanese-made wonderments; ...&lt;ref&gt;''Questioning Minds: The Letters of Guy Davenport and Hugh Kenner'', ed. Edward M. Burns (Counterpoint, 2018), p. 733.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Quirks ==

Following his global prominence from the 1960s onward, Fuller became a frequent flier, often crossing time zones to lecture. In the 1960s and 1970s, he wore three watches simultaneously; one for the time zone of his office in [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], one for the time zone of the location he would next visit, and one for the time zone he was currently in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenner-Guided-Tour&quot;/&gt;{{rp|290}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Kolbert |first=Elizabeth |url=https://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/09/080609fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all |title=Annals of Innovation: Dymaxion Man: Reporting &amp; Essays |magazine=The New Yorker |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Fuller |first = Buckminster |title = Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth |publisher = Southern Illinois University Press |location = Carbondale |year = 1969 |isbn = 978-0-8093-2461-3|title-link = Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Fuller was only in 'homely' locations (his personal home in Carbondale, Illinois; his holiday retreat in Bear Island, Maine; his daughter's home in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]], California) roughly 65 nights per year—the other 300 nights were spent in hotel beds in the locations he visited on his lecturing and consulting circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenner-Guided-Tour&quot;/&gt;{{rp|290}}

In the 1920s, Fuller experimented with [[polyphasic sleep]], which he called ''Dymaxion sleep''. Inspired by the sleep habits of animals such as dogs and cats,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-Universe&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Sieden | first1 = Lloyd Steven | title = Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work | location = New York | publisher = [[Perseus Books Group]] | date = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-7382-0379-9 | title-link = Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}} Fuller worked until he was tired, and then slept short naps.

Despite only practicing true polyphasic sleep for a period during the 1920s, Fuller was known for his stamina throughout his life. He was described as &quot;tireless&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Life-Magazine-1971-Farrell&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Farrell | first = Barry | title = The View from the Year 2000 | newspaper = [[Life (magazine)|Life]] magazine | pages = 46–58 | date = 26 February 1971 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=kVMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22fuller+is+a+man+of+exceedingly+gentle+manners%22 | accessdate = 1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} by [[Barry Farrell]] in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, who noted that Fuller stayed up all night replying to mail during Farrell's 1970 trip to Bear Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life-Magazine-1971-Farrell&quot;/&gt;{{rp|55}} In his seventies, Fuller generally slept for 5–8 hours per night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenner-Guided-Tour&quot;/&gt;{{rp|160}}

Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately {{convert|270|ft|m}} of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous Fuller Collection is currently housed at [[Stanford]] University.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

In his youth, Fuller experimented with several ways of presenting himself: R. B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply &quot;Bucky&quot;.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

== Language and neologisms ==

Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often &quot;common sense&quot; to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense.&quot; Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled &quot;What I Am Trying to Do.&quot; And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller used the word ''Universe'' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that &quot;by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How Little I Know&quot; from And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The words &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot;, according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. &quot;I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going &quot;outstairs&quot; and &quot;instairs.&quot;' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Intuition'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;World-around&quot; is a term coined by Fuller to replace &quot;worldwide&quot;. The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[classical antiquity]], so using &quot;wide&quot; is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms &quot;sunsight&quot; and &quot;sunclipse&quot;, replacing &quot;sunrise&quot; and &quot;sunset&quot; to overturn the [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]].

Fuller also invented the word &quot;livingry,&quot; as opposed to weaponry (or &quot;killingry&quot;), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. &quot;The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Critical Path'', page xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term &quot;[[tensegrity]]&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;tensional integrity&quot;. &quot;Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Synergetics'', page 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Dymaxion]]&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;dynamic maximum tension&quot;. It was invented around 1929 by two [[Advertising agency|admen]] at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and tension.&lt;ref&gt;''R. Buckminster Fuller – Autobiographical Monologue/Scenario'',St. Martin's Press, Inc.,1980, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller also helped to popularize the concept of [[Spaceship Earth]]: &quot;The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cjfearnley_com-fortunes_srchstr_Fuller&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Selected Quotes|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/cgi-bin/cjf-fortunes.pl?srchstr=Fuller&amp;name=Submit}} 090810 cjfearnley.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Buckminster Fuller on the 50th anniversary of his patent for the geodesic dome and by the occasion of his 109th birthday. The stamp's design replicated the January 10, 1964 cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]''.

Fuller was the subject of two documentary films: ''[[The World of Buckminster Fuller]]'' (1971) and ''[[Buckminster Fuller: Thinking Out Loud]]'' (1996). Additionally, filmmaker [[Sam Green (filmmaker)|Sam Green]] and the band [[Yo La Tengo]] collaborated on a 2012 &quot;live documentary&quot; about Fuller, ''The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://samgreen.to/the-love-song-of-r-buckminster-fuller/ The Love Song of R. Buckminster Fuller] Retrieved May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] presented &quot;Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe&quot;, the most comprehensive retrospective to date of his work and ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitney.org/www/buckminster_fuller/about.jsp Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819090507/http://www.whitney.org/www/buckminster_fuller/about.jsp |date=August 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition traveled to the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] in 2009. It presented a combination of models, sketches, and other artifacts, representing six decades of the artist's integrated approach to housing, transportation, communication, and cartography. It also featured the extensive connections with Chicago from his years spent living, teaching, and working in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/R_Buckminster_Fuller_Starting_with_the_Universe.html |title=Chicago's MCA to show ''Buckminster Fuller ~ Starting with the Universe'' |year=2009 |publisher=Art Knowledge News |accessdate=August 8, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407000421/http://www.artknowledgenews.com/R_Buckminster_Fuller_Starting_with_the_Universe.html |archivedate=April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a number of US companies decided to repackage spherical magnets and sell them as toys. One company, Maxfield &amp; Oberton, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that they saw the product on YouTube and decided to repackage them as ''&quot;[[Buckyballs (toy)|Buckyballs]]''&quot;, because the magnets could self-form and hold together in shapes reminiscent of the Fuller inspired buckyballs.&lt;ref name=nyt20120817&gt;

''Second Chance: for Your Money, Your Life and Our World'', Plata Publishing, LLC, 2015, {{ISBN|978-1612680460}}&lt;/ref&gt; is largely about Kiyosaki's interactions with Fuller, and Fuller's unusual final book ''Grunch of Giants''.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, R.

In 2012, the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] hosted &quot;The Utopian Impulse&quot; – a show about Buckminster Fuller's influence in the Bay Area. Featured were concepts, inventions and designs for creating &quot;free energy&quot; from natural forces, and for sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. The show ran January through July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmoma.org/about/press/press_exhibitions/releases/903 &quot;The Utopian Impulse,&quot;] San Francisco Museum of Modern Art press release, retrieved April 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller is briefly mentioned in the 2014 [[superhero film]], ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past (film)|X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', when Kitty Pride is giving a lecture to a group of students regarding utopian architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/buckminster-fuller-and-crystals_b_5877686?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGfxVtleTeip2GqFo89QX-y2Mu9JGHCWPY9Asl0H_KS2OMzukzFTr0NVDKys935oyU0xRVondmzpAniHFMFuDa-fn9CZvsUP4jYFZJZoMU8xJPrvXmebATsUXRlPptA_HF4QiwObcHPB5uxpVxVnf6u_5JOjuOcygYeEVsnQ_Sjw |title=X-Men Movie: We Know the World Is Intact Because of Buckminster Fuller and Crystals. |work=[[HuffPost]] | date=November 25, 2014 |first=L.

In a different note, Fuller's quote &quot;Those who play with the Devil's toys, will be brought by degree to wield his sword&quot; was used and referenced as the first display seen in the strategy sci-fi video game ''[[XCOM: Enemy Within]]'' developed by [[Firaxis Games]].

''[[The House of Tomorrow (2017 film)|The House of Tomorrow]]'', is a 2017 American independent drama film written and directed by [[Peter Livolsi]], based on [[Peter Bognanni]]'s 2010 novel of the same name, featuring [[Asa Butterfield]], [[Alex Wolff]], [[Nick Offerman]], [[Maude Apatow]], and [[Ellen Burstyn]].  Burstyn's character is obsessed by all things Buckminster Fuller providing retro-futurist tours of her geodesic home, including authentic video of Buckminster Fuller talking and sailing with Ellen Burstyn, who'd actually befriended him in real life.
