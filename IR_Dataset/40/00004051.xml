'''Brian Wilson Kernighan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɜːr|n|ᵻ|h|æ|n}}; born January 1, 1942)&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2002&quot;/&gt; is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[computer scientist]].

He worked at [[Bell Labs]] and contributed to the development of [[Unix]] alongside [[Unix]] creators [[Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]].

Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] with [[Dennis Ritchie]]. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language (&quot;it's entirely [[Dennis Ritchie]]'s work&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;LJ 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7035|title=Interview with Brian Kernighan|last=Dolya|first=Aleksey|date=29 July 2003|magazine=[[Linux Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He authored many [[Unix]] programs, including [[troff|ditroff]].

Kernighan is coauthor of the [[AWK]] and [[AMPL]] [[programming language]]s. The &quot;K&quot; of [[The C Programming Language|K&amp;R C]] and the &quot;K&quot; in AWK both stand for &quot;Kernighan&quot;. 

In collaboration with [[Shen Lin]] he devised well-known [[heuristic]]s for two [[NP-complete]] optimization problems: [[graph partition]]ing and the [[travelling salesman problem]]. In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the [[Kernighan–Lin algorithm]], while the latter is known as the [[Lin–Kernighan heuristic]].

Kernighan has been a Professor in the Computer Science Department of [[Princeton University]] since 2000. He is also the Undergraduate Department Representative.&lt;ref name=&quot;acm&quot;&gt;{{ACMPortal|id=81100397511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090428163341/https://www.princeton.edu/~mike/unixhistory Brian Kernighan's home page at Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
[[File:Brian Kernighan in 2012 at Bell Labs 3.jpg|thumb|Brian Kernighan speaks at a tribute to [[Dennis Ritchie]] in 2012 at [[Bell Labs]].]]
Kernighan was born in [[Toronto]]. He attended the [[University of Toronto]] between 1960 and 1964, earning his [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[engineering physics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LJ 2003&quot; /&gt; He received his PhD in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Princeton University]] in 1969 for research supervised by Peter Weiner.&lt;ref name=phd/&gt;

==Career and research==
Kernighan has held a professorship in the Department of Computer Science at Princeton since 2000.  Each fall he teaches a course called &quot;Computers in Our World&quot;, which introduces the fundamentals of computing to non-majors. 

Kernighan was the software editor for [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall International]]. His &quot;Software Tools&quot; series spread the essence of &quot;C/Unix thinking&quot; with makeovers for [[BASIC]], [[Fortran|FORTRAN]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and most notably his &quot;[[Ratfor]]&quot; (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.

He has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it would have to be C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~mihaib/kernighan-interview/index.html |title=An Interview with Brian Kernighan |first=Mihai |last=Budiu |date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kernighan coined the term [[Unix]] and helped popularize Thompson's [[Unix philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reader&quot;&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=M. D. |last1=McIlroy |authorlink1=Doug McIlroy |year=1987 |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf |title=A Research Unix reader: annotated excerpts from the Programmer's Manual, 1971–1986 |series=CSTR |number=139 |institution=Bell Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kernighan is also known as a coiner of the expression &quot;What You See Is All You Get&quot; (WYSIAYG), which is a sarcastic variant of the original &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; ([[WYSIWYG]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/opinion/geek-of-the-week/brian-kernighan-geek-of-the-week/|title=Brian Kernighan: Geek of the Week|date=2010-05-19|website=Simple Talk|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kernighan's term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.

Kernighan's original 1978 implementation of [[Hello, World!]] was sold at [[The Algorithm Auction]], the world's first auction of [[computer algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brian Kernighan {{ndash}} Hello World|url=https://www.artsy.net/artwork/brian-kernighan-hello-world|website=Artsy|publisher=Artsy|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Kernighan taught [[CS50]] which is the [[Harvard University]] introductory course in Computer Science.&lt;ref name=sigscse&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malan|first1=David J.|title=Reinventing CS50|year=2010|pages=152|doi=10.1145/1734263.1734316|journal=Proceeding of SIGCSE '10 Proceedings of the 41st ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education|isbn=9781450300063}}&lt;/ref&gt;
