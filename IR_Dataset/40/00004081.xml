'''''Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[K. W. Jeter]] published in 1996. It is a continuation of Jeter's novel ''[[Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human]]'', which was itself a sequel to both the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and the novel upon which the film was based, [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]''

== Plot introduction ==
Living on [[Mars]], Deckard is acting as a consultant to a movie crew filming the story of his days as a [[blade runner]]. He finds himself drawn into a mission on behalf of the [[replicant]]s he was once assigned to kill. Meanwhile, the mystery surrounding the beginnings of the Tyrell Corporation is being exposed.

==Characters==
*Rick Deckard, a former [[bounty hunter]], now working as a film consultant
*Sarah Tyrell, the niece of Eldon Tyrell; she has been living on Mars since the events of ''Blade Runner 2''
*Anson Tyrell, Sarah's father
*Ruth Tyrell, Sarah's mother
*Rachael, a ten-year-old girl
*Roy Batty, the human template for the replicant Deckard fought in the previous novel. That replicant's personality now resides inside Deckard's briefcase.
*Sebastien, a dehydrated deity
*Urbenton, director of the movie ''Blade Runner'' on which Rick Deckard is a consultant
*Dave Holden, Deckard's former police partner

==Film adaptation==
