'''Benedict of Nursia''' ({{lang-la|Benedictus Nursiae}}; {{lang-it|Benedetto da Norcia}}; {{lang-la|label=[[Vulgar Latin]]|*Benedecto}}; {{lang-got|Benedikt|script=Latn}}; {{circa|2 March 480}} – {{circa|21 March 547 AD}}) is a Christian saint venerated in the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], the [[Anglican Communion]] and [[Old Catholic Church]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Barry|first= Patrick|author-link=Patrick Barry (bishop)|title= St. Benedict and Christianity in England|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U6OTu8n3SLcC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate= 24 November 2012|date= 1 July 1995|publisher= Gracewing Publishing|isbn= 9780852443385|page= 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a [[Patron saints of Europe|patron saint of Europe]].&lt;ref name=SHMI&gt;{{cite book|author= Fr.

Benedict founded twelve communities for monks at [[Subiaco, Lazio]], Italy (about {{convert|65|km|mi}} to the east of Rome), before moving to [[Monte Cassino]] in the mountains of [[southern Italy]]. The [[Order of Saint Benedict]] is of later origin and, moreover, not an &quot;order&quot; as commonly understood but merely a confederation of autonomous congregations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holder2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Holder|first= Arthur G.|title= Christian Spirituality: The Classics|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz2KjBCIcEkC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate= 24 November 2012|date= 29 July 2009|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn= 9780415776028|page= 70|quote=Today, tens of thousands of men and women throughout the world profess to live their lives according to Benedict's ''Rule''. These men and women are associated with over two thousand Roman Catholic, Anglican, and ecumenical Benedictine monasteries on six continents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict's main achievement, his &quot;[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]&quot;, contains a set of [[Decree (canon law)|rules]] for his monks to follow. Heavily influenced by the writings of [[John Cassian]], it shows strong affinity with the [[Rule of the Master]], but it also has a unique spirit of balance, moderation and reasonableness ({{lang|grc|ἐπιείκεια}}, ''epieíkeia''), which persuaded most Christian religious communities founded throughout the [[Middle Ages]] to adopt it. As a result, his Rule became one of the most influential religious rules in Western [[Christendom]]. For this reason, Giuseppe Carletti regarded Benedict as the founder of [[Christian monasticism#Western Christian monasticism|Western Christian monasticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Carletti, Giuseppe, ''Life of St. Benedict'' ([[Freeport, New York|Freeport, NY]]: Books for Libraries Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Apart from a short poem attributed to Mark of Monte Cassino,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ampleforthjournal.org/V_027.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the only ancient account of Benedict is found in the second volume of [[Pope Gregory&amp;nbsp;I]]'s four-book ''Dialogues'', thought to have been written in 593,&lt;ref name=ford/&gt; although the authenticity of this work has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;''Life and Miracles of St. Benedict'' (''Book II, Dialogues''), translated by Odo John Zimmerman, O.S.B. and Benedict R. Avery, O.S.B. (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1980), p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory's account of this saint's life is not, however, a biography in the modern sense of the word. It provides instead a [[Hagiography|spiritual portrait]] of the gentle, disciplined abbot. In a letter to Bishop Maximilian of Syracuse, Gregory states his intention for his ''Dialogues'', saying they are a kind of ''floretum'' (an ''anthology'', literally, 'flowers') of the most striking miracles of Italian holy men.&lt;ref name=&quot;fn_4&quot;&gt;See Ildephonso Schuster, ''Saint Benedict and His Times'', Gregory J. Roettger, trans. (London: B. Herder, 1951), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory did not set out to write a chronological, historically anchored story of Saint Benedict, but he did base his anecdotes on direct testimony. To establish his authority, Gregory explains that his information came from what he considered the best sources: a handful of Benedict's disciples who lived with the saint and witnessed his various miracles. These followers, he says, are Constantinus, who succeeded Benedict as [[Abbot]] of Monte Cassino; Valentinianus; Simplicius; and Honoratus, who was abbot of Subiaco when St Gregory wrote his ''Dialogues''.

In Gregory's day, history was not recognised as an independent field of study; it was a branch of grammar or rhetoric, and ''historia'' was an account that summed up the findings of the learned when they wrote what was, at that time, considered 'history.'&lt;ref name=&quot;fn_6&quot;&gt;See Deborah Mauskopf Deliyannis, editor, ''Historiography in the Middle Ages'' (Boston: Brill, 2003), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory's ''Dialogues'' Book Two, then, an authentic [[Hagiography#Medieval England|medieval hagiography]] cast as a conversation between the Pope and his deacon Peter, is designed to teach spiritual lessons.&lt;ref name=ford/&gt;

==Early life==
He was the son of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] noble of [[Nursia]],&lt;ref name=ford&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02467b.htm Ford, Hugh. &quot;St. Benedict of Norcia.&quot; The ''Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 3 Mar. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; the modern [[Norcia]], in [[Umbria]]. A tradition which [[Bede]] accepts makes him a twin with his sister [[Scholastica]]. If 480 is accepted as the year of his birth, the year of his abandonment of his studies and leaving home would be about 500. Saint Gregory's narrative makes it impossible to suppose him younger than 20 at the time. He was old enough to be in the midst of his literary studies, to understand the real meaning and worth of the dissolute and licentious lives of his companions, and to have been deeply affected by the love of a woman. He was at the beginning of life, and he had at his disposal the means to a career as a Roman noble; clearly he was not a child.

Benedict was sent to Rome to study, but was disappointed by the life he found there. He does not seem to have left Rome for the purpose of becoming a [[hermit]], but only to find some place away from the life of the great city. He took his old nurse with him as a servant and they settled down to live in [[Enfide]].&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/BENEDICT.htm &quot;Saint Benedict, Abbot&quot;, ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley &amp; Co., Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; Enfide, which the tradition of Subiaco identifies with the modern [[Affile]], is in the [[Monti Simbruini|Simbruini]] mountains, about forty miles from Rome and two from Subiaco.

[[File:Benedetto, Mauro e Placido.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Saint Benedict orders [[Saint Maurus]] to the rescue of [[Saint Placidus]]'', by [[Fra Filippo Lippi]], 1445 A.D.]]

A short distance from Enfide is the entrance to a narrow, gloomy valley, penetrating the mountains and leading directly to Subiaco. The path continues to ascend, and the side of the ravine, on which it runs, becomes steeper, until a cave is reached above which the mountain now rises almost perpendicularly; while on the right, it strikes in a rapid descent down to where, in Saint Benedict's day, {{convert|500|ft|m}} below, lay the blue waters of the lake. The cave has a large triangular-shaped opening and is about ten feet deep.
On his way from Enfide, Benedict met a monk, [[Romanus of Subiaco]], whose monastery was on the mountain above the cliff overhanging the cave. Romanus had discussed with Benedict the purpose which had brought him to Subiaco, and had given him the monk's habit. By his advice Benedict became a hermit and for three years, unknown to men, lived in this cave above the lake.&lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt;

==Later life==
Gregory tells us little of these years. He now speaks of Benedict no longer as a youth (''puer''), but as a man (''vir'') of God. [[Romanus of Subiaco|Romanus]], Gregory tells us, served the saint in every way he could. The monk apparently visited him frequently, and on fixed days brought him food.&lt;ref name=Crawley/&gt;&lt;!-- Image with questionable fair-use claim removed: [[File:it238th.jpg|right]] --&gt;

During these three years of solitude, broken only by occasional communications with the outer world and by the visits of Romanus, Benedict matured both in mind and character, in knowledge of himself and of his fellow-man, and at the same time he became not merely known to, but secured the respect of, those about him; so much so that on the death of the abbot of a monastery in the neighbourhood (identified by some with [[Vicovaro]]), the community came to him and begged him to become its abbot. Benedict was acquainted with the life and discipline of the monastery, and knew that &quot;their manners were diverse from his and therefore that they would never agree together: yet, at length, overcome with their entreaty, he gave his consent&quot; (ibid., 3). The experiment failed; the monks tried to poison him. The legend goes that they first tried to poison his drink. He prayed a blessing over the cup and the cup shattered. Thus he left the group and went back to his cave at Subiaco. There lived in the neighborhood a priest called Florentius who, moved by envy, tried to ruin him. He tried to poison him with poisoned bread. When he prayed a blessing over the bread, a raven swept in and took the loaf away. From this time his miracles seem to have become frequent, and many people, attracted by his sanctity and character, came to Subiaco to be under his guidance. Having failed by sending him poisonous bread, Florentius tried to seduce his monks with some prostitutes. To avoid further temptations, in about 530 Benedict left Subiaco.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Bunson|Bunson, M.]], Bunson, M., &amp; Bunson, S., ''Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints'' ([[Huntington, Indiana|Huntington IN]]: [[Our Sunday Visitor]], 2014), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded 12 monasteries in the vicinity of Subiaco, and, eventually, in 530 he founded the great Benedictine monastery of [[Monte Cassino]],&lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt; which lies on a hilltop between Rome and Naples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benedictine-srs.org/nursia.html Nursia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716220328/http://www.benedictine-srs.org/nursia.html |date=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the invasion of Italy, [[Totila]], King of the [[Ostrogoths|Goths]], ordered a general to wear his kingly robes and to see whether Benedict would discover the truth. Immediately the Saint detected the impersonation, and Totila came to pay him due respect.&lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt;

==Veneration==
[[File:Totila e San Benedetto.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Totila]] and Saint Benedict, painted by [[Spinello Aretino]].]]
He is believed to have died of a fever at [[Monte Cassino]] not long after his twin sister, [[Saint Scholastica]], and was buried in the same place as his sister. According to tradition, this occurred on 21 March 547.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20080409.html Saint Benedict of Norcia]&lt;/ref&gt; He was named patron protector of Europe by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=556 | title=St. Benedict of Norcia| publisher=Catholic Online | accessdate=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared him co-[[patron saint|patron]] of Europe, together with [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Egregiae Virtutis&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Egregiae Virtutis | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_31121980_egregiae-virtutis_lt.html | accessdate = 26 April 2009}} [[Apostolic letter]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], 31 December 1980 {{in lang|la}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre-1970 [[General Roman Calendar]], his feast is kept on 21 March, the day of his death according to some manuscripts of the ''[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]'' and that of [[Bede]]. Because on that date his [[liturgy|liturgical]] [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]] would always be impeded by the observance of [[Lent]], the [[Mysterii Paschalis|1969 revision]] of the [[General Roman Calendar]] moved his memorial to 11 July, the date that appears in some Gallic liturgical books of the end of the 8th century as the feast commemorating his birth (''Natalis S. Benedicti''). There is some uncertainty about the origin of this feast.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Calendarium Romanum&quot; ([[Vatican Publishing House|Libreria Editrice Vaticana]]), pp. 97 and 119&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, on 21 March the [[Roman Martyrology]] mentions in a line and a half that it is Benedict's day of death and that his memorial is celebrated on 11 July, while on 11 July it devotes seven lines to speaking of him, and mentions the tradition that he died on 21 March.&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'' 199 (edito altera 2004); pages 188 and 361 of the 2001 edition (Libreria Editrice Vaticana {{ISBN|978-88-209-7210-3}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] commemorates Saint Benedict on 14 March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100800 &quot;Orthodox Church in America: The Lives of the Saints, March 14th&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anglican Communion]] has no single universal calendar, but a provincial [[List of Anglican Church calendars|calendar of saints]] is published in each province. In almost all of these, Saint Benedict is commemorated on 11 July.

==Rule of Saint Benedict==
{{Main|Rule of Saint Benedict}}
Benedict wrote the ''Rule'' in 516&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Monasticon Anglicanum, or, The history of the ancient abbies, and other monasteries, hospitals, cathedral and collegiate churches in England and Wales. With divers French, Irish, and Scotch monasteries formerly relating to England|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=pAtJAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|last1=Dugdale|first1=William|last2=Stevens|first2=John|last3=Wright|first3=James|last4=Dodsworth|first4= Roger|publisher=Sam Keble|year=1693|author-link1=William Dugdale|author-link2=John Stevens (translator)|author-link3=James Wright (antiquarian)|author-link4=Roger Dodsworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot. Seventy-three short chapters comprise the ''Rule''. Its wisdom is twofold: spiritual (how to live a Christocentric life on earth) and administrative (how to run a monastery efficiently). More than half of the chapters describe how to be obedient and humble, and what to do when a member of the community is not. About one-fourth regulate the work of God (the [[Opus Dei]]). One-tenth outline how, and by whom, the monastery should be managed.

Following the golden rule of ''Ora et Labora - pray and work'', the monks each day devoted eight hours to prayer, eight hours to sleep, and eight hours to manual work, sacred reading and/or works of charity.&lt;ref name=SHMI /&gt;

==Saint Benedict Medal==
{{Main|Saint Benedict Medal}}
[[File:StBenedictVadeRetroSatana.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Image of Saint Benedict with a cross (which is inscribed, &quot;Crux sacra sit mihi lux! Non draco sit mihi dux!&quot; (&quot;May the holy cross be my light! May the dragon never be my guide!&quot;)) and a scroll stating &quot;Vade retro Satana! Nunquam suade mihi vana! Sunt mala quae libas. Ipse venena bibas! (&quot;Begone Satan! Never tempt me with your vanities! The drink you offer is evil. Drink that poison yourself!&quot;, or in brief,''[[Vade Retro Satana]]'' which is abbreviated on the [[Saint Benedict Medal]]]]

This [[devotional medal]] originally came from a cross in honour of Saint Benedict. On one side, the medal has an image of Saint Benedict, holding the Holy Rule in his left hand and a cross in his right. There is a raven on one side of him, with a cup on the other side of him. Around the medal's outer margin are the words ''&quot;Eius in obitu nostro praesentia muniamur&quot;'' (&quot;May we be strengthened by his presence in the hour of our death&quot;). The other side of the medal has a cross with the initials '''CSSML''' on the vertical bar which signify ''&quot;Crux Sacra Sit Mihi Lux&quot;'' (&quot;May the Holy Cross be my light&quot;) and on the horizontal bar are the initials '''NDSMD''' which stand for ''&quot;Non Draco Sit Mihi Dux&quot;'' (&quot;Let not the dragon be my guide&quot;). The initials '''CSPB''' stand for ''&quot;Crux Sancti Patris Benedicti&quot;'' (&quot;The Cross of the Holy Father Benedict&quot;) and are located on the interior angles of the cross. Either the inscription ''&quot;PAX&quot;'' (Peace) or the [[Christogram]] ''&quot;IHS&quot;'' may be found at the top of the cross in most cases. Around the medal's margin on this side are the ''[[Vade Retro Satana]]'' initials '''VRSNSMV''' which stand for ''&quot;Vade Retro Satana, Nonquam Suade Mihi Vana&quot;'' (&quot;Begone Satan, do not suggest to me thy vanities&quot;) then a space followed by the initials '''SMQLIVB''' which signify ''&quot;Sunt Mala Quae Libas, Ipse Venena Bibas&quot;'' (&quot;Evil are the things thou profferest, drink thou thy own poison&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedict pp 60&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dgElCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''The Life of St Benedict''], by St. Gregory the Great, [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford, IL]]: [[TAN Books]], pp 60–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benediktusmedaille.jpg|thumb|210px|Benedict depicted on a Jubilee [[Saint Benedict Medal]] for the 1400th anniversary of his birth in 1880]]

This medal was first struck in 1880 to commemorate the fourteenth centenary of Saint Benedict's birth and is also called the Jubilee Medal; its exact origin, however, is unknown. In 1647, during a witchcraft trial at [[Natternberg]] near [[Metten Abbey]] in Bavaria, the accused women testified they had no power over Metten, which was under the protection of the cross. An investigation found a number of painted crosses on the walls of the abbey with the letters now found on St Benedict medals, but their meaning had been forgotten. A manuscript written in 1415 was eventually found that had a picture of Saint Benedict holding a scroll in one hand and a staff which ended in a cross in the other. On the scroll and staff were written the full words of the initials contained on the crosses. Medals then began to be struck in Germany, which then spread throughout Europe. This medal was first approved by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in his briefs of 23 December 1741, and 12 March 1742.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benedict pp 60&quot;/&gt;

Saint Benedict has been also the motive of many collector's coins around the world. The [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|Austria 50 euro 'The Christian Religious Orders']], issued on 13 March 2002 is one of them.

The early Middle Ages have been called &quot;the Benedictine centuries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Western Europe in the Middle Ages | accessdate = 17 November 2008 | url = http://www.northern.edu/marmorsa/medievallec1.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080602064810/http://www.northern.edu/marmorsa/medievallec1.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] discussed the influence St Benedict had on Western Europe.

Saint Benedict contributed more than anyone else to the rise of monasticism in the West. His Rule was the foundational document for thousands of religious communities in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/benedict.html  Stracke, Prof. J.R., &quot;St. Benedict – Iconography&quot;, Augusta State University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116014059/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/benedict.html |date=16 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, The Rule of St. Benedict is the most common and influential Rule used by monasteries and monks, more than 1,400 years after its writing. Today the Benedictine family is represented by two branches: the Benedictine Federation and the Cistercians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1441 Foley O.F.M., Leonard, rev. McCloskey O.F.M., Pat, &quot;Saint of the Day&quot;, American Catholic]&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Saint Benedict produced &quot;a true spiritual ferment&quot; in Europe, and over the coming decades his followers spread across the continent to establish a new cultural unity based on Christian faith.

A basilica was built upon the birthplace of Saints Benedict and Scholastica in the 1400s. Ruins of their familial home were excavated from beneath the church and preserved. The [[October 2016 Central Italy earthquakes|earthquake of 30 October 2016]] completely devastated the structure of the basilica, leaving only the front facade and altar standing.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.nursia.org/earthquake/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/beer-brewing-monks-norcia-say-earthquake-destroys-st-benedict-basilica-n675536 |title = Quake flattens historic basilica that beer was helping to save}}&lt;/ref&gt;
