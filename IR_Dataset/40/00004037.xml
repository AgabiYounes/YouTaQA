'''Bletchley Park''' is a 19th-century mansion and estate in [[Milton Keynes]] ([[Buckinghamshire]]) that became the principal centre of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[World War II cryptography|code-breaking during the Second World War]]. The mansion was constructed  during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. During [[World War II]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&amp;CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]]. The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war.

According to the official historian of British Intelligence, the &quot;[[Ultra]]&quot; intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinsleyLecture&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the  development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.{{efn|Colossus itself was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] in London, to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at the GC&amp;CS. From there, it (and nine more) were installed and operated in Bletchley.}} Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations. It receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title=Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015'S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202043901/https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The separate [[The National Museum of Computing|National Museum of Computing]], which includes a working replica [[Bombe]] machine and a rebuilt [[Colossus computer]], is housed in Block H on the site.

==History==
The site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]]. [[Browne Willis]] built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down. It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by [[Samuel Lipscomb Seckham]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate of {{convert|581|acres|ha}} was bought in 1883 by Sir [[Herbert Samuel Leon]], who expanded the then-existing farmhouse&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Edward |first=Legg |title=Early History of Bletchley Park 1235{{ndash}}1937|work=Bletchley Park Trust Historic Guides|number=1|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; into what architect [[Landis Gores]] called a &quot;maudlin and monstrous pile&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining [[Victorian Gothic]], [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]], and [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anglotopia.net/british-history/great-british-houses-bletchley-park-house-saved-britain-world-war-ii/|publisher=Great British Houses|title=Bletchley Park – The House That Helped Save Britain in World War II – Where Enigma Was Decoded|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his Christmas family gatherings there was a [[fox hunting]] meet on Boxing Day with glasses of sloe gin from the butler, and the house was always &quot;humming with servants&quot;. With 40 gardeners, a flower bed of yellow daffodils could become a sea of red tulips overnight.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore |2017|p=}}

In 1938, the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder for a housing estate, but in May 1938 Admiral Sir [[Hugh Sinclair]], head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS or [[MI6]]), bought the mansion and {{convert|58|acre|ha}} of land for £6,000 (£{{Inflation|UK|6000|1938|r=-3|fmt=c}} today) for use by GC&amp;CS and SIS in the event of war. He used his own money as the Government said they did not have the budget to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues (inspecting the site under the cover of &quot;Captain Ridley's shooting party&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Bletchley's geographical centrality. It was almost immediately adjacent to [[Bletchley railway station]], where the &quot;[[Varsity Line]]&quot; between [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]{{snd}}whose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakers{{snd}}met the main [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast railway line]] connecting London, [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. [[Watling Street]], the main road linking London to the north-west (subsequently the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]) was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby [[Fenny Stratford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C2135171|title=Fenny Stratford Telephone Repeater Station. Erection. A. Cole Ltd.|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bletchley Park was known as &quot;B.P.&quot; to those who worked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Station X&quot; (X = Roman numeral ten), &quot;London Signals Intelligence Centre&quot;, and &quot;[[Government Communications Headquarters]]&quot; were all cover names used during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aldrich|2010|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The formal posting of the many &quot;Wrens&quot;{{snd}}members of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]{{snd}}working there, was to [[RAF Eastcote|HMS Pembroke V]]. Royal Air Force names of Bletchley Park and its outstations included [[RAF Eastcote]], RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shearer | first = Caroline | title = My years at Bletchley Park – Station X | year = 2014 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/60/a2377460.shtml | access-date = 27 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170226011212/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/60/a2377460.shtml | archive-date = 26 February 2017 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The postal address that staff had to use was &quot;Room 47, Foreign Office&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Good |first=Jack | author-link = I.J.

After the war, the Government Code &amp; Cypher School became the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), moving to [[Eastcote]] in 1946 and to [[Cheltenham]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= GCHQ |author-link= Government Communications Headquarters |title= Bletchley Park - post-war |year= 2016 |url= https://www.gchq.gov.uk/features/bletchley-park-post-war }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was used by various government agencies, including the [[General Post Office|GPO]] and the [[Civil Aviation Authority]]. One large building, block F, was demolished in 1987 by which time the site was being run down with tenants leaving. In 1990 the site was at risk of being sold for housing development. However, [[Milton Keynes Council]] made it into a conservation area. Bletchley Park Trust was set up in 1991 by a group of people who recognised the site's importance.{{sfn|Enever|1999}} The initial trustees included Roger Bristow, Ted Enever, [[Peter Wescombe]], Dr Peter Jarvis of the Bletchley Archaeological &amp; Historical Society, and [[Tony Sale]] who in 1994 became the first director of the Bletchley Park Museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Anon |title= Peter Wescombe - obituary |publisher= Daily Telegraph |year= 2014 |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11299648/Peter-Wescombe-obituary.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commander [[Alastair Denniston]] was operational head of GC&amp;CS from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the [[Admiralty]]'s [[Room 40]] (NID25) and the [[War Office]]'s [[MI1]]b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key GC&amp;CS [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] who moved from London to Bletchley Park included [[John Tiltman]], [[Dilly Knox|Dillwyn &quot;Dilly&quot; Knox]], [[Josh Cooper (cryptographer)|Josh Cooper]], [[Oliver Strachey]] and [[Nigel de Grey]]. These people had a variety of backgrounds{{snd}}linguists and chess champions were common, and in Knox's case [[papyrology]]. The British War Office recruited top solvers of [[cryptic crossword]] puzzles, as these individuals had strong [[lateral thinking]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11151478/Could-you-have-been-a-codebreaker-at-Bletchley-Park.html|title=Could you have been a codebreaker at Bletchley Park?|date=10 October 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324105712/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11151478/Could-you-have-been-a-codebreaker-at-Bletchley-Park.html|archive-date=24 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|the day Britain declared war on Germany]], Denniston wrote to the [[Foreign Office]] about recruiting &quot;men of the professor type&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal networking drove early recruitments, particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=13{{ndash}}23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one 1941 recruiting stratagem, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about &quot;a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=McKay |first=Sinclair |title=Telegraph crossword: Cracking hobby won the day – The boffins of Bletchley cut their teeth on the Telegraph crossword |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=26 August 2010 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/wellbeing/7966268/Telegraph-crossword-Cracking-hobby-won-the-day.html |access-date=3 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227164948/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/wellbeing/7966268/Telegraph-crossword-Cracking-hobby-won-the-day.html |archive-date=27 December 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initial training at the Inter-Service Special Intelligence School set up by [[John Tiltman]] (initially at an RAF depot in Buckingham and later in [[Bedford]]{{snd}}where it was known locally as &quot;the Spy School&quot;)&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith89P205-6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=79, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; staff worked a six-day week, rotating through three shifts: 4{{nbsp}}p.m. to midnight, midnight to 8{{nbsp}}a.m. (the most disliked shift), and 8{{nbsp}}a.m. to 4{{nbsp}}p.m., each with a half-hour meal break. At the end of the third week, a worker went off at 8{{nbsp}}a.m. and came back at 4{{nbsp}}p.m., thus putting in sixteen hours on that last day.&lt;!-- Could we have explicit clarification of the sequence of shifts? Also, how did six-days/week work? Surely the place wasn't idle on Sundays... --&gt; The irregular hours affected workers' health and social life, as well as the routines of the nearby homes at which most staff lodged. The work was tedious and demanded intense concentration; staff got one week's leave four times a year, but some &quot;girls&quot; collapsed and required extended rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|pp=70, 102, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment took place to combat a shortage of experts in Morse code and German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forces.net/news/last-surviving-bletchley-park-listener-dies-aged-97|title=Last Surviving Bletchley Park 'Listener' Dies Aged 97|publisher=Forces network|date=24 October 2017|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1945, at the peak of codebreaking efforts, nearly 10,000 personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Women Codebreakers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/ |title=Women Codebreakers |publisher=Bletchley Park Research |accessdate=12 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126200024/http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/ |archive-date=26 November 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; About three-quarters of these &lt;ref name=&quot;Women Codebreakers&quot;/&gt; were women. Many of the women came from middle-class backgrounds&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt; and held degrees in the areas of mathematics, physics and engineering; they were given entry into [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] programs due to the lack of men, who had been sent to war.

Many of the women had backgrounds in languages, particularly French and German.

For a long time, the British Government didn't recognize the contributions the personnel at Bletchley Park made. Their work achieved official recognition only in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11308744/The-extraordinary-female-codebreakers-of-Bletchley-Park.html|title=The extraordinary female codebreakers of Bletchley Park|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=12 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105114712/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11308744/The-extraordinary-female-codebreakers-of-Bletchley-Park.html|archive-date=5 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secrecy==
Properly used, the German Enigma and [[Lorenz cipher]]s should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities that made Bletchley's attacks just barely feasible. These vulnerabilities, however, could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures,&lt;ref name=&quot;Milner-Barry1993P92&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Milner-Barry|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany had any hint of Bletchley's success. Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britain's &quot;[[Ultra]] secret&quot;{{snd}}higher even than the normally highest classification {{nowrap|''Most&amp;nbsp;Secret''{{thinsp}}{{snd}}}}and security was paramount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All staff signed the [[Official Secrets Act 1939|Official Secrets Act (1939)]] and a 1942 security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: &quot;Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your Hut{{nbsp}}...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=128{{ndash}}29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there were security leaks. [[Jock Colville]], the Assistant Private Secretary to [[Winston Churchill]], recorded in his diary on 31 July 1941, that the newspaper proprietor [[Lord Camrose]] had discovered Ultra and that security leaks &quot;increase in number and seriousness&quot;.{{sfn|Colville|1985|p=422}} Without doubt, the most serious of these was that Bletchley Park had been infiltrated by [[John Cairncross]], the notorious Soviet mole and member of the [[Cambridge Spy Ring]], who leaked Ultra material to Moscow.{{sfn|Smith|2015|pp=81-82}}

The first personnel of the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room; the top floor was allocated to [[MI6]]. Construction of the wooden huts began in late 1939, and Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school in a Victorian Gothic redbrick building by a church, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=2{{ndash}}3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[United States]] joined World War II, a number of American [[cryptographer]]s were posted to [[Hut 3]], and from May 1943 onwards there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1993|pp=71, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[1943 BRUSA Agreement]].) In contrast, the [[Soviet Union]] was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities{{snd}} a reflection of Churchill's distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8ZJxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA571&amp;lpg=PA571&amp;dq=Churchill+distrust+Soviet+Union+bletchley#v=onepage&amp;q=Churchill%20distrust%20Soviet%20Union%20bletchley&amp;f=false|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of World War II|page=571|first= Cathal J. |last=Nolan|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2010|volume=1|isbn=978-0313330506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only direct enemy damage to the site was done 20{{ndash}}21 November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for [[Bletchley railway station]]; Hut{{nbsp}}4, shifted two feet off its foundation, was winched back into place as
work inside continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bletchley Park National Codes Centre |title=The Cafe in Hut 4 |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content//index.rhtm |accessdate=3 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119043409/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content//index.rhtm |archive-date=19 January 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Intelligence reporting==
[[File:Ultra Hut3 Graph.png|thumbnail|upright=1.5| Average daily number of Signals to Commands Abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1999|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Initially, when only a very limited amount of Enigma traffic was being read,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | last = Hinsley | first = F.H. | author-link = Harry Hinsley | year = 1993 | title= Introduction: The influence of Ultra in the Second World War }} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; deciphered non-Naval Enigma messages were sent from [[Hut&amp;nbsp;6]] to [[Hut 3]] which handled their translation and onward transmission. Subsequently, under [[Eric Malcolm Jones|Group Captain Eric Jones]], Hut 3 expanded to become the heart of Bletchley Park’s intelligence effort, with input from decrypts of “[[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]]” (Lorenz SZ42) traffic and many other sources.  Early in 1942 it moved into Block D, but its functions were still referred to as Hut 3.{{sfn|Kenyon|2019|p=75}}

Hut 3 contained a number of sections: Air Section &quot;3A&quot;, Military Section &quot;3M&quot;, a small Naval Section &quot;3N&quot;, a multi-service Research Section &quot;3G&quot; and a large liaison section &quot;3L&quot;.{{sfn|Kenyon|2019|pp=78, 81, 83}} It also housed the Traffic Analysis Section, SIXTA.{{sfn|Kenyon|2019|p=70}} An important function that allowed the synthesis of raw messages into valuable [[Military intelligence]] was the indexing and cross-referencing of information in a number of different filing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Nelson |first= Eric L. |title= The peripheral and central indexes at Bletchley Park during the Second World War |journal= The Indexer |volume= 36 |issue= 3 |pages= 95–101 |date= September 2018 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328267522_The_peripheral_and_central_indexes_at_Bletchley_Park_during_the_Second_World_War }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence reports were sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service, the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries, and later on to high-level commanders in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|pp=70–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Naval Enigma deciphering was in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;8]], with translation in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;4]]. Verbatim translations were sent to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] (NID) of the Admiralty's Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC), supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross-references from a knowledge store of German naval technology. &lt;ref name=&quot;Calvocoressi 2001 29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where relevant to non-naval matters, they would also be passed to Hut 3. Hut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher, which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network. Feeding these back to Hut{{nbsp}}8 provided excellent &quot;cribs&quot; for [[Known-plaintext attack]]s on the daily naval Enigma key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|2011|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Listening stations==
Initially, a [[radio|wireless]] room was established at Bletchley Park.
It was set up in the mansion's water tower under the code name &quot;Station&amp;nbsp;X&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;WatsonP307&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1993|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. The &quot;X&quot; is the [[Roman numeral]] &quot;ten&quot;, this being the Secret Intelligence Service's tenth such station. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby [[Whaddon Hall]] to avoid drawing attention to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pidgeon|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, other listening stations{{snd}}the [[Y-stations]], such as the ones at [[RAF Chicksands|Chicksands]] in Bedfordshire, [[Beaumanor Hall]], Leicestershire (where the headquarters of the War Office &quot;Y&quot; Group was located) and [[Beeston Hill Y Station]] in Norfolk{{snd}}gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle [[despatch rider]]s or (later) by teleprinter.&lt;ref name=teleprinters&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1440534|title=Teleprinter Building, Bletchley Park|publisher=Pastscape|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional buildings==
The wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Watson |first=Bob |title=Appendix: How the Bletchley Park buildings took shape |pages=306–310}} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=149–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a hut's number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original &quot;Hut&quot; designation.&lt;ref&gt;Some of this information has been derived from [http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/history/RollofHonour.rhtm The Bletchley Park Trust's Roll of Honour] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518133112/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/history/RollofHonour.rhtm |date=18 May 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totalmk.co.uk/whats-on/virtual-lorenz-revealed-in-tribute-to-wartime-codebreakers-at-bletchley-park|title=Virtual Lorenz revealed in tribute to wartime codebreakers at Bletchley Park|publisher=Total MK|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luftwaffe]] messages were the first to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the [[US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombe]] that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.&lt;ref name=teleprinters/&gt;

[[File:Colossus.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Mark 2 Colossus computer. The ten Colossi were the world's first (semi-) programmable electronic computers, the first having been built in 1943]]

The [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|Lorenz messages]] were codenamed ''Tunny'' at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks were used for high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the [[Testery]] (named after [[Ralph Tester]], its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his team at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]]. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of 1 June in time for [[Normandy landings|D-day]]. Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the [[Newmanry]] after its head [[Max Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bletchley's work was essential to defeating the [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and to the British naval victories in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] and the [[Battle of North Cape]]. In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the [[North African Campaign|North African desert campaign]] against German forces under General [[Erwin Rommel]]. General Sir [[Claude Auchinleck]] wrote that were it not for Ultra, &quot;Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo&quot;. While not changing the events,&lt;!--maybe instead we should list more situations in which events WERE changed--&gt; &quot;[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]&quot; decrypts featured prominently in the story of [[Operation Salaam|Operation SALAM]], [[László Almásy]]'s mission across [[Western Desert (Egypt)|the desert]] behind Allied lines in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Kuno, Michael Rolke and András Zboray, [http://fjexpeditions.com/resources/salam/operation_salam.htm Operation SALAM] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516121757/http://fjexpeditions.com/resources/salam/operation_salam.htm |date=16 May 2013 }} - László Almásy’s most daring Mission in the Desert War, Belleville, München, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Normandy landings]] on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany's fifty-eight Western-front divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian signals===
{{see also|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}
Italian signals had been of interest since Italy's attack on Abyssinia in 1935.
During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the [[Royal Italian Navy|Italian Navy]] used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.
When Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were &quot;wholesale changes&quot; in Italian codes and cyphers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lwKuAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT87&amp;dq=Bletchley+%22Italian+Navy%22+%22K+model%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Bletchley%20%22Italian%20Navy%22%20%22K%20model%22&amp;f=false|title=The Bletchley Park Codebreakers|first= Michael|last= Smith|publisher=Biteback|year=2011|isbn=978-1849540780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women (&quot;Dilly's girls&quot;), who included [[Margaret Rock]], Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and [[Mavis Batey|Mavis Lever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grey|2012|pp=1323–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mavis Lever solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy's operational plans before the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in 1941, leading to a British victory.&lt;ref name=batey&gt;{{Citation |last=Batey |first=Mavis | author-link = Mavis Batey |title=Breaking Italian Naval Enigma |year=2011 |page=81}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|pp=79–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Cunningham]] visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.&lt;ref name=batey/&gt;

On entering World War II in June 1940, the [[Italy|Italians]] were using book codes for most of their military messages. The exception was the [[Italian Navy]], which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the [[C-38 (cipher machine)|C-38]] version of the [[Boris Hagelin]] [[Rotor machine|rotor-based]] [[cipher machine]], particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hinsley |first=Sir Harry | author-link = Harry Hinsley |title=The Influence of ULTRA in the Second World War |origyear=1993 |year=1996 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/Historical/hinsley.html |accessdate=23 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706194507/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/Historical/hinsley.html |archivedate=6 July 2012}} Transcript of a lecture given on Tuesday 19 October 1993 at Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;
As a consequence, [[James Ramsay Montagu Butler|JRM Butler]] recruited his former student [[Bernard Willson]] to join a team with two others in Hut{{nbsp}}4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dakin |first=Alec Naylor |year=1993 |title=The Z Watch in Hut 4, Part I }} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=50{{ndash}}56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Patrick |year=1993 |title=Italian naval ciphers}} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=61–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1941, Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommel's [[Afrika Korps]]. This led to increased shipping losses and, from reading the intercepted traffic, the team learnt that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the [[Luftwaffe]] in North Africa reduced by 90 percent.&lt;ref name=BPJuly41&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/index/july1941.rhtm |title=July 1941 |publisher=Bletchley Park |accessdate=23 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117213633/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/index/july1941.rhtm |archive-date=17 January 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes.&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Middle East Intelligence Centre (MEIC) was set up in Cairo in 1939. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo. A Combined Bureau Middle East (CBME) was set up in November, though the Middle East authorities made &quot;increasingly bitter complaints&quot; that [[GC&amp;CS]] was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers. However, the principle of concentrating high-grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley, Harry]] ''British Intelligence in the Second World War, Volume One: Its Influence on Strategy and Operations'' (1979, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London) pp. 191{{ndash}}221, 570{{ndash}}72 {{ISBN|0 11 630933 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Chadwick]] started cryptanalysis work in 1942 on Italian signals at the naval base 'HMS Nile' in Alexandria. Later, he was with GC&amp;CS; in the Heliopolis Museum, Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens, Alexandria.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAMBRIDGE&quot;&gt;[http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/faculty/research_groups_and_societies/mycenaean_epigraphy/decipherment/life_of_chadwick/ &quot;Life of John Chadwick : 1920 - 1998 : Classical Philologist, Lexicographer and Co-decipherer of Linear B&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017230923/http://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/faculty/research_groups_and_societies/mycenaean_epigraphy/decipherment/life_of_chadwick/ |date=2010-10-17 }}, Faculty of Classics, Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet signals===
Soviet signals had been studied since the 1920s. In 1939{{ndash}}40, [[John Tiltman]] (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at [[Sarafand al-Amar|Sarafand]] in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&amp;CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13–34}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese signals===
An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], then [[Kilindini Harbour|Kilindini]], [[Mombasa]], Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Michael |title=Mombasa was base for high-level UK espionage operation |url=http://www.coastweek.com/codes.htm |work=coastweek.com |publisher=Coastweek |accessdate=20 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515123737/http://www.coastweek.com/codes.htm |archive-date=15 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the [[Wireless Experimental Centre]] at [[Delhi]], India.&lt;ref name=smith54&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=54–55, 175–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war's end. Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;7]], under [[John Tiltman]].&lt;ref name=smith54/&gt;

By mid-1945, well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at [[Arlington Hall]], Virginia. In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: &quot;Only now are the British codebreakers (like [[John Tiltman]], [[Hugh Foss]], and [[Eric Nave]]) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2001|pp=127{{ndash}}51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war==

===Continued secrecy===
After the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=129{{ndash}}35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as &quot;the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor's net and appeared in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thirsk|2008|pp=61–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of [[F. W. Winterbotham|F.{{nbsp}}W. Winterbotham's]] ''The Ultra Secret'' (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Winterbotham |first=F. W. | author-link = F.W. Winterbotham |title=The Ultra Secret |place=London |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; public discussion of Bletchley's work finally became possible (though even today some former staff still consider themselves bound to silence)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Withers-Green |first=Sheila |title=audiopause audio:&lt;!--&lt;&lt;regularize this cite--&gt; I made a promise that I wouldn't say anything |year=2010 |url=http://audioboo.fm/boos/176850-i-made-a-promise-that-i-wouldn-t-say-anything-sheila-withers-green-bpark2010?playlist_direction=forward |accessdate=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045611/http://audioboo.fm/boos/176850-i-made-a-promise-that-i-wouldn-t-say-anything-sheila-withers-green-bpark2010?playlist_direction=forward |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2009 the British government announced that Bletchley personnel would be recognised with a commemorative badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5789263/Enigma-codebreakers-to-be-honoured-finally.html |title=Enigma codebreakers to be honoured finally |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=3 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809120446/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5789263/Enigma-codebreakers-to-be-honoured-finally.html |archive-date=9 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |date=10 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site===
After the war, the site passed through a succession of hands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9678.asp|title=Solo Travel Summer Home Preparation|website=Bellaonline.com|accessdate=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311205544/http://bellaonline.com/articles/art9678.asp|archive-date=11 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw a number of uses, including as a teacher-training college and local [[General Post Office|GPO]] headquarters. By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bletchleypark.org.uk/our-story/why-it-matters/preserving-bletchley-park|title=Preserving Bletchley Park|publisher=Bletchley Park|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1992, the [[Milton Keynes Borough Council]] declared most of the Park a conservation area, and the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum. The site opened to visitors in 1993, and was formally inaugurated by the Duke of Kent as Chief Patron in July 1994. In 1999 the land owners, the [[Office of Government Commerce|Property Advisors to the Civil Estate]] and [[BT Group|BT]], granted a lease to the Trust giving it control over most of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/recent.rhtm|title=Bletchley Park History|author=Bletchley Park Trust.|website=Bletchleypark.org.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102204518/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/recent.rhtm|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
