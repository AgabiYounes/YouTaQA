'''Baldr''' (also '''Balder''', '''Baldur''') is a [[Æsir|god]] in [[Norse mythology]] and a son of the god [[Odin]] and the goddess [[Frigg]]. He has [[Sons of Odin|numerous brothers]], such as [[Thor]] and [[Váli]].

During the 12th century, Danish accounts by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a [[Euhemerism|euhemerized]] account of his story. Compiled in [[Iceland]] during the 13th century, but based on much older [[Old Norse poetry]], the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the [[Æsir]] and a harbinger of [[Ragnarök]].

According to ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', a book of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Prose Edda, Baldr's wife is [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] and their son is [[Forseti]]. Baldr had the greatest ship ever built, [[Hringhorni]], and there is no place more beautiful than his hall, [[Breidablik]].

==Name==
[[Jacob Grimm]], in his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]'' (ch. 11), identifies Old Norse ''Baldr'' with the Old High German ''Baldere'' (2nd [[Merseburg Incantations|Merseburg Charm]], Thuringia), ''Palter'' (theonym, Bavaria), ''Paltar'' (personal name) and with Old English ''bealdor, baldor'' &quot;lord, prince, king&quot; (used always with a genitive plural, as in ''gumena baldor'' &quot;lord of men&quot;, ''wigena baldor'' &quot;lord of warriors&quot;, et cetera). Old Norse shows this usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in ''baldur î brynju'' ([[Saemundar Edda|Sæm.]] 272b) and ''herbaldr'' (Sæm. 218b), epithets of heroes in general.

Grimm traces the etymology of the name to *''balþaz'', whence Gothic ''balþs'', Old English ''bald'', Old High German ''pald'', all meaning &quot;bold, brave&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Baldrs'' would in strictness appear to have no connexion with the Goth. ''balþs'' (bold, audax), nor ''Paltar'' with the OHG. ''pald'', nor ''Baldr'' with the ON. ''ballr'' 'dangerous, dire'. As a rule, the Gothic ''ld'' is represented by ON. ''ld'' and OHG. ''lt'': the Gothic ''lþ'' by ON. ''ll'' and OHG. ''ld''. But the OS. and AS. have ''ld'' in both cases, and even in Gothic, ON. and OHG. a root will sometimes appear in both forms in the same language; so that a close connexion between ''balþs'' and ''Baldrs'', ''pald'' and Paltar, is possible after all.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

But the interpretation of Baldr as &quot;the brave god&quot; may be secondary. Baltic (cf. Lithuanian ''[[:wikt:baltas|baltas]]'', Latvian ''[[:wikt:balts|balts]]'') has a word meaning &quot;the white, the good&quot;, and Grimm speculates that the name may originate as a Baltic loan into [[Proto-Germanic]].
In continental Saxon and Anglo-Saxon tradition, the son of [[Odin|Woden]] is called not ''Bealdor'' but ''Baldag'' (Saxon) and ''[[Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies#Wessex and Bernicia|Bældæg, Beldeg]]'' (Anglo-Saxon), which shows association with &quot;day&quot;, possibly with [[Dagr|Day]] personified as a deity. This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning &quot;shining one, white one, a god&quot; derived from the meaning of Baltic ''baltas'', further adducing Slavic ''[[Belobog]]'' and German ''[[Berhta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Bæl-dæg'' itself is white-god, light-god, he that shines as sky and light and day, the kindly ''Bièlbôgh, Bèlbôgh'' of the Slav system. It is in perfect accord with this explanation of ''Bæl-dæg'', that the Anglo-Saxon tale of ancestry assigns to him a son Brond, of whom the Edda is silent, ''brond, brand'', ON. ''brandr'' (fire brand or blade of a sword), signifying ''jubar, fax, titio''. Bældæg therefore, as regards his name, would agree with ''Berhta'', the bright goddess.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grimm's etymology is endorsed by modern research. According to Rudolf Simek, the original name for Baldr must be understood as 'shining day'.&lt;ref&gt;Simek. ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology'', 2007, 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merseburg Incantation===
One of the two [[Merseburg Incantations]] names ''Baldere'', but also mentions a figure named ''Phol'', considered to be a byname for Baldr (as in Scandinavian ''Falr'', ''Fjalarr''; (in Saxo) ''Balderus'' : ''Fjallerus'').&lt;ref name=CALVIN&gt;[[Calvin Thomas (linguist)|Calvin, Thomas]]. ''An Anthology of German Literature'', D. C. Heath &amp; Co. ASIN: B0008BTK3E,B00089RS3K. P5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Poetic Edda''===
[[Image:Mímer and Balder Consulting the Norns (1821-1822) by H. E. Freund.jpg|thumb|&quot;Mímir and Baldr Consulting the Norns&quot; (1821–1822) by [[H. E. Freund]].]]

In the Poetic Edda the tale of Baldr's death is referred to rather than recounted at length. Among the visions which the [[Völva]] sees and describes in the prophecy known as the ''[[Völuspá]]'' is one of the fatal [[mistletoe]], the birth of [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]] and the weeping of [[Frigg]] (stanzas 31–33).  Yet looking far into the future the Völva sees a brighter vision of a new world, when both Höðr and Baldr will come back (stanza 62). The Eddic poem ''[[Baldr's Dreams]]'' mentions that Baldr has bad dreams which the gods then discuss. [[Odin]] rides to Hel and awakens a seeress, who tells him [[Höðr]] will kill Baldr but Vali will avenge him (stanzas 9, 11).

In ''Gylfaginning'', Baldur is described as follows:

:''Annar sonur Óðins er Baldur, og er frá honum gott að segja. Hann er svá fagr álitum ok bjartr svá at lýsir af honum, ok eitt gras er svá hvítt at jafnat er til Baldrs brár. Þat er allra grasa hvítast, ok þar eptir máttu marka fegrð hans bæði á hár og á líki. Hann er vitrastr ása ok fegrst talaðr ok líknsamastr. En sú náttúra fylgir honum at engi má haldask dómr hans.

:The second son of Odin is Baldur, and good things are to be said of him. He is best, and all praise him; he is so fair of feature, and so bright, that light shines from him. [[Matricaria perforata|A certain herb]] is so white that it is likened to Baldr's brow; of all grasses it is whitest, and by it thou mayest judge his fairness, both in hair and in body.

Apart from this description, Baldr is known primarily for the story of his death, which is seen as the first in a chain of events that will ultimately lead to the destruction of the gods at [[Ragnarök]]. According to ''[[Völuspá]]'', Baldr will be reborn in the new world.

He had a dream of his own death and his mother had the same dreams. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this depressed him, so his mother [[Frigg]] made every object on earth [[vow]] never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except [[mistletoe]]&lt;ref name=&quot;The Children of Odin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Children of Odin |first=Padraic |last=Colum |author-link=Padraic Colum |publisher=Aladdin Paperbacks |year=1920 |isbn=0-689-86885-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill Kaplan, 'Once More on the Mistletoe', in ''News from Other Worlds/''Tíðendi ór ǫðrum heimum'': Studies in Nordic Folklore, Mythology and Culture in Honor of John F. Lindow'', ed. by Merrill Kaplan and Timothy R.

When [[Loki]], the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god [[Höðr]], who then inadvertently killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the asynja [[Rindr]] gave birth to [[Váli (son of Odin)|Váli]], who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose/069072.php |title=Gylfaginning, XLIX |access-date=2007-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184501/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose/069072.php |archive-date=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship, [[Hringhorni]], the largest of all ships. As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered in his ear. This was to be a key riddle asked by Odin (in disguise) of the giant [[Vafthrudnir]] (and which was unanswerable) in the poem ''[[Vafthrudnismal]]''. The riddle also appears in the riddles of [[Gestumblindi]] in ''[[Hervarar saga]]''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Carolyne Larrington in her translation of the ''Poetic Edda'' it is assumed that what Odin whispered in Baldr's ear was a promise of resurrection.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dwarf [[Litr]] was kicked by [[Thor]] into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldr's wife, also threw herself on the funeral fire to await Ragnarök when she would be reunited with her husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by [[Hyrrokin]], a [[giantess]], who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.

Upon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger [[Hermóðr|Hermod]], [[Hel (goddess)|Hel]] promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. All did, except a [[giantess]], [[Þökk]] (often presumed to be the god [[Loki]] in disguise), who refused to mourn the slain god. Thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarök, when he and his brother Höðr would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.

===''Gesta Danorum''===
[[File:Baldur by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9| ''Baldur'' by [[Johannes Gehrts]].]]

Writing during the end of the 12th century, the [[Denmark|Danish]] historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] tells the story of Baldr (recorded as ''Balderus'') in a form that professes to be historical.  According to him, Balderus and Høtherus were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of [[Norway]]. Balderus was a demigod and common [[steel]] could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the other gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and Høtherus married the princess.

Nevertheless, Balderus took heart of grace and again met Høtherus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. Høtherus dealt him a deadly wound with a [[magic sword]], named [[Mistilteinn|Mistletoe]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|Davidson, H.R. Ellis]] (1964). ''Gods and Myths of Northern Europe''. Pelican Books. {{ISBN|0-14-013627-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he had received from Mimir, the satyr of the woods; after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.

===''Chronicon Lethrense'' and ''Annales Lundenses''===
There are also two lesser known Danish Latin chronicles, the ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'' and the ''[[Annales Lundenses]]'' of which the latter is included in the former. These two sources provide a second euhemerized account of Höðr's slaying of Baldr.

It relates that Hother was the king of the [[Saxons]] and son of [[Hothbrodd]] and [[Hadding]]. Hother first slew Othen's (i.e. Odin) son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor. Finally, Othen's son Both killed Hother. Hother, Balder, Othen and Thor were incorrectly considered to be gods.

===Utrecht Inscription===
A Latin votive inscription from Utrecht, from the 3rd or 4th century C.E., has been theorized as containing the dative form ''Baldruo'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Die germanischen Götternamen der antiken Inschriften&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Die germanischen Götternamen der antiken Inschriften |first=Siegfried |last=Gutenbrunner |publisher=Max Niemeyer Verlag |year=1936 |isbn=}}, p. 210 &amp; pp. 218-20.&lt;/ref&gt; pointing to a Latin nominative singular *''Baldruus'', which some have identified with the Norse/Germanic god,&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathen Gods in Old English Literature&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Heathen Gods in Old English Literature |first=Richard |last=North |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_LKUIqNvPQC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Heathen+Gods+in+Old+English+Literature#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |isbn=0-521-55183-8}}, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; although both the reading and this interpretation have been questioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Ægir tot Ymir: personages en thema's uit de Germaanse en Noordse mythologie&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Van Ægir tot Ymir: personages en thema's uit de Germaanse en Noordse mythologie |first=Pamela &amp; Quak, Arend |last=Vermeyden |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=90-6168-661-X}}, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;''Balder'', in Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=''Balder'', in Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde |first=Karl |last=Helm |publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG |year=1976 |isbn=}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anglo Saxon Chronicles ===
In the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|Anglo Saxon Chronicles]] Baldr is named as the ancestor of the monarchy of [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]], [[Bernicia]], [[Deira]], and [[Wessex]] through his supposed son [[Anglo-Saxon royal genealogies|Brond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anglo-Saxons Chronicle (Winchester Chronicle)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
[[Image:Tripleurospermum perforatum.JPG|right|thumb|[[Matricaria perforata|Baldr's brow]] (Matricaria perforata'')]]
As referenced in ''Gylfaginning'', in [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], the [[Matricaria perforata|scentless mayweed]] (''Matricaria perforata'') and the similar [[sea mayweed]] (''Matricaria maritima'') are both called ''baldursbrá'' &quot;Balder's brow&quot; and regionally in northern England (''baldeyebrow'').&lt;ref name=&quot;linnaeus&quot;/&gt; In [[Iceland]] only the former is found.&lt;ref name=&quot;linnaeus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/astera/tripl/tripper.html|title=Den virtuella floran: Tripleurospermum perforatum (Mérat) Laínz - Baldersbrå|author=Anna-Lena Anderberg|work=nrm.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany [[lily-of-the-valley]] is known as ''weisser Baldrian''; variations using or influenced by reflexes of ''Phol'' include ''Faltrian'' (upper Austria), Villum''fallum'' (Salzburg), and ''Fildron'' or ''Faldron'' (Tyrol).

===Toponyms===
There are a few old place names in Scandinavia that contain the name ''Baldr''. The most certain and notable one is the (former) parish name [[Balleshol]] in Hedmark county, Norway: &quot;a Balldrshole&quot; 1356 (where the last element is ''hóll'' m &quot;mound; small hill&quot;). Others may be (in [[North Germanic languages|Norse]] forms) ''Baldrsberg'' in Vestfold county, ''Baldrsheimr'' in Hordaland county ''Baldrsnes'' in Sør-Trøndelag county—and (very uncertain) the [[Balsfjorden]] fjord and [[Balsfjord]] municipality in Troms county.

In [[Copenhagen]], there is also a Baldersgade, or &quot;Balder's Street&quot;. A street in downtown [[Reykjavík]] is called Baldursgata (Baldur's Street).

In [[Sweden]] there is a Baldersgatan (Balder's Street) in [[Stockholm]]. There is also Baldersnäs (Balder's isthmus), Baldersvik (Balder's bay), Balders udde (Balder's headland) and Baldersberg (Balder's mountain) at various places.
