'''''Bar Kokhba''''' is a [[double album]] by [[John Zorn]], recorded between 1994 and 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tzadik.com/index.php?catalog=7108-2 Tzadik catalogue]&lt;/ref&gt; It features music from Zorn's ''[[Masada (band)|Masada]]'' project, rearranged for small ensembles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://masada.world/book-one/bar-kokhba/bar-kokhba.html Bar Kokhba album on Masada World]&lt;/ref&gt; It also features the original soundtrack from ''The Art of Remembrance – Simon Wiesenthal'', a film by Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel (1994–95).

== Reception ==
The [[AllMusic]] review by Marc Gilman awarded the album 4½ stars, noting that, &quot;While some compositions retain their original structure and sound, some are expanded and probed by Zorn's arrangements, and resemble avant-garde classical music more than jazz. But this is the beauty of the album; the ensembles provide a forum for Zorn to expand his compositions. The album consistently impresses.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;Gilman, M. [http://www.allmusic.com/album/bar-kokhba-r307394 Allmusic Review] accessed July 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
