In the aftermath of the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Belarus declared independence as the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]] became a founding [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]] in 1922 and was renamed as the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Byelorussian SSR). Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919–1921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the [[Second Polish Republic]] were reintegrated into it after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], and were finalized after World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=&quot;uni1&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o85YDMTeMrUC&amp;dq=reunification+of+western+belarus| title=National purpose in the world economy: post-Soviet states in comparative perspective| last=Abdelal| first=Rawi| year=2001| publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]| isbn=978-0-8014-3879-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni2&quot;&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGA4o-UhAfgC&amp;pg=PA713&amp;dq=reunification+of+western+belarus#v=onepage| title=Europa World Year, Book 1| last=Taylor &amp; Francis Group| year=2004| publisher=[[Routledge|Europa publications]] |isbn= 978-1-85743-254-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni3&quot;/&gt; During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;axell&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last=Axell| first=Albert| title=Russia's Heroes, 1941–45| publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers| year=2002| page=[https://archive.org/details/russiasheroes19400albe/page/247 247]| isbn=0-7867-1011-X| url=https://archive.org/details/russiasheroes19400albe/page/247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years.

In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, forming the [[Union State]]. Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49&amp;nbsp;million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], with sizable minorities of [[Russians]], [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The second-most widespread religion, [[Catholic Church in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]], has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as [[Public holidays in Belarus|national holidays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://president.gov.by/special/en/holidays_en/| title=The official Internet portal of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the [[European Union]] but nevertheless maintains a [[Belarus–European Union relations|bilateral relationship with the organisation]], and likewise participates in two EU projects: the [[Eastern Partnership]] and the [[Baku Initiative]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The name ''Belarus'' is closely related with the term ''Belaya Rus{{'}}'', i.e., ''[[White Rus']]''. There are several claims to the origin of the name ''White Rus'.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old [[Ruthenia]]n lands within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] that had been populated mostly by [[Slavs]] who had been Christianized early, as opposed to [[Black Ruthenia]], which was predominantly inhabited by pagan [[Balts]].&lt;ref&gt;Аб паходжанні назваў Белая і Чорная Русь (Eng. &quot;About the Origins of the Names of White and Black Ruthenia&quot;), Язэп Юхо (Joseph Juho), 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Minahan|1998|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third theory suggests that the old Rus' lands that were not conquered by the [[Tatars]] (i.e., Polotsk, Vitebsk and Mogilev) had been referred to as &quot;White Rus'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;/&gt;

The name ''Rus'' is often conflated with its Latin forms ''Russia'' and ''Ruthenia'', thus Belarus is often referred to as ''White Russia'' or ''White Ruthenia''. The name first appeared in [[Middle High German literature|German]] and [[Medieval Latin literature|Latin]] [[medieval literature]]; the chronicles of [[Jan of Czarnków]] mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke [[Jogaila]] and his mother at &quot;{{lang|la|Albae Russiae, Poloczk dicto}}&quot; in 1381.&lt;ref name=&quot;vauchez&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vauchez|Dobson|Lapidge|2001|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, including German, Afrikaans and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the country is generally called &quot;White Russia&quot; to this day (''{{lang|de|Weißrussland}}'' and ''{{lang|nl|Wit-Rusland}}'' respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Laenderinformationen/00-SiHi/BelarusSicherheit.html |title=Belarus: Reise- und Sicherheitshinweise |work=Auswärtiges Amt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/reisadviezen/inhoud/belarus-wit-rusland|title=Reisadvies Belarus (Wit-Rusland) |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin term &quot;Alba Russia&quot; was used again by [[Pope Pius VI]] in 1783 to recognize the [[Society of Jesus]] there, exclaiming &quot;{{lang|la|Approbo Societatem Jesu in Alba Russia degentem, approbo, approbo}}.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Courson|1879|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]], who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;alies&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bely |first=Alies |title=The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name |publisher=Encyclopedix |year=2000 |location=Minsk, Belarus |isbn=985-6599-12-1 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, the Russian [[tsar]]s used &quot;White Rus&quot; to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2001|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Belorussia'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Белору́ссия}}, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, ''Russia'') first rose in the days of the [[Russian Empire]], and the Russian Tsar was usually styled &quot;the Tsar of All the Russias&quot;, as ''Russia'' or the ''Russian Empire'' was formed by three parts of Russia—the [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Ruthenia|White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XAItI5C_JPUC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=Belorussia+Russian+Empire |title=Where Nation-States Come From: Institutional Change in the Age of Nationalism |author=Philip G. Roeder |date=15 December 2011 |isbn=978-0-691-13467-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oUydX_3rG0AC&amp;pg=PA385&amp;dq=Belorussia+name |title=Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity: The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts |date=13 April 2011 |isbn=978-0-19-983799-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, the term &quot;White Russia&quot; caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richmond|1995|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term ''Byelorussia'' was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, ''Byelorussia'' became commonly used in the regions of [[Białystok]] and [[Grodno]] during the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ioffe |first=Grigory |title=Understanding Belarus and How Western Foreign Policy Misses the Mark |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc |date=25 February 2008 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00B6wxgftH8C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=west+belarus |isbn=0-7425-5558-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Byelorussia'' (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus|Supreme Soviet]] of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Republic of Belarus'' ({{lang|ru|Республика Беларусь}} spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be &quot;Belarus&quot;. The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their [[Belarusian language]] forms.

{{Main|History of Belarus}}

===Early history===
From 5000 to 2000 BC, [[Bandkeramik]] cultures predominated. In addition, remains from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] were found in Belarus and parts of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Ian|last2=Jameson|first2=Robert|title=A Dictionary of Archaeology|publisher=Wiley|year=2008|pages=203–04|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HKDtlPuM2oC&amp;pg=PA203|isbn=978-0-470-75196-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cimmerians]] and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC, and by 500 AD, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the [[Scythians]] who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the [[Huns]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], swept through c. 400–600 AD, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.&lt;ref&gt;John Haywood, ''Historical Atlas, Ancient and Classical World'' (1998).&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:001 Kievan Rus' Kyivan Rus' Ukraine map 1220 1240.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] [[List of early East Slavic states|principalities]] before the Mongol and Lithuanian invasions]]
The region that is now Belarus was first settled by [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by Slavic tribes. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century the territory of modern Belarus became part of [[Kievan Rus']], a vast East Slavic state ruled by the [[Rurikid]] dynasty. Upon the death of Kievan Rus' ruler [[Yaroslav I the Wise]], the state split into independent principalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plokhy|first=Serhii|title=The Origins of the Slavic Nations|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|pages=94–95|isbn=0-521-86403-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many early Rus' principalities were virtually razed or severely affected by a major [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century, but the lands of modern Belarus avoided the brunt of the invasion and eventually joined the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Charles Henry|title=The Conversion of Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/conversioneurop00robigoog|publisher=Longmans, Green|year=1917|pages=491–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GDL Map, 15cent.png|thumb|upright=1|A map of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the 15th century. Belarus was fully within its borders.]]
There are no sources of military seizure, but the annals affirm the alliance and united foreign policy of Polotsk and Lithuania for decades. For example, the Chronicle of Novgorod informs about &quot;Izyaslav had been set to be Knyaz in Luki and covered Novgorod from the Lithuanians&quot; in 1198 when Luki is situated on the east from Polotsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michell|first1=Robert|last2=Shakhmaton|first2=A.A|last3=Forbes|first3=Nevill|last4=Beazley|first4=C.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{Further|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
On 2 February 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] were joined in a [[personal union]] through a [[Union of Krewo|marriage of their rulers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Michael|last=Rowell|first=S.C.|contribution=Baltic Europe|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History (Vol. 6)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|page=710|isbn=0-521-36290-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], created in 1569 by the [[Union of Lublin]].

The Lithuanian nobles were forced to go for rapprochement because of the threat coming from [[Muscovy]].
To strengthen the independence in the format of the union, three editions of the [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were issued in the 16th century. 
The third Article of the Statute establishes that all lands of Grand Duchy of Lithuania will be eternally in Grand Duchy of Lithuania and never enter as a part of other states. It allowed to own the land within Grand Duchy of Lithuania only to own families. Anyone from outside Duchy would be honored with property only own it after swearing to Grand Duke of Lithuania. These articles were aimed to defend the rights of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania nobility against Polish, Prussian and other aristocracy of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

In the years following the union, the process of gradual [[Polonization]] of both Lithuanians and Ruthenians gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the [[Polish language]] and [[Catholicism]] became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Ruthenian as the official language—with the Ruthenian language being banned from administrative use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&amp;menu=00 &quot;Belarusian&quot;: UCLA Language Materials Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171418/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&amp;menu=00 |date=22 December 2015 }}, ucla.edu; accessed 4 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]]. Statutes were initially only issued in [[Ruthenian language]] and later also in Polish. Around 1840 the Statutes were banned by the Russian tsar following the [[November Uprising]]. Modern Ukrainian lands used it until 1860s.

In a [[Russification]] drive in the 1840s, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] prohibited use of the Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded in a [[January Uprising|revolt]], led by [[Konstanty Kalinowski]]. After the failed revolt, the Russian government reintroduced the use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to Belarusian in 1864 and no documents in Belarusian were permitted by the Russian government until 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

The Belarusian People's Republic was the first attempt to create an independent Belarusian state under name &quot;Belarus&quot;. Despite significant efforts the state ceased to exist, primarily because the territory was continually dominated by the [[German Imperial Army]] and the [[Imperial Russian Army]] in [[World War I]], and then the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]]. It existed only from 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisites for the formation of the state idea around the name &quot;Belarus&quot;. The choice of the name was probably based on the fact that the educated core of the newly formed government was educated in the tsardom universities, with a corresponding education around the ideology of West-Russianism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jr.Zaprudnik2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vitali Silitski, Jr.|author2=Jan Zaprudnik|title=The A to Z of Belarus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bQXyAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA308|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4617-3174-0|pages=308–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of Central Lithuania]] was a short-lived political entity, which was the last attempt to restore Lithuania in the historical confederacy state (it was also supposed to create Lithuania Upper and Lithuania Lower).

Centered on the historical capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], [[Vilna]] ({{lang-lt|Vilnius}}, {{lang-pl|Wilno}}), for 18 months the entity served as a [[buffer state]] between [[Poland]], upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;von Rauch&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Georg von |last=Rauch |authorlink=Georg von Rauch | editor=Gerald Onn | title =The Baltic States: Years of Independence – Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 1917–40 | year =1974 | pages = 100–102 | chapter =The Early Stages of Independence | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=emBIdi4LPz8C&amp;pg=PA101 |publisher =C.

After the war, Belarus was among the 51 founding countries of the [[United Nations Charter]] and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN, on top of the Soviet Union's vote. Vigorous postwar reconstruction promptly followed the end of the war and the Byelorussian SSR became a major center of manufacturing in the western USSR, creating jobs and attracting ethnic Russians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviet-era&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iexplore.com/travel-guides/europe/belarus/history-and-culture |title=Belarus History and Culture |accessdate=26 March 2006 |publisher=iExplore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borders of the Byelorussian SSR and Poland were redrawn, in accord with the 1919-proposed [[Curzon Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;olson95&quot;/&gt;

For the first time, he delivered a speech in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] (rather than Russian, which most people use), in which he said, &quot;We are not Russian—we are Belarusians&quot;, and later encouraged the use of Belarusian.

After the December completion of the [[2010 Belarusian presidential election|2010 presidential election]], Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% of the vote in elections.

The Byelorussian SSR was one of the two Soviet republics that joined the [[United Nations]] along with the Ukrainian SSR as one of the original 51 members in 1945. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, under international law, Belarus became the internationally recognized successor state to the Byelorussian SSR, retaining its UN membership.

Belarus and Russia have been close trading partners and diplomatic allies since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Belarus is dependent on Russia for imports of raw materials and for its export market.&lt;ref name=&quot;stategov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5371.htm|title=Background Note: Belarus|accessdate=7 November 2007|publisher=United States State Department|year=2007|author=United States Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
In 2014 the share of manufacturing in GDP was 37%, more than two thirds of this amount falls on manufacturing industries. The number of people employed in industry is 32.7% of the working population. The growth rate is much lower than for the economy as a whole – about 1.9% in 2014. At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Belarus was one of the world's most industrially developed states by percentage of GDP as well as the richest CIS member-state.&lt;ref name=&quot;wb97&quot;&gt;[[World Bank]]. &quot;Belarus: Prices, Markets, and Enterprise Reform,&quot; [https://books.google.com/books?id=0jCvjCHPHpcC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=ISBN0821339761#PPA1,M1 p. 1].

Belarus was once a major center of European Jews, with 10% of the population being [[history of the Jews in Belarus|Jewish]]. But since the mid-20th century, the number of Jews has been reduced by the [[Holocaust]], deportation, and emigration, so that today it is a very small minority of less than one percent.&lt;ref&gt;Minsk Jewish Campus [http://www.meod.by/en/belarus-info/jewish-belarus.html Jewish Belarus] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130824171216/http://www.meod.by/en/belarus-info/jewish-belarus.html|date=24 August 2013}}; retrieved {{Nowrap|9 July}} 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lipka Tatars]], numbering over 15,000, are predominantly [[Islam in Belarus|Muslims]].

By the 16th century, [[Polotsk]] resident [[Francysk Skaryna]] translated the Bible into Belarusian.

After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of &quot;Belarusianization&quot; was followed in the newly formed Byelorussian SSR. This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tereshkovich|first=Pavel|author2=Robert J.

Several poets and authors went into exile after the Nazi occupation of Belarus and would not return until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;byeb&quot;/&gt;

The last major revival of Belarusian literature occurred in the 1960s with novels published by [[Vasil Bykaŭ]] and [[Uladzimir Karatkievich]]. An influential author who devoted his work to awakening the awareness of the catastrophes the country has suffered, was [[Ales Adamovich]]. He was named by [[Svetlana Alexievich]], the Belarusian winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] 2015, as &quot;her main teacher, who helped her to find a path of her own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alexievich.info/biogr_EN.html ''Svetlana Alexievich: Voices from Big Utopia''], alexievich.info; accessed 4 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Music of Belarus|Music in Belarus]] largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 19th century, Polish composer [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]] and created the opera ''Sialanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Crystal|last=Zou|title=Ballets for Christmas|date=11 December 2003|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html|work=Shanghai Star|accessdate=20 December 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225084753/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html|archivedate=25 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland. During this period, [[Anatoly Bogatyrev]], creator of the opera ''In Polesye Virgin Forest'', served as the &quot;tutor&quot; of Belarusian composers.&lt;ref name=&quot;clasmus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/music/Belarusian_composers_&amp;_classical_music.htm|title=Classical Music of Belarus|publisher=Belarusguide.com|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academic Theatre of Ballet in Minsk was awarded the [[Prix Benois de la Danse|Benois de la Dance Prize]] in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;clasmus&quot;/&gt; Rock music has become increasingly popular in recent years, though the Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio in favor of traditional Belarusian music.

===Dress===
The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus']] period. Due to the cool climate, clothes were designed to preserve body heat and were usually made from [[flax]] or [[wool]]. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/clothing/index.html|title=Belarusian traditional clothing|publisher=Belarusguide.com|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates the hoist of the [[Flag of Belarus|Belarusian national flag]], adopted in a [[1995 Belarusian referendum|disputed referendum]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/by.html#orn|title=Belarus – Ornament, Flags of the World|publisher=Fotw.fivestarflags.com|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Potato pancakes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potato pancake|Draniki]], the national dish]]
[[Belarusian cuisine]] consists mainly of vegetables, meat (particularly pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or [[stewed]]. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals later in the day. [[Wheat]] and [[rye]] breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of [[bread and salt]] when greeting a guest or visitor.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Citizenship and Immigration&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project&amp;nbsp;– Eating the Belarusian Way] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320041709/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html |date=20 March 2007 }} (1998); retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
