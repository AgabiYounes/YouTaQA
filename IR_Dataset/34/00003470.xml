Its citizens are known as ''Burkinabé'' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɜːr|ˈ|k|iː|n|ə|b|eɪ}} {{respell|bur|KEE|nə|bay}}). Its capital is [[Ouagadougou]].

The [[Republic of Upper Volta]] was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]], and on 5 August 1960 it gained full independence, with [[Maurice Yaméogo]] as [[List of heads of state of Burkina Faso|President]]. After protests by students and [[labour union]] members, Yaméogo was deposed in the [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1966 coup d'état]], led by [[Sangoulé Lamizana]], who became President. His rule coincided with the [[Sahel drought|Sahel drought and famine]], and facing problems from the country's traditionally powerful trade unions he was deposed in the [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1980 coup d'état]], led by [[Saye Zerbo]]. Encountering resistance from trade unions again, Zerbo's government was overthrown in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1982 coup d'état]], led by [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]].  

The leader of the leftist faction of Ouédraogo's government, [[Thomas Sankara]], was made [[List of Prime Ministers of Burkina Faso|Prime Minister]] but was later imprisoned. Efforts to free him led to the popularly-supported 1983 coup d'état, in which he became President.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReutersChe2&quot;&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/assets/print?aid=USL17577712 Burkina Faso Salutes &quot;Africa's Che&quot; Thomas Sankara] by Mathieu Bonkoungou, ''[[Reuters]]'', 17 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UprightDVD&quot;&gt;[http://newsreel.org/nav/title.asp?tc=CN0205 ''Thomas Sankara: the Upright Man''] by ''[[California Newsreel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara renamed the country Burkina Faso and launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme which included a nationwide [[literacy]] campaign, [[land redistribution]] to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriage]]s and [[polygamy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UprightDVD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grila2&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120124093433/http://www.zcommunications.org/commemorating-thomas-sankara-by-farid-omar Commemorating Thomas Sankara] by Farid Omar, ''Group for Research and Initiative for the Liberation of Africa'' (GRILA), 28 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara was overthrown and killed in the [[1987 Burkinabé coup d'état|1987 coup d'état]] led by [[Blaise Compaoré]] – deteriorating relations with former coloniser France and its ally the Ivory Coast were the reason given for the coup.

==Etymology==
Formerly called the Republic of Upper Volta, the country was renamed &quot;Burkina Faso&quot; on 4 August 1984 by then-President Thomas Sankara. The words &quot;Burkina&quot; and &quot;Faso&quot; both stem from different languages spoken in the country: &quot;Burkina&quot; comes from [[Mossi language|Mossi]] and means &quot;upright&quot;, showing how the people are proud of their integrity, while &quot;Faso&quot; comes from the [[Dioula language]] and means &quot;fatherland&quot; (literally, &quot;father's house&quot;). The &quot;bè&quot; suffix added onto &quot;Burkina&quot; to form the demonym &quot;Burkinabè&quot; comes from the [[Fula language]] and means &quot;men or women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://afrolegends.com/2013/09/12/why-the-name-burkina-faso/|title=Why the name: Burkina Faso?|date=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA summarizes the etymology as &quot;land of the honest (incorruptible) men&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uv.html|title=Africa – Burkina Faso|date=21 December 2018|website=CIA|accessdate=16 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French colony of Upper Volta was named for its location on the upper courses of the [[Volta River]] (the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[Red Volta|Red]] and [[White Volta]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=by3eqBwNRyIC&amp;pg=PA21|title=iAfrica – Ancient History UNTOLD|publisher=Forbidden Fruit Books LLC|pages=21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of Burkina Faso}}

===Early history===
The northwestern part of present-day Burkina Faso was populated by [[hunter-gatherer]]s from 14000 BC to 5000 BC. Their tools, including [[scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], [[chisel]]s and [[arrowhead]]s, were discovered in 1973 through [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} [[Agricultural]] settlements were established between 3600 and 2600&amp;nbsp;BC.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The [[Bura culture]] was an [[iron age|Iron-Age]] [[civilization]] centred in the southwest portion of modern-day Niger and in the southeast part of contemporary Burkina Faso.&lt;ref name=&quot;whc.unesco.org&quot;&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Centre. [https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5045/ &quot;Site archéologique de Bura&quot;]. ''unesco.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iron industry]], in [[smelting]] and [[forging]] for tools and weapons, had developed in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] by 1200&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Various ethnic groups of present-day Burkina Faso, such as the [[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Fula people|Fula]] and [[Dyula people|Dioula]], arrived in successive waves between the 8th and 15th centuries. From the 11th century, the Mossi people established [[Mossi Kingdoms|several separate kingdoms]]. 
[[File:Africa de l'Oèst en 1875-es.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|West Africa circa 1875]]

In the 1890s, during the European [[Scramble for Africa]], the territory of Burkina Faso was invaded by [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Colonialism|colonial]] control was established following a war of conquest between 1896 and 1904. The territory was made part of [[French West Africa]] in 1904, and the colony of [[French Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The colony was named for its location on the upper courses of the [[Volta River]] (the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[Red Volta|Red]] and [[White Volta]]).

===8th Century to 18th century===
Historians began to debate about the exact dates when Burkina Faso's many ethnic groups arrived to the area. The [[Moosei people|Proto-Mossi]] arrived in the far Eastern part of what is today Burkina Faso sometime between the 8th and 11th centuries,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rupley|Rupley]], p.&amp;nbsp;27&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Samo language (Burkina)|Samo]] arrived around the 15th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#Rupley|Rupley]], p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] lived in Burkina Faso's north and northwest regions until sometime in the 15th or 16th centuries,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and many of the other ethnic groups that make up the country's population arrived in the region during this time.

[[File:Pg381 Des hommes sur les toits s'opposent.jpg|thumb|Armed men prevent the French explorer [[Louis-Gustave Binger]] from entering Sia (Bobo-Dioulasso) during his stay in April 1892.]]
During the [[Middle Ages]] the Mossi established several separate kingdoms including those of Tenkodogo, Yatenga, Zandoma, and Ouagadougou.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nations 2014&quot;&gt;&quot;Encyclopedia of the Nations.&quot; History. Advameg, Inc., n.d. Web. 8 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime between 1328 and 1338 Mossi warriors raided [[Timbuktu]] but the Mossi were defeated by [[Sonni Ali]] of [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] at the Battle of Kobi in Mali in 1483.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rupley|Rupley]], p. xxvioi&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 16th century the Songhai conducted many slave raids into what is today Burkina Faso.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; During the 18th century the Gwiriko Empire was established at [[Bobo Dioulasso]] and ethnic groups such as the Dyan, Lobi, and Birifor settled along the [[Black Volta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rupley|Rupley]], p. xxvix&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more citations needed section|date=December 2017}}
Starting in the early 1890s a series of [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] military officers made attempts to claim parts of what is today Burkina Faso. At times these [[colonialists]] and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties. The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties amongst themselves. Through a complex series of events what is today Burkina Faso eventually became a French protectorate in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rupley|Rupley]], pp.&amp;nbsp;30–33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|[[French West Africa]] circa 1913]]
The eastern and western regions, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler [[Samori Ture]] complicated the situation, came under French occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso was nominally conquered; however, French control of many parts remained uncertain.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The [[Anglo-French Convention of 1898|Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898]] created the country's modern borders. In the French territory, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony of [[French West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].

The language of colonial administration and schooling became French. The public education system started from humble origins. Advanced education was provided for many years during the colonial period in Dakar.

[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War I]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs sénégalais|Senegalese Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government: the [[Volta-Bani War]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahir Saul and Patrick Royer, ''West African Challenge to Empire,'' 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The French government finally suppressed the movement but only after suffering defeats. It also had to organize its largest expeditionary force of its colonial history to send into the country to suppress the insurrection. Armed opposition wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.

[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|The capital, [[Ouagadougou]], in 1930]]
[[French Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The French feared a recurrence of armed uprising and had related economic considerations. To bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger.

The new colony was named ''Haute Volta,'' and François Charles Alexis Édouard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]]. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program to improve infrastructure and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy – based on [[coercion]] – failed, and revenue generated by the colony stagnated. The colony was dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split between the French colonies of [[Ivory Coast]], [[French Sudan]] and [[Niger]]. Ivory Coast received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.

France reversed this change during the period of intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On 4 September 1947, it revived the colony of Upper Volta, with its previous boundaries, as a part of the [[French Union]]. The French designated its colonies as departments of [[metropolitan France]] on the European continent.

On 11 December 1958 the colony achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] as the [[Republic of Upper Volta]]; it joined the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories had begun with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganization measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from France was received in 1960.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/635|title=More (Language of the Moose people) Phrase Book|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper Volta (1958–1984)===
[[File:Maurice Yaméogo and Louis Jacquinot exchanging instruments of ratification for the independence of the Upper Volta.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Yaméogo]], the first President of Upper Volta, examines documents of ratifying the country's independence in 1960]]
{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}
The Republic of Upper Volta ({{lang-fr|République de Haute-Volta}}) was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]]. The name ''Upper Volta'' related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the [[Volta River]]. The river's three [[Tributary|tributaries]] are called the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[White Volta|White]] and [[Red Volta]]. These were expressed in the three colors of the [[Flag of Upper Volta|former national flag]].

Before attaining autonomy, it had been French Upper Volta and part of the French Union. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from [[French Fourth Republic|France]]. The first president, [[Maurice Yaméogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by [[universal suffrage]] of a president and a national assembly for five-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yaméogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966. After much unrest, including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants, the military intervened.

====Lamizana's rule and multiple coups====
The [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'état|1966 military coup]] deposed Yaméogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoulé Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years. On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the [[Sahel drought|Sahel drought and famine]] which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries. After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977. Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.

Lamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'état|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.

Colonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP) in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'état]]. The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqEHU3iW2i0C&amp;pg=PA137|title=Revolutionary Overthrow of Constitutional Orders in Africa|last=Anyangwe|first=Carlson|date=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=9789956727780|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

====1983 coup d'état====
Infighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP. The leader of the leftists, Capt. [[Thomas Sankara]], was appointed prime minister in January 1983, but subsequently arrested. Efforts to free him, directed by Capt. [[Blaise Compaoré]], resulted in a military [[coup d'état]] on 4 August 1983.

The coup brought Sankara to power and his government began to implement a series of revolutionary programs which included mass-vaccinations, infrastructure improvements, the expansion of women's rights, encouragement of domestic agricultural consumption and anti-desertification projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;UprightDVD&quot; /&gt;

===Burkina Faso (since 1984)===
On 4 August 1984,&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt; on President Sankara's initiative, the country's name was changed from Upper Volta to Burkina Faso or ''land of the honest men''; (the literal translation is ''land of the upright men''.)&lt;ref&gt;Kingfisher Geography Encyclopedia. {{ISBN|1-85613-582-9}}.

The &quot;-be&quot; suffix in the name for the people – Burkinabe – comes from the Fula plural suffix for people, ''-ɓe''.&lt;/ref&gt; The demonym for people of Burkina Faso is &quot;Burkinabé&quot; and this includes expatriates or descendants people of Burkinabé origin.

[[File:Pionniers de la révolution.jpg|thumb|[[Pioneers of the Revolution]], {{Circa}} 1985]]
Sankara's government formed the National Council for the Revolution (CNR), with Sankara as its president, and established popular [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (Burkina Faso)|Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]] (CDRs). The [[Pioneers of the Revolution]] youth programme was also established.

Sankara launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme for change, one of the largest ever undertaken on the African continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;UprightDVD&quot; /&gt; His foreign policies were centred on [[anti-imperialism]], his government denying all [[foreign aid]], pushing for [[odious debt]] reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth and averting the power and influence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]]. His domestic policies included a nationwide literacy campaign, land redistribution to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriage]]s and [[polygamy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grila2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UprightDVD&quot; /&gt;

Sankara pushed for agrarian self-sufficiency and promoted public health by vaccinating 2,500,000 children against [[meningitis]], [[yellow fever]], and [[measles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grila2&quot;/&gt; His national agenda also included planting over 10,000,000 trees to halt the growing [[desertification]] of the [[Sahel]]. Sankara called on every village to build a medical dispensary and had over 350 communities build schools with their own labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;UprightDVD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thomassankara.net/resurrecting-thomas-sankara/?lang=en|title=Resurrecting Thomas Sankara – My Blog|last=X|first=Mr|date=28 October 2015|work=My Blog|access-date=25 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1987 coup d'état ====
On 15 October 1987, Sankara, along with twelve other officials, was killed in a [[coup d'état]] organized by Blaise Compaoré, Sankara's former colleague and Burkina Faso's president until October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/06/reviving-thomas-sankara-spirit-150603104633020.html|title=Reviving Thomas Sankara's spirit|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the coup and although Sankara was known to be dead, some CDRs mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} A majority of Burkinabé citizens hold that [[Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs|France's foreign ministry]], the [[Quai d'Orsay (disambiguation)|Quai d'Orsay]], was behind Compaoré in organizing the coup.

Deterioration in relations with neighbouring countries was one of the reasons given by Compaoré for the coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kasuka|first1=Bridgette|title=African Leaders|date=2011|publisher=Bankole Kamara Taylor|location=3rd Paragraph|isbn=978-1468114362|page=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80SvCmSTxGoC&amp;pg=PA128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compaoré argued that Sankara had jeopardised foreign relations with the former colonial power France and neighbouring [[Ivory Coast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReutersChe2&quot;/&gt; Following the coup Compaoré immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara's policies, returned the country back into the IMF fold, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara's legacy. Following an alleged [[1989 Burkinabé coup d'état attempt|coup attempt in 1989,]] limited democratic reforms were introduced in 1990 by Compaoré. Under the new constitution, Compaoré was re-elected without opposition in 1991. In 1998 Compaoré won election in a landslide. In 2004, 13 people were tried for plotting a coup against President Compaoré and the coup's alleged mastermind was sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Burkina Faso Profile.&quot; Burkina Faso Profile.

Compaoré's government had played the role of negotiator in several West-African disputes including the [[2010–11 Ivorian crisis]], the Inter-Togolese Dialogue, and the [[2012 Malian coup d'état|2012 Malian Crisis]].

With French help, Blaise Compaoré seized power in a coup d'état in 1987. He overthrew his long-time friend and ally [[Thomas Sankara]], who was killed in the coup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13101197 &quot;Burkina Faso's Blaise Compaore sacks his government&quot;], BBC News, 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Burkina Faso|constitution]] of 2 June 1991 established a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential government]]: its parliament could be dissolved by the [[List of heads of state of Burkina Faso|President of the Republic]], who was to be [[Elections in Burkina Faso|elected]] for a term of seven years. In 2000, the constitution was amended to reduce the presidential term to five years and set term limits to two, preventing successive re-election. The amendment took effect during the 2005 elections. If passed beforehand, it would have prevented Compaoré from being reelected.

Other presidential candidates challenged the election results. But in October 2005, the constitutional council ruled that, because Compaoré was the sitting president in 2000, the amendment would not apply to him until the end of his second term in office. This cleared the way for his candidacy in [[Burkina Faso presidential elections, 2005|the 2005 election]]. On 13 November 2005, Compaoré was reelected in a landslide, because of a divided political opposition.

In the [[Burkinabé presidential election, 2010|2010 Presidential elections]], President Compaoré was re-elected. Only 1.6&amp;nbsp;million Burkinabés voted, out of a total population 10&amp;nbsp;times that size.

The [[2011 Burkinabè protests]] were a series of popular protests that called for the resignation of Compaoré, democratic reforms, higher wages for troops and public servants and economic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=182823|agency=The Daily Star|date=23 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|title=Burkina opposition calls anti-president demo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/world/africa/28burkina.html|agency=The New York Times|title=Mayor's Home Burned as Burkina Faso Protests Continue|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|first1=Hervé|last1=Taoko|first2=Adam|last2=Nossiter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430114102/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/world/africa/28burkina.html|archivedate=30 April 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-28/burkina-faso-riot-police-join-wave-of-protests-after-government-dissolved.html|agency=Bloomberg L.P.|date=28 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|title=Burkina Faso Riot Police Join Wave of Protests After Government Dissolved|first=Simon|last=Gongo}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, governors were replaced and wages for public servants were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13542959|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=28 May 2011|title=Burkina Faso teachers' strike: Union agrees deal|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110527020543/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13542959|archivedate= 27 May 2011|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=1623195|agency=Taiwan News|date=9 June 2011|accessdate=11 June 2011|title=Burkina Faso government replaces its governors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[parliament]] consisted of [[unicameralism|one chamber]] known as the [[National Assembly (Burkina Faso)|National Assembly]] which had 111&amp;nbsp;seats with members elected to serve five-year terms. There was also a constitutional chamber, composed of ten members, and an economic and social council whose roles were purely consultative. The 1991 constitution created a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament but the upper house (Chamber of Representatives) was abolished in 2002.

The Compaoré administration had worked to [[Decentralization#Government decentralization|decentralize power]] by devolving some of its powers to regions and municipal authorities. But the widespread distrust of politicians and lack of political involvement by many residents complicated this process. Critics described this as a hybrid decentralisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Failure Likely|author=Tiendrebeongo, Aristide|publisher=dandc.eu|date=March 2013|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/decentralisation-burkina-faso-coming-against-obstacles-because-local-people-are-distrustful}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constitution ===
{{Further|Constitution of Burkina Faso}}

In 2015, Kaboré promised to revise the 1991 constitution. The revision was completed in 2018. One condition prevents any individual from serving as president for more than ten years either consecutively or intermittently and provides a method for impeaching a president. A referendum on the constitution for the Fifth Republic was scheduled for 24 March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apanews.net/en/news/burkina-faso-referendum-new-constitutional-set-for-march-2019|website=Danube Travel|date=28 August 2018 |title=Burkina Faso: Referendum on new constitution set for March 2019|accessdate=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain rights are also enshrined in the revised wording: access to drinking water, to decent housing and a recognition of the right to civil disobedience, for example. The referendum was required because the opposition parties in Parliament refused to sanction the proposed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20180827-burkina-faso-le-referendum-constitutionnel-prevu-le-24-mars-2019 | title=Burkina Faso: Le référendum constitutionnel prévu le 24 mars 2019 – RFI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===

Burkina Faso is a member of the [[African Union]], [[G5 Sahel]], [[Community of Sahel–Saharan States]], [[La Francophonie]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], [[Economic Community of West African States]], and [[United Nations]].

===Military===
{{main|Military of Burkina Faso}}

The [[Army of Burkina Faso|army]] consists of some 6,000&amp;nbsp;men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national People's Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35&amp;nbsp;years of age who are trained in both military and civil duties. According to ''Jane's Sentinel Country Risk Assessment'', Burkina Faso's Army is undermanned for its force structure and poorly equipped, but has wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa.

In terms of training and equipment, the regular Army is believed to be neglected in relation to the élite Regiment of Presidential Security ({{lang-fr|Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle}} – RSP). Reports have emerged in recent years of disputes over pay and conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20100827071950/http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Sentinel-Security-Assessment-West-Africa/Army-Burkina-Faso.html Jane's Sentinel Security Assessment – West Africa]'', 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There is an air force with some 19&amp;nbsp;operational aircraft, but no navy, as the country is landlocked. Military expenses constitute approximately 1.2% of the nation's GDP.

In April 2011, there was an [[2011 Burkina Faso mutiny|army mutiny]]; the president named new chiefs of staff, and a curfew was imposed in [[Ouagadougou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13107109|accessdate=17 April 2011|title=Burkina Faso capital under curfew after army mutiny|work=BBC News|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law enforcement===
{{main|Law enforcement in Burkina Faso}}
Burkina Faso employs numerous police and security forces, generally modeled after organizations used by [[French police]]. France continues to provide significant support and training to police forces. The ''Gendarmerie Nationale'' is organized along military lines, with most police services delivered at the brigade level. The [[Gendarmerie]] operates under the authority of the Minister of Defence, and its members are employed chiefly in the rural areas and along borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Das, pp.&amp;nbsp;139–141&quot;&gt;Das, Dilip K. and Palmiotto, Michael J. (2005) ''World Police Encyclopedia'', Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-94250-0}}. pp.&amp;nbsp;139–141&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a municipal police force controlled by the [[Ministry of Territorial Administration]]; a national police force controlled by the Ministry of Security; and an autonomous [[Regiment of Presidential Security]] (''Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle'', or RSP), a 'palace guard' devoted to the protection of the President of the Republic. Both the gendarmerie and the national police are subdivided into both administrative and judicial police functions; the former are detailed to protect public order and provide security, the latter are charged with criminal investigations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Das, pp.&amp;nbsp;139–141&quot;/&gt;

All foreigners and citizens are required to carry photo ID passports, or other forms of identification or risk a fine, and police spot identity checks are commonplace for persons traveling by auto, [[Share taxi|bush-taxi]], or bus.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of State, [https://web.archive.org/web/20131114034455/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1075.html Burkina Faso: Country Specific Information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foreign and Commonwealth Office,{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso|title=''Sub-Saharan Africa: Burkina Faso''|accessdate=13 August 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827125629/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travelling-and-living-overseas/travel-advice-by-country/sub-saharan-africa/burkina-faso|archivedate=27 August 2009 }} . fco.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Burkina sat.png|thumb|Satellite image of Burkina Faso.]]
{{main|Geography of Burkina Faso}}

===Geography===
[[File:Burkina Faso Map.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Map of Burkina Faso]]
Burkina Faso lies mostly between latitudes [[9th parallel north|9°]] and [[15th parallel north|15°N]] (a small area is north of 15°), and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6°W]] and [[3rd meridian east|3°E]].

It is made up of two major types of countryside. The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]], which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a [[Precambrian]] [[massif]]. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a [[sandstone]] massif, where the highest peak, [[Ténakourou]], is found at an elevation of {{convert|749|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is {{convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than {{convert|600|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.

The country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the [[Black Volta]] (or ''Mouhoun''), the [[White Volta]] (''Nakambé'') and the [[Red Volta]] (''Nazinon''). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the [[Komoé River|Komoé]], which flows to the southwest. The basin of the [[Niger River]] also [[drainage basin|drains]] 27% of the country's surface.

The Niger's [[tributary|tributaries]] – the Béli, Gorouol, Goudébo, and Dargol – are [[Torrent (stream)|seasonal streams]] and flow for only four to six months a year. They still can flood and overflow, however. The country also contains numerous lakes – the principal ones are Tingrela, [[Lake Bam|Bam]], and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, Béli, Yomboli, and Markoye. [[Drought|Water shortages]] are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.
[[File:WP 35, SDr9776.JPG|right|thumb|[[Savanna]]h near the [[Gbomblora Department]], on the road from [[Gaoua]] to [[Batié, Burkina Faso|Batié]]]]

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Regions of Burkina Faso|Provinces of Burkina Faso|Departments of Burkina Faso}}
The country is divided into [[Regions of Burkina Faso|13&amp;nbsp;administrative regions]]. These regions encompass [[Provinces of Burkina Faso|45&amp;nbsp;provinces]] and [[Departments of Burkina Faso|301&amp;nbsp;departments]]. Each region is administered by a [[governor]].

===Climate===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map BFA present.svg|thumb|Map of [[Köppen climate classification]]]]

Burkina Faso has a primarily tropical climate with two very distinct seasons. In the rainy season, the country receives between {{convert|60|and|90|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} of rainfall; in the dry season, the [[harmattan]] – a hot dry wind from the Sahara – blows. The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June through September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea. The [[Sahel]] in the north typically receives less than {{convert|60|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=relationship&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sim.org/country.asp?fun=1&amp;CID=18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309142111/http://www.sim.org/country.asp?CID=18&amp;fun=1|archivedate=9 March 2008|title=SIM Country Profile: Burkina Faso|accessdate=5 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; of rainfall per&amp;nbsp;year and has high temperatures, {{convert|5|–|47|°C|°F|0|lk=on}}.

A relatively dry [[tropical savanna]], the Sahel extends beyond the borders of Burkina Faso, from the [[Horn of Africa]] to the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the [[Sahara]] to its north and the fertile region of the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] to the south. Situated between 11°3' and 13°5'&amp;nbsp;north [[latitude]], the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than {{convert|90|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}}&lt;ref name=relationship/&gt; of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.

=== Natural resources ===
Burkina Faso's natural resources include [[gold]], [[manganese]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], [[phosphate]]s, [[pumice]], and [[Salt mining|salt]].

===Wildlife and the environment===
{{Further|Wildlife of Burkina Faso}}

Burkina Faso has a larger number of elephants than many countries in West Africa. Lions, leopards and buffalo can also be found here, including the dwarf or red buffalo, a smaller reddish-brown animal which looks like a fierce kind of short-legged cow. Other large predators live in Burkina Faso, such as the cheetah, the caracal or African lynx, the spotted hyena and the African wild dog, one of the continent's most endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.our-africa.org/burkina-faso/geography-wildlife?ref=nf Geography &amp; Wildlife] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903210757/http://www.our-africa.org/burkina-faso/geography-wildlife?ref=nf|date=3 September 2015 }}. our-africa.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Burkina Faso's [[Wildlife in Burkina Faso|fauna and flora]] are protected in four national parks:
* The W National Park in the east which passes Burkina Faso, Benin, and Niger
* The Arly Wildlife Reserve (Arly National Park in the east)
* The Léraba-Comoé Classified Forest and Partial Reserve of Wildlife in the west
* The Mare aux Hippopotames in the west

and several reserves: see [[List of national parks in Africa]] and [[Nature reserves of Burkina Faso]].

It consists mostly of rearing livestock. Especially in the south and southwest, the people grow crops of [[sorghum]], [[pearl millet]], [[maize|maize (corn)]], [[peanut]]s, rice and cotton, with surpluses to be sold. A large part of the economic activity of the country is funded by international aid, despite having gold ores in abundance.

The top five export commodities in 2017 were as follows, in order of importance: gems, precious metals, US$1.9 billion (78.5% of total exports), cotton, $198.7 million (8.3%), ores, slag, ash, $137.6 million (5.8%), fruits, nuts: $76.6 million (3.2%) and oil seeds: $59.5 million (2.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.worldstopexports.com/burkina-fasos-top-10-exports/ | title=Burkina Faso's Top 10 Exports| date=17 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2018 report from the World Bank indicates that in 2017, economic growth increased to 6.4% in 2017 (vs. 5.9% in 2016) primarily due to gold production and increased investment in infrastructure. The increase in consumption linked to growth of the wage bill also supported economic growth. Inflation remained low, 0.4% that year but the public deficit grew to 7.7% of GDP (vs. 3.5% in 2016). The government was continuing to get financial aid and loans to finance the debt. To finance the public deficit, the Government combined concessional aid and borrowing on the regional market. The World Bank said that the economic outlook remained favorable in the short and medium term, although that could be negatively impacted. Risks included high oil prices (imports), lower prices of gold and cotton (exports) as well as terrorist threat and labour strikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;

Burkina Faso is part of the [[West African Monetary and Economic Union]] (UMEOA) and has adopted the [[West African CFA franc|CFA franc]]. This is issued by the [[Central Bank of the West African States]] (BCEAO), situated in [[Dakar]], Senegal. The BCEAO manages the monetary and reserve policy of the member states, and provides regulation and oversight of financial sector and banking activity. A legal framework regarding licensing, bank activities, organizational and capital requirements, inspections and sanctions (all applicable to all countries of the Union) is in place, having been reformed significantly in 1999. [[Microfinance]] institutions are governed by a separate law, which regulates microfinance activities in all WAEMU countries. The insurance sector is regulated through the Inter-African Conference on Insurance Markets (CIMA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-financial-sector-profile.html|title=Burkina Faso Financial Sector Profile|accessdate=11 June 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210114640/https://www.mfw4a.org/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-financial-sector-profile.html|archivedate=10 December 2014 }}, MFW4A&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, tourism was almost non-existent in large parts of the country. The U.S. government (and others) warn their citizens not to travel into large parts of Burkina Faso: &quot;The northern Sahel border region shared with Mali and Niger due to crime and terrorism. The provinces of Kmoandjari, Tapoa, Kompienga, and Gourma in East Region due to crime and terrorism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/burkina-faso-travel-advisory.html|title=Burkina Faso Travel Advisory|date=11 October 2016|website=Government of USA|accessdate=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 CIA World Factbook provides this updated summary. &quot;Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that depends on adequate rainfall. Irregular patterns of rainfall, poor soil, and the lack of adequate communications and other infrastructure contribute to the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks. About 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. Cotton and gold are Burkina Faso’s key exports ...The country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and exports.

While the end of the political crisis has allowed Burkina Faso’s economy to resume positive growth, the country’s fragile security situation could put these gains at risk. Political insecurity in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose long-term challenges.&quot; The report also highlights the 2018–2020 International Monetary Fund program, including the government's plan to &quot;reduce the budget deficit and preserve critical spending on social services and priority public investments&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto1&quot;/&gt;

A 2018 report by the African Development Bank Group discussed a macroeconomic evolution: &quot;higher investment and continued spending on social services and security that will add to the budget deficit&quot;. This group's prediction for 2018 indicated that the budget deficit would be reduced to 4.8% of GDP in 2018 and to 2.9% in 2019. Public debt associated with the National Economic and Social Development Plan was estimated at 36.9% of GDP in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/west-africa/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-economic-outlook/ | title=Burkina Faso Economic Outlook| date=27 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is mining of copper, iron, [[manganese]], gold, [[cassiterite]] (tin ore), and phosphates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inadev.org/profile_-_burkina_faso.htm Profile – Burkina Faso]. Inadev.org. Retrieved on 5 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; These operations provide employment and generate international aid.

The [[European Commission]] expects that approximately 500,000&amp;nbsp;children under age&amp;nbsp;5 in Burkina Faso will suffer from acute malnutrition in 2015, including around 149,000 who will suffer from its most life-threatening form.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECHO Factsheet&quot;/&gt; Rates of micronutrient deficiencies are also high.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHS Program&quot;/&gt; According to the [[Demographic and Health Surveys|Demographic and Health Survey]] (DHS&amp;nbsp;2010), 49&amp;nbsp;percent of women and 88&amp;nbsp;percent of children under the age of five suffer from anemia.&lt;ref name=&quot;DHS Program&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The DHS Program – Burkina Faso: DHS, 2010 – Final Report (French)|url = http://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-FR256-DHS-Final-Reports.cfm|website = dhsprogram.com|accessdate = 19 October 2015|date = April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty percent of infant deaths can be attributed to malnutrition, and in turn, these infant mortality rates have decreased Burkina Faso's total work force by 13.6&amp;nbsp;percent, demonstrating how food security affects more aspects of life beyond health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Know About Hunger&quot;/&gt;

These high rates of food insecurity and the accompanying effects are even more prevalent in rural populations compared to urban ones, as access to health services in rural areas is much more limited and awareness and education of children's nutritional needs is lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gains and losses as Burkina Faso fights child hunger|url = http://www.irinnews.org/report/99767/gains-and-losses-as-burkina-faso-fights-child-hunger|website = IRINnews|accessdate = 19 October 2015|date = 11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An October 2018 report by [[USAid]] stated that droughts and floods remained problematic, and that &quot;violence and insecurity are disrupting markets, trade and livelihoods activities in some of Burkina Faso’s northern and eastern areas&quot;. The report estimated that over 954,300 people needed food security support, and that, according to [[UNICEF]], an &quot;estimated 187,200 children under 5 years of age will experience severe acute malnutrition&quot;. Agencies providing assistance at the time included USAID's Office of Food for Peace (FFP) working with the UN [[World Food Programme]], the NGO [[Oxfam]] Intermón and [[ACDI/VOCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.usaid.gov/burkina-faso/food-assistance | title=Food Assistance Fact Sheet – Burkina Faso &amp;#124; Food Assistance &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development| date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approaches to improving food security===

====World Food Programme====
The United Nation's World Food Programme has worked on programs that are geared towards increasing food security in Burkina Faso.
The Protracted Relief and Recovery Operation&amp;nbsp;200509 (PRRO) was formed to respond to the high levels of malnutrition in Burkina Faso, following the food and nutrition crisis in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Food Programme&quot;/&gt; The efforts of this project are mostly geared towards the treatment and prevention of malnutrition and include take home rations for the caretakers of those children who are being treated for malnutrition.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Food Programme&quot;/&gt; Additionally, the activities of this operation contribute to families' abilities to withstand future food crises. Better nutrition among the two most vulnerable groups, young children and pregnant women, prepares them to be able to respond better in times when food security is compromised, such as in droughts.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Food Programme&quot;/&gt;

The Country Programme (CP) has two parts: food and nutritional assistance to people with [[HIV]]/AIDS, and a school feeding program for all primary schools in the Sahel region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/ep/wfp272247.pdf|title = Burkina Faso Brief|website =|publisher = World Food Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HIV/AIDS nutrition program aims to better the nutritional recovery of those who are living with HIV/AIDS and to protect at-risk children and orphans from malnutrition and food security.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief&quot;/&gt; As part of the school feeding component, the Country Programme's goals are to increase enrollment and attendance in schools in the Sahel region, where enrollment rates are below the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Food Programme&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, the program aims at improving gender parity rates in these schools, by providing girls with high attendance in the last two years of primary school with take-home rations of cereals as an incentive to households, encouraging them to send their girls to school.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Food Programme&quot;/&gt;

The WFP concluded the formation of a subsequently approved plan in August 2018 &quot;to support the Government’s vision of 'a democratic, unified and united nation, transforming the structure of its economy and achieving a strong and inclusive growth through patterns of sustainable consumption and production.' It will take important steps in WFP’s new strategic direction for strengthened national and local capacities to enable the Government and communities to own, manage, and implement food and nutrition security programmes by 2030&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www1.wfp.org/operations/bf01-burkina-faso-transitional-icsp-january-december-2018 | title=Burkina Faso Transitional ICSP (January – December 2018) &amp;#124; World Food Programme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Bank====

The [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] was established in 1944, and comprises five institutions whose shared goals are to end extreme poverty by 2030 and to promote shared prosperity by fostering income growth of the lower forty percent of every country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What We Do|url = http://www.worldbank.org/en/about/what-we-do|website = worldbank.org|accessdate = 2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main projects the World Bank is working on to reduce food insecurity in Burkina Faso is the Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgProdFSP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = Projects : Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project {{!}} The World Bank|url = http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P114236/agricultural-productivity-food-security-project?lang=en|website = worldbank.org|accessdate = 2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, the objective of this project is to &quot;improve the capacity of poor producers to increase food production and to ensure improved availability of food products in rural markets.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AgProdFSP&quot;/&gt; The Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project has three main parts. Its first component is to work towards the improvement of food production, including financing grants and providing 'voucher for work' programs for households who cannot pay their contribution in cash.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgProdFSP&quot;/&gt; The project's next component involves improving the ability of food products, particularly in rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgProdFSP&quot;/&gt; This includes supporting the marketing of food products, and aims to strengthen the capabilities of stakeholders to control the variability of food products and supplies at local and national levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgProdFSP&quot;/&gt; Lastly, the third component of this project focuses on institutional development and capacity building. Its goal is to reinforce the capacities of service providers and institutions who are specifically involved in project implementation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgProdFSP&quot;/&gt; The project's activities aim to build capacities of service providers, strengthen the capacity of food producer organizations, strengthen agricultural input supply delivery methods, and manage and evaluate project activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgProdFSP&quot;/&gt;

The December 2018 report by the World Bank indicated that the poverty rate fell slightly between 2009 and 2014, from 46% to a still high 40.1%. The report provided this updated summary of the country's development challenges: &quot;Burkina Faso remains vulnerable to climatic shocks related to changes in rainfall patterns and to fluctuations in the prices of its export commodities on world markets. Its economic and social development will, to some extent, be contingent on political stability in the country and the subregion, its openness to international trade, and export diversification&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/burkinafaso/overview | title=Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burkina Faso is faced with high levels of [[food insecurity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Food Programme&quot;/&gt; As defined by the 1996 [[World Food Summit]], &quot;food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy lifestyle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://argus.iica.ac.cr/Esp/organizacion/LTGC/Documentacion/BibliotecaVenezuela/Boletines/2009/n4/foodsecurity-Springer-art%C3%ADculo2.pdf|title = Food security: definition and measurement|last = Pinstrup-Andersen|first = Per|date = 21 January 2009|journal = Food Security|doi = 10.1007/s12571-008-0002-y|volume = 1|pages = 5–7|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074246/http://argus.iica.ac.cr/Esp/organizacion/LTGC/Documentacion/BibliotecaVenezuela/Boletines/2009/n4/foodsecurity-Springer-art%C3%ADculo2.pdf|archive-date = 4 March 2016|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has not been much successful improvement on this issue of food security within recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Food Programme&quot;/&gt; Burkina Faso's rapidly growing population (around 3.6% annually) continues to put a strain on the country's resources and infrastructure, which can further limit accessibility to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Burkina Faso ICE Case Study|url = http://www1.american.edu/ted/ICE/burkina-food-riot.html|website = 1.american.edu|accessdate = 2 November 2015|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120209/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ICE/burkina-food-riot.html|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because the country is landlocked and prone to [[natural disaster]]s, including drought and floods, many families struggle to protect themselves from severe [[hunger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Food Programme&quot;/&gt; While recent harvest productions have improved some, much of the population is still having a hard time overcoming the continuous food and nutrition crises of the past decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECHO Factsheet&quot;/&gt; [[Malnutrition]] is especially common in women and children, with large amounts of the population suffering from [[stunted growth]] and [[micronutrient deficiencies]] such as [[anemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU311.pdf|title = USAID Office of Food for Peace Burkina Faso Food Security Country Framework|website =|publisher = United States Agency International Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food insecurity has grown to be a structural problem in Burkina Faso, only to be intensified by high food prices.

==Infrastructure and services==

=== Water ===
[[File:Grand marché de Koudougou.jpg|thumb|The ''Grand marché'' in [[Koudougou]], Burkina Faso]]
While [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services]] remain underdeveloped, the National Office for Water and Sanitation (ONEA), a [[state-owned]] [[utility company]] run along commercial lines, is emerging as one of the best-performing utility companies in Africa.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Peter Newborne 2011.

Since 2000, nearly 2&amp;nbsp;million more people have access to water in the four principal urban centres in the country; the company has kept the quality of [[Water infrastructure|infrastructure]] high (less than 18% of the water is lost through leaks – one of the lowest in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]), improved financial reporting, and increased its annual revenue by an average of 12% (well above inflation).&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Challenges remain, including difficulties among some customers in paying for services, with the need to rely on international aid to expand its infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; The state-owned, commercially run venture has helped the nation reach its [[Millennium Development Goal]] (MDG) targets in water-related areas, and has grown as a viable company.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

However, access to drinking water has improved over the last 28 years. According to UNICEF, access to drinking water has increased from 39 to 76% in rural areas between 1990 and 2015.

Transport in Burkina Faso is limited by relatively underdeveloped infrastructure.

As of June 2014 the main international airport, [[Ouagadougou Airport]], had regularly scheduled flights to many destinations in [[West Africa]] as well as [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and [[Istanbul]]. The other international airport, [[Bobo Dioulasso Airport]], has flights to Ouagadougou and [[Port Bouet Airport|Abidjan]].

[[Rail transport in Burkina Faso]] consists of a single line which runs from [[Kaya, Burkina Faso|Kaya]] to [[Abidjan]] in Ivory Coast via [[Ouagadougou]], [[Koudougou]], Bobo Dioulasso and [[Banfora]]. ''Sitarail'' operates a passenger train three times a week along the route.&lt;ref&gt;European Rail Timetable, Summer&amp;nbsp;2014 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 15,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres of roads in Burkina Faso, of which 2,500&amp;nbsp;kilometres are paved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burkina Faso Road Network|url=https://dlca.logcluster.org/display/public/DLCA/2.3+Burkina+Faso+Road+Network|website=Logistics Capacity Assessments (LCAs)|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and technology==
{{Main|Science and technology in Burkina Faso}}

In 2009, Burkina Faso spent 0.20% of GDP on research and development (R&amp;D), one of the lowest ratios in West Africa. There were 48 researchers (in full-time equivalents) per million inhabitants in 2010, which is more than twice the average for sub-Saharan Africa (20 per million population in 2013) and higher than the ratio for Ghana and Nigeria (39). It is, however, much lower than the ratio for Senegal (361 per million inhabitants). In Burkina Faso in 2010, 46% of researchers were working in the health sector, 16% in engineering, 13% in natural sciences, 9% in agricultural sciences, 7% in the humanities and 4% in social sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO Science Report&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|pages=472–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the government created the Ministry of Scientific Research and Innovation. Up until then, management of science, technology and innovation had fallen under the Department of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research. Within this ministry, the Directorate General for Research and Sector Statistics is responsible for planning. A separate body, the Directorate General of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation, co-ordinates research. This is a departure from the pattern in many other West African countries where a single body fulfils both functions. The move signals the government's intention to make science and technology a development priority.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO Science Report&quot; /&gt;

In 2012, Burkina Faso adopted a ''National Policy for Scientific and Technical Research'', the strategic objectives of which are to develop R&amp;D and the application and commercialization of research results. The policy also makes provisions for strengthening the ministry's strategic and operational capacities. One of the key priorities is to improve food security and self-sufficiency by boosting capacity in agricultural and environmental sciences. The creation of a centre of excellence in 2014 at the International Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering in Ouagadougou within the World Bank project provides essential funding for capacity-building in these priority areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO Science Report&quot; /&gt;

A dual priority is to promote innovative, effective and accessible health systems. The government wishes to develop, in parallel, applied sciences and technology and social and human sciences. To complement the national research policy, the government has prepared a ''National Strategy to Popularize Technologies, Inventions and Innovations'' (2012) and a ''National Innovation Strategy'' (2014). Other policies also incorporate science and technology, such as that on ''Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research'' (2010), the ''National Policy on Food and Nutrition Security'' (2014) and the ''National Programme for the Rural Sector'' (2011).&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO Science Report&quot; /&gt;

In 2013, Burkina Faso passed the Science, Technology and Innovation Act establishing three mechanisms for financing research and innovation, a clear indication of high-level commitment. These mechanisms are the National Fund for Education and Research, the National Fund for Research and Innovation for Development and the Forum of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESCO Science Report&quot; /&gt;

Burkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state. Most of Burkina Faso's people are concentrated in the south and centre of the country, where their density sometimes exceeds 48&amp;nbsp;persons per square kilometre (125/sq.&amp;nbsp;mi.). Hundreds of thousands of Burkinabè migrate regularly to Ivory Coast and Ghana, mainly for seasonal agricultural work. These flows of workers are affected by external events; the September 2002 coup attempt in Ivory Coast and the ensuing fighting meant that hundreds of thousands of Burkinabè returned to Burkina Faso. The regional economy suffered when they were unable to work.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In 2015, most of the population belonged to &quot;one of two West African ethnic cultural groups: the Voltaic and the Mande.

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Burkina Faso}}
Burkina Faso's 17.3&amp;nbsp;million people belong to two major West African ethnic cultural groups—the [[Gur languages|Voltaic]] and the [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] (whose common language is [[Dioula language|Dioula]]). The Voltaic [[Mossi people|Mossi]] make up about one-half of the population. The Mossi claim descent from warriors who migrated to present-day Burkina Faso from northern Ghana around 1100&amp;nbsp;AD. They established an empire that lasted more than 800&amp;nbsp;years. Predominantly farmers, the Mossi kingdom is led by the ''[[Mogho Naba]],'' whose court is in Ouagadougou.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot;&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2834.htm &quot;Burkina Faso&quot;], U.S. Department of State, June 2008.&lt;br /&gt;{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Religion in Burkina Faso}}
Statistics on religion in Burkina Faso can be misleading because [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] are often practiced in tandem with indigenous religious beliefs. The [[government of Burkina Faso]]'s 2006 census reported that 60.5% of the population practice Islam, and that the majority of this group belong to the [[Sunni]] branch,&lt;ref name=RGPH2006&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cns.bf/IMG/pdf/Depliant_Resultats_Definitifs_du_RGPH_2006.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511060719/http://cns.bf/IMG/pdf/Depliant_Resultats_Definitifs_du_RGPH_2006.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2011|title=Recensement général de la population et de l'habitation de 2006|author=Comité national du recensement|date=July 2008|publisher=Conseil national de la statistique|accessdate=20 January 2011|url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report2010&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2010/148665.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2010: Burkina Faso].

A significant number of Sunni Muslims identify with the [[Tijaniyah]] [[Sufi]] order. The government estimated that 23.2% of the population are Christians (19% being Roman Catholics and 4.2% members of Protestant denominations); 15.3% follow [[African traditional religion|traditional indigenous beliefs]], 0.6% have other religions, and 0.4% have none.&lt;ref name=RGPH2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=report2010/&gt;

===Education===
{{main|Education in Burkina Faso}}
[[File:Gando-School-Burkina-Faso.JPG|thumb|The [[Gando, Burkina Faso|Gando]] primary school. Its architect, [[Diébédo Francis Kéré]], received the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 2004.]]
Education in Burkina Faso is divided into primary, secondary and higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Burkina-Faso-EDUCATION.html|title=Education – Burkina Faso|publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; High school costs approximately CFA&amp;nbsp;25,000 (US$50) per year, which is far above the means of most Burkinabè families. Boys receive preference in schooling; as such, girls' education and literacy rates are far lower than their male counterparts. An increase in girls' schooling has been observed because of the government's policy of making school cheaper for girls and granting them more scholarships.

To proceed from primary to middle school, middle to high school or high school to college, national exams must be passed. Institutions of higher education include the [[University of Ouagadougou]], [[The Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso]], and the [[University of Koudougou]], which is also a teacher training institution. There are some small private colleges in the capital city of [[Ouagadougou]] but these are affordable to only a small portion of the population.

There is also the [[International School of Ouagadougou]] (ISO), an American-based private school located in Ouagadougou.

The 2008&amp;nbsp;UN Development Program Report ranked Burkina Faso as the country with the lowest level of literacy in the world, despite a concerted effort to double its literacy rate from 12.8% in 1990 to 25.3% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf|title=UNDP Human Development Report 2007/2008|accessdate=13 January 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429033726/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf|archivedate=29 April 2011 }}.

{{main|Culture of Burkina Faso}}
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Nunuma of Winiama maskerdanser TMnr 20031569.jpg|thumb|A masked Winiama dancer, ca. 1970]]
[[Literature in Burkina Faso]] is based on the [[oral tradition]], which remains important. In 1934, during French occupation, Dim-Dolobsom Ouedraogo published his ''Maximes, pensées et devinettes mossi'' (''Maximes, Thoughts and Riddles of the Mossi''), a record of the oral history of the [[Mossi people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KS&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Salhi|first=Kamal|title=Francophone Voices|publisher=Intellect Books|year=1999|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G9u9TeDegXMC|isbn=978-1-902454-03-0|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oral tradition continued to have an influence on Burkinabè writers in the post-independence Burkina Faso of the 1960s, such as [[Nazi Boni]] and Roger Nikiema.&lt;ref name=&quot;TJA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Allan|first=Tuzyline Jita|title=Women's Studies Quarterly: Teaching African Literatures in a Global Literary|publisher=[[Feminist Press]]|year=1997|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QD8TgZVWugYC|isbn=978-1-55861-169-6|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw a growth in the number of playwrights being published.&lt;ref name=&quot;KS&quot;/&gt; Since the 1970s, literature has developed in Burkina Faso with many more writers being published.&lt;ref name=&quot;JM&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchais|first=Julien|title=Burkina Faso|publisher=Petit Futé|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6jsBLSzJWYsC|language=French|isbn=978-2-7469-1601-2|year=2006|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theatre of Burkina Faso]] combines traditional Burkinabè performance with the colonial influences and post-colonial efforts to educate rural people to produce a distinctive national theatre. Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with [[mask]]s. Western-style theatre became common during colonial times, heavily influenced by [[French theatre]]. With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by [[Theatre of the Oppressed|forum theatre]] aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Faso's rural people.

===Arts and crafts===
{{Main|Art of Burkina Faso}}

In addition to several rich traditional artistic heritages among the peoples, there is a large artist community in Burkina Faso, especially in [[Ouagadougou]]. Much of the crafts produced are for the country's growing tourist industry.

Burkina Faso also hosts the International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou. It is better known by its French name as [[SIAO]], ''Le Salon International de l' Artisanat de Ouagadougou'', and is one of the most important African handicraft fairs.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Burkinabé cuisine}}
[[File:Fufu.jpg|thumb|A plate of [[fufu]] (right) accompanied with [[peanut soup]].]]
Typical of West African cuisine, Burkina Faso's cuisine is based on [[staple food]]s of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], rice, maize, [[peanut]]s, potatoes, [[bean]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s and [[okra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxfam's Cool Planet – Food in Burkina Faso|publisher=[[Oxfam]]|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/ontheline/explore/journey/burkina/food.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517115414/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/ontheline/explore/journey/burkina/food.htm|archivedate=17 May 2012|accessdate=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common sources of animal protein are chicken, chicken eggs and fresh water fish. A typical Burkinabè beverage is Banji or Palm Wine, which is fermented [[Palm wine|palm sap]]; and Zoom-kom, or &quot;grain water&quot; purportedly the national drink of Burkina Faso. Zoom-kom is milky-looking and whitish, having a water and cereal base, best drunk with ice cubes. In the more rural regions, in the outskirts of Burkina, you would find Dolo, which is drink made from fermented millet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sinotables.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1217:lhumeur-de-dom-zoom-kom-la-boisson-star-des-burkinabes&amp;catid=48:encontinu-secondtwo-droite article in French on Burkinabe Zoom-kom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchester: Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0719058619}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Burkina's contribution to [[African cinema]] started with the establishment of the film festival [[FESPACO]] (Festival Panafricain du Cinéma et de la Télévision de Ouagadougou), which was launched as a film week in 1969. Many of the nation's filmmakers are known internationally and have won international prizes.

For many years the headquarters of the Federation of Panafrican Filmmakers (FEPACI) was in Ouagadougou, rescued in 1983 from a period of moribund inactivity by the enthusiastic support and funding of President Sankara. (In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa, but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagadougou.) Among the best known directors from Burkina Faso are [[Gaston Kaboré]], [[Idrissa Ouedraogo]] and [[Dani Kouyate]].&lt;ref&gt;Turégano, Teresa Hoefert (2005) ''African Cinema and Europe: Close-Up on Burkina Faso'', Florence: European Press Academic, {{ISBN|888398031X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Burkina produces popular television series such as ''Les Bobodiouf''. Internationally known filmmakers such as Ouedraogo, Kabore, Yameogo, and Kouyate make popular television series.

===Sports===

{{main|Sport in Burkina Faso}}
Sport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football (soccer), basketball, cycling, rugby union, handball, tennis, boxing and martial arts. Football is very popular in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country. The national team is nicknamed &quot;Les Etalons&quot; (&quot;the Stallions&quot;) in reference to the legendary horse of Princess [[Yennenga]].

In 1998, Burkina Faso hosted the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] for which the Omnisport Stadium in Bobo-Dioulasso was built. In 2013, Burkina Faso qualified for the African Cup of Nations in South Africa, reached the final, but then lost to Nigeria by the score of 0&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;1. The country is currently ranked 53rd in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldranking/rankingtable/index.html|accessdate=4 February 2017|title=The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking|work=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Media of Burkina Faso|Communications in Burkina Faso}}

The nation's principal media outlet is its state-sponsored combined television and radio service, ''Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina'' (RTB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtb.bf/|title=Radiodiffusion-Télévision Burkina|publisher=Rtb.bf|accessdate=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''RTB'' broadcasts on two [[medium-wave]] ([[Amplitude modulation|AM]]) and several [[Frequency modulation|FM]] frequencies. Besides RTB, there are privately owned sports, cultural, music, and religious FM radio stations. ''RTB'' maintains a worldwide short-wave news broadcast (''Radio Nationale Burkina'') in the French language from the capital at Ouagadougou using a 100&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter on 4.815 and 5.030&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;Radio Station World, ''[http://radiostationworld.com/locations/burkina_faso/ Burkina Faso: Governmental Broadcasting Agencies]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to develop an independent press and media in Burkina Faso have been intermittent. In 1998, investigative journalist [[Norbert Zongo]], his brother Ernest, his driver, and another man were assassinated by unknown assailants, and the bodies burned. The crime was never solved.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists, [http://www.cpj.org/africa/burkina-faso/ ''Burkina Faso'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, an independent Commission of Inquiry later concluded that Norbert Zongo was killed for political reasons because of his investigative work into the death of David Ouedraogo, a chauffeur who worked for François Compaoré, President Blaise Compaoré's brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;en.rsf.org&quot;&gt;Reporters Sans Frontieres, ''[http://en.rsf.org/predator-what-s-happening-about-the-inquiry-into-norbert-zongo-s-death,2485.html What’s Happening About The Inquiry Into Norbert Zongo’s Death?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421082231/http://en.rsf.org/predator-what-s-happening-about-the-inquiry-into-norbert-zongo-s-death%2C2485.html|date=21 April 2014 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Outrageous Denial of Justice&quot;&gt;Reporters Sans Frontieres, ''[http://www.ifex.org/burkina_faso/2006/07/21/outrageous_denial_of_justice_in/ Outrageous Denial Of Justice]'' 21 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1999, François Compaoré was charged with the murder of David Ouedraogo, who had died as a result of torture in January 1998. The charges were later dropped by a military tribunal after an appeal. In August 2000, five members of the President's personal security guard detail (''Régiment de la Sécurité Présidentielle'', or RSP) were charged with the murder of Ouedraogo. RSP members Marcel Kafando, Edmond Koama, and Ousseini Yaro, investigated as suspects in the Norbert Zongo assassination, were convicted in the Ouedraogo case and sentenced to lengthy prison terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;en.rsf.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Outrageous Denial of Justice&quot;/&gt;

Since the death of Norbert Zongo, several protests regarding the Zongo investigation and treatment of journalists have been prevented or dispersed by government police and security forces. In April 2007, popular radio reggae host [[Sams'K Le Jah|Karim Sama]], whose programs feature reggae songs interspersed with critical commentary on alleged government injustice and corruption, received several death threats.&lt;ref&gt;IFEX, ''[http://www.ifex.org/burkina_faso/2007/04/30/radio_station_temporarily_pulls/ Radio Station Temporarily Pulls Programme After Host Receives Death Threats]'', 26 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Sama's personal car was later burned outside the private radio station ''Ouaga FM'' by unknown vandals.&lt;ref&gt;FreeMuse.org, ''[http://freemuse.org/archives/928 Death threat against Reggae Radio Host] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426215002/http://freemuse.org/archives/928|date=26 April 2014 }}'', 3 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] (CPJ) wrote to President Compaoré to request his government investigate the sending of e-mailed death threats to journalists and radio commentators in Burkina Faso who were critical of the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; In December 2008, police in Ouagadougou questioned leaders of a protest march that called for a renewed investigation into the unsolved Zongo assassination. Among the marchers was Jean-Claude Meda, the president of the Association of Journalists of Burkina Faso.&lt;ref&gt;Keita, Mohamed, ''[http://cpj.org/blog/2008/12/burkina-faso-police-question-zongo-protesters.php#more Burkina Faso Police Question Zongo Protesters]'', Committee to Protect Journalists, 15 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural festivals and events===
Every two years, Ouagadougou hosts the [[Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou]] (FESPACO), the largest African cinema festival on the continent (February, odd years).

Held every two years since 1988, the [[International Art and Craft Fair, Ouagadougou]] (SIAO), is one of Africa's most important trade shows for art and handicrafts (late October-early November, even years).

Also every two years, the [[Symposium de sculpture sur granit de Laongo]] takes place on a site located about {{convert|35|km|abbr=off}} from [[Ouagadougou]], in the province of [[Oubritenga]].

The [[National Culture Week of Burkina Faso]], better known by its French name La Semaine Nationale de la culture (SNC), is one of the most important cultural activities of Burkina Faso. It is a biennial event which takes place every two years in Bobo Dioulasso, the second-largest city in the country.

The [[Festival International des Masques et des Arts]] (FESTIMA), celebrating [[Traditional African masks|traditional masks]], is held every two years in [[Dédougou]].

==Environmental issues==
[[File:Wreckage of a dam (Dourtenga, 2008).jpg|thumb|Damage caused by the Dourtenga floodings in 2007.]]Geographic and environmental causes can also play a significant role in contributing to Burkina Faso's issue of food insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Agroclimatic Shock, Income Inequality, and Poverty: Evidence from Burkina Faso|last = Reardon|first = Thomas|date = 1996|journal = World Development|doi = 10.1016/0305-750x(96)00009-5|volume=24|issue = 5|pages=901–914}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the country is situated in the [[Sahel]] region, Burkina Faso experiences some of the most radical climatic variation in the world, ranging from severe flooding to extreme drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cultural barriers to climate change adaptation: A case study from Northern Burkina Faso|last = Ostergaard Nielsen|first = Jonas|date = February 2010|journal = Global Environmental Change|doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.10.002|volume=20|pages=142–152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unpredictable climatic shock that Burkina Faso citizens often face results in strong difficulties in being able to rely on and accumulate wealth through agricultural means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Human Vulnerability to Climate Variability in the Sahel: Farmers' Adaptation Strategies in Northern Burkina Faso|author = Barbier|date = 2009|journal = Environmental Management|doi = 10.1007/s00267-008-9237-9|pmid = 19037691|display-authors=etal|volume=43|issue = 5|pages=790–803|bibcode = 2009EnMan..43..790B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Burkina Faso's climate also renders its crops vulnerable to insect attacks, including attacks from [[locust]]s and [[Cricket (insect)|crickets]], which destroy crops and further inhibit food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Groten|first1 = S.
