A '''board game''' is a [[tabletop game]] that involves counters or {{boardgloss|pieces}} moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or &quot;board&quot;, according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure [[Strategy game|strategy]], but many contain an element of [[Game of chance|chance]]; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill.

Games usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve. Early board games represented a battle between two armies, and most modern board games are still based on defeating opponents in terms of counters, winning position, or accrual of points.

There are many varieties of board games. Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, like [[checkers]], to having a specific theme and narrative, like ''[[Cluedo]]''. Rules can range from the very simple, like [[Tic-tac-toe]], to those describing a game universe in great detail, like ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''&amp;nbsp;– although most of the latter are [[role-playing game]]s where the board is secondary to the game, serving to help visualize the game [[scenario]].

The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily correlated with the number or complexity of rules; games like [[chess]] or [[Go (board game)|Go]] possess relatively simple {{boardgloss|ruleset|rulesets}}, but have great strategic depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pritchard |first=D.B. |authorlink=David Pritchard (chess player) |title=The Encyclopedia of Chess Variants |publisher=Games &amp; Puzzles Publications |year=1994 |page=84 |isbn=978-0-9524142-0-9|quote=Chess itself is a simple game to learn but its resulting strategy is profound. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient board games===
Board games have been played, travelled and evolved&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Board games in 100 moves|last=Livingstone|first=Ian|last2=Wallis|first2=James|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|year=2019|isbn=978-0-241-36378-2|location=London|pages=|oclc=1078419452}}&lt;/ref&gt; in most cultures and societies throughout history. A number of important historical sites, artifacts, and documents shed light on early board games such as [[Jiroft civilization]] gameboards&lt;ref&gt;Madjidzadeh, Y (2003) Jiroft, The earliest oriental civilization. Organization of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, Tehran&lt;/ref&gt; in Iran.

[[Backgammon]] originated in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] over 5,000 years ago. [[Chess]], [[Pachisi]] and [[Chaupar]] originated in India. [[Go (board game)|Go]] and [[Liubo]] originated in China.

===United States===
In 17th and 18th century colonial America, the agrarian life of the country left little time for game playing, although [[draughts]] ([[checkers]]), [[bowling]], and card games were not unknown. The Pilgrims and Puritans of New England frowned on game playing and viewed dice as instruments of the devil. When Governor William Bradford discovered a group of non-Puritans playing stool-ball, pitching the bar, and pursuing other sports in the streets on Christmas Day, 1622, he confiscated their implements, reprimanded them, and told them their devotion for the day should be confined to their homes.

In ''Thoughts on Lotteries'' (1826) [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Almost all these pursuits of chance [i.e., of human industry] produce something useful to society. But there are some which produce nothing, and endanger the well-being of the individuals engaged in them or of others depending on them. Such are games with cards, dice, billiards, etc. And although the pursuit of them is a matter of natural right, yet society, perceiving the irresistible bent of some of its members to pursue them, and the ruin produced by them to the families depending on these individuals, consider it as a case of insanity, quoad hoc, step in to protect the family and the party himself, as in other cases of insanity, infancy, imbecility, etc., and suppress the pursuit altogether, and the natural right of following it. There are some other games of chance, useful on certain occasions, and injurious only when carried beyond their useful bounds. Such are insurances, lotteries, raffles, etc. These they do not suppress, but take their regulation under their own discretion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The board game ''Traveller's Tour Through the United States'' and its sister game ''Traveller's Tour Through Europe'' were published by New York City bookseller [[F. &amp; R. Lockwood]] in 1822 and today claims the distinction of being the first board game published in the United States.&lt;ref name=fv/&gt;

As the U.S. shifted from agrarian to urban living in the 19th century, greater leisure time and a rise in income became available to the middle class. The American home, once the center of economic production, became the [[wikt:locus|locus]] of entertainment, enlightenment, and education under the supervision of mothers. Children were encouraged to play board games that developed literacy skills and provided moral instruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_6_160/ai_80864307/pg_1?tag=content;col1 |last=Jensen |first=Jennifer |title=Teaching Success Through Play: American Board and Table Games, 1840–1900 |work=Magazine Antiques |publisher=bnet |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FirstAmericanPrintrunOfThe MansionOfHappiness.jpg|thumb|left|''The Mansion of Happiness'' (1843)]]
The earliest board games published in the United States were based upon Christian morality. ''[[The Mansion of Happiness]]'' (1843), for example, sent players along a path of virtues and vices that led to the Mansion of Happiness (Heaven).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot;/&gt; ''The Game of Pope and Pagan, or The Siege of the Stronghold of Satan by the Christian Army'' (1844) pitted an image on its board of a [[Hindu]] woman committing ''[[suttee]]'' against missionaries landing on a foreign shore. The missionaries are cast in white as &quot;the symbol of innocence, temperance, and hope&quot; while the pope and pagan are cast in black, the color of &quot;gloom of error, and&amp;nbsp;... grief at the daily loss of empire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2pitMiJJLX8C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=Fessenden+Culture+and+Religion+Pope+and+Pagan |last=Fessenden |first=Tracy |title=Culture and Redemption: Religion, the Secular, and American Literature |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2007 |page=271 |accessdate=2009-02-07|isbn=978-0-691-04963-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially produced board games in the mid-19th century were monochrome prints laboriously hand-colored by teams of low-paid young factory women. Advances in papermaking and printmaking during the period enabled the commercial production of relatively inexpensive board games. The most significant advance was the development of [[chromolithography]], a technological achievement that made bold, richly colored images available at affordable prices. Games cost as little as US$.25 for a small boxed card game to $3.00 for more elaborate games.

American Protestants believed a virtuous life led to success, but the belief was challenged mid-century when the country embraced materialism and capitalism. In 1860, ''[[The Checkered Game of Life]]'' rewarded players for mundane activities such as attending college, marrying, and getting rich. Daily life rather than eternal life became the focus of board games. The game was the first to focus on secular virtues rather than religious virtues,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot;/&gt; and sold 40,000 copies its first year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icYtGRUZrZUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Margaret+Hofer+The+Games+We+Played |last=Hofer |first=Margaret K. |title=The Games We Played: The Golden Age of Board &amp; Table Games |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |year=2003 |accessdate=2009-02-07|isbn=978-1-56898-397-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:District Messenger Boy Box Cover 1886.jpg|thumb|upright|''Game of the [[telegraph boys|District Messenger Boy]]'' (1886)]]
''Game of the District Messenger Boy, or Merit Rewarded'', published in 1886 by the New York City firm of [[McLoughlin Brothers]], was one of the first board games based on materialism and capitalism published in the United States. The game is a typical [[:Category:Roll-and-move board games|roll-and-move]] track board game. Players move their tokens along the track at the spin of the arrow toward the goal at the track's end. Some spaces on the track will advance the player while others will send him back.

In the affluent 1880s, Americans witnessed the publication of [[Horatio Alger, Jr.|Algeresque]] [[rags to riches]] games that permitted players to emulate the capitalist heroes of the age. One of the first such games, ''The Game of the District Messenger Boy'', encouraged the idea that the lowliest messenger boy could ascend the corporate ladder to its topmost rung. Such games insinuated that the accumulation of wealth brought increased social status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot;/&gt; Competitive capitalistic games culminated in 1935 with ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', the most commercially successful board game in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boardgames.lovetoknow.com/History_of_the_Game_Monopoly |author1=Weber, Susan |author2=Susie McGee |lastauthoramp=yes |title=History of the Game Monopoly |date=n.d. |accessdate=2009-02-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210050138/http://boardgames.lovetoknow.com/History_of_the_Game_Monopoly |archivedate=10 February 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLoughlin Brothers published similar games based on the telegraph boy theme including ''Game of the Telegraph Boy, or Merit Rewarded'' (1888). Greg Downey notes in his essay, &quot;Information Networks and Urban Spaces: The Case of the Telegraph Messenger Boy&quot;, that families who could afford the deluxe version of the game in its [[chromolithography|chromolithographed]], wood-sided box would not &quot;have sent their sons out for such a rough apprenticeship in the working world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mercurians.org/Nov_99/info_networks.html |author=Downey, Greg |title=Information Networks and Urban Spaces: The Case of the Telegraph Messenger Boy |publisher=Mercurians |work=Antenna |date=November 1999 |accessdate=2009-02-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807161116/http://www.mercurians.org/Nov_99/info_networks.html |archivedate=7 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Hofer]] described the period of the 1880s–1920s as &quot;The Golden Age&quot; of board gaming in America.&lt;ref name=fv/&gt; Board game popularity was boosted, like that of many items, through [[mass production]], which made them cheaper and more easily available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Damian Gareth Walker |title=A Book of Historic Board Games |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iThBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13 |date=5 November 2014 |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-1-326-03480-1 |page=13}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} Although there are no detailed statistics, some scholars suggest that the 20th century saw a decline in the popularity of the hobby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker2014&quot;/&gt;

The late 1990s onwards have seen substantial growth in the reach and market of board games. This has been attributed to, among other factors, the [[Internet]], which has made it easier for people to find out about games and to find opponents to play against.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker2014&quot;/&gt; Around the year 2000 the board gaming industry began significant growth with companies producing a rising number of new games to be sold to a growing worldwide audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;board game resurgence&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shutupshow.com/post/34426556753/su-sd-present-the-board-game-golden-age |title=The Board Game Golden Age |first=Quintin |last=Smith |date=October 2012 |accessdate=2013-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601124655/http://www.shutupshow.com/post/34426556753/su-sd-present-the-board-game-golden-age |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1943195/look-golden-age-boardgames|title=A look into the golden age of boardgames {{!}} BGG|website=BoardGameGeek|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, a number of publications referred to board games as having a new Golden Age, though some board-gamers prefer to call it a 'renaissance', as The Golden Age is both predefined and a common term.&lt;ref name=&quot;board game resurgence&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian2014oct/&gt; Board game venues are also growing in popularity; in 2016, over 5,000 board games opened in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.wttw.com/2020/02/11/board-game-biz-booming-and-chicago-s-ready-play|title=The Board Game Biz is Booming, and Chicago’s Ready to Play|website=WTTW News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Board game cafes are also reported to be very popular in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://flamingogroup.com/six-reasons-china-loves-board-game-cafes# |title=Six Reasons China Loves Board Game Cafés |website=Flamingo |access-date=2016-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520043014/http://flamingogroup.com/six-reasons-china-loves-board-game-cafes |archive-date=20 May 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luck, strategy, and diplomacy==
Some games, such as chess, depend completely on player skill, while many children's games such as ''[[Candy Land]]'' and ''[[Snakes and Ladders]]'' require no decisions by the players and are decided purely by luck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2009/01/26/the-case-against-can.html &quot;The case against Candy Land&quot;], 26 January 2009, BoingBoing.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Board game damah at Souq Waqif.jpg|thumb|Two Qataris playing the traditional board game of ''damah'', which requires both skill and luck]]
Many games require some level of both skill and luck. A player may be hampered by bad luck in [[backgammon]], ''Monopoly'', ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]''; but over many games a skilled player will win more often,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bkgm.com/articles/Simborg/LuckVsSkill/index.html &quot;Luck vs. Skill in Backgammon&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the elements of luck can make for more excitement, and more diverse and multifaceted strategies, as concepts such as [[expected value]] and [[risk management]] must be considered.

Luck may be introduced into a game by a number of methods. The use of [[dice]] of various sorts goes back to the [[Royal Game of Ur|earliest board games]]. These can decide everything from how many steps a player moves their token, as in ''Monopoly'', to how their forces fare in battle, as in ''Risk'', or which resources a player gains, as in ''The Settlers of Catan''. Other games such as ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'' use a deck of special [[Playing card|cards]] that, when shuffled, create randomness. ''[[Scrabble]]'' does something similar with randomly picked letters. Other games use spinners, timers of random length, or other sources of randomness. [[German-style board game]]s are notable for often having less luck element than many North American board games.

Another important aspect of some games is [[diplomacy]], that is, players making deals with one another. Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players, [[cooperative games]] being the exception. An important facet of ''[[The Settlers of Catan]]'', for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. In ''Risk'', two or more players may team up against others. ''Easy'' diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. ''Advanced'' diplomacy (e.g., in the aptly named game ''[[Diplomacy (board game)|Diplomacy]]'') consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1986/06/02/lying-and-cheating-by-the-rules/78ab5e73-b64d-4448-875e-aae12ab43476/ &quot;Lying and Cheating by the Rules&quot;] Joseph McLellan, 2 June 1986, The Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[perfect information]] games, such as chess, each player has complete information on the state of the game, but in other games, such as ''[[Tigris and Euphrates]]'' or ''[[Stratego]]'', some information is hidden from players. This makes finding the best move more difficult, and may involve estimating probabilities by the opponents.

==Other media==
Many board games are now available as [[video game]]s, which can include the computer playing as one or more opponents. Many board games can now be played [[Internet|online]] against a computer and/or other players. Some [[website]]s allow play in [[real time (media)|real time]] and immediately show the opponents' moves, while others use [[email]] to notify the players after each move.&lt;ref name=&quot;chessbyemail&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u3abroadbeach.com/chess-by-email.html |title=U3a International Chess by Email |accessdate=2014-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015070203/http://www.u3abroadbeach.com/chess-by-email.html |archive-date=15 October 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet]] and cheaper home printing has also influenced board games via print-and-play games that may be purchased and printed.&lt;ref name=&quot;printplay&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1120/print-play |title=Print &amp; Play |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some games use external media such as audio cassettes or [[DVD]]s in accompaniment to the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdgames&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/7348/dvd-board-games |title=DVD Board Games |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cassettegames&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/7477/audio-cassette-board-games |title=Audio Cassette Board Games |accessdate=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Virtual tabletop}}
There are also virtual tabletop programs that allow online players to play a variety of existing and new board games through tools needed to manipulate the game board, but do not necessarily enforce the game's rules, leaving this up to the players. There are generalized programs such as ''[[Vassal Engine|Vassal]]'', ''[[Tabletop Simulator]]'' and ''Tabletopia'' that can be used to play any board or card game, while programs like ''[[Roll20]]'' and ''[[Fantasy Grounds]]'' that are more specialized for role-playing games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/22/8470473/dungeons-dragons-virtual-tabletop-fantasy-grounds |title=D&amp;D now on Steam, complete with dice and a Dungeon Master |last=Hall |first=Charlie |date=22 April 2015 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/1/13806190/tabletopia-steam-board-games-free-to-play |title=Tabletopia is slick as hell, and it's free on Steam |first=Charlie |last=Hall |date=1 December 2016 |accessdate=7 September 2017 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these virtual tabletops have worked with the license holders to allow for use of their game's assets within the program; for example, ''Fantasy Grounds'' has licenses for both ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and ''[[Pathfinder (periodicals)|Pathfinder]]'' materials, while ''Tabletop Simulator'' allows game publishers to provide [[microtransaction|paid downloadable content]] for their games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fantasygrounds.com/press/ |title=SmiteWorks USA, LLC |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Fantasy Grounds |publisher=SmiteWorks |access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/01/cosmic-encounter-tabletop-simulator/ |title=Cosmic Encounter Officially Invades Tabletop Simulator |first=Alice |last=O'Conner |date=1 October 2015 |accessdate=1 August 2016 |work=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as these games offer the ability to add in content through [[mod (video gaming)|user modifications]], there are also unlicensed uses of board game assets available through these programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/247109/Mod_Mentality_How_Tabletop_Simulator_was_made_to_be_broken.php |title=Mod Mentality: How Tabletop Simulator was made to be broken |accessdate=8 July 2015 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |date=3 July 2015 |first=Alex |last=Wawro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dedicated field of research into gaming exists, known as [[game studies]] or ludology.

While there has been a fair amount of scientific research on the psychology of older board games (e.g., [[chess]], [[Go (board game)|Go]], [[mancala]]), less has been done on contemporary board games such as ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Scrabble]]'', and ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gobet, Fernand |author-link=Fernand Gobet |author2=de Voogt, Alex |author3= Retschitzki, Jean |title=Moves in mind: The psychology of board games |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-84169-336-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much research has been carried out on chess, in part because many tournament players are publicly ranked in national and international lists, which makes it possible to compare their levels of expertise. The works of [[Adriaan de Groot]], William Chase, [[Herbert A. Simon]], and [[Fernand Gobet]] have established that knowledge, more than the ability to anticipate moves, plays an essential role in chess-playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simons |first1=Daniel |title=How experts recall chess positions |url=http://theinvisiblegorilla.com/blog/2012/02/15/how-experts-recall-chess-positions/ |website=The Invisible Gorilla |accessdate=21 November 2017 |date=15 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041450/http://theinvisiblegorilla.com/blog/2012/02/15/how-experts-recall-chess-positions/ |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linearly arranged board games have been shown to improve children's spatial numerical understanding. This is because the game is similar to a [[number line]] in that they promote a linear understanding of numbers rather than the innate logarithmic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/sieg-ram09.pdf |title=Playing Linear Number Board Games—But Not Circular Ones—Improves Low-Income Preschoolers' Numerical Understanding |access-date=30 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524170555/http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/sieg-ram09.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research studies show that board games such as ''Snakes and Ladders'' result in children showing significant improvements in aspects of basic number skills such as counting, recognizing numbers, numerical estimation and number comprehension. They also practice fine motor skills each time they grasp a game piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=LeFebvre |first1=J.E. |title=Parenting the preschooler |url=http://parenting.uwex.edu/parenting-the-preschooler/documents/board_games.pdf |website=UW Extension |accessdate=10 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521002940/http://parenting.uwex.edu/parenting-the-preschooler/documents/board_games.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing board games has also been tied to improving children's [[executive functions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Family Game Night Makes Kids Into Better Students |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/07/how-family-game-night-makes-kids-into-better-students/374525/ |accessdate=13 May 2019|work=The Atlantic|date=16 July 2014 | first=Jessica | last=Lahey }}&lt;/ref&gt; and help reducing risks of dementia for the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dartigues|first=Jean François|last2=Foubert-Samier|first2=Alexandra|last3=Le Goff|first3=Mélanie|last4=Viltard|first4=Mélanie|last5=Amieva|first5=Hélène|last6=Orgogozo|first6=Jean Marc|last7=Barberger-Gateau|first7=Pascale|last8=Helmer|first8=Catherine|date=2013|title=Playing board games, cognitive decline and dementia: a French population-based cohort study|journal=BMJ Open|language=en|volume=3|issue=8|pages=e002998|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-002998|issn=2044-6055|pmc=3758967|pmid=23988362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altschul|first=Drew M|last2=Deary|first2=Ian J|date=2019-11-18|editor-last=Taler|editor-first=Vanessa|title=Playing Analog Games Is Associated With Reduced Declines in Cognitive Function: A 68-Year Longitudinal Cohort Study|url=https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/geronb/gbz149/5628188|journal=The Journals of Gerontology: Series B|language=en|pages=gbz149|doi=10.1093/geronb/gbz149|pmid=31738418|issn=1079-5014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this is a growing academic interest in the topic of game accessibility, culminating in the development of guidelines for assessing the accessibility of modern tabletop games&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Heron |first=Michael James |last2=Belford |first2=Pauline Helen |last3=Reid |first3=Hayley |last4=Crabb |first4=Michael |date=2018-04-27 |title=Meeple Centred Design: A Heuristic Toolkit for Evaluating the Accessibility of Tabletop Games |journal=The Computer Games Journal |volume=7 |issue=2 |language=en |pages=97–114 |doi=10.1007/s40869-018-0057-8 |issn=2052-773X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent to which they are playable for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Heron |first=Michael James |last2=Belford |first2=Pauline Helen |last3=Reid |first3=Hayley |last4=Crabb |first4=Michael |date=2018-04-21 |title=Eighteen Months of Meeple Like Us: An Exploration into the State of Board Game Accessibility |journal=The Computer Games Journal |volume=7 |issue=2 |language=en |pages=75–95 |doi=10.1007/s40869-018-0056-9 |issn=2052-773X|url=http://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/ws/files/27828635/Heron2018_Article_EighteenMonthsOfMeepleLikeUsAn.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, board games can be therapeutic. [[Bruce Barrymore Halpenny|Bruce Halpenny]], a [[games inventor]] said when interviewed about his game, [[The Great Train Robbery (board game)|''The Great Train Robbery'']]:&lt;blockquote&gt;With crime you deal with every basic human emotion and also have enough elements to combine action with melodrama. The player's imagination is fired as they plan to rob the train. Because of the gamble they take in the early stage of the game there is a build-up of tension, which is immediately released once the train is robbed. Release of tension is therapeutic and useful in our society, because most jobs are boring and repetitive.&lt;ref name=TRN1976&gt;Stealing the show. ''Toy Retailing News'', Volume 2 Number 4 (December 1976), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Playing games has been suggested as a viable addition to traditional educational curriculum if the content is appropriate and the gameplay informs students on the curriculum content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1=Christopher |last1=Harris |title=Meet the New School Board: Board Games Are Back – And They're Exactly What Your Curriculum Needs |url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ850549 |magazine=School Library Journal |date= n.d. |issn=0362-8930 |pages=24–26 |volume=55 |issue=5 |accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
