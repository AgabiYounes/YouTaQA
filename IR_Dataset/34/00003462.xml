The capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country.

The [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]].

The country's population, estimated at 11&amp;nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].

Before Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunción]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].
After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Simón Bolívar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964–82)#The Banzer regime|coup d'état]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan José Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.

Modern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

== Etymology ==
Bolivia is named after [[Simón Bolívar]], a Venezuelan leader in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salempress.com/store/samples/great_lives_from_history_19th/great_lives_from_history_19th_bolivar.htm |title=Simón Bolívar |publisher=Salem Press |accessdate=28 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825121538/https://salempress.com/store/samples/great_lives_from_history_19th/great_lives_from_history_19th_bolivar.htm |archivedate=25 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader of [[Venezuela]], [[Antonio José de Sucre]], had been given the option by Bolívar to either unite [[Sucre|Charcas]] (present-day Bolivia) with the newly formed [[Republic of Peru]], to unite with the [[United Provinces of Rio de la Plata]], or to formally declare its independence from Spain as a wholly independent state. Sucre opted to create a brand new state and on 6 August 1825, with local support, named it in honor of Simón Bolívar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historia-bolivia.com/6-de-Agosto-Independencia-de-Bolivia/6 |title=6 de Agosto: Independencia de Bolivia |publisher=Historia-bolivia.com |accessdate=14 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820091233/http://historia-bolivia.com/6-de-Agosto-Independencia-de-Bolivia/6 |archivedate=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original name was Republic of Bolívar. Some days later, congressman Manuel Martín Cruz proposed: &quot;If from [[Romulus]] comes Rome, then from [[Bolívar]] comes Bolivia&quot; ({{lang-es|Si de Rómulo, Roma; de Bolívar, Bolivia|links=no}}). The name was approved by the Republic on 3 October 1825.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blogs.law.harvard.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/01/11/what-countries-are-named-after-individuals-or-families/ |title=What countries are named after individuals or families? |publisher=Blogs.law.harvard.edu |date=11 January 2009 |accessdate=14 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719211218/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2009/01/11/what-countries-are-named-after-individuals-or-families/ |archive-date=19 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a [[Constitution of Bolivia|new constitution]] changed the country's official name to &quot;Plurinational State of Bolivia&quot; in recognition of the multi-ethnic nature of the country and the enhanced position of Bolivia's indigenous peoples under the new constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blogs.law.harvard.edu&quot;/&gt;

=== Pre-colonial ===
[[File:Puerta_del_Sol_Símbolo_de_Tiwanaku_-_Bolivia.jpg|thumb|[[Gate of the Sun|Puerta del Sol]], Archaeological Zone of [[Tiwanaku]], Bolivia]]
[[File:Map_of_Wari_and_Tiawaku.svg|thumb|Tiwanaku at its largest territorial extent, AD 950 (present-day boundaries shown).]]
The region now known as Bolivia had been occupied for over 2,500 years when the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] arrived. However, present-day Aymara associate themselves with the ancient civilization of the [[Tiwanaku culture]] which had its capital at [[Tiwanaku]], in Western Bolivia. The capital city of Tiwanaku dates from as early as 1500 BC when it was a small, agriculturally based village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fagan|2001|p={{page needed|date=July 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The community grew to urban proportions between AD 600 and AD 800, becoming an important regional power in the southern [[Andes]]. According to early estimates,{{When|date=February 2014}} the city covered approximately {{convert|6.5|sqkm|abbr=off|sp=us}} at its maximum extent and had between 15,000 and 30,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolata|1993|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 [[satellite imaging]] was used to map the extent of fossilized suka kollus (flooded raised fields) across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku, arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Valley of the Spirits&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolata|1996|p={{page needed|date=July 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around AD 400, Tiwanaku went from being a locally dominant force to a predatory state. Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects. In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67–83|doi=10.2307/530562|jstor=530562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire continued to grow with no end in sight. William H. Isbell states &quot;Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between AD 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isbell|first=William H.|title=Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon|journal=The Handbook of South American Archaeology|year=2008|pages=731–751|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-74907-5_37|isbn=978-0-387-74906-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiwanaku continued to absorb cultures rather than eradicate them. Archaeologists note a dramatic adoption of Tiwanaku ceramics into the cultures which became part of the Tiwanaku empire. Tiwanaku's power was further solidified through the trade it implemented among the cities within its empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997&quot;/&gt;

Tiwanaku's elites gained their status through the surplus food they controlled, collected from outlying regions and then redistributed to the general populace. Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites. Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources, the elite's power continued to grow until about AD 950. At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata, Alan L. 1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kolata|first=Alan L. |title=The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization|date=8 December 1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-55786-183-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2013}} causing a significant drop in precipitation in the Titicaca Basin, believed by archaeologists to have been on the scale of a major drought.

As the rainfall decreased, many of the cities farther away from Lake Titicaca began to tender fewer foodstuffs to the elites. As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up. The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata, Alan L. 1993&quot;/&gt;

Between 1438 and 1527, the Inca empire expanded from its capital at [[Cuzco]], [[Peru]]. It gained control over much of what is now Andean Bolivia and extended its control into the fringes of the Amazon basin.

=== Colonial period ===
The Spanish conquest of the [[Inca empire]] began in 1524, and was mostly completed by 1533. The territory now called Bolivia was known as Charcas, and was under the authority of the Viceroy of [[Lima]]. Local government came from the [[Real Audiencia of Charcas|Audiencia de Charcas]] located in Chuquisaca (La Plata—modern [[Sucre]]). Founded in 1545 as a mining town, [[Potosí]] soon produced fabulous wealth, becoming the largest city in the [[New World]] with a population exceeding 150,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/potosi/ |title=The High Place: Potosi |author=Demos, John |publisher=Common-place.org |accessdate=14 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114061035/http://www.common-place.org/vol-03/no-04/potosi/ |archivedate=14 November 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independence and subsequent wars ===

{{Main|History of Bolivia (1809–1920)}}

The [[Bolivian War of Independence|struggle for independence]] started in the city of [[Sucre]] on 25 May 1809 and the [[Chuquisaca Revolution]] (Chuquisaca was then the name of the city) is known as the first cry of Freedom in Latin America. That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.

Bolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and patriots. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns, all of which were defeated, and eventually limited itself to protecting the national borders at Salta. Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Marshal [[Antonio José de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Simón Bolívar]]. After 16 years of war the Republic was [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed]] on 6 August 1825.

[[File:Coat of arms of Bolivia (1825).svg|thumb|The first coat of arms of Bolivia, formerly named the Republic of Bolívar in honor of [[Simón Bolívar]]]]

In 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of [[Marshal]] [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]], invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, [[General]] [[Luis José de Orbegoso]]. Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]]. The Chilean army and its Peruvian rebel allies surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. However, the Chilean government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.

Following the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agustín Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. On November 18, 1841, the battle de Ingavi took place, in which the Bolivian Army defeated the Peruvian troops of Gamarra (killed in the battle). After the victory, Bolivia invaded Perú on several fronts.  The eviction of the Bolivian troops from the south of Peru would be achieved by the greater availability of material and human resources of Peru; the Bolivian Army did not have enough troops to maintain an occupation. In the district of Locumba - Tacna, a column of Peruvian soldiers and peasants defeated a Bolivian regiment in the so-called Battle of Los Altos de Chipe (Locumba). In the district of Sama and in Arica, the Peruvian colonel José María Lavayén organized a troop that managed to defeat the Bolivian forces of Colonel Rodríguez Magariños and threaten the port of Arica. In the battle of Tarapacá on January 7 1842, Peruvian militias formed by the commander Juan Buendía defeated a detachment led by Bolivian colonel José María García, who died in the confrontation. Bolivian troops left Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá in February 1842, retreating towards Moquegua and Puno.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Albarracín: La portentosa Heroicidad|last=Cavagnaro Orellana|first=Luis|publisher=Archivo Regional de Tacna|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battles of Motoni and&amp;nbsp; Orurillo forced the withdrawal of Bolivian forces occupying Peruvian territory and exposed Bolivia to the threat of counter-invasion. The Treaty of Puno was signed on June 7, 1842, ending the war. However, the climate of tension between Lima and La Paz would continue until 1847, when the signing of a Peace and Trade Treaty became effective.

The estimated population of the main three cities in 1843 was La Paz 300,000, Cochabamba 250,000 and Potosi 200,000.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol III'', London, Charles Knight, 1847, p.528.&lt;/ref&gt;

A period of political and economic instability in the early-to-mid-19th century weakened Bolivia. In addition, during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83), [[Chile]] occupied vast territories rich in [[natural resources]] south west of Bolivia, including the Bolivian [[coast]]. Chile took control of today's [[Chuquicamata]] area, the adjoining rich ''salitre'' ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]) fields, and the port of [[Antofagasta]] among other Bolivian territories.

Since independence, Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGurn Centellas |first=Katherine |date=June 2008 |title=For Love of Land and Laboratory: Nation-building and Bioscience in Bolivia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXD4SlJQYDgC&amp;pg=PA97 |location=Chicago |isbn=9780549565697 |access-date=14 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015203222/https://books.google.com/books?id=VXD4SlJQYDgC&amp;pg=PA97 |archive-date=15 October 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through diplomatic channels in 1909, it lost the basin of the Madre de Dios River and the territory of the Purus in the Amazon, yielding 250,000&amp;nbsp;km² to Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Portal Educabolivia|title=Pérdidas territoriales de Bolivia|date=2014-08-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftw65nhfXsA|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also lost the [[Acre (state)|state of Acre]], in the [[Acre War]], important because this region was known for its production of rubber. Peasants and the Bolivian army fought briefly but after a few victories, and facing the prospect of a total war against Brazil, it was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Petrópolis]] in 1903, in which Bolivia lost this rich territory. Popular myth has it that Bolivian president Mariano Melgarejo (1864–71) traded the land for what he called &quot;a magnificent white horse&quot; and Acre was subsequently flooded by Brazilians, which ultimately led to confrontation and fear of war with Brazil.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} 

In the late 19th century, an increase in the world price of silver brought Bolivia relative prosperity and political stability.

The [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] (MNR), the most historic political party, emerged as a broad-based party. Denied its victory in the 1951 presidential elections, the MNR led a successful revolution in 1952. Under President [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]], the MNR, having strong popular pressure, introduced [[universal suffrage]] into his political platform and carried out a sweeping land-reform promoting rural education and nationalization of the country's largest tin mines.

Twelve years of tumultuous rule left the MNR divided. In 1964, a military [[military dictatorship|junta]] overthrew President Estenssoro at the outset of his third term. The 1969 death of President [[René Barrientos Ortuño]], a former member of the junta who was elected president in 1966, led to a succession of weak governments. Alarmed by the rising Popular Assembly and the increase in the popularity of President [[Juan José Torres]], the military, the MNR, and others installed Colonel (later General) [[Hugo Banzer Suárez]] as president in 1971. He returned to the presidency in 1997 through 2001.

A teachers' strike in 1995 was defeated because the COB could not marshal the support of many of its members, including construction and factory workers.

====1997–2002 General Banzer Presidency====
In the 1997 elections, General [[Hugo Banzer]], leader of the [[Nationalist Democratic Action]] party (ADN) and former dictator (1971–78), won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. At the outset of his government, President Banzer launched a policy of using special police-units to eradicate physically the illegal coca of the Chapare region. The MIR of Jaime Paz Zamora remained a coalition-partner throughout the Banzer government, supporting this policy (called the Dignity Plan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chakana.nl/files/pub/AssiesSalman_2005_Ethnicity-and-Politics-in-Bolivia.pdf |title=Ethnicity and Politics in Bolivia |publisher=Ethnopolitics 4(3):269–297 |date=September 2005 |accessdate=14 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724150223/http://chakana.nl/files/pub/AssiesSalman_2005_Ethnicity-and-Politics-in-Bolivia.pdf |archive-date=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banzer government basically continued the free-market and privatization-policies of its predecessor. The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.

Between January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices. On 6 August 2001, Banzer resigned from office after being diagnosed with cancer. He died less than a year later. Vice President [[Jorge Quiroga|Jorge Fernando Quiroga Ramírez]] completed the final year of his term.

In the June 2002 national elections, former President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada (MNR) placed first with 22.5% of the vote, followed by coca-advocate and native peasant-leader [[Evo Morales]] ([[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement Toward Socialism]], MAS) with 20.9%. A July agreement between the MNR and the fourth-place MIR, which had again been led in the election by former President Jaime Paz Zamora, virtually ensured the election of Sánchez de Lozada in the congressional run-off, and on 6 August he was sworn in for the second time. The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], and social inclusion.

In 2003 the [[Bolivian gas conflict]] broke out. On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, Sánchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.

The country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June. The chief justice of the Supreme Court, [[Eduardo Rodríguez]], was sworn as interim president to succeed the outgoing Carlos Mesa.

====2005–present Morales Presidency and re-nationalization of petroleum assets====
[[File:Evomorales 20050122 posesion01.jpg|thumb|Evo Morales' inauguration as President]]
[[Evo Morales]] won the [[Bolivian presidential election, 2005|2005 presidential election]] with 53.7% of the votes, an [[absolute majority]], unusual in Bolivian elections. On May 1st, 2006, Morales caused controversy when he announced his intent to [[Bolivian gas conflict|re-nationalize Bolivian hydrocarbon assets]]. Fulfilling a campaign promise, on August 6th, 2006, Morales opened the [[Bolivian Constituent Assembly]] to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5251306.stm |title=Push for new Bolivia constitution |work=BBC News |date=6 August 2006 |accessdate=30 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327011109/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5251306.stm |archive-date=27 March 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, conflicts arose in [[Sucre]], as the city demanded the discussion of the seat of government inside the assembly, hoping the executive and legislative branches could return to the city, but the assembly and the government said this demand was overwhelmingly impractical and politically undesirable. Three people died in that conflict and many resulted wounded.  In May 2008, Evo Morales was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. In the 2009 national general elections, Evo Morales was re-elected with 64.22% of the vote. His party, [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]], also won a two-thirds majority in both houses of the [[National Congress of Bolivia|National Congress]]. A referendum held on February 21st, 2016 put a limit of three terms to presidencies, which would have barred him from a fourth term, but a constitutional court put the restriction aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-50055725|title= Bolivia elections: Will Evo Morales get a fourth term in office?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolivia is located in the central zone of [[South America]], between 57°26'–69°38'W and 9°38'–22°53'S. With an area of {{convert|1098581|km2|sqmi}}, Bolivia is the world's 28th-largest country, and the fifth largest country in South America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html | title=Country Comparison :: Area | work=[[The World Factbook]] | publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] | accessdate=12 February 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209041128/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html | archive-date=9 February 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; extending from the [[Andes|Central Andes]] through part of the ''[[Gran Chaco]]'', [[Pantanal]] and as far as the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. The geographic center of the country is the so-called ''Puerto Estrella'' (&quot;Star Port&quot;) on the [[Río Grande (Bolivia)|Río Grande]], in [[Ñuflo de Chávez Province]], [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz Department]].

The geography of the country exhibits a great variety of terrain and climates. Bolivia has a high level of [[biodiversity]], considered one of the greatest in the world, as well as several [[ecoregion]]s with ecological sub-units such as the ''[[Altiplano]]'', [[tropical rainforest]]s (including [[Amazon rainforest]]), dry [[valley]]s, and the ''[[Chiquitania]]'', which is a [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savanna]]. These areas feature enormous variations in altitude, from an elevation of {{convert|6542|m|ft}} above sea level in [[Nevado Sajama]] to nearly {{convert|70|m|ft}} along the [[Paraguay River]]. Although a country of great geographic diversity, Bolivia has remained a [[landlocked country]] since the [[War of the Pacific]]. [[Puerto Suárez]], [[San Matías, Santa Cruz|San Matías]] and [[Puerto Quijarro]] are located in the [[Pantanal|Bolivian Pantanal]].

Bolivia can be divided into three [[Physical geography|physiographic]] regions:

*'''The Andean region''' in the southwest spans 28% of the national territory, extending over {{convert|307603|km²|sqmi}}. This area is located above {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude and is located between two big Andean chains, the ''[[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]]'' (&quot;Western Range&quot;) and the ''[[Cordillera Central (Bolivia)|Cordillera Central]]'' (&quot;Central Range&quot;), with some of the highest spots in the [[Americas]] such as the [[Nevado Sajama]], with an altitude of {{convert|6542|m|ft}}, and the [[Illimani]], at {{convert|6462|m|ft}}. Also located in the Cordillera Central is [[Lake Titicaca]], the highest commercially navigable lake in the world and the largest lake in South America;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5080/ | title=Lake Titicaca | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | date=17 June 2005 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217125355/https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5080/ | archive-date=17 February 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the lake is shared with [[Peru]]. Also in this region are the ''[[Altiplano]]'' and the ''[[Salar de Uyuni]]'', which is the largest [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]] in the world and an important source of [[lithium]].
*The '''Sub-Andean region''' in the center and south of the country is an intermediate region between the ''[[Altiplano]]'' and the eastern ''[[Plain|llanos]]'' (plain); this region comprises 13% of the territory of Bolivia, extending over {{convert|142815|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and encompassing the Bolivian valleys and the Yungas region. It is distinguished by its farming activities and its temperate climate.
*The '''Llanos region''' in the northeast comprises 59% of the territory, with {{convert|648163|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is located to the north of the Cordillera Central and extends from the Andean foothills to the [[Paraguay River]]. It is a region of flat land and small plateaus, all covered by extensive rain forests containing enormous biodiversity. The region is below {{convert|400|m|ft}} above sea level.

Bolivia has three [[drainage basin]]s:

*The first is the [[Amazon River|Amazon Basin]], also called the North Basin ({{convert|724000|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}/66% of the territory). The rivers of this basin generally have big [[meander]]s which form lakes such as [[Murillo Lake]] in [[Pando Department]]. The main Bolivian [[tributary]] to the Amazon basin is the [[Mamoré River]], with a length of {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}} running north to the confluence with the [[Beni River]], {{convert|1113|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length and the second most important river of the country. The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guaporé River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].
*The second is the [[Río de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandioré Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.
*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km²|sqmi}}/13% of the territory). The ''[[Altiplano]]'' has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean because they are enclosed by the Andean mountains. The most important river is the [[Desaguadero River (Bolivia)|Desaguadero River]], with a length of {{convert|436|km|mi|abbr=on}}, the longest river of the ''Altiplano''; it begins in [[Lake Titicaca]] and then runs in a southeast direction to [[Poopó Lake]]. The basin is then formed by Lake Titicaca, Lake Poopó, the Desaguadero River, and great salt flats, including the ''[[Salar de Uyuni]]'' and [[Coipasa Lake]].

The [[geology of Bolivia]] comprises a variety of different [[lithology|lithologies]] as well as [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] and sedimentary environments. On a synoptic scale, geological units coincide with topographical units. Most elementally, the country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the [[subduction]] processes in the Pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable [[platform (geology)|platforms]] and [[shield (geology)|shields]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Pista de esquí de Chacaltaya Bolivia.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chacaltaya]] Ski Resort, [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz Department]]]]
The climate of Bolivia varies drastically from one eco-region to the other, from the tropics in the eastern ''[[Plain|llanos]]'' to a [[polar climate]] in the western Andes. The summers are warm, humid in the east and dry in the west, with rains that often modify temperatures, humidity, winds, [[atmospheric pressure]] and evaporation, yielding very different climates in different areas. When the climatological phenomenon known as ''[[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itdg.org.pe/archivos/desastres/reportemarzo.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308110026/http://www.itdg.org.pe/archivos/desastres/reportemarzo.pdf |archivedate=8 March 2005 |title=Fortalecimiento de las Capacidades locales para enfrentar El Fenómeno del Niño en Perú y Bolivia |publisher=itdg.org.pe |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=48449&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001813/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/ElFinanciero/Portal/cfpages/contentmgr.cfm?docId=48449&amp;docTipo=1&amp;orderby=docid&amp;sortby=ASC |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Deja 56 muertos &quot;El Niño&quot; en Bolivia |publisher=elfinanciero.com.mx |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place, it causes great alterations in the weather. Winters are very cold in the west, and it snows in the mountain ranges, while in the western regions, windy days are more common. The autumn is dry in the non-tropical regions.
*''Llanos''. A [[Humidity|humid]] [[tropical climate]] with an average temperature of {{convert|25|°C|F}}. The wind coming from the [[Amazon rainforest]] causes significant rainfall. In May, there is low precipitation because of dry winds, and most days have clear skies. Even so, winds from the south, called ''surazos'', can bring cooler temperatures lasting several days.
*''[[Altiplano]]''. [[Desert climate|Desert]]-[[Polar climate|Polar]] climates, with strong and cold winds. The average temperature ranges from 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;°C. At night, temperatures descend drastically to slightly above 0&amp;nbsp;°C, while during the day, the weather is dry and [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] is high. [[Ground frost]]s occur every month, and snow is frequent.
*Valleys and ''Yungas''. [[Temperateness|Temperate]] climate. The humid northeastern winds are pushed to the mountains, making this region very humid and rainy. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations. Snow occurs at altitudes of {{convert|2000|m|ft}}.
*''[[Gran Chaco|Chaco]]''. [[Subtropics|Subtropical]] [[semi-arid climate]]. Rainy and humid in January and the rest of the year, with warm days and cold nights.

=== Issues with climate change ===
Bolivia is especially vulnerable to the negative consequences of [[climate change]].

# Promoting clean development in Bolivia by introducing technological changes in the agriculture, forestry, and industrial sectors, aimed to reduce GHG emissions with a positive impact on development.
# Contributing to carbon management in forests, wetlands and other managed natural ecosystems.
# Increasing effectiveness in energy supply and use to mitigate effects of GHG emissions and risk of contingencies.

=== Biodiversity ===
Bolivia, with an enormous variety of [[organism]]s and [[ecosystem]]s, is part of the &quot;[[Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.biosafetyclearinghouse.net/actividades/2009/grouplmmc.pdf|title=LIKE MINDED MEGADIVERSE COUNTRIES|accessdate=6 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106190738/http://pe.biosafetyclearinghouse.net/actividades/2009/grouplmmc.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolivia's variable altitudes, ranging from {{convert|90|-|6542|m|ft}} above sea level, allow for a vast biologic diversity. The territory of Bolivia comprises four types of [[biome]]s, 32 ecological regions, and 199 ecosystems. Within this geographic area there are several natural parks and reserves such as the [[Noel Kempff Mercado National Park]], the [[Madidi National Park]], the [[Tunari National Park]], the [[Eduardo Avaroa Andean Fauna National Reserve]], and the [[Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area]], among others.

Bolivia boasts over 17,000 species of seed plants, including over 1,200 species of [[fern]], 1,500 species of ''[[marchantiophyta]]'' and [[moss]], and at least 800 species of [[fungus]]. In addition, there are more than 3,000 species of [[medicinal plant]]s. Bolivia is considered the place of origin for such species as [[Capsicum pubescens|peppers]] and [[Capsicum|chili peppers]], [[peanut]]s, the [[Phaseolus vulgaris|common bean]]s, [[Cassava|yucca]], and several species of palm. Bolivia also naturally produces over 4,000 kinds of [[potato]]es.

Bolivia has more than 2,900 animal species, including 398 mammals, over 1,400 birds (about 14% of birds known in the world, being the sixth most diverse country in terms of bird species)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bolivia.com/noticias/Autonoticias/DetalleNoticia40938.asp | title=Bolivia es el Sexto País con la Mayor Cantidad de Especies de Aves en el Mundo | trans-title=Bolivia is the Sixth Country with the Highest Number of Bird Species in the World | language=Spanish | publisher=Bolivia.com | date=10 June 2009 | accessdate=21 February 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225080900/http://www.bolivia.com/noticias/AutoNoticias/DetalleNoticia40938.asp | archive-date=25 February 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2014}}, 204 [[amphibian]]s, 277 [[reptile]]s, and 635 fish, all [[fresh water]] fish as Bolivia is a [[landlocked country]].

==Politics and government==
{{Main|Politics of Bolivia|Foreign relations of Bolivia}}

[[File:LaPaz Plaza Pedro Di Murillo 10.2004.jpg|thumb|The government building of the [[National Congress of Bolivia]] at the Plaza Murillo in central [[La Paz]]]]

Bolivia has been governed by democratically elected governments since 1982; prior to that, it was governed by various dictatorships. Presidents [[Hernán Siles Zuazo]] (1982–85) and [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985–89) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although three presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada]] in 2003, [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005, and [[Evo Morales]] in 2019.

Bolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. On November 11th, 2019, all senior governmental positions were vacated following [[Evo Morales government resignation|the resignation of Evo Morales and his government]]. On November 13th, 2019, [[Jeanine Áñez]], a former senator representing Beni, declared herself acting president of Bolivia. She is currently the ''de facto'' [[President of Bolivia]].

The [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitution]], drafted in 2006–07 and approved in 2009, provides for balanced executive, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers, as well as several levels of autonomy. The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.

The executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.&lt;ref name=&quot;presidencia.gob.bo&quot;/&gt;

The ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]]. The ''Cámara de Diputados'' (Chamber of Deputies) has 130 members elected to five-year terms, seventy from single-member districts (''circunscripciones''), sixty by proportional representation, and seven by the minority indigenous peoples of seven departments.&lt;!-- 70 + 60 + 7 = 137. Can someone clarify how National Congress has 130 members while, apparently, 137 is elected --&gt; The ''Cámara de Senadores'' (Chamber of Senators) has 36 members (four per department). Members of the Assembly are elected to five-year terms. The body has its headquarters on the Plaza Murillo in La Paz, but also holds honorary sessions elsewhere in Bolivia. The Vice President serves as titular head of the combined Assembly.

[[File:20170805 Bolivia 1195 crop Sucre sRGB (26204170499).jpg|thumb|The Supreme Court Building in the capital of Bolivia, [[Sucre]]]]

The judiciary consists of the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Bolivia)|Supreme Court of Justice]], the [[Plurinational Constitutional Court]], the Judiciary Council, Agrarian and Environmental Court, and District (departmental) and lower courts. In October 2011, Bolivia held its first judicial elections to choose members of the national courts by popular vote, a reform brought about by Evo Morales.

The [[Plurinational Electoral Organ]] is an independent branch of government which replaced the [[National Electoral Court of Bolivia|National Electoral Court]] in 2010. The branch consists of the Supreme Electoral Court, the nine Departmental Electoral Court, Electoral Judges, the anonymously selected Juries at Election Tables, and Electoral Notaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Posesionan a cuatro Vocales del Tribunal Supremo Electoral | work = La Jornada | accessdate = 28 April 2011 | date = 16 August 2010 | url = http://www.jornadanet.com/n.php?a=51574-1 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121138/http://www.jornadanet.com/n.php?a=51574-1 | archive-date = 13 July 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilfredo Ovando presides over the seven-member Supreme Electoral Court. Its operations are mandated by the Constitution and regulated by the Electoral Regime Law (Law 026, passed 2010). The Organ's first elections were the country's first [[Bolivian judicial election, 2011|judicial election]] in October 2011, and five municipal special elections held in 2011.

=== Capital ===
Bolivia has its constitutionally recognized capital in [[Sucre]], while La Paz is the seat of government. La Plata (now Sucre) was proclaimed provisional capital of the newly independent Alto Perú (later, Bolivia) on 1 July 1826.&lt;ref name=DicGeo&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Impr. &quot;Bolívar&quot; de M. Pizarro | last=Sucre. | first = Sociedad Geográfica | title = Diccionario geográfico del Departamento de Chuquisaca: contiene datos geográficos, históricos y estadisticos | year = 1903 | pages = 296–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July 1839, President [[José Miguel de Velasco]] proclaimed a law naming the city as the capital of Bolivia, and renaming it in honor of the revolutionary leader [[Antonio José de Sucre]].&lt;ref name=DicGeo /&gt; The Bolivian seat of government moved to [[La Paz]] at the start of the twentieth century, as a consequence of Sucre's relative remoteness from economic activity after the decline of [[Potosí]] and its silver industry and of the Liberal Party in the War of 1899.

The [[Constitution of Bolivia|2009 Constitution]] assigns the role of national capital to Sucre, not referring to La Paz in the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;presidencia.gob.bo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/download/constitucion.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619201729/http://www.presidencia.gob.bo/download/constitucion.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2009 |work=Nueva Constitución Política del Estado |page=4 |quote=I. Sucre is the Capital of Bolivia.&quot; |title=Political Constitution of the State, First Part, Title I, Chapter One: Model of State |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being the constitutional capital, the Supreme Court of Bolivia is located in Sucre, making it the judicial capital. Nonetheless, the [[Palacio Quemado]] (the Presidential Palace and seat of Bolivian [[Executive (government)|executive power]]) is located in La Paz, as are the National Congress and Plurinational Electoral Organ. La Paz thus continues to be the seat of government.

=== Law and crime ===
{{Main|Crime in Bolivia}}
There are 54 [[prisons in Bolivia]], which incarcerate around 8,700 people {{As of|2010|lc=y}}. The prisons are managed by the Penitentiary Regime Directorate ({{lang-es|Dirección de Régimen Penintenciario|links=no}}). There are 17 prisons in [[Departments of Bolivia|departmental]] capital cities and 36 provincial prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/advocacy/prisons/americas2.htm|title=Human Rights Watch - Prison Conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite losing its maritime coast, the so-called [[Litoral Department]], after the [[War of the Pacific]], Bolivia has historically maintained, as a state policy, a maritime claim to that part of [[Chile]]; the claim asks for sovereign access to the [[Pacific Ocean]] and its maritime space. The issue has also been presented before the [[Organization of American States]]; in 1979, the OAS passed the ''426 Resolution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oas.org/columbus/Bolivia.asp |title=Bolivia |publisher=Oas.org |accessdate=14 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605114445/http://www.oas.org/columbus/Bolivia.asp |archive-date=5 June 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared that the Bolivian problem is a hemispheric problem. On 4 April 1884, a truce was signed with Chile, whereby Chile gave facilities of access to Bolivian products through [[Antofagasta]], and freed the payment of export rights in the port of [[Arica]]. In October 1904, the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1904)|Treaty of Peace and Friendship]] was signed, and Chile agreed to build a [[Arica–La Paz railway|railway between Arica and La Paz]], to improve access of Bolivian products to the ports.

Since 1964, Bolivia has had its own port facilities in the ''Bolivian Free Port'' in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario, Argentina]]. This port is located on the [[Paraná River]], which is directly connected to the Atlantic Ocean.

The dispute with Chile was taken to the [[International Court of Justice]]. The court ruled in support of the Chilean position, and declared that although Chile may have held talks about a Bolivian corridor to the sea, the country was not required to actually negotiate one or to surrender its territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-chile-worldcourt/world-court-chile-not-forced-to-negotiate-over-bolivia-sea-access-idUSKCN1MB2YR|title= World Court: Chile not forced to negotiate over Bolivia sea access|author= Stephanie van den Berg, Aislinn Laing|date= October 1, 2018|work= Reuters|accessdate= October 1, 2018|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20181001200644/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-chile-worldcourt/world-court-chile-not-forced-to-negotiate-over-bolivia-sea-access-idUSKCN1MB2YR|archive-date= 1 October 2018|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolivian army has around 31,500 men. There are six military regions (''regiones militares''—RMs) in the army. The army is organized into ten divisions. Although it is landlocked Bolivia keeps a navy. The [[Bolivian Naval Force]] (''Fuerza Naval Boliviana'' in Spanish) is a naval force about 5,000 strong in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/bolivia | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Bolivia's landlocked sailors pine for the high seas | first=Rory | last=Carroll | date=28 August 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902165715/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/28/bolivia | archive-date=2 September 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bolivian Air Force]] ('Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' or 'FAB') has nine air bases, located at La Paz, Cochabamba, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]], [[Puerto Suárez]], [[Tarija, Bolivia|Tarija]], [[Villamontes]], [[Cobija]], [[Riberalta]], and [[Roboré]].

According to what is established by the Bolivian Political Constitution, the Law of Autonomies and Decentralization regulates the procedure for the elaboration of Statutes of Autonomy, the transfer and distribution of direct competences between the central government and the autonomous entities.&lt;ref&gt;Political Constitution of Bolivia, Article 271&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four levels of decentralization: Departmental government, constituted by the ''Departmental Assembly'', with rights over the legislation of the department. The [[governor]] is chosen by [[universal suffrage]]. Municipal government, constituted by a ''Municipal Council'', with rights over the legislation of the municipality. The [[mayor]] is chosen by universal suffrage. Regional government, formed by several provinces or municipalities of geographical continuity within a department. It is constituted by a ''Regional Assembly''. Original indigenous government, [[self-governance]] of original indigenous people on the ancient territories where they live.

Despite a series of mostly political setbacks, between 2006 and 2009 the Morales administration has spurred growth higher than at any point in the preceding 30 years.

A major blow to the Bolivian economy came with a drastic fall in the price of tin during the early 1980s, which impacted one of Bolivia's main sources of income and one of its major mining industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crabtree | first=J. |author2=Buffy, G. |author3=Pearce, J. | title=The Great Tin Crash: Bolivia and the World Tin Market | journal=Bulletin of Latin American Research | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=174–175 |year=1988 | doi=10.2307/3338459 | jstor=3338459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1985, the government of Bolivia has implemented a far-reaching program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform aimed at maintaining price stability, creating conditions for sustained growth, and alleviating scarcity. A major reform of the customs service has significantly improved transparency in this area. Parallel legislative reforms have locked into place market-liberal policies, especially in the hydrocarbon and telecommunication sectors, that have encouraged private investment. Foreign investors are accorded national treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35751.htm#econ |title=Economy of Bolivia |publisher=US State Government |date=23 October 2012 |accessdate=14 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000, Hugo Banzer, the former president of Bolivia, signed a contract with Aguas del Tunari, a private consortium, to operate and improve the water supply in Bolivia's third-largest city, [[Cochabamba]]. Shortly thereafter, the company tripled the water rates in that city, an action which resulted in [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests and rioting]] among those who could no longer afford clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hattam|first=Jennifer|title=Who Owns Water?|journal=Sierra|date=September 2001|volume=86|issue=5|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200109/lol1.asp|accessdate=14 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825105255/http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200109/lol1.asp|archive-date=25 August 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bolivia/ |title=Leasing the Rain |publisher=PBS Frontline/World |date=June 2002 |accessdate=14 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825104154/http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/bolivia/ |archive-date=25 August 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst Bolivia's nationwide economic collapse and growing national unrest over the state of the economy, the Bolivian government was forced to withdraw the water contract.

Bolivia has the second largest [[natural gas]] reserves in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7607158.stm |title=Anti-Morales protests hit Bolivia |work=BBC News |date=10 September 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327011113/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7607158.stm |archive-date=27 March 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has a long-term sales agreement to sell natural gas to Brazil through 2019. The government held a binding referendum in 2005 on the Hydrocarbon Law.

The [[United States Geological Survey|US Geological Service]] estimates that Bolivia has 5.4 million [[cubic ton]]nes of [[lithium]], which represent 50%–70% of world reserves. However, to mine for it would involve disturbing the country's salt flats (called [[Salar de Uyuni]]), an important natural feature which boosts tourism in the region. The government does not want to destroy this unique natural landscape to meet the rising world demand for lithium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7607624.stm | work=BBC News | title=Bolivia's lithium mining dilemma | date=10 September 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414021531/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7607624.stm | archive-date=14 April 2009 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, sustainable extraction of lithium is attempted by the government. This project is carried out by the public company &quot;Recursos Evaporíticos&quot; subsidiary of COMIBOL.

It is thought that due to the importance of lithium for batteries for [[electric vehicle]]s and stabilization of electric grids with large proportions of intermittent [[Renewable energy|renewables]] in the electricity mix, Bolivia could be strengthened geopolitically. However, this perspective has also been criticized for underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2019-03-01|title=The geopolitics of renewable energy: Debunking four emerging myths|journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science|volume=49|pages=36–40|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018|issn=2214-6296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Bolivia's government depended heavily on foreign assistance to finance development projects and to pay the public staff. At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5 billion to its foreign [[creditor]]s, with $1.6 billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the [[Paris Club]] mechanism. External creditors have been willing to do this because the Bolivian government has generally achieved the monetary and fiscal targets set by IMF programs since 1987, though economic crises have undercut Bolivia's normally good record. However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentina of natural gas.

=== Foreign-exchange reserves ===
The amount in reserve currencies and [[gold]] held by Bolivia's Central Bank advanced from 1.085 billion US dollars in 2000, under [[Hugo Banzer Suarez]]'s government, to 15.282 billion US dollars in 2014 under [[Evo Morales]]' government.

The fall from the narrow {{convert|12|ft|m}} path is as much as {{convert|2000|ft|m}} in some places and due to the humid weather from the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] there are often poor conditions like mudslides and falling rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Terrifying Tour of the World's Most Dangerous Road, North Yungas| work=Slate | accessdate=August 5, 2019 | date=October 24, 2013 |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/atlas_obscura/2013/10/24/a_terrifying_tour_of_the_world_s_most_dangerous_road_north_yungas_in_bolivia.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year over 25,000 bikers cycle along the {{convert|40|mi|km}} road.

[[File:Aviones de BoA en Cochabamba.jpg|thumb|[[Boliviana de Aviación]] (BoA) is a state-owned company and the country's largest airline. Two BoA Boeing 737-300s parked at [[Jorge Wilstermann International Airport]].]]
The General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics (Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil—DGAC) formerly part of the FAB, administers a civil aeronautics school called the National Institute of Civil Aeronautics (Instituto Nacional de Aeronáutica Civil—INAC), and two commercial air transport services TAM and TAB.

[[TAM – Transporte Aéreo Militar]] (the Bolivian Military Airline) was an airline based in La Paz, Bolivia. It was the civilian wing of the 'Fuerza Aérea Boliviana' (the Bolivian Air Force), operating passenger services to remote towns and communities in the North and Northeast of Bolivia. TAM (a.k.a. TAM Group 71) has been a part of the FAB since 1945. The airline company has suspended its operations since 23 September 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://simpleflying.com/tam-bolivia-suspends-operations/|title=Another Airline Casualty?

[[Boliviana de Aviación]], often referred to as simply BoA, is the flag carrier airline of Bolivia and is wholly owned by the country's government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boa.bo |title=Boliviana de Aviación |publisher=Boliviana de Aviación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A private airline serving regional destinations is [[Línea Aérea Amaszonas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amaszonas.com |title=Amaszonas |publisher=Amaszonas |accessdate=30 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804030849/http://www.amaszonas.com/ |archive-date=4 August 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with services including some international destinations.

Although a civil transport airline, [[TAB – Transportes Aéreos Bolivianos]], was created as a subsidiary company of the FAB in 1977. It is subordinate to the Air Transport Management (Gerencia de Transportes Aéreos) and is headed by an FAB general. TAB, a charter heavy cargo airline, links Bolivia with most countries of the [[Western Hemisphere]]; its inventory includes a fleet of Hercules C130 aircraft. TAB is headquartered adjacent to [[El Alto International Airport]]. TAB flies to [[Miami]] and [[Houston]], with a stop in [[Panama]].

The three largest, and main international airports in Bolivia are [[El Alto International Airport]] in La Paz, [[Viru Viru International Airport]] in Santa Cruz, and [[Jorge Wilstermann International Airport]] in Cochabamba.  There are regional airports in other cities that connect to these three hubs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://boliviamia.net/bolivia-aeropuertos |title=Aeropuertos en Bolivia |publisher=Aeropuertos en Bolivia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Bolivia}}
Bolivias's drinking water and [[sanitation]] coverage has greatly improved since 1990 due to a considerable increase in sectoral investment. However, the country has the continent's lowest coverage levels and services are of low quality. Political and institutional instability have contributed to the weakening of the sector's institutions at the national and local levels.

Two concessions to foreign private companies in two of the three largest cities – [[Cochabamba]] and [[La Paz]]/[[El Alto]] – were prematurely ended in 2000 and 2006 respectively. The country's second largest city, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], manages its own water and sanitation system relatively successfully by way of cooperatives. The government of [[Evo Morales]] intends to strengthen citizen participation within the sector. Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment financing.

According to the government the main problems in the sector are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of indigenous customs; &quot;technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects&quot;; a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is &quot;not consistent with the political change in the country&quot;; &quot;ambiguities in the social participation schemes&quot;; a reduction in the quantity and 
quality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and programs for the reuse of wastewater.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNSB&quot;&gt;Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia:[http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Basico 2008–2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228092846/http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf |date=28 February 2013 }}, retrieved on September 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Only 27% of the population has access to [[improved sanitation]], 80 to 88% has access to [[improved water source]]s. Coverage in urban areas is bigger than in rural ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;JMP&quot;&gt;[http://www.wssinfo.org/about-the-jmp/introduction/ JMP 2010 Estimates for Bolivia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110110338/http://www.wssinfo.org/about-the-jmp/introduction/ |date=10 November 2010 }}.

According to the last two censuses carried out by the Bolivian National Statistics Institute ''(Instituto Nacional de Estadística'', INE), the population increased from 8,274,325 (from which 4,123,850 were men and 4,150,475 were women) in 2001 to 10,059,856 in 2012.&lt;ref name=Cen2012&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ine.gob.bo:8081/censo2012/PDF/resultadosCPV2012.pdf | title=Principales resultados del censo nacional de población y vivienda 2012 (CNPV 2012) – Estado plurinacional de Bolivia | publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) | date=July 2013 | accessdate=8 August 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209134921/http://www.ine.gob.bo:8081/censo2012/PDF/resultadosCPV2012.pdf | archivedate=9 February 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last fifty years the Bolivian population has tripled, reaching a population growth rate of 2.25%. The growth of the population in the inter-census periods (1950–1976 and 1976–1992) was approximately 2.05%, while between the last period, 1992–2001, it reached 2.74% annually.

Some 67.49% of Bolivians live in urban areas, while the remaining 32.51% in rural areas. The most part of the population (70%) is concentrated in the departments of [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]], [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]] and [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]]. In the [[Andes|Andean]] [[Altiplano]] region the departments of La Paz and [[Oruro Department|Oruro]] hold the largest percentage of population, in the valley region the largest percentage is held by the departments of Cochabamba and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], while in the Llanos region by Santa Cruz and [[Beni Department|Beni]]. At national level, the population density is 8.49, with variations marked between 0.8 ([[Pando Department]]) and 26.2 (Cochabamba Department).

The largest population center is located in the so-called &quot;central axis&quot; and in the Llanos region. Bolivia has a young population. According to the 2011 census, 59% of the population is between 15 and 59 years old, 39% is less than 15 years old. Almost 60% of the population is younger than 25 years of age.

=== Genetics ===
According to a genetic study done on Bolivians, average values of Native American, European and African ancestry are 86%, 12.5%, and 1.5%, in individuals from La Paz and 76.8%, 21.4%, and 1.8% in individuals from Chuquisaca; respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255957174|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2013.05.012|pmid=23948324|title=Ancestry analysis reveals a predominant Native American component with moderate European admixture in Bolivians|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=7|issue=5|pages=537–42|year=2013|last1=Heinz|first1=Tanja|last2=Álvarez-Iglesias|first2=Vanesa|last3=Pardo-Seco|first3=Jacobo|last4=Taboada-Echalar|first4=Patricia|last5=Gómez-Carballa|first5=Alberto|last6=Torres-Balanza|first6=Antonio|last7=Rocabado|first7=Omar|last8=Carracedo|first8=Ángel|last9=Vullo|first9=Carlos|last10=Salas|first10=Antonio}}

=== Ethnic and racial classifications ===

[[File:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - Bolivia-133.jpg|thumb|[[Aymara people|Aymara]] man, near Lake Titicaca, Bolivia]]

The vast majority of Bolivians are [[mestizo]] (with the indigenous component higher than the European one), although the government has not included cultural self-identification &quot;mestizo&quot; in the November 2012 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213095613/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bl.html|archive-date=13 February 2011|url-status=live|access-date=2018-10-08|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are approximately three dozen native groups totaling approximately half of the Bolivian population – the largest proportion of indigenous people in Latin America. Exact numbers vary based on the wording of the ethnicity question and the available response choices. For example, the 2001 census did not provide the racial category &quot;mestizo&quot; as a response choice, resulting in a much higher proportion of respondents identifying themselves as belonging to one of the available indigenous ethnicity choices. Mestizos are distributed throughout the entire country and make up 26% of the Bolivian population. Most people assume their ''mestizo'' identity while at the same time identifying themselves with one or more indigenous cultures. A 2018 estimate of racial classification put mestizo (mixed white and Amerindian) at 68%, indigenous at 20%, white at 5%, [[cholo#Bolivia|cholo]] at 2%, black at 1%, other at 4%, while 2% were unspecified; 44% attributed themselves to some indigenous group, predominantly the linguistic categories of [[Quechuas]] or [[Aymara people|Aymaras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; [[White people|Whites]] comprised about 14% of the population in 2006, and are usually concentrated in the largest cities: [[La Paz]], [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and [[Cochabamba]], but as well in some minor cities like [[Tarija]] and [[Sucre]]. The ancestry of Whites and the White ancestry of Mestizos lies within the continents of [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], most notably [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Croatia]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. In the [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz Department]], there are several dozen colonies of German-speaking [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites from Russia]] totaling around 40,000 inhabitants ({{As of|2012|lc=y}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/americas/21bolivia.html |title=Bolivian Reforms Raise Anxiety on Mennonite Frontier |newspaper=New York Times |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=14 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622233205/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/world/americas/21bolivia.html |archive-date=22 June 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]], also called ''&quot;originarios&quot;'' (&quot;native&quot; or &quot;original&quot;) and less frequently, ''Amerindians'', could be categorized by geographic area, such as [[Andes|Andean]], like the [[Aymara people|Aymaras]] and [[Quechua people|Quechuas]] (who formed the ancient [[Inca Empire]]), who are concentrated in the western departments of [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz]], [[Potosí Department|Potosí]], [[Oruro Department|Oruro]], [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]. There also are ethnic populations in the east, composed of the [[Chiquitano]], [[Chané]], [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] and [[Moxo]]s, among others, who inhabit the departments of [[Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia|Santa Cruz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], [[Tarija Department|Tarija]] and [[Pando Department|Pando]].

There are small numbers of European citizens from [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]], as well as from other countries of the Americas, as [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Ecuador]], the [[United States]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]], among others. There are important [[Peru]]vian colonies in [[La Paz]], [[El Alto]] and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].

There are around 140,000 [[mennonites in Bolivia]] of Friesian, Flemish and German ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/pdt|title=Plautdietsch|accessdate=20 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bolivia&amp;oldid=103617|title=Bolivia|accessdate=20 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous peoples ====
The [[Indigenous peoples of Bolivia]] can be divided into two categories of ethnic groups: the Andeans, who are located in the [[Andes|Andean]] [[Altiplano]] and the valley region; and the lowland groups, who inhabit the warm regions of central and eastern Bolivia, including the valleys of Cochabamba Department, the Amazon Basin areas of northern La Paz Department, and the lowland departments of Beni, Pando, Santa Cruz, and Tarija (including the [[Gran Chaco]] region in the southeast of the country). Large numbers of Andean peoples have also migrated to form Quechua, Aymara, and intercultural communities in the lowlands.

*'''Andean ethnicities'''
** [[Aymara people]]. They live on the high plateau of the departments of La Paz, Oruro and Potosí, as well as some small regions near the tropical flatlands.
** [[Quechua people]]. They mostly inhabit the valleys in [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] and [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]]. They also inhabit some mountain regions in [[Potosí Department|Potosí]] and [[Oruro Department|Oruro]]. They divide themselves into different Quechua nations, as the Tarabucos, Ucumaris, Chalchas, Chaquies, Yralipes, Tirinas, among others.
** [[Uru people]]
*'''Ethnicities of the Eastern Lowlands'''
** [[Guaraní people|Guaraníes]]: made up of Guarayos, Pausernas, [[Sirionó]]s, Chiriguanos, [[Wichí]], Chulipis, Taipetes, [[Toba people|Tobas]], and Yuquis.
**'''Tacanas''': made up of Lecos, Chimanes, Araonas, and Maropas.
**'''Panos''': made up of Chacobos, Caripunas, Sinabos, Capuibos, and Guacanaguas.
**'''Aruacos''': made up of Apolistas, Baures, [[Moxo people|Moxos]], [[Chané people|Chané]], Movimas, Cayabayas, Carabecas, and Paiconecas (Paucanacas).
**'''Chapacuras''': made up of Itenez (More), Chapacuras, Sansinonianos, Canichanas, Itonamas, Yuracares, Guatoses, and [[Chiquitano]]s.
**'''Botocudos''': made up of Bororos and Otuquis.

The [[Constitution of Bolivia]] recognizes 36 official languages besides [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Araona language|Araona]], [[Baure language|Baure]], [[Bésiro language|Bésiro]], [[Canichana language|Canichana]], [[Cavineño language|Cavineño]], [[Cayubaba language|Cayubaba]], [[Chácobo language|Chácobo]], [[Chimán language|Chimán]], [[Ese Ejja language|Ese Ejja]], [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]], [[Guarasuawe language|Guarasu'we]], [[Guarayu language|Guarayu]], [[Itonama language|Itonama]], [[Leco language|Leco]], [[Machajuyai-Kallawaya]], [[Machineri language|Machineri]], [[Maropa language|Maropa]], [[Mojeño-Ignaciano]], [[Mojeño-Trinitario]], [[Moré language (Bolivia)|Moré]], [[Mosetén language|Mosetén]], [[Movima language|Movima]], [[Pacawara language|Pacawara]], [[Puquina language|Puquina]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Sirionó language|Sirionó]], [[Tacana language|Tacana]], [[Tapieté language|Tapieté]], [[Toromona language|Toromona]], [[Uru-Chipaya]], [[Weenhayek language|Weenhayek]], [[Yaminawa language|Yaminawa]], [[Yuki language (Bolivia)|Yuki]], [[Yuracaré language|Yuracaré]], and [[Zamuco language|Zamuco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;languages&quot;/&gt;

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most spoken official language in the country, according to the 2001 census; as it is spoken by two-thirds of the population. All legal and official documents issued by the State, including the Constitution, the main private and public institutions, the media, and commercial activities, are in Spanish.

The main indigenous languages are: [[Quechua language|Quechua]] (21.2% of the population in the 2001 census), [[Aymara language|Aymara]] (14.6%), [[Guarani language|Guarani]] (0.6%) and others (0.4%) including the [[Moxos language|Moxos]] in the department of Beni.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Bolivia}}

Bolivia is a constitutionally [[secular state]] that guarantees the [[freedom of religion]] and the independence of government from religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitute Assembly of Bolivia 2007 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Constitute Assembly of Bolivia|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2001 [[census]] conducted by the [[National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia]], 78% of the population is [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]], followed by 19% that are [[Protestant]], as well as a small number of Bolivians that are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], and 3% non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90243.htm | title= Bolivia religion | publisher= Department of State | location= USA | date= 14 September 2007 | accessdate= 30 August 2010 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://institutointerglobal.org/ateismo/1545-ateos-en-numeros|title=Ateos en números|publisher=InterGlobal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205041006/http://institutointerglobal.org/ateismo/1545-ateos-en-numeros|archivedate=5 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on the World Christian Database) records that in 2010, 92.5% of Bolivians identified as [[Christianity|Christian]] (of any denomination), 3.1% identified with indigenous religion, 2.2% identified as [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], 1.9% identified as [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], and all other groups constituted 0.1% or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia: Adherents|url=http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_27_2.asp|website=The Association of Religious Data Archives|access-date=5 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015204554/http://www.thearda.com/internationalData/countries/Country_27_2.asp|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the indigenous population adheres to different traditional beliefs marked by [[inculturation]] or [[Syncretic|syncretisim]] with Christianity. The cult of [[Pachamama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catamarcaguia.com.ar/Cultura/Pachamama.php |title=Pachamama y los Dioses Incaicos |publisher=Catamarcaguia.com.ar |accessdate=14 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117013359/http://www.catamarcaguia.com.ar/Cultura/Pachamama.php |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, is notable. The veneration of the [[Virgen de Copacabana|Virgin of Copacabana]], Virgin of Urkupiña and Virgin of Socavón, is also an important feature of [[Christian pilgrimage]]. There also are important [[Aymara people|Aymaran communities]] near [[Lake Titicaca]] that have a strong devotion to [[James, son of Zebedee|James the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bolivia.com/Noticias/AutoNoticias/DetalleNoticia32134.asp|publisher=Bolivia.com|title=El Tata Santiago, un santo en Guaqui con vena de general|access-date=7 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206130141/http://www.bolivia.com/Noticias/AutoNoticias/DetalleNoticia32134.asp|archive-date=6 February 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deities worshiped in Bolivia include [[Ekeko]], the Aymaran god of abundance and prosperity, whose day is celebrated every 24 January, and [[Guarani mythology|Tupá]], a god of the [[Guaraní people]].

=== Largest cities and towns ===
Approximately 67% of Bolivians live in urban areas,&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot; /&gt; among the lowest proportion in South America. Nevertheless, the rate of urbanization is growing steadily, at around 2.5% annually. According to the 2012 census, there are total of 3,158,691 households in Bolivia – an increase of 887,960 from 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cen2012&quot; /&gt; In 2009, 75.4% of homes were classified as a house, hut, or Pahuichi; 3.3% were apartments; 21.1% were rental residences; and 0.1% were [[mobile home]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ine.gob.bo/indicadoresddhh/vivi4.asp | title=Bolivia: Hogares por Tipo y Tenencia de la Vivienda, Según Área Geográfica, 2000 – 2009 |trans-title=Bolivia: Households by Type and Tenure, According to Geographic Area, 2000 – 2009 | publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics of Bolivia]] | accessdate=28 January 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113183010/http://www.ine.gob.bo/indicadoresddhh/vivi4.asp | archivedate=13 November 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the country's largest cities are located in the highlands of the west and central regions.

[[File:Niños ejecutando una tarkeada.jpg|thumb|Bolivian children playing [[Tarka (flute)|tarka]]]]
Bolivian culture has been heavily influenced by the Aymara, the Quechua, as well as the popular cultures of Latin America as a whole.

The cultural development is divided into three distinct periods: precolumbian, colonial, and republican. Important [[archaeology|archaeological]] ruins, gold and silver ornaments, stone monuments, [[ceramic]]s, and [[weaving]]s remain from several important pre-Columbian cultures. Major ruins include [[Tiwanaku]], [[El Fuerte de Samaipata]], [[Inkallaqta]] and [[Iskanawaya]]. The country abounds in other sites that are difficult to reach and have seen little archaeological exploration.&lt;ref name=&quot;BackgroundNote&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Background Note: Bolivia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35751.htm |accessdate=17 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish brought their own tradition of religious art which, in the hands of local native and mestizo builders and [[artisan]]s, developed into a rich and distinctive style of architecture, painting, and sculpture known as &quot;Mestizo Baroque&quot;. The colonial period produced not only the paintings of Pérez de Holguín, Flores, Bitti, and others but also the works of skilled but unknown stonecutters, woodcarvers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths. An important body of Native Baroque religious music of the colonial period was recovered and has been performed internationally to wide acclaim since 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;BackgroundNote&quot;/&gt;

Bolivian artists of stature in the 20th century include [[María Luisa Pacheco]], [[Roberto Mamani Mamani]], [[Alejandro Mario Yllanes]], [[Alfredo Da Silva]], and [[Marina Núñez del Prado]].

Bolivia has a rich [[folklore]]. Its regional [[folk music]] is distinctive and varied. The &quot;devil dances&quot; at the annual carnival of Oruro are one of the great folkloric events of South America, as is the lesser known carnival at [[Tarabuco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BackgroundNote&quot;/&gt;
