'''''Beavis and Butt-Head''''' is an American [[Adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Mike Judge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-22/entertainment/ca-556_1_mike-judge|title=That's Mr. Beavis and Butt-head to You|last=Strauss|first=Robert|date=November 22, 1994|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715012146/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-22/entertainment/ca-556_1_mike-judge|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series originated from ''[[Frog Baseball]]'', a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on ''[[Liquid Television]]''. After seeing the short, [[MTV]] signed Judge to develop the short into a full series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-16/entertainment/ca-664_1_animation-festival|title=MTV Toon Dudes Are Slow on Two Counts Television|last=Cerone|first=Daniel|date=March 16, 1993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715030747/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-03-16/entertainment/ca-664_1_animation-festival|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/entertainment/ca-57733|title=Butt-head, We Hardly Knew Ye|last=Rosenberg|first=Howard|date=November 26, 1997|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 8, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324125445/http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/26/entertainment/ca-57733|archive-date=March 24, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series originally ran for seven seasons from March 8, 1993 to November 28, 1997.

During its initial run, Beavis and Butt-Head received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its satirical, scathing commentary on society. It was a subject of controversy for its violent content. Fourteen years following the end of the series, the series was revived for an eighth season airing from October 27 to December 29, 2011. A theatrical feature-length film based on the series titled ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head Do America]]'' was released in 1996 by [[Paramount Pictures]].

==Premise==
{{See also|List of Beavis and Butt-Head characters}}

The series centers on two socially-incompetent, dimwitted, [[Juvenile delinquency|teenage delinquent]], [[Sedentary lifestyle|couch potatoes]] named [[Beavis]] and [[Butt-Head]] (both voiced by Judge). They go to school at Highland High located in Highland, Texas. If they are not at school or out causing mayhem, they will be in front of the TV. Beavis and Butt-head have no adult supervision at home and are barely literate. Both lack any empathy or moral scruples even when it regards to each other. They will usually deem their encounters as &quot;cool&quot; if they are associated with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], violence, sex, destruction, or [[macabre]]. While inexperienced with females, they both share an obsession with sex and tend to chuckle whenever they hear words or phrases that could be even [[Throat-clear|vaguely]] interpreted as sexual, [[Carnal knowledge|carnal]] or [[scatological]].

Each episode features frequent interstitial scenes in which they critique [[music video]]s using commentary improvised by Judge (much in the same way as ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''; in season eight, they also commented on clips from other MTV shows such as ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and ''[[True Life]]'', plus shows from other [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]-owned networks such as [[Paramount Network|Spike]]) The remainder of the episodes depict the duo embarking on some kind of scheme or adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-08-02/features/1997214087_1_beavis-and-butt-head-butt-head-do-america-groupie|title=Goodbye, cool world TV: Beavis and Butt-head, nasty, dumb, hysterical little boogers, are going off the air.

Their actions sometimes result in serious consequences, sometimes for themselves but often for others in which they themselves do not express any remorse.

It would be easy to attack B&amp;B as ignorant, vulgar, depraved, repulsive slobs. Of course they are. But that would miss the point, which is that Mike Judge's characters reflect parts of the society that produced them.

Over its run, ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' drew a notable amount of both positive and negative reactions from the public with its combination of lewd humor, and implied criticism of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/arts/television-keeping-beavis-and-butt-head-just-stupid-enough.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head&amp;st=cse|title=TELEVISION; Keeping Beavis and Butt-Head Just Stupid Enough|last=Kolbert|first=Elizabeth|date=October 17, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116154025/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/17/arts/television-keeping-beavis-and-butt-head-just-stupid-enough.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head&amp;st=cse|archive-date=January 16, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the focus of criticism from some social critics, such as [[Michael Medved]] while others such as [[David Letterman]] and the ''[[National Review]],'' defended it as a cleverly subversive vehicle for social criticism and a particularly creative and intelligent comedy. Either way, the show captured the attention of many young television viewers and is often considered a classic piece of 1990s youth culture and [[Generation X]]. [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], creators of ''[[South Park]],'' cite the series as an influence and compared it to the [[blues]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Taint of Greatness: The Journey of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 2,&quot; in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Dan Tobin of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' commented on the series' humor, saying it transformed &quot;stupidity into a crusade, forcing us to acknowledge how little it really takes to make us laugh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/11/BEAVIS_AND_BUTTHEAD.html|title=Butting out|last=Tobin|first=Dan|date=November 26, 1997|work=[[The Boston Phoenix]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228022024/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/11/BEAVIS_AND_BUTTHEAD.html|archive-date=February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Ted Drozdowski of ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'' described the 1997 ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' state as &quot;reduced to self-parody of their self-parody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html|title=Eye pleasers|last=Drozdowski|first=Ted|date=May 8, 1997|work=[[The Boston Phoenix]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203205756/http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html|archive-date=February 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2005, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked the duo's distinct laughing at #66 on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvland.com/originals/catchphrases/quotes.jhtml The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313194321/http://www.tvland.com/originals/catchphrases/quotes.jhtml |date=2008-03-13 }}, TV Guide.

[[Mike Judge]] himself is highly critical of the animation and quality of earlier episodes, in particular the first two—''Give Blood''/''Blood Drive'' and ''Door to Door''—which he described as &quot;awful, I don't know why anybody liked it{{nbsp}}... I was burying my head in the sand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Taint of Greatness: The Story of Beavis and Butt-Head Part 1&quot;, in ''The Mike Judge Collection'' Volume 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Early episodes depicted a juvenile obsession with fire and other dangerous behaviors, summed up with Beavis's chanting of &quot;Fire! Fire!&quot;. The show was blamed for the death of two-year-old Jessica Messner in [[Moraine, Ohio]], in October 1993. The girl's five-year-old brother, Austin, set fire to his mother's mobile home with a [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]], killing the two-year-old.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/us/cartoon-on-mtv-blamed-for-fire.html|title=Cartoon On MTV Blamed For Fire|last=|first=|date=October 10, 1993|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 29, 2010|agency=[[The Associated Press]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516072740/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/10/us/cartoon-on-mtv-blamed-for-fire.html|archive-date=May 16, 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, MTV pulled the episode temporarily. The mother later claimed that her son watched one of the fire-related segments shortly before he burned down the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot; /&gt; However, neighbors claimed that the family didn't even have [[cable television]], and was unable to view the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rolling Stone|date=March 24, 1994|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, all references to fire were removed from subsequent airings and prompted the show to a later time slot.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-10-14-ca-45776-story.html|title=Child's Death Prompts MTV to Retool 'Beavis'|date=1993-10-14|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;The creators found a censorship [[loophole]] and took delight in sometimes making Beavis scream things that sounded very similar to his previous &quot;Fire! Fire!&quot; (such as &quot;Fryer! Fryer!&quot; when he and Butt-Head are working the late shift at Burger World) and also having him almost say the forbidden word (such as one time when he sang &quot;Liar, liar, pants on{{nbsp}}...&quot; and pausing before &quot;fire&quot;). There was also a music video where a man runs on fire in slow motion (&quot;California&quot; by [[Wax (rock band)|Wax]]). Beavis is hypnotized by it and can barely say &quot;fire&quot;. However, MTV eventually removed the episode entirely. References to fire were cut from earlier episodes — even the original master tapes were altered permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonic.net/~goblin/9beavis.html|title=Heh-Heh-Heh...

Copies of early episodes with the controversial content intact are rare, and the copies that exist are made from home video recordings of the original broadcasts. In an interview included with the ''Mike Judge Collection'' DVD set, Judge said he is uncertain whether some of the earlier episodes still exist in their original, uncensored form.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

When the series returned in 2011, MTV allowed Beavis to use the word &quot;fire&quot; once again uncensored.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS-2010-08-03&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-mike-judge-on-the-return-of-beavis-and-butt-head-20100803|title=Exclusive: Mike Judge on the Return of 'Beavis and Butt-Head'|last=Greene|first=Andy|date=August 3, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116041646/http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/exclusive-mike-judge-on-the-return-of-beavis-and-butt-head-20110803|archivedate=November 16, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first video segment, &quot;[[Werewolves of Highland]]&quot;, the first new episode of the revival, Beavis utters the word &quot;fire&quot; a total of seven times within 28 seconds, with Butt-head saying it once as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= [[Werewolves of Highland]] |series= Beavis and Butt-head |network=MTV |date= October 27, 2011|season=8 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1994, watchdog group [[Morality in Media]] claimed that the death of eight-month-old Natalia Rivera, struck by a [[bowling ball]] thrown from an overpass onto a highway in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], near the [[Holland Tunnel]] by 18-year-old Calvin J. Settle, was partially inspired by ''Beavis and Butt-Head''.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/10/nyregion/youth-is-held-in-death-from-bowling-ball.html?pagewanted=all|title=Youth Is Held In Death From Bowling Ball|last=Levy|first=Clifford J.|date=February 10, 1994|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727153138/https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/10/nyregion/youth-is-held-in-death-from-bowling-ball.html?pagewanted=all|archive-date=July 27, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group said that Settle was influenced by the episode &quot;Ball Breakers&quot;, in which Beavis and Butt-Head load a bowling ball with explosives and drop it from a rooftop.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt; While Morality in Media claimed that the show inspired Settle's actions, the case's prosecutors did not. It was later revealed by both prosecutors and the defendant that Settle did not have cable TV, nor did he watch the show.

In &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;, the show parodies the desire to blame things on youth culture. When a reporter asks the duo why they had been flying a kite in a thunderstorm, they explain that they had been [[Kite experiment|inspired]] by a documentary about &quot;some old dude with long hair and glasses&quot;. The interview continues until they mention having watched rock music videos earlier in the day; the reporter concludes (on the air) that the videos are to blame for their actions.

MTV also responded by broadcasting the program after 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., and included a disclaimer, reminding viewers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Beavis and Butt-Head are not real. They are stupid cartoon people completely made up by [[Mike Judge|this Texas guy]] whom we hardly even know. Beavis and Butt-Head are dumb, crude, thoughtless, ugly, sexist, self-destructive fools. But for some reason, the little wienerheads make us laugh.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This was later changed to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Beavis and Butt-Head are not role models. They're not even human. They're cartoons. Some of the things they do would cause a person to get hurt, expelled, arrested, possibly [[deported]]. To put it another way: don't try this at home.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This disclaimer also appears before the opening of their [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games as well as their [[Windows]] game ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Beavis and Butt-Head (TV Series 1993–2011) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105950/crazycredits|access-date=2019-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were famously lambasted by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[South Carolina]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ernest Hollings|Fritz Hollings]] as &quot;Buffcoat and Beaver&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1997/08/15/end-beavis-and-butt-head/|title=Dude...

For example, one character on the show, Tom Anderson, originally called them &quot;Butthole&quot; and &quot;Joe&quot;, and believed the two to be of Asian ethnicity. (describing them to the police as &quot;[[Oriental]]&quot;) In later episodes, Anderson uses the Hollings mispronunciation once, and on at least one occasion refers to them as &quot;Penis and Butt-Munch&quot;. [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] called them &quot;Beavis and Bum-head&quot; in &quot;Citizen Butt-head&quot;, as well as in the [[Beavis and Butt-head Do America|movie]], where an old lady (voiced by [[Cloris Leachman]]) consistently calls them &quot;Travis&quot; and &quot;Bob-head&quot;. In &quot;Incognito&quot;, when another student threatens to kill them, the duo uses this to their advantage, pretending to be exchange students named &quot;Crevis and Bung-Head&quot;. The bully, seeing through the disguises, calls them &quot;Beaver and Butt-Plug&quot;. In &quot;Right On!&quot;, when the duo appear on the ''Gus Baker Show'', host Gus Baker (a caricature of [[Rush Limbaugh]]) introduces them as &quot;Beavis and Buffcoat&quot;.

Beavis and Butt-Head have been compared to [[Savant syndrome|idiot savants]] because of their creative and subversively intelligent observations of music videos. This part of the show was mostly improvised by [[Mike Judge]]. With regard to criticisms of the two as &quot;idiots&quot;, Judge responded that a show about straight-A students would not be funny.

== Satire ==
{{Fanpov|date=January 2020}}
Beavis and Butt-head are satirical devices.

In Beavis and Butt-head, the idea of traditional and progressive styles of teaching are expressed through Mr. Buzzcut and Mr. Van Driessen. Judge contrasts between the well-established image of a teacher that makes a connection with their student, to the perspective of Beavis and Butt-head that every teacher sucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weber, S. and Mitchell, C. 1995.

==Film==
{{Main|Beavis and Butt-Head Do America}}

In 1996, a full-length film featuring the duo titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head Do America'' was released in theaters by [[Paramount Pictures]]. The film features the voices of [[Bruce Willis]], [[Demi Moore]], [[Cloris Leachman]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[Greg Kinnear]] (in an uncredited role) and [[David Letterman]]. (credited as Earl Hofert) It gained mostly positive reviews from film critics and a &quot;two thumbs up&quot; from [[Gene Siskel|Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert|Ebert]]. The film earned over $60 million at the domestic box office, a strong return for a film that cost only $12 million to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl88376833/weekend/|title=Beavis and Butt-Head Do America|website=Box Office Mojo|access-date=2019-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2010, a spokesperson for MTV Networks informed a ''[[New York Post]]'' reporter that Mike Judge was creating a new ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' series, that Judge would reprise his voice-acting roles for the show, and that the animation would be hand-drawn. According to [[TMZ]], MTV had not asked [[Tracy Grandstaff]] to reprise her role as [[Daria Morgendorffer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tmz.com/2011/02/05/beavis-butthead-daria-morgendorffer-mtv-show-mike-judge/|title=Daria Left Out of 'Beavis and Butt-Head' Reboot|work=TMZ|date=8 February 2011|accessdate=2011-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624090530/http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/05/beavis-butthead-daria-morgendorffer-mtv-show-mike-judge|archive-date=24 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview, Judge was asked if ''Daria'' was coming back, and he said: &quot;No. There's sort of a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in one episode.

John Altschuler, formerly a writer for ''[[King of the Hill]]'', told a ''Rolling Stone'' reporter that he saw signs that Mike Judge was thinking of reviving ''Beavis and Butt-head''. On more than one occasion, Judge told the writers that one of their ideas for an episode of ''King of the Hill'' would work well for ''Beavis and Butt-head''; eventually he concluded, &quot;Maybe we should just actually make some good ''Beavis and Butt-head'' episodes.&quot; Later, a [[Lady Gaga]] video convinced Van Toffler of the tenability of a ''Beavis and Butt-head'' revival: &quot;I felt like there was a whole crop of new artists—and what the world sorely missed was the point of view that only Beavis and Butt-Head could bring.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs /&gt;

As part of a promotional campaign for the new series, cinemas screening ''[[Jackass 3D]]'' opened the [[feature film]] with a [[3-D film|3-D]] ''Beavis and Butt-head'' short subject. Months later, in a media presentation on February 2, 2010, MTV announced that the series would premiere in mid-2011. On July 21, 2011 Mike Judge spoke and fielded questions on a panel at [[Comic-Con International]]. A preview of the episode &quot;Holy Cornholio&quot; was also shown.&lt;ref&gt;Sitterson, Aubrey.

It's the thing I'm most proud of.&quot; However, he also added, &quot;Another movie{{nbsp}}... the problem is it takes a year and half, two years, two and a half years—maybe—to do that right. And that's a pretty strong level of commitment. I'm going to look at that again. That comes up every three years.&quot; One of his ideas is bringing back the characters as old men, instead of teenagers. &quot;I kind of think of them as being either 15 or in their 60s,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn't mind doing something with them as these two dirty old men sitting on the couch.&quot; Judge added that he would not completely ignore the time that has passed in between.

In 2016, Judge told [[RadioTimes.com]] &quot;Maybe it could be a live-action someday&quot;, then went on to speculate that Beavis might be homeless by now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A single [[LaserDisc]] volume titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head: The Essential Collection'' was released on June 27, 1994. It contains all the episodes from ''Work Sucks!'' on one side and the episodes from ''There Goes the Neighborhood'' on the other side. The volumes ''The Final Judgment'' and ''Beavis &amp; Butt-head Do Christmas'' were also released on [[DVD]] during the early days of the format.

===Time Life===

All of the U.S. VHS Volumes were later issued on DVD in five two-disc sets through the [[Time Life]] organization. The DVD releases were titled ''The Best of Beavis and Butt-Head''. The third DVD release of Beavis and Butt-Head was two series of three-disc sets released by Time-Life in December 2002.

The first set in the series contained the same program content of six of the Beavis and Butt-Head VHS compilations previously released by Sony Music Video from 1994 to 1999: Butt-O-Ween, Beavis and Butt-Head Do Christmas, Innocence Lost, Chicks 'n' Stuff, Feel Our Pain, and Troubled Youth, with two VHS compilations combined into a single disc. The set was advertised considerably on networks such as Comedy Central and on the Time-Life website.

Sometime after the first release, a second set of Time-Life Beavis and Butt-Head DVDs was released. This set contained the programs of the remaining SMV VHS compilations: Work Sucks, There Goes the Neighborhood, The Final Judgement, Law-Abiding Citizens, and Hard Cash. Two of the discs in the set once again contained the program content of two of the VHS tapes, while the last disc (Hard Cash) contained only the content of the final VHS program, but did additionally include four of the music video segments from the original broadcasts with Beavis and Butt-Head commentating. The second Time-Life set was not advertised, and subsequently became rarer. They also released VHS version of the Time Life collection.

===''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head''===

Paramount announced the release of a two-disc DVD set titled ''The History of Beavis and Butt-Head'' which was scheduled for release in September 2002 in the United States. However, its release was cancelled at the last moment at the demand of Judge, who owned approval rights for video releases of the series. According to Judge, the ''History'' set was made up of episodes that he had previously rejected for home video release and had been prepared without his knowledge or consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=Tasha |url=https://avclub.com/content/node/23060 |title=Mike Judge |newspaper=The A.V.

Many copies were mistakenly put on store shelves on the scheduled release date, only to be immediately recalled. The set is currently selling on [[eBay]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] for very high prices. Some brand new copies are being sold for over $300.

===''The Mike Judge Collection''===

On January 27, 2008, MTV and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] made all three collections available on the [[iTunes Store]]. A Blu-ray and DVD release of Season 8, titled ''Beavis and Butt-Head – Volume 4'', was released on February 15, 2012 in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Volume-4/16232 ''Beavis and Butt-head – Volume 4''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122203845/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beavis-Butt-head-Volume-4/16232 |date=2011-11-22 }} at TV Shows on DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

Many music video segments and content from other third parties were never released due to licensing issues with the rights holders. Early episodes featuring Beavis and Butt-Head engaging in unusually cruel and criminal activities were never released due to Mike Judge and MTV's dislike of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/beavis-and-butt-heads-complete-collection-dvd-review/|title=Why BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD's Incomplete &quot;Complete Collection&quot; May Be the Closest We'll Come|publisher=[[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]]|author=Luke Y.

===Marvel===

From 1994 to 1996, [[Marvel Comics]] published a monthly ''Beavis and Butt-Head'' comic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotextra.com/bandbcollectiblescomics.html |title=Beavis and Butthead Central |publisher=Hotextra.com |accessdate=2011-10-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029233814/http://hotextra.com/bandbcollectiblescomics.html |archive-date=2011-10-29 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Marvel Absurd]] imprint by a variety of writers, but with each issue drawn by artist Rick Parker. It was also reprinted by Marvel UK, which created new editorial material.

The letters page was answered by Beavis and Butt-Head or one of their supporting characters. Instead of reviewing music videos, they reviewed (custom-made) pages from other Marvel Comics. In their review of a [[Ghost Rider]] comic, Beavis tries to avoid using the word &quot;fire&quot; to describe the character's fiery skull.

In the comic, minor characters like Earl, Billy Bob, Clark Cobb, and Mistress Cora Anthrax would get repeated appearances; Earl was quite regular, and Anthrax was in two issues and got to answer a letter's page.

===''Daria''===
{{Main|Daria}}

A spin-off based on classmate Daria Morgendorffer premiered in 1997. Mike Judge was not involved at all except to give permission for use of the character (created by [[Glenn Eichler]] and designed by Bill Peckmann).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Brainy 'Beavis' Pal 'Daria' Spins Off|newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= March 3, 1997|url= https://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-03/entertainment/ca-34294_1_daria-morgendorffer|accessdate= 2010-11-20|first= Howard|last= Rosenberg|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120715015913/http://articles.latimes.com/1997-03-03/entertainment/ca-34294_1_daria-morgendorffer|archive-date= July 15, 2012|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only reference to the original show is Daria's mentioning that Lawndale can't be a second Highland &quot;unless there's uranium in the drinking water here too&quot;.
