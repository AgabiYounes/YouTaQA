'''{{lang|tr|Bursa|italics=no}}''' is a large city in [[Turkey]], located in northwestern [[Anatolia]], within the [[Marmara Region]]. The [[list of cities in Turkey|fourth most populous]] city in Turkey and [[List of largest cities and towns in Turkey|second most populous]] in [[Marmara Region]], Bursa functions as one of the [[Economy of Turkey| industrial and trade centres of Turkey]] (especially in respect of the automotive industry). The city is also the capital of [[Bursa Province]].

Bursa ({{lang-ota|بورسا}}) was the first major and second overall capital of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman State]] between 1335 and 1363. The city was referred to as {{lang|tr|Hüdavendigar}} ({{lang|ota|خداوندگار}}, from the [[Persian language|Persian]] name translated as &quot;God's gift&quot;) during the [[Ottoman Empire| Ottoman]] period, while a more recent nickname is {{lang|tr|Yeşil Bursa}} (&quot;{{lang|en|Green Bursa}}&quot;) in reference to the parks and gardens located across its urban fabric, as well as to the vast and richly varied forests of the surrounding region. [[Uludağ |Mount Uludağ]], the ancient Mysian Olympus, towers over it, and has a well-known [[ski resort]]. Bursa has rather orderly urban growth and borders a fertile plain. The [[mausoleums]] of the early [[Ottoman Dynasty| Ottoman sultans]] are located in Bursa, and the city's main landmarks include numerous edifices built throughout the Ottoman period. Bursa also has [[thermal bath]]s, old Ottoman mansions, palaces, and [https://www.bursa.com.tr/kategori/tarih-kultur/muzeler several museums].

The [[shadow play | shadow-play]] characters [[Karagöz and Hacivat]] are based on historic personalities who lived and died in Bursa (in the 14th century). The city is also known for {{lang|tr|[[İskender kebap]]}}, pideli köfte, cantık,  [[marron glacé]] and Bursa peaches. Bursa houses the [[Uludağ University]], and its population can claim one of the highest overall levels of education in Turkey. The historic towns of [[İznik]] ([[Nicaea]]), [[Zeytinbağı]] ([[Tirilye]]) are near the [[Bursa|centrum]].

{{As of | 2015}} [[Bursa]] had a population of 1,854,285, and [[Bursa Province]] had 2,842,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;citypopulation.de&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rapor.tuik.gov.tr&quot;/&gt;

The earliest known human settlement near Bursa's current location was at Ilıpınar Höyüğü around 5200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ilıpınar Excavations I|last = Roodenberg|first = J.

Prusias rebuilt the city and renamed it '''Prusa''' ({{lang-grc|Προῦσα}}; sometimes rendered as '''Prussa'''). After 128 years of Bithynian rule, [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia|Nicomedes IV]], the last King of [[Bithynia]], bequeathed the entire kingdom to the [[Roman Empire]] in 74 BC. An early [[Bursa Treasure|Roman Treasure]] was found in the vicinity of Bursa in the early 20th century. Composed of a woman's silver toilet articles, it is now in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Bursa,+tomb|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for Bursa, tomb|work=British Museum|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bursa became the first major capital city of the early [[Ottoman Empire]] following its capture from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in 1326. As a result, the city witnessed a considerable amount of urban growth throughout the 14th century. After conquering [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) in [[East Thrace]], the Ottomans turned it into the new capital city in 1363, but Bursa retained its spiritual and commercial importance in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In 1363 the Ottoman capital moved from Bursa to Edirne, although Bursa retained its spiritual and economic importance.&quot; [http://www.otelcenneti.com/oteller/bursa ''Ottoman Capital Bursa''].

The population of Bursa was 45,000 in 1487.&lt;ref&gt;''The city in the Islamic world'', Volume 1, ed. [[Salma Khadra Jayyusi]], Renata Holod, Attilio Petruccioli, André Raymond, page 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Ottoman period, Bursa continued to be the source of most royal [[silk]] products. Aside from the local silk production, the city imported raw silk from [[Iran]], and occasionally from [[China]], and was the main production centre for the kaftans, pillows, embroidery and other silk products for the Ottoman palaces until the 17th century.

Following the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Bursa became one of the industrial centres of the country. The economic development of the city was followed by population growth and Bursa became the 4th most populous city in [[Turkey]].

The city has traditionally been a pole of attraction, and was a major centre for refugees from various ethnic backgrounds who immigrated to [[Anatolia]] from the [[Balkans]] during the loss of the [[Ottoman territories in Europe]] between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most recent arrival of [[Turks in Europe#Balkan Turks|Balkan Turks]] took place in the 1940s until the 1990s, when the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] expelled approximately 150,000 [[Bulgarian Turks in Turkey|Bulgarian Turks]] to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Eminov, Ali, ''Turks and Other Muslim Minorities in Bulgaria'', New York, Routledge, 1997, Höpken, W., &quot;Modernisierung und Nationalismus: Sozialgeschichtliche Aspekte der bulgarischen Minderheitenpolitik gegenüber den Türken&quot; in: SOE 7-8 (1986), Schönfeld, R., ed, ''Nationalitätenprobleme in Südosteuropa'', Munich, Oldenbourg, 1997, p. 255-303, Erdinç, Didar, &quot;Bulgaristan'daki Değişim Sürecinde Türk Azınlığın Ekonomik Durumu&quot;, ''Türkler'', Ankara, 2002, s.394–400.&lt;/ref&gt; About one-third of these 150,000 Bulgarian Turkish refugees eventually settled in Bursa (especially in Hürriyet Neighborhood.

Traditionally, Bursa was famous for being the largest centre of [[silk]] trade in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, during the period of the lucrative [[Silk Road]]. The city is still a major centre for textiles in Turkey and is home to the Bursa International Textiles and Trade Centre ({{lang|tr|Bursa Uluslararası Tekstil ve Ticaret Merkezi}}, or {{lang|tr|BUTTIM}}). Bursa was also known for its fertile soil and agricultural activities, which have decreased in the recent decades due to the heavy industrialization of the city.

Bursa is a major centre for tourism. One of the most popular [[skiing]] resorts of Turkey is located at [[Uludağ|Mount Uludağ]], just next to the city proper.

The citizens of Bursa also prefer Istanbul's airports such as [[Istanbul Airport]] and [[Sabiha Gökçen International Airport]] for flights to foreign countries, due to Istanbul's proximity to Bursa. There are numerous daily bus and ferry services between the two cities.

The {{convert|8.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} long [[Bursa Uludağ Gondola]] ({{lang-tr|Teleferik}}) connects Bursa with the ski resort areas {{convert|1870|m|ft|abbr=on}} high on the mountain [[Uludağ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.leitner-ropeways.com/en/company/references/gd8-bursa-i-ii-iii-716/|title=GD8 Bursa I + II + III - References - Company - LEITNER ropeways|website=www.leitner-ropeways.com|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Mimarlık Fakültesi.jpg|thumb|[[Uludağ University]]]]

Bursa has two public universities and one private university. [[Uludağ University]], founded in 1975 in [[Görükle]], is the oldest institution of higher education in the city. Founded first as the Bursa University then renamed Uludağ University in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uludag.edu.tr/konu/view/15|title=Uludağ Üniversitesi Hakkında|last=|first=|date=|website=Uludağ Üniversitesi Resmi Websitesi|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the university has a student body of 47,000, one of the largest in Turkey. [[Bursa Technical University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btu.edu.tr/ |title=Bursa Teknik Üniversitesi |publisher=Btu.edu.tr |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the second public university of Bursa and was established in 2010, beginning education in the 2011–2012 academic year.

The first private university of Bursa was the [[Bursa Orhangazi University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bou.edu.tr/ |title=Bursa Orhangazi Üniversitesi |publisher=Bou.edu.tr |accessdate=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072854/http://www.bou.edu.tr/ |archivedate=2013-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which started education in the 2012–2013 academic year. However, Orhangazi University was shut down by the Turkish Government after the failed coup attempt of July 2016.  [[Istanbul Commerce University]] has opened graduate programs in Bursa in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==

The city has one professional football club,  [[Bursaspor]], which competes in the Turkish Super League, the top-tier of Turkish football. As of December 21, the team plays their home games at ''The Timsah Arena'' stadium (literally meaning Crocodile Arena), which has a sitting capacity of 45,000.  [[Bursaspor]] has won its first league title in the 2009–10 Turkish Super League season, becoming the second Anatolian club to ever win the league title after Trabzonspor. Today Bursaspor is considered one of the five biggest football clubs in Turkey along with Galatasaray SK, Fenerbahçe, Beşiktaş, and Trabzonspor.

The city has a professional [[basketball]] team in the [[Turkish Basketball League]], [[Tofaş S.K.]], which was among the most successful teams.

==Main sights==

===Ulu Cami (Grand Mosque)===
[[File:Ulucamii2-Turkey-2001.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] (Grand Mosque), showing the fountain (şadırvan) for [[Wudu|ritual ablutions]].]]

[[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] is the largest mosque in Bursa and a landmark of early [[Ottoman architecture]], which incorporated many elements from [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate|Seljuk]] architecture. Ordered by Sultan [[Bayezid I]], the mosque was designed and built by architect Ali Neccar in 1396–1400. It is a large and rectangular building, with a total of twenty domes that are arranged in four rows of five, and are supported by 12 columns. Supposedly the twenty domes were built instead of the twenty separate mosques which Sultan [[Bayezid I]] had promised for winning the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396. The mosque has two [[minaret]]s.

Inside the mosque there are 192 monumental wall inscriptions written by the famous [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphers]] of that period. There is also a fountain ([[şadırvan]]) where worshipers can perform [[Wudu|ritual ablutions]] before prayer; the dome over the şadırvan is capped by a skylight which creates a soft, serene light below; thus playing an important role in the illumination of the large building.

The horizontally spacious and dimly lit interior is designed to feel peaceful and contemplative. The subdivisions of space formed by multiple domes and pillars create a sense of privacy and even intimacy. This atmosphere contrasts with the later Ottoman mosques (see for example the works of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s chief architect [[Mimar Sinan]].) The mosques that were built after the [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and influenced by the design of the 6th century Byzantine basilica of [[Hagia Sophia]], had increasingly elevated and large central domes, which create a vertical emphasis that is intended to be more overwhelming; in order to convey the divine power of Allah, the majesty of the Ottoman Sultan, and the governmental authority of the Ottoman State.
