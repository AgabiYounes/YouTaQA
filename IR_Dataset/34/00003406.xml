'''Branchiopoda''' is a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[crustacean]]s. It comprises [[Anostraca|fairy shrimp]], [[clam shrimp]], [[Cladocera]], [[Notostraca]] and the Devonian ''[[Lepidocaris]]''. They are mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus.

==Description==
Members of the Branchiopoda are unified by the presence of [[gill]]s on many of the animals' [[appendage]]s, including some of the [[arthropod mouthparts|mouthparts]]. This is also responsible for the name of the group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The animal kingdom: arranged after its organization, forming a natural history of animals, and an introduction to comparative anatomy |author=Georges Cuvier |translator=William Benjamin Carpenter |publisher=W.

==Ecology==
Among the branchiopods, only some [[cladocera]]ns are marine; all the other groups are found in continental [[freshwater|fresh water]], including [[vernal pool|temporary pools]] and in salt lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sol Felty Light |title=Intertidal invertebrates of the central California coast |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-520-00750-5 |chapter=Phylum Arthropoda |pages=112–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most branchiopodans eat floating [[detritus]] or [[plankton]], which they take using the [[seta]]e on their appendages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyman&quot;/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
In early taxonomic treatments, the current members of the Branchiopoda were all placed in a single genus, ''Monoculus''. The taxon Branchiopoda was erected by [[Pierre André Latreille]] in 1817, initially at the [[taxonomic rank|rank]] of [[Order (biology)|order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |series=The animal kingdom arranged in conformity with its organization |volume=3 |title=The Crustacea, Arachnides and Insecta |author=Pierre André Latreille |editor=[[Georges Cuvier]] |others=Henry M'Murtrie (trans.) |publisher=G. &amp; C. &amp; H.

===Anostraca===
[[File:Artemia salina 3.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Artemia salina]]'' ([[Anostraca]]: [[Artemiidae]])]]
{{main|Anostraca}}
The fairy shrimp of the order [[Anostraca]] are usually {{convert|6|-|25|mm|abbr=on}} long (exceptionally up to {{convert|170|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Belk&quot;/&gt; Most species have 20 body segments, bearing 11 pairs of leaf-like ''phyllopodia'' (swimming legs), and the body lacks a [[carapace]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khanna&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=D.

===Laevicaudata, Spinicaudata and Cyclestherida (once Conchostraca)===
{{main|Clam shrimp}}
Clam shrimp are bivalved animals which have lived since at least the [[Devonian]]. The three groups are not believed to form a [[clade]]. They have 10–32 trunk segments, decreasing in size from front to back, and each bears a pair of [[arthropod leg|legs]] which also carry [[gill]]s. A strong muscle can close the two halves of the shell together.

==Evolution==
The [[fossil record]] of branchiopods extends back at least into the [[Upper Cambrian]] and possibly further. The group is thought to be [[monophyly|monophyletic]], with the [[Anostraca]] having been the first group to [[cladogenesis|branch off]].&lt;ref name=&quot;M&amp;D&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://atiniui.nhm.org/pdfs/3839/3839.pdf |title=An Updated Classification of the Recent Crustacea |author1=Joel W.
