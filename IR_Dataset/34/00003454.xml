'''Bangladesh''' ({{lang-bn|&lt;!-- The following spelling is correct.

It is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by population|8th-most populous]] country with nearly 163 million people,{{UN_Population|ref}} and is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|92nd-largest country]] in land area, spanning {{convert|147570|km2|sqmi}}, making it one of the most [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|densely-populated]] countries in the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with [[India]] to the west, north, and east, [[Myanmar]] to the southeast, and the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the south. It is narrowly separated from [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] by India's [[Siliguri Corridor]] in the north and from [[China]] by the Indian state of [[Sikkim]] in the northeast. [[Dhaka]], the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political and cultural hub. [[Chittagong]], the [[Port of Chittagong|largest sea port]], is the second largest city. The dominant geographic feature is the [[Ganges delta]], which empties into the Bay of Bengal the combined waters of several [[river system]]s, including the [[Brahmaputra river|Brahmaputra]] and the [[Ganges river|Ganges]], with numerous criss-crossing rivers and inland waterways. [[List of mountains in Bangladesh|Highlands]] with evergreen forests cover the northeastern and southeastern regions. The seacoast features the [[Cox's Bazar|longest natural sea beach]] and most of the world's [[Sundarbans|largest mangrove forest]]. The country's [[biodiversity]] includes a vast array of plants and wildlife, including the endangered [[Bengal tiger]], the national animal.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Names of Bengal}}

The exact origin of the word ''Bangla'' is unknown, though it is believed to come from &quot;Vanga&quot;, an ancient kingdom and geopolitical division on the Ganges delta in the Indian subcontinent. It was located in southern Bengal, with the core region including present-day southern West Bengal (India) and southwestern Bangladesh.

Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies in [[East Pakistan]].

During the 18th century, the [[Nawabs of Bengal]] became the region's ''de facto'' rulers. The title of the ruler is popularly known as the ''Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa'', given that the Bengali Nawab's realm encompassed much of the eastern subcontinent. The Nawabs forged alliances with European colonial companies, which made the region relatively prosperous early in the century. Bengal accounted for 50% of the gross domestic product of the empire. The Bengali economy relied on [[textile manufacturing]], [[shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]], [[saltpetre]] production, craftsmanship and agricultural produce. Bengal was a major hub for international trade - silk and cotton textiles from Bengal were worn in Europe, Japan, Indonesia and Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;John F.

The Mughals had aided France during the [[Seven Years' War]] to avoid losing the [[Bengal]] region to the [[British Empire|British]]. However, in the [[Battle of Plassey]] the British [[East India Company]] registered a decisive victory over the [[Nawab of Bengal]] and his [[French East India Company|French]]{{sfn|Campbell|Watts|1760|loc=[https://www.wdl.org/en/item/2384/]}} allies on 22 June 1757, under the leadership of [[Robert Clive]]. The battle followed the order of [[Siraj ud-Daulah|Siraj-ud-Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, to the English to stop the extension of their fortification. Robert Clive bribed [[Mir Jafar]], the commander-in-chief of the Nawab's army, and also promised him to make him Nawab of Bengal which helped him to defeat Siraj-ud-Daulah and capture [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robins|first1=Nick|title=This Imperious Company&amp;nbsp;— The East India Company and the Modern Multinational&amp;nbsp;— Nick Robins&amp;nbsp;— Gresham College Lectures|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/this-imperious-company-the-east-india-company-and-the-modern-multinational|website=Gresham College Lectures|publisher=Gresham College|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The battle consolidated the Company's presence in [[Bengal]], which later expanded to cover much of [[India]] over the next hundred years.

After the 1757 [[Battle of Plassey]], Bengal was the first region of the Indian subcontinent conquered by the [[British East India Company]].

Supported by the Muslim aristocracy, the British government created the province of [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] in 1905; the new province received increased investment in education, transport and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/e/eastern_bengal_and_assam.html |title=Eastern Bengal and Assam - Encyclopedia |publisher=Theodora.com |accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|first partition of Bengal]] created an uproar in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and the [[Indian National Congress]]. In response to growing Hindu nationalism, the [[All India Muslim League]] was formed in Dhaka during the 1906 All India Muhammadan Educational Conference. The British government reorganised the provinces in 1912, reuniting East and West Bengal and making [[Assam Province|Assam]] a second province.

The Raj was slow to allow self-rule in the colonial subcontinent. It established the [[Bengal Legislative Council]] in 1862, and the council's native Bengali representation increased during the early 20th century. The [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]] was formed in 1913 to advocate [[civil rights]] for Bengali Muslims within a constitutional framework. During the 1920s, the league was divided into factions supporting the [[Khilafat movement]] and favouring co-operation with the British to achieve self-rule. Segments of the Bengali elite supported [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]]'s [[Secularism in Turkey|secularist]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kennedy |first=Bernard |date=December 2005 |title=Ambassador Rezaqul Haider: Mediating for commerce |url=http://www.diplomat.com.tr/sayilar/s14/yazilar/s14-3.htm |magazine=Diplomat |location=Ankara, Turkey |quote=After the First World War when the great leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk started his war of independence, the people of Bengal were very spontaneous in giving all sorts of support.

After the [[Morley-Minto Reforms]] and the [[Government of India Act 1919|diarchy]] era in the [[legislatures of British India]], the British government promised [[Government of India Act 1935|limited provincial autonomy]] in 1935. The [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]], British India's largest legislature, was established in 1937.

Although it won a majority of seats in 1937, the Bengal Congress boycotted the legislature. [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] of the [[Krishak Sramik Party|Krishak Praja Party]] was elected as the first [[Prime Minister of Bengal]]. In 1940 Huq supported the [[Lahore Resolution]], which envisaged independent states in the northwestern and eastern Muslim-majority regions of the subcontinent. The first Huq ministry, a coalition with the Bengal Provincial Muslim League, lasted until 1941; it was followed by a Huq coalition with the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] which lasted until 1943. Huq was succeeded by [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], who grappled with the effects of the [[Burma Campaign]], the [[Bengal famine of 1943]], which killed up to 3 million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Churchill's policies contributed to 1943 Bengal famine – study |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/29/winston-churchill-policies-contributed-to-1943-bengal-famine-study |work=The Guardian |date=29 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Quit India]] movement. In 1946, the Bengal Provincial Muslim League won the provincial election, taking 113 of the 250-seat assembly (the largest Muslim League mandate in British India). [[H. S.

Pakistan adopted its first constitution in 1956. Three Bengalis were its Prime Minister until 1957: Nazimuddin, [[Mohammad Ali of Bogra]] and Suhrawardy. None of the three completed their terms, and resigned from office. The [[Pakistan Army]] imposed [[1958 Pakistani coup d'état|military rule in 1958]], and [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] was the country's strongman for 11 years. Political repression increased after the coup. Khan introduced a new constitution in 1962, replacing Pakistan's parliamentary system with a presidential and gubernatorial system (based on [[electoral college]] selection) known as Basic Democracy. In 1962 Dhaka became the seat of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]], a move seen as appeasing increased Bengali nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vale |first=Lawrence |title=Architecture, Power and National Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qWx9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA291 |publisher=Routledge |page=291 |isbn=978-1-134-72921-0 |date=2014 |access-date=14 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106091442/https://books.google.com/books?id=qWx9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA291 |archive-date=6 January 2017 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani government built the controversial [[Kaptai Dam]], displacing the [[Chakma people]] from their indigenous homeland in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Terminski |first=Bogumil |year=2014 |title=Development-Induced Displacement and Resettlement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WW8xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |publisher=Columbia University Press |page=28 |isbn=978-3-8382-6723-4 |access-date=20 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214215710/https://books.google.com/books?id=WW8xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 |archive-date=14 February 2017 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1965 Pakistani presidential election|1965 presidential election]], [[Fatima Jinnah]] lost to Ayub Khan despite support from the Combined Opposition alliance (which included the Awami League).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed2004p157&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Salahuddin Ahmed|title=Bangladesh: Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Szfqq7ruqWgC&amp;pg=PA157|year=2004|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-469-5|page=157|access-date=29 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504084534/https://books.google.com/books?id=Szfqq7ruqWgC&amp;pg=PA157|archive-date=4 May 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] blocked cross-border transport links with neighbouring India in what is described as a second partition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Zafar Sobhan |date=17 August 2007 |title=Tragedy of errors |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-318 |work=The Daily Star |type=Editorial |access-date=19 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829180610/http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-318 |archive-date=29 August 2017 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Awami League leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] announced a [[six point movement]] for a federal parliamentary democracy.

During the Bangladesh Liberation War, Bengali nationalists declared independence and formed the [[Mukti Bahini]] (the Bangladeshi National Liberation Army). The [[Provisional Government of Bangladesh]] was established on 17 April 1971, converting the 469 elected members of the Pakistani national assembly and East Pakistani provincial assembly into the [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]]. The provisional government issued a [[Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence|proclamation]] that became the country's interim constitution and declared &quot;equality, human dignity and social justice&quot; as its fundamental principles. Due to Mujib's detention, [[Syed Nazrul Islam]] took over the role of Acting President, while [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] was named Bangladesh's first Prime Minister. The Mukti Bahini and other Bengali guerrilla forces formed the [[Bangladesh Forces]] which became the military wing of the provisional government. Led by General [[M. A. G. Osmani]] and eleven [[List of sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|sector commanders]], the forces held the countryside during the war and conducted wide-ranging guerrilla operations against Pakistani forces. As a result, almost the entire country except the capital Dacca was liberated by [[Bangladesh Forces]] by late November.[[File:Joy of Independence.jpg|thumb|[[National Martyrs’ Memorial]] set up in the memory of those who died in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971]]This led the Pakistan Army to attack neighbouring India's western front on 2 December. India retaliated in both the western and eastern fronts. With a joint ground advance by Bangladeshi and Indian forces, coupled with air strikes by both India and the small Bengali air contingent, the capital Dacca was liberated from Pakistani occupation in mid-December. During the last phase of the war, the Soviet Union and the United States dispatched naval forces to the Bay of Bengal in a Cold War standoff.

[[File:Mujib and Ford.jpg|thumb|alt=A seated Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Gerald Ford, smiling and talking|Prime Minister [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] and U.S. president [[Gerald Ford]] in 1974]]
The constituent assembly adopted the constitution of Bangladesh on 4 November 1972, establishing a secular, multiparty parliamentary democracy. The new constitution included references to [[socialism]], and Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman [[nationalised]] major industries in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Umar |first=Badruddin |author-link=Badruddin Umar |year=1972 |title=Bangladesh nationalisation: What does it all mean? |journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=328–30 |doi=10.1080/00472337285390641}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major reconstruction and rehabilitation program was launched. The Awami League won the country's first general election in 1973, securing a large majority in the &quot;[[Jatiyo Sangshad]]&quot;, the national parliament. Bangladesh joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the UN, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and Rahman strengthened ties with India. Amid growing agitation by the opposition [[National Awami Party]] and [[Jashod|National Socialist Party]], he became increasingly authoritarian. Rahman amended the constitution, giving himself more emergency powers (including the suspension of fundamental rights). The [[Bangladesh famine of 1974]] also worsened the political situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David Lewis|title=Bangladesh: Politics, Economy and Civil Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lH40gT7xvYC|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50257-3|access-date=11 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106064248/https://books.google.com/books?id=5lH40gT7xvYC|archive-date=6 January 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman introduced [[One-party state|one-party socialist rule]] under [[Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League|BAKSAL]]. Rahman banned all newspapers except four state-owned publications, and amended the constitution to increase his power. He was [[Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman|assassinated]] during a coup on 15 August 1975. [[Martial law]] was declared, and the presidency passed to the [[usurper]] [[Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad]] for four months.

Chief Justice [[Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem]] was installed as president by the military on 6 November 1975. Bangladesh was governed by a [[military junta]] led by the [[Chief Martial Law Administrator]] for three years. In 1977, the army chief [[Ziaur Rahman]] became president. Rahman reinstated [[multiparty]] politics, [[privatised]] industries and newspapers, established [[Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority|BEPZA]] and held the country's second general election in 1979. A [[semi-presidential]] system evolved, with the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) governing until 1982. Rahman was assassinated in 1981, and was succeeded by [[Vice President of Bangladesh|Vice-President]] [[Abdus Sattar (president)|Abdus Sattar]]. Sattar received 65.5 percent of the vote in the [[1981 Bangladeshi presidential election|1981 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Khasru&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=B.Z.

After a year in office, Sattar was overthrown in the [[1982 Bangladesh coup d'état]]. Chief Justice [[A. F. M. Ahsanuddin Chowdhury]] was installed as president, but army chief [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] became the country's ''de facto'' leader and assumed the presidency in 1983. Ershad lifted martial law in 1986. He governed with four successive prime ministers ([[Ataur Rahman Khan]], [[Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury]], [[Moudud Ahmed]] and [[Kazi Zafar Ahmed]]) and a parliament dominated by his [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiyo Party]]. General elections were held in 1986 and 1988, although the latter was boycotted by the opposition BNP and Awami League. Ershad pursued administrative decentralisation, dividing the country into 64 districts, and pushed Parliament to make Islam the state religion in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12651483|title=Bangladesh profile|date=13 August 2017|accessdate=19 September 2017|work=BBC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180711040420/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12651483|archive-date=11 July 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[1990 Mass Uprising in Bangladesh|1990 mass uprising]] forced him to resign, and Chief Justice [[Shahabuddin Ahmed]] led the country's first caretaker government as part of the transition to parliamentary rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Khasru&quot;/&gt;

After the 1991 general election, the twelfth amendment to the constitution restored the parliamentary republic and [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] became Bangladesh's first female prime minister. Zia, a former first lady, led a BNP government from 1990 to 1996. In 1991 her finance minister, [[Saifur Rahman (Bangladeshi politician)|Saifur Rahman]], began a major program to liberalise the Bangladeshi economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis2011&quot;/&gt;

In February 1996, [[February 1996 Bangladeshi general election|a general election]] was held which was boycotted by all opposition parties giving a 300 (of 300) seat victory for BNP. This election was deemed illegitimate, so a system of a [[caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]] was introduced to oversee the transfer of power and a new election was held in June 1996, overseen by Justice [[Muhammad Habibur Rahman]], the first [[Chief Adviser of Bangladesh]]. The [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] won the [[June 1996 Bangladeshi general election|seventh general election]], marking its leader [[Sheikh Hasina|Sheikh Hasina's]] first term as Prime Minister. Hasina's first term was highlighted by the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] and a [[Ganges]] water-sharing treaty with India. The second caretaker government, led by Chief Adviser Justice [[Latifur Rahman]], oversaw the [[2001 Bangladeshi general election]] which returned Begum Zia and the BNP to power.

The second Zia administration saw improved economic growth, but political turmoil gripped the country between 2004 and 2006. A radical Islamist militant group, the [[Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh|JMB]], carried out a series of terror attacks. The evidence of staging these attacks by these extremist groups have been found in the investigation, and hundreds of suspected members were detained in numerous security operations in 2006, including the two chiefs of the JMB, [[Shaykh Abdur Rahman]] and [[Bangla Bhai]], who were executed with other top leaders in March 2007, bringing the militant group to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/03/31/d7033101011.htm | title=The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 1007 | access-date=10 November 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180915190630/http://archive.thedailystar.net/2007/03/31/d7033101011.htm | archive-date=15 September 2018 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, at the end of the term of the BNP administration, there was widespread political unrest related to the handover of power to a caretaker government.  As such, the Bangladeshi military urged President [[Iajuddin Ahmed]] to impose a [[state of emergency]] and a caretaker government, led by technocrat [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]], was installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis2011&quot;/&gt; Emergency rule lasted for two years, during which time investigations into members of both Awami League and BNP were conducted, including their leaders [[Sheikh Hasina]] and [[Khaleda Zia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/former-bangladeshi-pm-arrested-reports/2503992|title=Former Bangladeshi PM arrested: reports|date=16 July 2007|work=ABC News|access-date=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922235154/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-07-16/former-bangladeshi-pm-arrested-reports/2503992|archive-date=22 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/02/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Ex-Prime-Minister.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212031648/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/02/asia/AS-GEN-Bangladesh-Ex-Prime-Minister.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 February 2009|title=Ex-PM sued on corruption charges in Bangladesh |work= International Herald Tribune|date=12 February 2009|access-date=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the [[2008 Bangladeshi general election|ninth general election]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; saw a return to power for [[Sheikh Hasina]] and the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] led [[Grand Alliance (Bangladesh)|Grand Alliance]] in a landslide victory. In 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]] ruled martial law illegal and affirmed [[Secularism|secular]] principles in the constitution. The following year, the Awami League abolished the caretaker-government system.

Citing the lack of caretaker government the [[2014 Bangladeshi general election|2014 general election]] was boycotted by the BNP and other opposition parties, giving the Awami League a decisive victory. The election was controversial with reports of violence and an alleged crackdown on the opposition in the run-up to the election and 153 seats (of 300) went uncontested in the election. Despite the controversy Hasina went on to form a government which saw her return for a third term as Prime Minister. Due to strong domestic demand, Bangladesh emerged as one of the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing economies in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/02/economic-reforms-can-make-bangladesh-grow-faster |title=Economic Reforms Can Make Bangladesh Grow Faster |access-date=9 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411084103/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/10/02/economic-reforms-can-make-bangladesh-grow-faster |archive-date=11 April 2019 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[human rights abuses]] increased under the Hasina administration, particularly [[Forced disappearance in Bangladesh|enforced disappearances]].

In 2018, the country saw major movements for [[2018 Bangladesh quota reform movement|government quota reforms]] and [[2018 Bangladesh road-safety protests|road-safety]].

The geography of Bangladesh is divided between three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile [[Ganges-Brahmaputra delta]], the largest delta in the world,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Misachi|first=John|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/which-is-the-largest-delta-in-the-world.html|title=Where Is The Largest Delta in the World?|publisher=WorldAtlas, worldatlus.com|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2020}} The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the [[Madhupur tract|Madhupur]] and the [[Barind Tract|Barind]] plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to [[evergreen]] hill ranges.

The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Bangladesh has 57 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making the resolution of water issues politically complicated, in most cases, as the country is a lower [[riparian zone|riparian]] state to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Suvedī | first = Sūryaprasāda | title = International watercourses law for the 21st century | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = 154–66 | isbn = 978-0-7546-4527-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ali&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=A. |year=1996 |title=Vulnerability of Bangladesh to climate change and sea level rise through tropical cyclones and storm surges |doi = 10.1007/BF00175563|journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |volume=92 |issue=1–2 |pages=171–79|doi-broken-date=2019-12-01|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00175563}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country's [[haor]] wetlands are of significance to global environmental science.

In southeastern Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. Construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt, creating new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has become a multi-agency endeavour, building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change|title=&quot;Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change&quot;, by William Wheeler and Anna-Katarina Gravgaard, The Washington Times|publisher=Pulitzercenter.org|accessdate=3 July 2010|date=18 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724121204/http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change|archive-date=24 July 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years of collaboration with donors and global experts in water resources management has enabled Bangladesh to formulate strategies to combat the impacts of climate change. In Sep 2018, Bangladesh Government approved ''Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100'', a combination of long-term strategies and subsequent interventions for ensuring long term water and food security, economic growth and environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/bangladesh-delta-plan-2100-implementation-challenges-and-way-forward-1553354695|title=Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100: Implementation challenges and way forward|publisher=The Financial Express|accessdate=24 September 2019|date=23 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formulation of the plan was led by the General Economics Division of the Ministry of Planning, and supported by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, bringing together cross-sectoral expertise from the Netherlands and Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dutchwatersector.com/news/bangladesh-delta-plan-2100|title=Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100|publisher=The Dutch water sector|accessdate=24 September 2019|date=20 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''[[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]]'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''.

There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Bangladesh's climate is tropical with a mild winter from October to March, and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature below {{convert|0|°C}}, with a record low of {{convert|1.1|°C}} in the north west city of [[Dinajpur]] on 3 February 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kantaji.com/dinajpurmap.html |title=Map of Dinajpur |website=kantaji.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713134542/http://kantaji.com/dinajpurmap.html |archive-date=13 July 2011 |access-date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the country's rainfall.

Natural calamities, such as [[Floods in Bangladesh|floods]], [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[tidal bore]]s occur almost every year,&lt;ref name=&quot;NatDis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Alexander |first=David E. |title= Natural Disasters |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/?id=gWHsuGTcF34C&amp;pg=PA532|year= 1999|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location= Dordrecht |isbn=978-0-412-04751-0 |page=532 |chapter=The Third World |origyear= 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; combined with the effects of [[deforestation]], [[Soils retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] and [[erosion]].

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw [[1998 Bangladesh floods|the most severe flooding]] in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and [[Meghna]] spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, {{convert|9700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of road and {{convert|2700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of embankment, 1,000&amp;nbsp;people were killed and 30&amp;nbsp;million more were made homeless; 135,000 cattle were killed; {{convert|50|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of land were destroyed; and {{convert|11000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads were damaged or destroyed. Effectively, two-thirds of the country was underwater.
The severity of the flooding was attributed to unusually high [[monsoon]] rains, the shedding of equally unusually large amounts of melt water from the [[Himalayas]], and the widespread cutting down of trees (that would have intercepted rain water) for firewood or animal husbandry.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWG&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Haggett|first=Peter |title= Encyclopedia of World Geography |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/?id=IROIY4ONOSEC&amp;pg=PA2634|publisher=Marshall Cavendish |year= 2002|location= New York |isbn=978-0-7614-7308-4 |oclc= 46578454|pages=2, 634 |chapter=The Indian Subcontinent |origyear=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of various international and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, human toll and economic damage from floods and cyclones have come down over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raju |first= M.

There is evidence that [[earthquake]]s pose a threat to the country and that [[plate tectonics]] have caused rivers to shift course suddenly and dramatically. It has been shown that rainy-season flooding in Bangladesh, on the world's largest river delta, can push the underlying crust down by as much as 6&amp;nbsp;centimetres, and possibly perturb faults.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earth.columbia.edu/videos/watch/337 Beneath Bangladesh: The Next Great Earthquake?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811070413/http://www.earth.columbia.edu/videos/watch/337 |date=11 August 2011 }}. earth.columbia.edu (12 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nymphaeaceae|Water lilies]] and [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotuses]] grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has [[List of protected areas of Bangladesh|50 wildlife sanctuaries]].

Bangladesh is home to much of the [[Sundarbans]], the world's largest [[mangrove forest]], covering an area of 6,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three protected sanctuaries–the [[Sundarbans South Wildlife Sanctuary|South]], [[Sundarbans East Wildlife Sanctuary|East]] and [[Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary|West]] zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, which is a unique ecosystem. It also includes [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]], a [[freshwater swamp forest]] and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong region]] covers evergreen and semi evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the plainland Sal forest running along the districts of Gazipur, [[Tangail]] and [[Mymensingh]]. [[St. Martin's Island]] is the only [[coral reef]] in the country.

Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one horned and two horned [[rhinoceros]] and common [[peafowl]]. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, hence limiting deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. Although many areas are protected under law, a large portion of Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. Furthermore, access to [[biocapacity]] in Bangladesh is low. In 2016, Bangladesh had 0.4 global hectares&lt;ref name=GFN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/countryTrends?cn=16&amp;type=BCpc,EFCpc|title=Country Trends|publisher=Global Footprint Network|access-date= 9 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; of biocapacity per person within its territory, or about one fourth of the world average. In contrast, in 2016, they used 0.84 global hectares of biocapacity - their [[ecological footprint]] of consumption. As a result, Bangladesh is running a biocapacity deficit.&lt;ref name=GFN/&gt;

The [[Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act]] was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several regions as [[Ecologically Critical Area]]s, including wetlands, forests and rivers. The [[Sundarbans tiger project]] and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bearprojectbd.weebly.com&quot;/&gt;

During this period, elections were managed by a neutral [[Caretaker government of Bangladesh|caretaker government]]. But the caretaker government was abolished by the Awami League government in 2011. The BNP boycotted the next election in 2014, arguing that it would not be fair without a caretaker government. The BNP-led [[Jatiya Oikya Front]] participated in the 2018 election and lost. The election saw many allegations of irregularities. Bangladesh has a prominent [[civil society]] since the colonial period. There are various special interest groups, including [[non-governmental organisations]], human rights organisations, professional associations, [[chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]], employers' associations and [[trade unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bti-project.org/en/reports/country-reports/detail/itc/BGD/|title=Detail|website=www.bti-project.org|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key aspects of Bangladeshi politics is the &quot;spirit of the liberation war&quot; which refers to the ideals of the liberation movement during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/spirit-of-liberation-war-17307|title=Spirit of Liberation War|date=26 March 2014|website=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Proclamation of Independence enunciated the values of &quot;equality, human dignity and social justice&quot;. In 1972, the constitution included a [[bill of rights]] and declared &quot;nationalism, socialism, democracy and [[secularity]]&quot; as the principles of government policy. Socialism was later de-emphasised and neglected by successive governments. Bangladesh has a market-based economy. To many Bangladeshis, especially in the younger generation, the spirit of the liberation war is a vision for a society based on civil liberties, human rights, the rule of law and good governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sobhan|first=Rehman|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-216327|title=The Spirit of the Liberation War|date=31 December 2011|website=The Daily Star|language=en|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive branch===
The [[Government of Bangladesh]] is overseen by a [[Cabinet of Bangladesh|cabinet]] headed by the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]]. The tenure of a parliamentary government is five years. The [[Bangladesh Civil Service]] assists the cabinet in running the government. Recruitment for the civil service is based on a public examination. In theory, the civil service should be a meritocracy. But a disputed quota system coupled with politicisation and preference for seniority have allegedly affected the civil service's meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://thediplomat.com/2013/08/no-meritocracy-bangladeshs-civil-service/|last=Kabir|first=A.|title=No Meritocracy: Bangladesh's Civil Service|publisher=The Diplomat|date=12 August 2013|access-date=9 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[President of Bangladesh]] is the ceremonial head of state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/sectors-bangladesh/government/president/|title=President|publisher=The Nexus Commonwealth Network|access-date=10 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose powers include signing bills passed by parliament into law. The President is elected by the parliament and has a five-year term. Under the constitution, the president acts on the advice of the prime minister. The President is the Supreme Commander of the Bangladesh Armed Forces and the chancellor of all universities.

===Legislative branch===
[[File:National Assembly of Bangladesh (06).jpg|thumb|[[Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban|The National Assembly of Bangladesh]]]]
The [[Jatiya Sangshad]] (National Assembly) is the [[unicameral]] parliament. It has 350 [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), including 300 MPs elected on the [[first past the post]] system and 50 MPs appointed to reserved seats for [[women's empowerment]]. [[Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh]] forbids MPs from voting against their party. However, several laws proposed independently by MPs have been transformed into legislation, including the anti-torture law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newagebd.net/article/32228/amendment-to-anti-torture-law-to-hinder-hr-protection-says-ask|title=Amendment to anti-torture law to hinder HR protection, says ASK|website=New Age {{!}} The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily in Bangladesh|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament is presided over by the [[Speaker of the Jatiya Sangsad]], who is second in line to the president as per the constitution. There is also a Deputy Speaker. When a president is incapable of performing duties (i.e. due to illness), the Speaker steps in as [[Acting President]] and the Deputy Speaker becomes Acting Speaker. A recurring proposal suggests that the Deputy Speaker should be a member of the opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shahid|first=S.

===Legal system===
{{Main|Laws in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Supreme Court of Bangladesh 12.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Long, white, domed building|[[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]]]]
The [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh]] is the highest court of the land followed by the [[High Court Division|High Court]] and Appellate Divisions. The head of the judiciary is the [[Chief Justice of Bangladesh]], who sits on the Supreme Court. The courts have wide latitude in [[judicial review in Bangladesh|judicial review]] and judicial [[precedent]] is supported by the Article 111 of the constitution. The [[Judiciary of Bangladesh|judiciary]] includes district and metropolitan courts, which are divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog. The [[Bangladesh Judicial Service Commission]] is an independent body responsible for judicial appointments, salaries and discipline.

Bangladesh's legal system is based on [[common law]] and its principal source of laws are [[acts of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Bangladesh.html|first=Omar|last=Sial|title=A Research Guide to the Legal System of the Peoples' Republic of Bangladesh|website=[[GlobaLex]]|date=October 2008|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bangladesh Code]] includes a list of all laws in force in the country. The code begins in 1836 and most of its listed laws were crafted under the [[British Raj]] by the [[Bengal Legislative Council]], the [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]], the [[Eastern Bengal and Assam Legislative Council]], the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] and the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. One example is the [[The Penal Code, 1860 (Bangladesh)|1860 Penal Code]]. From 1947 to 1971, laws were enacted by Pakistan's [[National Assembly of Pakistan|national assembly]] and the [[East Pakistan Provincial Assembly|East Pakistani legislature]]. The [[Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh]] was the country's provisional parliament until 1973, when the first elected Jatiyo Sangshad (National Parliament) was sworn in. Although most of Bangladesh's laws were compiled in [[English language|English]], after a 1987 government directive laws are now primarily written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. While most of Bangladeshi law is [[secular]]; marriage, divorce and inheritance are governed by [[Sharia|Islamic]], [[Hindu law|Hindu]] and Christian [[family law]]. The judiciary is often influenced by legal developments in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], such as the [[Legitimate expectation|doctrine of legitimate expectation]].

===Military===

Retrieved 17 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional defence roles, the military has supported civil authorities in disaster relief and provided internal security during periods of political unrest. For many years, Bangladesh has been the world's largest contributor to [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping forces]]. In February 2015, the country made major deployments to [[Cote d'Ivoire|Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Cyprus]], [[Darfur]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the [[Golan Heights]], [[Haiti]], [[Lebanon]], [[Liberia]] and [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afd.gov.bd/index.php/un-peacekeeping/ongoing-operations|title=Ongoing Operations|author=Armed Forces Division|website=afd.gov.bd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bangladesh Navy]] has the third-largest fleet of [[countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal]], including [[guided-missile frigate]]s, [[submarine]]s, [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]] and aircraft. The [[Bangladesh Air Force]] is equipped with several Russian multi-role fighter jets. Bangladesh cooperates defensively with the [[United States Armed Forces]], participating in the [[Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training]] (CARAT) exercises.

The first major intergovernmental organisation joined by Bangladesh was the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1972. The country joined the [[United Nations]] in 1974, and has been elected twice to the [[UN Security Council]]. Ambassador [[Humayun Rashid Choudhury]] was elected president of the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1986. Bangladesh relies on [[multilateralism|multilateral]] diplomacy in the [[World Trade Organization]]. It is a major contributor to [[UN peacekeeping]], providing 113,000 personnel to 54 UN missions in the Middle East, the Balkans, Africa and the Caribbean in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afd.gov.bd/index.php/un-peacekeeping/bangladesh-in-un-mission|title=Bangladesh in UN Mission|author=Armed Forces Division|publisher=afd.gov.bd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations, Bangladesh pioneered regional co-operation in [[South Asia]]. Bangladesh is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), an organisation designed to strengthen relations and promote economic and cultural growth among its members. It has hosted several summits and two Bangladeshi diplomats were the organisation's secretary-general.

Bangladesh joined the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) in 1973. It has hosted the summit of OIC foreign ministers, which addresses issues, conflicts and disputes affecting [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority countries]]. Bangladesh is a founding member of the [[Developing 8 Countries]], which is a bloc of eight Muslim-majority republics.

The neighbouring country of [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was one of first countries to recognise Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Foreign_Policy|title=Foreign Policy – Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite common regional interests, Bangladesh-Myanmar relations have been strained by the [[Rohingya genocide|Rohingya refugee crisis]] and the isolationist policies of the Myanmar military. In 2012, both countries came to terms at the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] over maritime boundaries in the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationallawobserver.eu/2012/03/15/judgment-in-bangladesh-myanmar-maritime-boundary-dispute/|title=Judgment in Bangladesh-Myanmar Maritime Boundary Dispute – International Law Observer – A blog dedicated to reports, commentary and the discussion of topical issues of international law|website=internationallawobserver.eu|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 and 2017, relations with Myanmar were strained once again as over 700,000 [[Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh|Rohingya refugees]] illegally entered Bangladesh fleeing persecution, ethnic cleansing, genocide and other atrocities in Myanmar. The parliament, government and civil society of Bangladesh have been at the forefront of [[International reaction to the 2016–17 Rohingya exodus|international criticism]] against Myanmar for military operations against the Rohingya, which the [[United Nations]] has described as [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Alam |first=Julhas |date=16 September 2017 |title=Bangladesh accuses Myanmar of violating its airspace |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/nationworld/sns-bc-as--myanmar-attacks-20170916-story.html |work=[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]] |agency=Associated Press |access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/un-myanmars-treatment-of-rohingya-textbook-example-of-ethnic-cleansing|title=Myanmar treatment of Rohingya looks like 'textbook ethnic cleansing', says UN|first=Michael|last=Safi|date=11 September 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh's most politically-important bilateral relationship is with neighbouring [[India]]. In 2015, major Indian newspapers called Bangladesh a &quot;trusted friend&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 June 2015 |title=Indian papers back strong ties with 'trusted friend' Bangladesh |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-33044181 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh and India are South Asia's largest trading partners. The countries are collaborating in regional economic and infrastructure projects, such as a regional motor-vehicle agreement in [[eastern South Asia]] and a coastal shipping agreement in the [[Bay of Bengal]]. [[Bangladesh-India relations|Indo-Bangladesh relations]] often emphasise a shared cultural heritage, democratic values and a history of support for [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladeshi independence]]. Despite political goodwill, [[Deaths along the Bangladesh–India border|border killings of Bangladeshi civilians]] and the lack of a comprehensive water-sharing agreement for 54 trans-boundary rivers are major issues. In 2017, India joined Russia and China in refusing to condemn Myanmar's atrocities against the [[Rohingya]], which contradicted with Bangladesh's demand for recognising Rohingya human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mahfuz Anam |date=9 September 2017 |title=Rohingya crisis: A concern for the region |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/asian-editors-circle/rohingya-crisis-concern-the-region-1459393 |work=The Daily Star |type=Opinion |access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Indian air force delivered aid shipments for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rohingya aid from India, Morocco, Indonesia arrives |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/morocco-sends-rohingya-aid-indian-relief-arrive-bangladesh-myanmar-1462063 |work=The Daily Star |date=14 September 2017 |access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crackdown against cattle smuggling in India has also affected Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi [[beef]] and [[leather]] industries have seen increased prices due to the Indian [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] government's Hindu nationalist campaign against the export of beef and cattle skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-cattle-bangladesh-feature/indias-push-to-save-its-cows-starves-bangladesh-of-beef-idUSKCN0PC2OW20150702|title=India's push to save its cows starves Bangladesh of beef|date=2 July 2015|work=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan and Bangladesh have a US$550 million trade relationship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dhakachamber.com/Bilateral/Pakistan-Bangladesh%20Bilateral%20Trade%20Statistics.pdf|title=Bangladesh-Pakistan Bilateral Trade Statistics|website=Dhaka Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in Pakistani [[cotton]] imports for the Bangladeshi textile industry. Although Bangladeshi and Pakistani businesses have invested in each other, diplomatic relations are strained because of Pakistani denial of the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. The execution of a [[Jamaat-e-Islami]] leader in 2013 on committing of [[1971 Bangladesh genocide|war crimes]] during the liberation war was opposed in Pakistan and led to further strained ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chowdhury |first=Syed Tashfin |date=22 December 2013 |title=Pakistan-Bangladesh relationship strained |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/pakistan-bangladesh-relationship-strained-2013122210285955448.html |work=Al Jazeera |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bangladesh-China relations|Sino-Bangladesh relations]] date to the 1950s and are relatively warm, despite the Chinese leadership siding with Pakistan during Bangladesh's war of independence. China and Bangladesh established bilateral relations in 1976 which have significantly strengthened and the country is considered a cost-effective source of arms for the Bangladeshi military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sheikh Shahariar Zaman |date=18 March 2014 |title=China biggest arms supplier to Bangladesh |url=http://archive.dhakatribune.com/foreign-affairs/2014/mar/18/china-biggest-arms-supplier-bangladesh |work=Dhaka Tribune |access-date=19 September 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919045546/http://archive.dhakatribune.com/foreign-affairs/2014/mar/18/china-biggest-arms-supplier-bangladesh |archivedate=19 September 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s 80 percent of Bangladesh's military equipment has been supplied by China (often with generous credit terms), and China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner.

Relations with other countries are generally positive. Shared democratic values ease relations with Western countries and similar economic concerns forge ties to other [[developing countries]].

Secularism is protected by the constitution of Bangladesh and religious parties are barred from contesting elections; however, the government is accused of courting religious extremist groups.

During its first five years of independence Bangladesh adopted socialist policies.

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Bangladesh}}
[[File:Rajshahi College Library Inside 02.JPG|thumb|right|The ''[[Charyapada]]'' scrolls are the oldest surviving text of the Bengali language. The photograph was taken at the [[Rajshahi College]] Library]]
The predominant language of Bangladesh is [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (also known as Bangla). Bengali is the one of the easternmost branches of the [[Indo-European language]] family. It is a part of the [[Eastern Indo-Aryan languages]] in South Asia, which developed between the 10th and 13th centuries. Bengali is written using the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. In ancient Bengal, [[Sanskrit]] was the language of written communication, especially by priests. During the Islamic period, Sanskrit was replaced by Bengali as the [[vernacular language]]. The Sultans of Bengal promoted the production of Bengali literature instead of Sanskrit. Bengali also received [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic]] loanwords during the [[Sultanate of Bengal]]. Under [[Bengal Presidency|British rule]], Bengali was significantly modernised by Europeans. Modern Standard Bengali emerged as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the region. A heavily Sanskritized version of Bengali was employed by Hindu scholars during the [[Bengali Renaissance]]. Muslim writers such as [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] gave attention to the Persian and Arabic vocabulary of the language. Today, the Bengali language standard is prescribed by the [[Bangla Academy]] in Bangladesh. Bengali is a symbol of secular Bangladeshi identity. More than 98 percent of people in Bangladesh speak Bengali as their native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condition of English in Bangladesh|url=http://www.eslteachersboard.com/cgi-bin/asia/index.pl?noframes;read=158|publisher=ESL Teachers Board|accessdate=21 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115144121/http://www.eslteachersboard.com/cgi-bin/asia/index.pl?noframes;read=158|archive-date=15 January 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;constitution-I-5&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130115144123/http://www.parliament.gov.bd/Constitution_English/index.htm Constitution of Bangladesh] (As modified up to 17 May 2004), Part I, Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bengali dialects|Dialects of Bengali]] are spoken in some parts of the country, which include non-standard dialects (sometimes viewed as separate languages) such as [[Chittagonian language|Chatgaiya]], [[Sylheti]] and [[Rangpuri language|Rangpuri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;3.

The [[Chakma language]] is another native Eastern Indo-Aryan language of Bangladesh. It is written using the [[Chakma script]]. The unique aspect of the language is that it is used by the Chakma people, who are a population with similarities to the people of East Asia, rather than the Indian subcontinent. The Chakma language is endangered due to its decreasing use in schools and institutions.

Other tribal languages include [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Manipuri language|Manipuri]], [[Kokborok]] and [[Rakhine language|Rakhine]]. Among the [[Austroasiatic languages]], the [[Santali language]] is spoken by the Santali tribe. Many of these languages are written in the Bengali script; while there is also some usage of the Latin script.

[[Urdu]] has a significant heritage in Bangladesh. The language was introduced to Bengal in the 17th-century. Traders from North India often spoke the language in Bengal, as did sections of the Bengali upper class. Urdu poets lived in many parts of Bangladesh. The use of Urdu became controversial during the [[Bengali Language Movement]], when the people of East Bengal resisted attempts to impose Urdu as the main official language. In modern Bangladesh, the Urdu-speaking community is restricted to the country's [[Biharis in Bangladesh|Bihari]] community (formerly Stranded Pakistanis); and some sections of the non-Bengali upper class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Urdu |title = Urdu - Banglapedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Education in Bangladesh}}
Bangladesh has a [[literacy rate]] of 72.9 percent as of 2018: 75.7% for males and 70.09% for females.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; The country's educational system is three-tiered and heavily subsidised, with the government operating many schools at the primary, secondary and higher-secondary levels and subsidising many private schools. In the tertiary-education sector, the Bangladeshi government funds over 15 state universities through the [[University Grants Commission of Bangladesh|University Grants Commission]].

The recorded history of art in Bangladesh can be traced to the 3rd century BCE, when [[terracotta]] sculptures were made in the region. In classical antiquity, a notable school of sculptural Hindu, Jain and Buddhist art developed in the Pala Empire and the Sena dynasty. Islamic art evolved since the 14th century. The architecture of the Bengal Sultanate saw a distinct style of domed mosques with complex niche pillars that had no minarets. [[Mughal Bengal]]'s most celebrated artistic tradition was the weaving of [[Jamdani]] [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] on fine muslin, which is now classified by UNESCO as an [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Jamdani motifs were similar to Iranian textile art (buta motifs) and Western textile art ([[Paisley (design)|paisley]]). The Jamdani weavers in Dhaka received imperial patronage.&lt;ref name=&quot;star&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/ruminations/2015/bangladeshi-islamic-art|title=In Search of Bangladeshi Islamic Art|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|accessdate=19 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812083629/http://www.metmuseum.org/blogs/ruminations/2015/bangladeshi-islamic-art|archive-date=12 August 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivory]] and [[brass]] were also widely used in Mughal art. [[Pottery]] is widely used in Bengali culture.

The [[modern art]] movement in Bangladesh took shape during the 1950s, particularly with the pioneering works of [[Zainul Abedin]]. East Bengal developed its own modernist painting and sculpture traditions, which were distinct from the art movements in West Bengal. The [[Art Institute Dhaka]] has been an important center for visual art in the region. Its annual [[Mangal Shobhajatra|Bengali New Year parade]] was enlisted as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO in 2016.

Modern Bangladesh has produced many of South Asia's leading painters, including [[SM Sultan]], [[Mohammad Kibria]], [[Shahabuddin Ahmed (artist)|Shahabuddin Ahmed]], [[Kanak Chanpa Chakma]], [[Kafil Ahmed]], [[Saifuddin Ahmed]], [[Qayyum Chowdhury]], [[Rashid Choudhury]], [[Quamrul Hassan]], [[Rafiqun Nabi]] and [[Syed Jahangir]], among others. [[Novera Ahmed]] and [[Nitun Kundu]] were the country's pioneers of modernist sculpture.

In recent times, photography as a medium of art has become popular. Biennial [[Chobi Mela]] is considered the largest photography festival in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 December 2014 |title=Chobi Mela kicks off next month |url=http://www.observerbd.com/2014/12/19/61610.php |location=Dhaka |newspaper=The Daily Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ahsan Manzil-Front View.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ahsan Manzil]] is one of the largest residences in [[Old Dhaka]], where there are many [[Indo-Saracenic]] buildings]]
The architectural traditions of Bangladesh have a 2,500-year-old heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahman |first=Mahbubur |year=2012 |chapter=Architecture |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terracotta architecture is a distinct feature of Bengal. Pre-Islamic Bengali architecture reached its pinnacle in the Pala Empire, when the Pala School of Sculptural Art established grand structures such as the Somapura Mahavihara. [[Islamic architecture]] began developing under the Bengal Sultanate, when local terracotta styles influenced medieval mosque construction. The [[Adina Mosque]] of [[United Bengal]] was the largest mosque built on the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Adina_Mosque|title=Adina Mosque, – Banglapedia|website=en.Banglapedia.org|access-date=12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] was the largest medieval mosque built in Bangladesh, and is a fine example of Turkic-Bengali architecture. The [[Mughal architecture|Mughal style]] replaced indigenous architecture when Bengal became a province of the Mughal Empire and influenced the development of urban housing. The [[Kantajew Temple]] and [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] are excellent examples of late medieval [[Hindu temple architecture]]. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]], based on Indo-Islamic styles, flourished during the British period. The zamindar gentry in Bangladesh built numerous Indo-Saracenic palaces and country mansions, such as the [[Ahsan Manzil]], [[Tajhat Palace]], [[Uttara Gonobhaban|Dighapatia Palace]], [[Puthia Rajbari]] and [[Natore Rajbari]].
[[File:Guest house in Sylhet (01).jpg|thumb|The [[bungalow]], which originated in Bengal, is a common sight. The roof style seen in the picture is common in the hilly areas of [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]]]
Bengali [[vernacular architecture]] is noted for pioneering the [[bungalow]]. Bangladeshi villages consist of [[thatch]]ed roofed houses made of natural materials like [[mud]], [[straw]], wood and bamboo. In modern times, village bungalows are increasingly made of [[tin]].

[[Muzharul Islam]] was the pioneer of Bangladeshi modern architecture. His varied works set the course of modern architectural practice in the country. Islam brought leading global architects, including [[Louis Kahn]], [[Richard Neutra]], [[Stanley Tigerman]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], [[Robert Boughey]] and [[Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis|Konstantinos Doxiadis]], to work in erstwhile East Pakistan. Louis Kahn was chosen to design the National Parliament Complex in [[Sher-e-Bangla Nagar]]. Kahn's monumental designs, combining regional red brick aesthetics, his own concrete and marble [[brutalism]] and the use of lakes to represent Bengali geography, are regarded as one of the masterpieces of the 20th century. In more recent times, award-winning architects like [[Rafiq Azam]] have set the course of contemporary architecture by adopting influences from the works of Islam and Kahn.

Folk music is accompanied by a one-stringed instrument known as the [[ektara]]. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], flute, and [[tabla]]. Bengali classical music includes [[Tagore songs]] and [[Nazrul geeti|Nazrul Sangeet]]. Bangladesh has a rich tradition of [[Indian classical music]], which uses instruments like the [[sitar]], tabla, [[sarod]] and [[santoor]].&lt;ref&gt;London, Ellen (2004). Bangladesh.

The [[Nakshi Kantha]] is a centuries-old [[embroidery]] tradition for [[quilt]]s, said to be indigenous to eastern Bengal (i.e. Bangladesh). The sari is the national dress for Bangladeshi women. Mughal Dhaka was renowned for producing the finest [[Muslin]] saris, as well as the famed [[Dhakai]] and [[Jamdani]], the weaving of which is listed by UNESCO as one of the masterpieces of humanity's intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional art of Jamdani weaving – intangible heritage – Culture Sector – UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/traditional-art-of-jamdani-weaving-00879|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209021720/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/traditional-art-of-jamdani-weaving-00879|archive-date=9 December 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh also produces the [[Rajshahi silk]]. The [[shalwar kameez]] is also widely worn by Bangladeshi women. In urban areas some women can be seen in western clothing. The [[kurta]] and [[sherwani]] are the national dress of Bangladeshi men; the [[lungi]] and [[dhoti]] are worn by them in informal settings. Aside from ethnic wear, domestically [[tailored]] [[suit (clothing)|suits]] and [[neckties]] are customarily worn by the country's men in offices, in schools and at social events.

The handloom industry supplies 60–65% of the country's clothing demand.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Shamsuddin (2012). &quot;Textiles&quot;. In Islam, Sirajul; Jamal, Ahmed A.

The retailer [[Aarong]] is one of the most successful ethnic wear brands in South Asia. The development of the Bangladesh textile industry, which supplies leading international brands, has promoted the production and retail of modern Western attire locally, with the country now having a number of expanding local brands like Westecs and Yellow. Bangladesh is the world's second largest garments exporter. Among Bangladesh's fashion designers, [[Bibi Russell]] has received international acclaim for her &quot;Fashion for Development&quot; shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture-and-development.info/issues/morebibi.htm|title=more Bibi Russell|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722064606/http://www.culture-and-development.info/issues/morebibi.htm|archivedate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Bengali cuisine|Bangladeshi cuisine}}
[[File:Bangladeshi cuisine.png|thumb|Traditional Bangladeshi Meal: [[Mustard seed]] [[Ilish]] [[Curry]], Dhakai [[Biryani]] and [[Pitha]]]]
[[White rice]] is the staple of Bangladeshi cuisine, along with many vegetables and [[lentil]]s. Rice preparations also include Bengali [[biryani]]s, [[pilaf|pulaos]], and [[khichuri]]s. [[Mustard (condiment)|Mustard]] sauce, [[ghee]], [[sunflower oil]] and fruit [[chutney]]s are widely used in Bangladeshi cooking. Fish is the main source of protein in Bengali cuisine. The [[Hilsa]] is the national fish and immensely popular across Bangladesh. Other kinds of fish eaten include [[rohu]], [[butterfish]], catfish, [[tilapia]] and [[barramundi]]. [[Fish egg]]s are a gourmet delicacy. Seafood holds an important place in Bengali cuisine, especially [[lobster]]s, [[shrimp]]s and [[dried fish]]. Meat consumption includes chicken, beef, [[mutton]], [[venison]], [[duck]] and [[squab (food)|squab]]. In Chittagong, ''Mezban'' feasts are a popular tradition featuring the serving of hot beef [[curry]]. In Sylhet, the ''[[shatkora]]'' lemons are used to marinate dishes. In the tribal Hill Tracts, bamboo shoot cooking is prevalent. Bangladesh has a vast spread of desserts, including distinctive [[sweets]] like ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Rôshomalai'', ''[[Chomchom]]'', ''Mishti Doi'' and ''Kalojaam''. [[Pitha]]s are traditional boiled desserts made with rice or fruits. [[Halwa]] is served during religious festivities. [[Naan]], [[paratha]], [[luchi]] and [[bakarkhani]] are the main local breads. [[Milk tea]] is offered to guests as a gesture of welcome and is the most common hot beverage in the country. [[Kebab]]s are widely popular across Bangladesh, particularly [[seekh kebab]]s, [[chicken tikka]] and [[shashlik]]s.

Bangladesh shares its culinary heritage with the neighbouring Indian state of [[West Bengal]]. The two regions have several differences, however. In Muslim-majority Bangladesh, meat consumption is greater; whereas in Hindu-majority West Bengal, vegetarianism is more prevalent. The Bangladeshi diaspora dominates the South Asian restaurant industry in many Western countries, particularly in the United Kingdom.

===Festivals===
{{Main|Public holidays in Bangladesh|List of festivals in Bangladesh}}
[[File:Mangal Shobhajatra in Dhaka.jpg|thumb|left|The annual [[Bengali New Year]] parade]]
''[[Pahela Baishakh]]'', the Bengali new year, is the major festival of [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and sees widespread festivities. Of the major holidays celebrated in Bangladesh, only Pahela Baishakh comes without any pre-existing expectations (specific religious identity, culture of gift-giving, etc.) and has become an occasion for celebrating the simpler, rural roots of the Bengal. Other cultural festivals include [[Nabanna|Nabonno]], and Poush Parbon both of which are Bengali harvest festivals.

The Muslim festivals of Eid al-Fitr, [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Milad un Nabi]], [[Muharram]], [[Chand Raat]], [[Barat Night|Shab-e-Barat]]; the Hindu festivals of [[Durga Puja]], [[Janmashtami]] and [[Rath Yatra]]; the Buddhist festival of [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], and Christian festival of Christmas are [[Public holidays in Bangladesh|national holidays]] in Bangladesh and see the most widespread celebrations in the country.

These occasions are celebrated with public ceremonies, parades, rallies by citizens, political speeches, fairs, concerts, and various other public and private events, celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs, and many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals, and concerts that draw the participation of citizens from all levels of Bangladeshi society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh|title=Pahela Baisakh, – Banglapedia|website=en.Banglapedia.org|access-date=12 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cinema of Bangladesh]] dates back to 1898, when films began screening at the Crown Theatre in Dhaka. The first bioscope on the subcontinent was established in Dhaka that year. The [[Dhaka Nawab Family]] patronised the production of several [[silent film]]s in the 1920s and 30s. In 1931, the East Bengal Cinematograph Society released the first full-length feature film in Bangladesh, titled the ''Last Kiss''. The first feature film in East Pakistan, ''[[Mukh O Mukhosh]]'', was released in 1956. During the 1960s, 25–30 films were produced annually in Dhaka. By the 2000s, Bangladesh produced 80–100 films a year. While the Bangladeshi film industry has achieved limited commercial success, the country has produced notable independent filmmakers. [[Zahir Raihan]] was a prominent documentary-maker who was assassinated in 1971. The late [[Tareque Masud]] is regarded as one of Bangladesh's outstanding directors due to his numerous productions on historical and social issues. Masud was honoured by [[FIPRESCI]] at the 2002 [[Cannes Film Festival]] for his film ''[[Matir Moina|The Clay Bird]]''. [[Tanvir Mokammel]], [[Mostofa Sarwar Farooki]], [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Alamgir Kabir (film maker)|Alamgir Kabir]], and [[Chashi Nazrul Islam]] are some of the prominent directors of Bangladeshi cinema.

The [[Varendra Research Museum]] is the oldest museum in Bangladesh. It houses important collections from both the pre-Islamic and Islamic periods, including the sculptures of the Pala-Sena School of Art and the Indus Valley Civilization; as well as Sanskrit, Arabic and Persian manuscripts and inscriptions. The Ahsan Manzil, the former residence of the Nawab of Dhaka, is a national museum housing collections from the British Raj. It was the site of the founding conference of the All India Muslim League and hosted many British Viceroys in Dhaka.

The [[Tajhat Palace|Tajhat]] Palace Museum preserves artefacts of the rich cultural heritage of North Bengal, including Hindu-Buddhist sculptures and Islamic manuscripts. The [[Mymensingh Museum]] houses the personal antique collections of Bengali aristocrats in central Bengal.

In ancient times, manuscripts were written on palm leaves, tree barks, parchment vellum and terracotta plates and preserved at monasteries known as ''[[vihara]]s''. The Hussain Shahi dynasty established royal libraries during the Bengal Sultanate. Libraries were established in each district of Bengal by the zamindar gentry during the Bengal Renaissance in the 19th century. The trend of establishing libraries continued until the beginning of World War II. In 1854, four major public libraries were opened, including the Bogra Woodburn Library, the Rangpur Public Library, the Jessore Institute Public Library and the Barisal Public Library.

The [[Northbrook Hall|Northbrook Hall Public Library]] was established in Dhaka in 1882 in honour of [[Lord Northbrook]], the Governor-General. Other libraries established in the British period included the Victoria Public Library, Natore (1901), the Sirajganj Public Library (1882), the [[Rajshahi Public Library]] (1884), the Comilla Birchandra Library (1885), the Shah Makhdum Institute Public Library, Rajshahi (1891), the Noakhali Town Hall Public Library (1896), the Prize Memorial Library, Sylhet (1897), the Chittagong Municipality Public Library (1904) and the Varendra Research Library (1910). The Great Bengal Library Association was formed in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rahman |first=Md Zillur |year=2012 |chapter=Library |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Library |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Public Library (Dhaka)|Central Public Library of Dhaka]] was established in 1959.
