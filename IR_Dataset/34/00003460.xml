'''Bermuda''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ər|ˈ|m|j|uː|d|ə}}) (in full, the ''Islands of Bermuda'') is a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]. It is approximately {{convert|1070|km|0|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]]; {{convert|1236|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Cape Sable Island]], [[Nova Scotia]]; and {{convert|1759|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Cuba]]. Though it is typically referred to in the singular, Bermuda consists of 181 islands; the largest of these islands is known as Main Island. The [[capital city]] of Bermuda is [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]. Bermuda is self-governing, with its own constitution and government and a Parliament which makes local laws. The United Kingdom retains responsibility for defence and foreign relations. As of July 2018, it has a population of 71,176, making it the most populous of the British overseas territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=North America :: Bermuda| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bd.html |publisher= CIA World Factbook| date=July 2018| accessdate=4 February 2019}} {{CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Bermuda is named after the Spanish sailor [[Juan de Bermúdez]], who discovered the islands in 1505.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Factbook&quot;/&gt;

One of the earliest appearances of the name in English literature is In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] ''[[The Tempest]]'', a play which was inspired by the wreck of the ''Sea Venture'', though not set on the islands:

&lt;poem&gt;''Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew''
''From the still-vex'd Bermoothes''&lt;ref&gt;''The Tempest'' Act I Scene II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

[[John Donne]]'s poem ''The Storm'' uses the same idea: ''Compar’d to these stormes, death is but a qualme, Hell somewhat lightsome, and the’Bermuda calme''.

===Settlement by the English===
[[File:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|[[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] wrote one of the first [[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles|histories of Bermuda]] in 1624 (combined with [[Virginia]] and [[New England]]).]]
For the next century, the island is believed to have been visited frequently, but not settled. The English had by this time started to take an interest in the 'New' World, initially attempting to settle in [[Virginia]] in what is now the eastern United States. After the failure of the first two English colonies here, a more determined effort was initiated by King [[James I of England]], who granted a Royal Charter to the [[Virginia Company]] which established a colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607. Two years later, a [[flotilla]] of seven ships left England under the company's admiral, Sir [[George Somers]], and the new governor of Jamestown, Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]], with several hundred settlers, food and supplies to relieve the colony of Jamestown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Sir George Somers (1554–1610)| author=Mark Nicholls| publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia| url=http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Somers_Sir_George_1554-1610 | date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the flotilla was broken up by a storm; as the [[flagship]], {{ship||Sea Venture}}, was taking on water, Somers drove it onto Bermuda's reef and reached the shores safely with smaller boats – all 150 passengers and a dog survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt; ([[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]]'', in which the character [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]] refers to the &quot;still-vex'd Bermoothes&quot; (I.ii.229), is thought to have been inspired by [[William Strachey]]'s account of this shipwreck.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=Hobson |title=A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest |url=https://archive.org/details/bravevesseltruet0000wood |url-access=registration |publisher=Viking |year=2009 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bravevesseltruet0000wood/page/191 191–199]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shipwreck Modernity, Ecologies of Globalization, 1550-1719|last1=Mentz|first1=Steve|date=2015|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-1452945545|edition=1st|location=|pages=Chapter 3|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stayed 10 months, starting a new settlement and building two small ships, the ''Deliverance'' and the ''Patience'', to sail on to Jamestown. Bermuda was claimed for the English Crown, and the charter of the Virginia Company was later extended to include them.

On 10 May 1610, all but two of the remaining survivors of ''Sea Venture'' sailed on to Jamestown (excluding those who had died or been killed on Bermuda, or the crew of the ''Sea Venture''{{'}}s longboat, sent under Henry Ravens to Virginia a month after the wreck of the ''Sea Venture'', none of whom were seen again; but including children born in Bermuda). Among them was [[John Rolfe]], whose wife and child died and were buried in Bermuda. Somers returned to Bermuda with the ''Plough'' to obtain food for the starving settlers of Jamestown but died in Bermuda; the Plough sailed instead for England, leaving a third man with the two who had remained behind in May. In 1612, the English began the intentional settlement of the archipelago, officially named ''Virgineola'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/Sir-George-Somers/ Historic UK: ''Sir George Somers''. By Ben Johnson]&lt;/ref&gt; with the arrival of the ship the ''Plough''. New London (soon renamed St. George's Town) was settled that year and designated as the colony's first capital.&lt;ref&gt;name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web |title=Bermuda – History and Heritage |date=6 November 2007 |work=Smithsonian|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524174308/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/destination-hunter/bermuda-history-heritage.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 May 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frommers - History of Bermuda&quot;/&gt; It is the oldest continually inhabited English town in the [[New World]].&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

In 1615, the colony, which had been renamed the Somers Isles in commemoration of Sir George Somers, was passed to a new company, the [[Somers Isles Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bearboat.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/tvlbt-bda-bd-11feb09_sailingtravel1.pdf |title=Bermuda's 400th Birthday |publisher=Bearboa.files.wordpress.com |date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bermuda-attractions.com/bermuda_0002ae.htm |title=Somers Garden |publisher=Bermuda, Bermuda-attractions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Bermudians settled [[Carolina Colony]] and contributed to the establishment of other English colonies in the Americas, [[Bermuda (disambiguation)|many other locations were also named after the archipelago]]. During this period the first slaves were brought to the islands. These were a mixture of African and Native American slaves, shipwreck victims from enemy nations, and political prisoners from Scotland and Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt;

The archipelago's limited land area and resources led to the creation of what may be the earliest conservation laws of the [[New World]]. In 1616 and 1620 acts were passed banning the hunting of certain [[bird]]s and young [[tortoise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Martin. &quot;Developing a Small Island GIS: the Bermuda Experience&quot;.

===Civil War===
In 1649, the [[English Civil War]] was in its seventh year and King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] was beheaded in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]], London. The conflict spilled over into Bermuda, where the majority of the colonists developed a strong sense of devotion to the Crown. Bermuda's civil war was ended by militias, and dissenters such as [[Puritan]]s and [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] were pushed to settle [[The Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/history.htm|title=Bermuda's History from 1500 to 1699|author=Keith Archibald Forbes|website=bermuda-online.org|access-date=22 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715004332/http://bermuda-online.org/history.htm|archive-date=15 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebellious [[cavalier|royalist]] colonies of Bermuda and Virginia, as well as [[Barbados]] and [[Antigua]], were the subjects of [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego|an Act of the Rump Parliament of England]] that was essentially a declaration of war:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/acts-ordinances-interregnum/pp425-429#p3 ''Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642–1660''.

The royalist colonies were also threatened with invasion. The Government of Bermuda eventually reached an agreement with the Parliamentarians in England which left the status quo in Bermuda.{{cn|date=November 2019}}

===Later 17th century===
[[File:Bermuda Gazette - 12 November 1796.jpg|thumb|right|''Bermuda Gazette'' of 12 November 1796, calling for [[privateer]]ing against Spain and its allies; it has advertisements for crew for two privateer vessels.]]
In the 17th century, the Somers Isles Company suppressed shipbuilding, as it needed Bermudians to farm in order for it to generate income from the land. The colony of Virginia far surpassed Bermuda in both quality and quantity of [[tobacco]] produced. Bermudians began to turn to maritime trades relatively early in the 17th century, but the Somers Isles Company used all its authority to suppress turning away from agriculture. This interference led to the islanders demanding, and receiving, the revocation of the company's charter in 1684, and the company was dissolved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt;

Bermudians rapidly abandoned agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland with the native juniper (''[[Juniperus bermudiana]]'', called ''Bermuda cedar'') trees that grew thickly over the entire island. Establishing effective control over the [[Turks Islands]], Bermudians deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century. Bermudians also vigorously pursued [[whaling]], [[privateering]], and the merchant trade.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

The [[Bermuda sloop]] became highly regarded for its speed and manoeuvrability, and was soon adapted for service with the [[Royal Navy]]. The Bermuda sloop {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}} carried dispatches of the victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], and news of the death of [[Admiral Lord Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], to England.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

===Bermuda and the American War of Independence===
Bermuda's ambivalence towards the American rebellion changed in September 1774, when the [[Continental Congress]] resolved to ban trade with Great Britain, Ireland, and the West Indies after 10 September 1775. Such an embargo would mean the collapse of their intercolonial commerce, famine and civil unrest. Lacking political channels with Great Britain, [[Henry Tucker (President of the Council of Bermuda)|the Tucker Family]] met in May 1775 with eight other parishioners, and resolved to send delegates to the Continental Congress in July, with the goal of an exemption from the ban. Henry Tucker noted a clause in the ban which allowed the exchange of American goods for military supplies. The clause was confirmed by [[Benjamin Franklin]] when Tucker met with the Pennsylvania [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]]. Independently, Tucker's sons St. George and Thomas Tudor confirmed this business arrangement with [[Peyton Randolph]] and the Charlestown Committee of Safety, while another Bermudian, Harris, did so with [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name=Jarvis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jarvis|first1=Michael|title=In the Eye of All Trade|date=2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=9780807872840|pages=385–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three American vessels, independently operating from Charlestown, Philadelphia and Newport, sailed to Bermuda, and on 14 August 1775, 100 barrels of gunpowder were taken from the Bermudian magazine, while Governor [[George James Bruere]] slept, and loaded onto these vessels. As a consequence, on 2 October the Continental Congress exempted Bermuda from their trade ban, and Bermuda acquired a reputation for disloyalty. Later that year, the British Parliament passed the [[Prohibitory Act]] to prohibit trade with the American rebelling colonies, and sent HMS ''Scorpion'' to keep watch over the island. The island's forts were stripped of cannon, such that by the end of 1775, all of Bermuda's forts were without cannon, shot and powder. Yet, wartime trade of contraband continued along well established family connections. With 120 vessels by 1775, Bermuda continued to trade with [[St. Eustatius]] until 1781, and provided salt to North American ports, despite the presence of hundreds of privateers.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|389–415}}

In June 1776, HMS ''Nautilus'' secured the island, followed by {{HMS|Galatea|1776|6}} in September. Yet, the two British captains seemed more intent on capturing prize money, causing a severe food shortage on the island until the departure of ''Nautilus'' in October. After France's entry into the war in 1778, [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|Sir Henry Clinton]] refortified and garrisoned the island under the command of Major [[William Sutherland (British Army officer)|William Sutherland]]. As a result, 91 French and American ships were captured in the winter of 1778–1779, bringing the population once again to the brink of starvation. Bermudian trade was severely hampered by the combined efforts of the Royal Navy, the British garrison and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist privateers]], such that famine struck the island in 1779.&lt;ref name=Jarvis/&gt;{{rp|416–427}}

The death of George Bruere in 1780 turned the governorship over to his son, George Jr., an active loyalist. Under his leadership, smuggling was stopped, and the Bermudian colonial government populated with like-minded loyalists.

After the [[American Revolution]], the [[Royal Navy]] began improving the harbours on the Bermudas. In 1811, work began on the large [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] on [[Ireland Island, Bermuda|Ireland Island]], in the west of the chain, which was to serve as the islands' principal naval base guarding the western Atlantic Ocean shipping lanes.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} To guard the dockyard, the [[British Army]] built a large [[Bermuda Garrison]], and heavily fortified the archipelago.

During the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the United States, the [[Burning of Washington|British attacks]] on [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake]] were planned and launched from Bermuda, where the headquarters of the Royal Navy's [[North America and West Indies Station|North American Station]] had recently been moved from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}
[[File:The Harbor at St. George, Bermuda from Sugar Loaf Hill.jpg|thumb|right|The harbour at [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]], the original capital]] In 1816, James Arnold, the son of [[Benedict Arnold]], fortified Bermuda's Royal Naval Dockyard against possible US attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Howes, James: [http://www.atlascom.us/keys.htm &quot;Attack on Baltimore Launched from Bermuda in 'War of 1812'&quot;] 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the [[National Museum of Bermuda]], which incorporates Bermuda's Maritime Museum, occupies the [[Keep]] of the Royal Naval Dockyard, including the Commissioner's House, and exhibits artifacts of the base's military history.

The British [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807, but not the institution itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/caribbean-islands/8.htm The Sugar Revolutions and Slavery], ''U.S. Library of Congress''&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of frequent slave rebellions in their other colonies, as well as the efforts of abolitionists, the British outlawed slavery in its empire in 1834.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frommers - History of Bermuda&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt;

Due to its proximity to the southeastern US coast, Bermuda was frequently used during the [[American Civil War]] as a stopping point base for the [[Confederate States]]' [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runners]] on their runs to and from the Southern states, and England, to evade Union naval vessels on blockade patrol;&lt;ref name=&quot;Frommers - History of Bermuda&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt; the blockade runners were then able to transport essential war goods from England and deliver valuable cotton back to England. The old Globe Hotel in St George's, which was a centre of intrigue for Confederate agents, is preserved as a public museum.

====Anglo-Boer War====
During the [[Anglo-Boer War]] (1899–1902), 5,000 [[Boer]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] were housed on five islands of Bermuda. They were located according to their views of the war. &quot;Bitterenders&quot; (Afrikaans: [[Bittereinder]]s), who refused to pledge allegiance to the British Crown, were interned on Darrell's Island and closely guarded. Other islands such as Morgan's Island held 884 men, including 27 officers; Tucker's Island held 809 Boer prisoners, Burt's Island 607, and Port's Island held 35.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angloboerwar.com/other-information/89-prisoner-of-war-camps/1838-camp-for-boers-bermuda Camps for Boers – Bermuda].

The most famous escapee was the Boer prisoner of war Captain [[Fritz Joubert Duquesne]], who was serving a life sentence for &quot;conspiracy against the British government and on (the charge of) espionage&quot;.{{sfn|Ronnie|1995|p=37}} On the night of 25 June 1902, Duquesne slipped out of his tent, worked his way over a barbed-wire fence, swam 1.5 miles (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) past patrol boats and bright spot lights, through storm-wracked waters, using the distant [[Gibbs Hill Lighthouse]] for navigation until he arrived ashore on the main island.{{sfn|Ronnie|1995|pp=54,63}} From there he escaped to the port of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] and a week later, he stowed away on a boat heading to Baltimore, Maryland.{{sfn|Ronnie|1995|pp=65–66}} He settled in the US and later became a spy for Germany in both World Wars. He claimed to be responsible for the 1916 death of [[Horatio Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in the sinking of {{HMS|Hampshire|1903|6}}, the head of the British Army who had also commanded British forces in South Africa during the second Boer War, but this had resulted from a mine. In 1942, Col. Duquesne was arrested by the [[FBI]] for leading the [[Duquesne Spy Ring]], which still to this day is the largest espionage case in the history of the United States.{{sfn|Duffy|2014|p=2}}

Lord Kitchener's brother, Lt. Gen. Sir [[Frederick Walter Kitchener|Walter Kitchener]], had been the [[governor of Bermuda]] from 1908 until his death in 1912. His son, Major Hal Kitchener, bought [[Hinson's Island, Bermuda|Hinson's Island]] (with his partner, Major Hemming, another First World War aviator). The island had formerly been part of the Boer POW camp, housing teenaged prisoners from 1901 to 1902.

===20th and 21st centuries===
[[File:Bermuda harbour 1926.jpg|thumb|[[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]] in the mid-1920s]]
In the early 20th century, as modern transport and communication systems developed, Bermuda became a popular destination for American, Canadian and British tourists arriving by sea. The United States [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] of 1930, which enacted protectionist trade [[tariffs]] on goods imported into the US, led to the demise of Bermuda's once-thriving agricultural export trade to America and encouraged the development of tourism as an alternative source of income. The island was one of the centres for illegal alcohol smuggling during the era of [[Prohibition in the United States]] (1920-1933).&lt;ref name=&quot;Frommers - History of Bermuda&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt;

In 1930, after several failed attempts, a [[Stinson Detroiter]] [[seaplane]] flew to Bermuda from [[New York City]], the first aeroplane ever to reach the islands. The flight was not without incident, as the aircraft had to land twice in the ocean, once because of darkness and again when it needed to refuel.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Navigation and weather forecasting improved in 1933 when the [[Royal Air Force]] (then responsible for providing equipment and personnel for the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]]) established a station at the Royal Naval Dockyard to repair [[Floatplane|float planes]] (and supply replacements) for the fleet. In 1936, [[Deutsche Luft Hansa|Luft Hansa]] began to experiment with seaplane flights from [[Berlin]] via the [[Azores]] with continuation flights to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldqslcards.com/UNUSUAL_PLACE.pdf |title=Unusual Place – Unusual Story – Heroic Crew |publisher=Oldqslcards.com|accessdate= 15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, [[Imperial Airways]] and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]] began operating scheduled [[flying boat]] airline services from New York and [[Baltimore]] to [[Darrell's Island, Bermuda]]. In 1948, a regularly scheduled commercial airline service began to operate, using land-based aeroplanes landing at [[Kindley Air Force Base|Kindley Field]] (now [[L.F. Wade International Airport]]), helping tourism to reach its peak in the 1960s–1970s. By the end of the 1970s, however, international business had supplanted tourism as the dominant sector of Bermuda's economy.

The Royal Naval Dockyard, and the attendant military garrison, continued to be important to Bermuda's economy until the mid-20th century. In addition to considerable building work, the armed forces needed to source food and other materials from local vendors. Beginning in [[World War II]], US military installations were also located in Bermuda, including a [[Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex|naval air station]] and [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] along with US Army air, anti-aircraft, and coast artillery forces. The Army forces were under the [[Bermuda Base Command]] during the war, with some shifting and renaming of bases between the US Army, Navy, and Air Force postwar. The American military presence lasted until 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;bermuda-online.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.bermuda-online.org/milquit.htm Bermuda Online: American military bases in Bermuda 1941 to 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal adult suffrage and the development of a two-party political system took place in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt; Universal suffrage was adopted as part of Bermuda's Constitution in 1967; voting had previously been dependent on a certain level of property ownership.

On 10 March 1973, the governor of Bermuda, [[Richard Sharples]], was assassinated by local [[Black Power movement|Black Power]] militants during a period of civil unrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt; Some moves were made towards possible independence for the islands, however this was decisively rejected in a [[1995 Bermudian independence referendum|referendum in 1995]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - Bermuda&quot;/&gt;

In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a designated [[World Heritage Site]]. [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers can explore numerous [[shipwreck|wrecks]] and [[coral reefs]] in relatively shallow water (typically {{convert|30|-|40|ft|0|disp=or|abbr=on}} in depth), with virtually unlimited visibility. Many nearby reefs are readily accessible from shore by [[snorkelling|snorkellers]], especially at [[Church Bay, Bermuda|Church Bay]].

Bermuda's most popular visitor attraction is the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], which includes the National Museum of Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-museums-in-bermuda|title=10 Best Museums in Bermuda|last=LaHuta|first=David|website=Condé Nast Traveler|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other attractions include the [[Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bamz.org |title=Bermuda Aquarium, Museum and Zoo |publisher=Bamz.org |accessdate =20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda Underwater Exploration Institute, the Botanical Gardens and [[Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art]], lighthouses, and the Crystal Caves with [[stalactites]] and underground saltwater pools.

It is not possible to rent a car on the island; public transport and taxis are available or visitors can hire [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] for use as private transport.&lt;ref name=Rybeck /&gt;

===Geology===
[[File:NOAA Ocean Explorer Bermuda Geologic Map.png|thumb|NOAA Ocean Explorer Bermuda Geologic Map. where red denotes the Walsingham Formation, purple denotes the Town Hill and Belmont Formations, green denotes the Rocky Bay and Southampton Formations, and white is fill associated with the airport]]
Bermuda consists of more than 150 [[limestone]] islands, but 5 main islands, along the southern margin of the Bermuda Platform, which is one of three topographic highs found on the [[Bermuda Pedestal]]. This Bermuda Pedestal sits atop the Bermuda Rise, a mid-basin swell surrounded by [[abyssal plain]]s. Initial uplift of this rise occurred in the Middle to [[Late Eocene]] and concluded by the [[Late Oligocene]], when it subsided below sea level. The volcanic rocks associated with this rise are [[tholeiitic magma series|tholeiitic lavas]] and [[intrusive rock|intrusive]] [[lamprophyre]] sheets, which form a volcanic basement, on average, 50 m below the island [[carbonate]] surface.&lt;ref name=Vacher&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vacher|first1=H.L.|last2=Rowe|first2=Mark|editor1-last=Vacher|editor1-first=H.L.|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=T.|title=Geology and Hydrogeology of Bermuda, in Geology and Hydrogeology of Carbonate Islands, Developments in Sedimentology 54|date=1997|publisher=elsevier Science B.V.|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780444516442|pages=35–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limestones of Bermuda consist of [[calcarenite|biocalcarenites]] with minor [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. The portion of Bermuda above sea level consists of rocks deposited by [[Aeolian processes]]. These [[eolianite]]s are actually the [[type locality (geology)|type locality]], and formed during [[interglaciation]]s, and are laced by red [[paleosol]]s, also referred to as geosols or terra rossas, indicative of [[Sahara]]n [[atmospheric dust]] and forming during [[glacial stage]]s. The [[stratigraphic column]] starts with the Walsingham [[formation (geology)|Formation]], overlain by the Castle Harbour Geosol, the Lower and Upper Town Hill Formations separated by the Harbour Road Geosol, the Ord Road Geosol, the Belmont Formation, the Shore Hills Geosol, the Rocky Bay Formation, and the Southampton Formation.&lt;ref name=Vacher/&gt;

The older eolianite ridges (Older Bermuda) are more rounded and subdued compared to the outer coastline (Younger Bermuda). Thus, post deposition morphology includes chemical [[erosion]], with inshore water bodies demonstrating much of Bermuda is partially drowned [[Pleistocene]] [[karst]]. The Walsingham Formation is a clear example, constituting the cave district around Castle Harbour. The Upper Town Hill Formation forms the core of the Main Island, and prominent hills such as Town Hill, Knapton Hill, and St. David's Lighthouse, while the highest hills, Gibbs Hill Lighthouse, are due to the Southampton Formation.&lt;ref name=Vacher/&gt;

Bermuda has two major [[aquifer]]s, the Langton Aquifer located within the Southampton, Rocky Bay and Belmont Formations, and the Brighton Aquifer located within the Town Hill Formation. Four freshwater [[lens (hydrology)|lenses]] occur in Bermuda, with the Central Lens being the largest on Main Island, containing an area of 7.2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a thickness greater than 10 m.&lt;ref name=Vacher/&gt;

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Bermuda|List of Bermuda hurricanes}}
[[File:Bermuda wv.jpg|left|thumb|Residential scene in Bermuda]]
Bermuda has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Af'''), bordering very closely on a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Cfa'''). Bermuda is warmed by the nearby [[Gulf Stream]], and low latitude. The islands may experience modestly cooler temperatures in January, February, and March [average {{cvt|17|C|}}].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forbes|first1=Keith Archibald|title=Bermuda's Climate and Weather|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/climateweather.htm|website=Bermuda Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has never been snow, a frost or freeze on record in Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;Hans W.

Summertime [[heat index]] in Bermuda can be high, although mid-August temperatures rarely exceed {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|34|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weather Summary for January 2009 |publisher=[[Bermuda Weather Service]] |date=4 February 2003 |url=http://www.weather.bm/data/2009-02.html |accessdate=25 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature of the Atlantic Ocean around Bermuda is {{convert|22.8|°C|1}}, from {{convert|18.6|°C|1}} in February to {{convert|28.2|°C|1}} in August.&lt;ref name=BWS/&gt;

Bermuda is in the [[hurricane belt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Factbook&quot;/&gt; Along the Gulf Stream, it is often directly in the path of hurricanes recurving in the westerlies, although they usually begin to weaken as they approach Bermuda, whose small size means that direct [[landfall (meteorology)|landfalls]] of hurricanes are rare. The most recent hurricanes to cause significant damage to Bermuda were [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 2]] [[Hurricane Gonzalo]] on 18 October 2014 and [[Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale|category 3]] [[Hurricane Nicole (2016)|Hurricane Nicole]] on 14 October 2016, both of which struck the island directly. Before that, [[Hurricane Fabian]] on 5 September 2003 was the last major hurricane to hit Bermuda directly.

With no rivers or freshwater lakes, the only source of fresh water is rainfall, which is collected on roofs and catchments (or drawn from underground lenses) and stored in tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Factbook&quot;/&gt; Each dwelling usually has at least one of these tanks forming part of its foundation. The law requires that each household collect rainwater that is piped down from the roof of each house. Average monthly rainfall is highest in October, at over {{convert|6|in|mm}}, and lowest in April and May.

===Flora and fauna===
{{main|Wildlife of Bermuda}}
[[File:Juvenile Bermuda Cedar at Ferry Reach.jpg|thumb|Young Bermuda cedar tree at [[Ferry Reach, Bermuda|Ferry Reach]]]]

When discovered, Bermuda was uninhabited by humans and mostly dominated by forests of [[Juniperus bermudiana|Bermuda cedar]], with [[mangrove]] [[marsh]]es along its shores.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/floraofbermuda00brit#page/n7/mode/2up.htm /&lt;/ref&gt; Only 165 of the island's current 1,000 [[vascular plant]] species are considered [[indigenous (ecology)|native]]; fifteen of those, including the eponymous cedar, are [[endemism|endemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://environment.bm/endemic-species|title=Endemic Species|website=The Department of Environment and Natural Resources|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semi-tropical climate of Bermuda allowed settlers to introduce many species of trees and plants to the island. Today, many types of palm trees, fruit trees, and bananas grow on Bermuda.

The only [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] [[mammal]]s of Bermuda are five species of [[bat]], all of which are also found in the eastern United States: ''[[Lasionycteris noctivagans]]'', ''[[Lasiurus borealis]]'', ''[[Lasiurus cinereus]]'', ''[[Lasiurus seminolus]]'' and ''[[Perimyotis subflavus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Grady, F.V. |author2=Olson, S.L. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006|title= Fossil bats from Quaternary deposits on Bermuda (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae)|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume= 87|issue=1|pages=148–152|doi=10.1644/05-MAMM-A-179R1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda include its national bird, the [[Bermuda petrel]] or cahow, which was rediscovered in 1951 after having been thought extinct since the 1620s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22698088/0 |title=''Pterodroma cahow'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |accessdate=26 November 2013|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cahow is important as an example of a [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus]] species, hence the government has a programme to protect it, including the restoration its habitat areas.

The [[Bermuda rock skink|Bermuda skink]] (or ''rock lizard'') was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. However, scientists have recently discovered through genetic DNA studies that a species of [[turtle]], the [[diamondback terrapin]], previously thought to have been introduced to the archipelago, actually pre-dated the arrival of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.bm/diamondback-terrapin/|title=Diamondback Terrapin|work=The Department of Conservation Services|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807051136/http://www.conservation.bm/diamondback-terrapin/|archivedate=7 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds, some argue that it should be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink's unique status.

Bermuda's 2016 Census put Bermuda's population at 63,779 and, with an area of {{convert|53.2|km²|1|abbr=on}}, it has a calculated population density of 1201/km² (3,111/mi²).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/2016%20Census%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2018, the population is estimated to be 71,176.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Factbook&quot;/&gt;

The racial makeup of Bermuda as recorded by the 2016 census, was 52% Black, 31% White, 9% multiracial, 4% Asian, and 4% other races, although these numbers are based on self-identification, and the majority of those who answered &quot;black&quot; having any mixture of black, white or other ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/2016%20Census%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Native-born Bermudians made up 70% of the population, compared to 30% non-natives.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/2016%20Census%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. Theresa's Cathedral chapel.jpg|thumb|upright|The image of the [[Cult of Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres|Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles]], in [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], venerated by [[Azores|Azoreans]] in Bermuda]]
The island experienced large-scale immigration over the 20th century, especially after the Second World War. Bermuda has a diverse population including both those with relatively deep roots in Bermuda extending back for centuries, and newer communities whose ancestry results from recent immigration, especially from Britain, North America, the West Indies, and the [[List of islands of Portugal|Portuguese Atlantic islands]] (especially the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]), although these groups are steadily merging. About 64% of the population identified themselves with Bermudian ancestry in 2010, which was an increase from the 51% who did so in the 2000 census. Those identifying with British ancestry dropped by 1% to 11% (although those born in Britain remain the largest non-native group at 3,942 persons). The number of people born in Canada declined by 13%. Those who reported West Indian ancestry were 13%. The number of people born in the West Indies actually increased by 538. A significant segment of the population is of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ancestry (25%), the result of immigration over the past 160 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~portwestind/diaspora/waves_of_migration.htm |title=The Portuguese of the West Indies |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=31 July 2001|accessdate =20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of whom 79% have residency status. In June 2018, Premier [[Edward David Burt]] announced that 4 November 2019 &quot;will be declared a public holiday to mark the 170th anniversary of the arrival of the first Portuguese immigrants in Bermuda&quot; due to the significant impact that Portuguese immigration has had on the territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bernews.com/2018/06/holiday-to-mark-arrival-of-portuguese-immigrants/ Holiday To Mark Arrival Of Portuguese Immigrants, Bernews, 2 June 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; Those first immigrants arrived from [[Madeira]] aboard the vessel the Golden Rule on 4 November 1849.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bernews.com/2018/06/portugal-honorary-consul-we-are-very-excited/ Portugal Honorary Consul: 'We Are Very Excited', Bernews, 2 June 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also several thousand [[expatriate]] workers, principally from Britain, Canada, the West Indies, [[South Africa]] and the United States, reside in Bermuda. They are primarily engaged in specialised professions such as accounting, finance, and insurance. Others are employed in various trades, such as hotels, restaurants, construction, and landscaping services. Of the total workforce of 38,947 persons in 2005, government employment figures stated that 11,223 (29%) were non-Bermudians.&lt;ref&gt;''Bermuda Sun'', 4 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
The predominant language on Bermuda is [[Bermudian English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;World Factbook&quot;/&gt; It exhibits characteristics of British, West Indian, and American English.

Bermuda's proximity to the US had made it attractive as the site for summit conferences between British prime ministers and US presidents. The first summit was held in December 1953, at the insistence of Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], to discuss relations with the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Cold War]]. Participants included Churchill, US president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and French premier [[Joseph Laniel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=John|chapter=The Western Summit at Bermuda, December 1953|date=1996|work=Diplomacy at the Highest Level: The Evolution of International Summitry|pages=165–181|editor-last=Dunn|editor-first=David H.|series=Studies in Diplomacy|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-24915-2_11|isbn=978-1-349-24915-2|title=Diplomacy at the Highest Level}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 a second summit conference was held. The British prime minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], arrived earlier than President Eisenhower, to demonstrate they were meeting on British territory, as tensions were still high regarding the previous year's conflict over the [[Suez Canal]]. Macmillan returned in 1961 for the third summit with President [[John F. Kennedy]]. The meeting was called to discuss Cold War tensions arising from construction of the [[Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Visitors&quot;/&gt;

The most recent summit conference in Bermuda between the two powers occurred in 1990, when British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] met US president [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Visitors&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Keith Forbes | title= Bermuda's distinguished visitors over the years | work=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]] | url= http://www.bermuda-online.org/specialvisitors.htm | accessdate =22 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct meetings between the president of the United States and the [[premier of Bermuda]] have been rare. The most recent meeting was on 23 June 2008, between Premier [[Ewart Brown]] and President [[George W. Bush]]. Prior to this, the leaders of Bermuda and the United States had not met at the White House since a 1996 meeting between Premier David Saul and President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name=rg&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20080624/NEWS/306249953|title=Premier meets the President|author=Jonathan Kent|date=24 June 2008|work=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were accused of training to assist the [[Taliban]]'s military. They were cleared as safe for release from Guantánamo in 2005 or 2006, but US domestic law prohibited deporting them back to China, their country of citizenship, because the US government determined that China was [[human rights in China|likely to violate]] their human rights.

In September 2008, the men were cleared of all suspicion and Judge Ricardo Urbina in Washington ordered their release. Congressional opposition to their admittance to the United States was very strong&lt;ref name=&quot;AssociatedPress2009-06-11&quot; /&gt; and the US failed to find a home for them until Bermuda and [[Palau]] agreed to accept the 22 men in June 2009.

The secret bilateral discussions that led to prisoner transfers between the US and the devolved Bermuda government sparked diplomatic ire from the United Kingdom, which was not consulted on the move despite Bermuda being a British territory. The British Foreign Office issued the following statement:
{{quote|We've underlined to the Bermuda Government that they should have consulted with the United Kingdom as to whether this falls within their competence or is a security issue, for which the Bermuda Government do not have delegated responsibility. We have made clear to the Bermuda Government the need for a security assessment, which we are now helping them to carry out, and we will decide on further steps as appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonard|first1=Tom|title=British anger over Bermuda decision to take Guantanamo detainees|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/bermuda/5507926/British-anger-over-Bermuda-decision-to-take-Guantanamo-detainees.html|accessdate=22 April 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

CARICOM is a [[socio-economic]] bloc of nations in or near the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Other outlying member states include the Co-operative Republic of [[Guyana]], the Republic of [[Suriname]] in South America, and [[Belize]] in Central America. The [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], an associate member of CARICOM, and the Commonwealth of [[The Bahamas]], a full member of CARICOM, are in the Atlantic, but close to the Caribbean. Other nearby nations or territories, such as the United States, are not members (although the US Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]] has [[observer status]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands]] announced in 2007 that they would seek ties with CARICOM). Bermuda has minimal trade with the Caribbean region, and little in common with it economically, being roughly a thousand miles from the Caribbean Sea; it joined CARICOM primarily to strengthen cultural links with the region.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Among some scholars,{{Who|date=August 2010}} &quot;the Caribbean&quot; can be a socio-historical category, commonly referring to a cultural zone characterised by the legacy of slavery (a characteristic Bermuda shared with the Caribbean and the US) and the plantation system (which did not exist in Bermuda). It embraces the islands and parts of the neighbouring continent, and may be extended to include the Caribbean Diaspora overseas.&lt;ref name=&quot;acs-aec.org&quot;&gt;[[Norman Girvan|Girvan, Norman]] (2001), {{cite web|url=http://www.acs-aec.org/About/SG/Girvan/Speeches/rei1.htm |title=Reinterpreting the Caribbean |accessdate=5 August 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615225544/http://www.acs-aec.org/About/SG/Girvan/Speeches/rei1.htm |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df=dmy }} In ''New Caribbean Thought'', Folke Lindahl and Brian Meeks (eds), UWI Press, pp. 3 ff.

The PLP, which was the party in government when the decision was made to join CARICOM, has been dominated for decades by West Indians and their descendants.

The decision to join CARICOM stirred up a huge amount of debate and speculation among the Bermudian community and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20021214/NEWS/312149994|author1=Karen Smith|author2=Stephen Breen|title=Caricom set to pass|date=14 December 2002|work=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]|access-date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20021219/COMMENT/312199980|title=Welcome to Caricom|date=19 December 2002|work=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]|access-date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion polls conducted by two Bermudian newspapers, ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]'' and ''[[The Bermuda Sun]]'', showed that clear majorities of Bermudians were opposed to joining CARICOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20021216/NEWS/312169990|author1=Karen Smith|author2=Stephen Breen|title=The 'ayes' have it in the great Caricom debate|date=16 December 2002|work=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]|access-date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UBP, which had been in government from 1968 to 1998, argued that joining CARICOM was detrimental to Bermuda's interests:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20030618/NEWS/306189976|title=UBP takes 'wait-and-see' stance on Caricom|author=Ayo Johnson|date=18 June 2003|work=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]|access-date=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bermuda's trade with the West Indies is negligible, its primary economic partners being the US, Canada, and UK (it has no direct air or shipping links to Caribbean islands);
* CARICOM is moving towards a single economy;
* the Caribbean islands are generally competitors to Bermuda's already ailing tourism industry; and
* participation in CARICOM would involve considerable investment of money and the time of government officials that could more profitably be spent elsewhere.

Once known as &quot;the Gibraltar of the West&quot; and &quot;Fortress Bermuda&quot;, Bermuda today is defended by British forces. For the first two centuries of settlement, the most potent armed force operating from Bermuda was its merchant shipping fleet, which turned to [[privateering]] at every opportunity. The Bermuda government maintained a local militia. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], Bermuda was established as the Western Atlantic headquarters of the [[Royal Navy]]. Once the Royal Navy established a base and dockyard defended by regular soldiers, however, the militias were disbanded following the [[War of 1812]]. At the end of the 19th century, the colony raised [[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|volunteer units]] to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].

Due to its isolated location in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], Bermuda was vital to the Allies' war effort during both [[world war]]s of the 20th century, serving as a marshalling point for trans-Atlantic convoys, as well as a naval air base. By the Second World War, both the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] were operating [[Seaplane]] bases on Bermuda.

In May 1940, the US requested base rights in Bermuda from the United Kingdom, but British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was initially unwilling to accede to the American request without getting something in return.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill and America''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1940, as part of the [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]], the UK granted the US base rights in Bermuda. Bermuda and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange. One of the terms of the agreement was that the airfield the US Army built would be used jointly by the US and the UK (which it was for the duration of the war, with RAF Transport Command relocating there from [[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Darrell's Island]] in 1943). The US Army established the [[Bermuda Base Command]] in 1941 to coordinate its [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets during the war. The US Navy operated a [[USN Submarine Base, Ordnance Island, Bermuda|submarine base]] on [[Ordnance Island, Bermuda|Ordnance Island]] from 1942 through 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;bermuda-online.org&quot;/&gt;

Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of {{convert|5.8|km²|1|abbr=on}} of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by [[US Air Force]] transport and refuelling aircraft and by [[US Navy]] aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first [[Kriegsmarine|German]] and, later, [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]]. The principal installation, [[Kindley Air Force Base]] on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated [[Naval Air Station Bermuda]]. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and [[Canadian Forces]] aircraft.

The original [[NAS Bermuda]] on the west side of the island, a [[seaplane]] base until the mid-1960s, was designated as the Naval Air Station Bermuda Annex. It provided optional anchorage and/or dockage facilities for transiting US Navy, [[US Coast Guard]] and [[NATO]] vessels, depending on size. An additional US Navy compound known as [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] (NAVFAC Bermuda), a submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station, was located to the west of the Annex near a Canadian Forces communications facility in the Tudor Hill area; it was converted from a US Army coast artillery bunker in 1954 and operated until 1995. Although leased for 99 years, US forces withdrew in 1995, as part of the wave of base closures following the end of the [[Cold War]].

Canada, which had operated a war-time naval base, [[HMCS Somers Isles|HMCS ''Somers Isles'']], on the old Royal Navy base at Convict Bay, St George's, also established a radio-listening post at Daniel's Head in the West End of the islands during this time.

In the 1950s, after the end of World War II, the Royal Naval dockyard and the military garrison were closed. A small Royal Navy supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the dockyard area, supporting transiting Royal Navy ships and submarines until it, too, was closed in 1995, along with the American and Canadian bases.

Bermudians served in the British armed forces during both [[World War I]] and World War II. After the latter, Major-General [[Glyn Gilbert|Glyn Charles Anglim Gilbert]], Bermuda's highest-ranking soldier, was instrumental in developing the Bermuda Regiment. A number of other Bermudians and their descendants had preceded him into senior ranks, including Bahamian-born Admiral [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Lord Gambier]], and Bermudian-born [[Royal Marines]] Brigadier Harvey. When promoted to brigadier at age 39, following his wounding at the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]], Harvey became the youngest-ever Royal Marine Brigadier. The [[Cenotaph]] in front of the Cabinet Building (in Hamilton) was erected in tribute to Bermuda's Great War dead (the tribute was later extended to Bermuda's Second World War dead) and is the site of the annual [[Remembrance Day]] commemoration.

Today, the only military unit remaining in Bermuda, other than [[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps|naval]] and army cadet corps, is the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units originally formed toward the end of the 19th century. Although the Regiment's predecessors were voluntary units, the modern body is formed primarily by conscription: balloted males are required to serve for three years, two months part-time, once they turn 18.

In early 2020 Bermuda formed the Bermuda Coast Guard. Its 24-hour on-duty service includes search and rescue, counter-narcotics operations, border control, and protection of Bermuda's maritime interests. The Bermuda Coast Guard will interact with the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda Police Service. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.bm/articles/launch-bermuda-coast-guard&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance===
* {{main|Taxation in Bermuda}}

Bermuda is an [[offshore financial centre]], which results from its minimal standards of business regulation/laws and direct [[taxation]] on personal or corporate income. It has one of the highest consumption taxes in the world and taxes all imports in lieu of an income tax system. Bermuda's consumption tax is equivalent to local income tax to local residents and funds government and infrastructure expenditures. The local tax system depends upon import duties, payroll taxes and [[consumption tax]]es. Foreign private individuals cannot easily open bank accounts or subscribe to mobile phone or internet services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://photos.state.gov/libraries/hamilton/19452/pdfs/CCG2011final.pdf |title= US Commercial Service: Doing Business in Bermuda |publisher=Photos.state.gov |date= 15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2020}}

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Bermuda}}
The Bermuda Education Act 1996 requires that only three categories of schools can operate in the Bermuda Education system:{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}
* An ''aided school'' has all or a part of its property vested in a body of trustees or board of governors and is partially maintained by public funding or, since 1965 and the [[desegregation]] of schools, has received a grant-in-aid out of public funds.
* A ''maintained school'' has the whole of its property belonging to the Government and is fully maintained by public funds.
* A ''private school'', not maintained by public funds and which has not, since 1965 and the desegregation of schools, received any capital grant-in-aid out of public funds. The private school sector consists of six traditional private schools, two of which are religious schools, and the remaining four are secular with one of these being a single-gender school and another a [[Montessori method|Montessori school]]. Also, within the private sector there are a number of home schools, which must be registered with the government and receive minimal government regulation. The only boys' school opened its doors to girls in the 1990s, and in 1996, one of the aided schools became a private school.

Prior to 1965, the Bermuda school system was racially segregated.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} When the desegregation of schools was enacted in 1965, two of the formerly maintained &quot;white&quot; schools and both single-sex schools opted to become private schools. The rest became part of the public school system and were either aided or maintained.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

There are 38 schools in the Bermuda Public School System, including 10 preschools, 18 primary schools, 5 middle schools, 2 senior schools ([[The Berkeley Institute]] and [[Cedarbridge Academy]]), 1 school for students with physical and cognitive challenges, and 1 for students with behavioral problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://schools.moed.bm/default.aspx|title=Home – Bermuda Schools|website=schools.moed.bm|access-date=2019-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is one aided primary school, two aided middle schools, and one aided senior school. Portuguese is taught as an optional foreign language in the Bermudian school system.{{ciation needed|date=March 2019}}

For higher education, the [[Bermuda College]] offers various [[associate degrees]] and other certificate programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bermuda College |url=http://www.bercol.bm/ |accessdate=10 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501101116/http://www.bercol.bm/ |archivedate= 1 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda does not have any four-year colleges or universities.

In May 2009, the Bermudian Government's application was approved to become a contributory member of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI). Bermuda's membership enabled Bermudian students to enter the university at an agreed-upon subsidised rate by 2010. UWI also agreed that its [[University of the West Indies Open Campus | Open Campus]] (online degree courses) would become open to Bermudian students in the future, with Bermuda becoming the 13th country to have access to the Open Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bermuda joins the UWI Family |url=https://sta.uwi.edu/news/releases/release.asp?id=280 |website=Campus News |publisher=UWI St. Augustine |accessdate=25 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it was announced that Bermuda would be an &quot;associate contributing country&quot; due to local Bermudan laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UWI welcomes Bermuda as a member country |url=https://sta.uwi.edu/news/releases/release.asp?id=681 |website=Campus News |publisher=UWI St. Augustine |accessdate=25 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Bermuda}}
{{see also|Holidays in Bermuda}}
{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}

Bermuda's culture is a mixture of the various sources of its population: Native American, Spanish-Caribbean, English, Irish, and Scots cultures were evident in the 17th century, and became part of the dominant British culture. English is the primary and official language. Due to 160 years of immigration from Portuguese Atlantic islands (primarily the [[Azores]], though also from [[Madeira]] and the [[Cape Verde Islands]]), a portion of the population also speaks Portuguese. There are strong British influences, together with [[African diaspora|Afro-Caribbean]] ones.

A second wave of immigration from the West Indies was sustained throughout the 20th century; the more recent arrivals have primarily come from English-speaking countries, also bringing aspects of their cultures. This new infusion of West Indians has both accelerated social and political change, and diversified Bermuda's culture.

The first notable, and historically important, book credited to a Bermudian was ''[[Mary Prince#Publication of The History of Mary Prince|The History of Mary Prince]]'', a [[slave narrative]] by [[Mary Prince]]. It is thought to have contributed to the abolition of slavery in the [[British Empire]]. [[Graham Ingham|Ernest Graham Ingham]], an expatriate author, published his books at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century, numerous books were written and published locally, though few were directed at a wider market than Bermuda. (The latter consisted primarily of scholarly works rather than creative writing). The novelist [[Brian Burland]] (1931– 2010) achieved a degree of success and acclaim internationally. More recently, [[Angela Barry]] has won critical recognition for her published fiction.

===Arts===
{{see also|Music of Bermuda}}
Music and dance are an important part of Bermudian culture. West Indian musicians introduced [[calypso music]] when Bermuda's tourist industry was expanded with the increase of visitors brought by post-Second World War aviation. Local icons, [[The Talbot Brothers of Bermuda|The Talbot Brothers]], performed calypso music for many decades both in Bermuda and the United States, and appeared on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]''. While calypso appealed more to tourists than to the local residents, [[reggae]] has been embraced by many Bermudians since the 1970s with the influx of [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrants.
[[File:Gombey dancers from Bermuda2001.jpg|thumb|left|Gombey dancers from Bermuda at the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C.]]
Noted Bermudian musicians include [[tenor|operatic tenor]] Dr. Gary Burgess; jazz pianist [[Lance Hayward]]; singer-songwriter and poet, [[Heather Nova]], and her brother [[Mishka (musician)|Mishka]], reggae musician; classical musician and conductor [[Kenneth Amis]]; and more recently, [[dancehall]] artist [[Collie Buddz]].

The dances of the colourful [[Gombey]] dancers, seen at many events, are strongly influenced by African, Caribbean, Native American and British cultural traditions. In summer 2001, they performed at the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States. These Gombey Dancers continue to showcase their work for locals and visitors during the Harbour Nights festival on Bermuda's Front Street every Wednesday evening (during the summer months) and draw very large crowds.

Bermuda's early literature was limited to the works of non-Bermudian writers commenting on the islands. These included [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith's]] ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' (1624), and [[Edmund Waller]]'s poem, &quot;Battle of the Summer Islands&quot; (1645).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|title=The Battle Of The Summer Islands : Canto 1 – Poem by Edmund Waller|website=poemhunter.com|access-date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008224321/http://www.poemhunter.com/edmund-waller/poems/page-2/Poem|archive-date=8 October 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/217/0304.html|title=The Cambridge History of English and American Literature in 18 Volumes (1907–21), Volume VII.

Bermuda is the only place name in the New World that is alluded to in the works of [[Shakespeare]]; it is mentioned in his play ''[[The Tempest]]'', in Act 1, Scene 2, line 230: &quot;the still-vexed Bermoothes&quot;, this being a reference to the Bermudas.

Local artwork may be viewed at several galleries around Bermuda, and watercolours painted by local artists are also on sale. Alfred Birdsey was one of the more famous and talented watercolourists; his impressionistic landscapes of [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]], and the surrounding sailboats, homes, and bays of Bermuda, are world-renowned. Hand-carved cedar sculptures are another speciality. One such {{convert|7|ft|m|abbr=on}} sculpture, created by Bermudian sculptor Chesley Trott, is installed at the airport's baggage claim area. In 2010, his sculpture ''We Arrive'' was unveiled in Barr's Bay Park, overlooking [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], to commemorate the freeing of slaves in 1835 from the American brig ''[[Enterprise (slave ship)|Enterprise]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20100219/NEWS/302199930|title=If there is a story that has the potential to bring all of us together, then this is the one|date=19 February 2010|author=Amanda Dale|work=[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]|access-date=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local resident Tom Butterfield founded the [[Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art]] in 1986, initially featuring works about Bermuda by artists from other countries. He began with pieces by American artists, such as [[Winslow Homer]], [[Charles Demuth]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], who had lived and worked on Bermuda. He has increasingly supported the development of local artists, arts education, and the arts scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://washington.cbslocal.com/top-lists/tom-butterfield/|title=Tom Butterfield|date=6 July 2011|publisher=[[CBS|CBS DC]]|access-date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the museum opened its new building, constructed within the [[Bermuda Botanical Gardens|Botanical Gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bermudamasterworks.com/|title=Masterworks Museum of Bermuda Art – official website|website=www.bermudamasterworks.org|access-date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bermuda hosts an annual international film festival, which shows many independent films. One of the founders is film producer and director [[Arthur Rankin, Jr.]], co-founder of the [[Rankin/Bass]] production company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biff.bm/|title=Bermuda International Film Festival – official website|website=www.biff.bm|access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{main|Sports and recreation in Bermuda}}

[[File:95_Coy_RGA_team_and_Governor%27s_Cup_in_Bermuda_1917.jpg|thumb|The football team of 95 Company, [[Royal Garrison Artillery]], victors in the 1917 Governor's Cup football match, pose with the cup. The cup was contested for annually by teams from annually by teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units stationed in Bermuda.]]

Many sports popular today were formalised by British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public schools]] and universities in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the [[British empire]], and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to think and act as part of a team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as [[the Football Association]] (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players. The [[Bermuda national football team]] managed to qualify to the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the country's first ever major football competition.

The professionals soon displaced the amateur ex-Public schoolboys. Bermuda's role as the primary Royal Navy base in the Western Hemisphere, with an army garrison to match, ensured that the naval and military officers quickly introduced the newly formalised sports to Bermuda, including [[cricket]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby football]], and even [[Lawn tennis|tennis]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] (rowing did not adapt well from British rivers to the stormy Atlantic. The officers soon switched to [[Yacht racing|sail racing]], founding the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]]). Once these sports reached Bermuda, they were eagerly adopted by Bermudians.

[[Bermuda national cricket team|Bermuda's national cricket team]] participated in the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]] in the West Indies. Their most famous player is a {{convert|130|kg}} police officer named [[Dwayne Leverock]]. But India defeated Bermuda and set a record of 413 runs in a [[One-Day International]] (ODI). Bermuda were knocked out of the World Cup. Also very well known is [[David Hemp]], a former captain of [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] in [[List of current first-class cricket teams#England and Wales|English first class cricket]]. The annual &quot;Cup Match&quot; cricket tournament between rival parishes St George's in the east and Somerset in the west is the occasion for a popular national holiday. This tournament began in 1872 when Captain Moresby of the Royal Navy introduced the game to Bermuda, holding a match at Somerset to mark ''forty years since the unjust thraldom of slavery''. The East End versus West End rivalry resulted from the locations of the ''St. George's Garrison'' (the original army headquarters in Bermuda) on Barrack Hill, St. George's, and the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Ireland Island. Moresby founded the Somerset Cricket Club which plays the St. George's Cricket Club in this game (the membership of both clubs has long been mostly civilian).&lt;ref&gt;Stranack&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Bermuda hosted the 25th [[PGA Grand Slam of Golf]]. This 36-hole event was held on 16–17 October 2007, at the [[Mid Ocean Club]] in Tucker's Town. This season-ending tournament is limited to four golfers: the winners of the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]], [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]]. The event returned to Bermuda in 2008 and 2009. One-armed Bermudian golfer [[Quinn Talbot]] was both the United States National Amputee Golf Champion for five successive years and the British World One-Arm Golf Champion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oceanviewgolfclub.com/staff/ Ocean View Golf Course Staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:International One Design - Hamilton Harbour - Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An [[International One Design|IOD]] racer on a mooring in [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]]]]
The Government announced in 2006 that it would provide substantial financial support to Bermuda's cricket and [[Bermuda national football team|football]] teams. Football did not become popular with Bermudians 'til after the [[Second World War]], though teams from the various Royal Navy, British Army [[Bermuda Garrison]], and Royal Air Force units of Bermuda had competed annually for the Governor's Cup introduced by Major-General Sir [[George Bullock (British Army officer)|George Mackworth Bullock]] in 1913. A combined team of the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] (BMA) and the [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] (BMI) defeated {{HMS|Malabar|shore establishment|6}} to win the cup on 21 March 1943, becoming the first team of a locally raised unit to do so, and the third British Army team to do so since 1926.&lt;ref&gt;''Bermuda Militia Win Governor's Football Cup''. The Recorder. Page 1. City of Hamilton, Bermuda. 24th of March, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Bermuda's most prominent footballers are [[Clyde Best]], [[Shaun Goater]], [[Kyle Lightbourne]], [[Reggie Lambe]], [[Sam Nusum]] and [[Nahki Wells]]. In 2006, the [[Bermuda Hogges]] were formed as the nation's first professional football team to raise the standard of play for the Bermuda national football team. The team played in the [[United Soccer Leagues Second Division]] but folded in 2013.

[[Sailing]], [[fishing]] and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports are popular with both residents and visitors alike. The prestigious [[Bermuda Race|Newport–Bermuda Yacht Race]] is a more than 100-year-old tradition, with boats racing between [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and Bermuda. In 2007, the 16th biennial [[Marion, Massachusetts|Marion]]-Bermuda yacht race occurred. A sport unique to Bermuda is racing the [[Bermuda Fitted Dinghy]]. [[International One Design]] racing also originated in Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iodfleet.bm/ |title=Bermuda International One Design Fleet |publisher=Iodfleet.bm |accessdate =20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, Bermuda's bid to host the [[2017 America's Cup]] was announced.

At the [[Bermuda at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics]], Bermuda competed in sailing, athletics, swimming, diving, triathlon and equestrian events. In those Olympics, Bermuda's Katura Horton-Perinchief made history by becoming the first black female diver to compete in the Olympic Games. Bermuda has had one Olympic medallist, [[Clarence Hill (boxer)|Clarence Hill]], who won a bronze medal in boxing. Bermuda also competed in Men's [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy. Patrick Singleton placed 19th, with a final time of 1:59.81. [[Jillian Teceira]] competed in the Beijing Olympics in 2008. It is tradition for Bermuda to march in the Opening Ceremony in [[Bermuda shorts]], regardless of the summer or winter Olympic celebration. Bermuda also competes in the biennial [[Island Games]], which it hosted in 2013.

In 1998, Bermuda established its own Basketball Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/FIBA/fibaStru/nfLeag/nfProf.asp?nationalFederationNumber=4697 FIBA National Federations | Bermuda], fiba.com.

==Healthcare==
The [[Bermuda Hospitals Board]] operates the King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, located in [[Paget Parish]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic Wellness Institute]], located in [[Devonshire Parish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bermudahospitals.bm/bhb/about-us/contact-us.asp &quot;Contact Us&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206182010/http://www.bermudahospitals.bm/bhb/about-us/contact-us.asp |date=6 December 2012 }}. Bermuda Hospitals Board. Retrieved 4 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Boston's Lahey Medical Center has an established visiting specialists program on the island which provides Bermudians and expats with access to specialists regularly on the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  There were about 6,000 hospital admissions, 30,000 emergency department attendances and 6,300 outpatient procedures in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hospital reveals harm figures |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/health/article/20180706/hospital-reveals-harm-figures |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Royal Gazette |date=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other territories that still remain under British rule, Bermuda does not have [[National health insurance|national healthcare]]. Employers must provide a healthcare plan and pay for up to 50% of the cost for each employee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Healthcare&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bermuda Healthcare costs|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/healthcare.htm|author=Keith Archibald Forbes|website=bermuda-online.org/healthcare|access-date=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare is a mandatory requirement and is expensive, even with the help provided by employers, though no more expensive than that which an employee in the US would typically pay for healthcare when obtained through their employer{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and the coverage typically far exceeds that which one may have through their employer in the US{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}. There are only a few approved healthcare providers that offer insurance to Bermudians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Healthcare&quot;/&gt; In 2016 these were the Bermudian government's Health Insurance Department, three other approved licensed health insurance companies, and three approved health insurance schemes (provided by the Bermudian government for its employees and by two banks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licensed and Approved Health Insurers|url=http://www.bhec.bm/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2016-Website-Notice.pdf|accessdate=2 January 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804064956/http://www.bhec.bm/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/2016-Website-Notice.pdf|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no [[paramedic]]s on the island.  The Bermuda Hospitals Board says that they were not vital in Bermuda because of its small size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Call for paramedics to save lives on island |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/drive-for-change/article/20181022/call-for-paramedics-to-save-lives-on-island |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Royal Gazette |date=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Nurse practitioner]]s on the island, of which there are not many, can be granted authority to write prescriptions “under the authority of a medical practitioner”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nurse can write prescriptions |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/health/article/20180925/nurse-can-write-prescriptions |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=Royal Gazette |date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
