The '''Bromeliales''' is the [[botanical name]] of an [[Order (biology)|order]] of [[flowering plants]].  Such an order has been recognized by a few [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|systems]] of plant taxonomy, with a various placement.  It appears that it always has had the same [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]]: 
consisting only of the family [[Bromeliaceae]], the bromeliad or [[pineapple]] family.  The order is not recognized in the [[APG II system]], of 2003, which places the plants involved in the order [[Poales]]. Some examples are:

* The [[Cronquist system]] of 1981 placed this order in subclass [[Zingiberidae]], of class [[Liliopsida]] [=monocotyledons].
* The [[Thorne system (1992)]] placed the order in superorder [[Commelinanae]] in subclass [[Liliidae]] [=monocotyledons].
* The [[Dahlgren system]] placed the order in superorder Bromeliiflorae (also known as Bromelianae) in subclass [[Liliidae]]  [=monocotyledons] together with five other orders.
* The [[Engler system]], in its update of 1964, placed the order in class [[Monocotyledoneae]].
