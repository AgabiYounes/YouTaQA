      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Violin Sonata No. 5''' in [[F major]], Opus 24, is a [[violin sonata]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. It is often known as the &quot;Spring Sonata&quot; (''Frühlingssonate''), and was published in [[1801 in music|1801]]. It was dedicated to [[Count Moritz von Fries]], a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the [[String Quintet, Op. 29 (Beethoven)|C major string quintet]] and the [[Violin Sonata No. 4 (Beethoven)|fourth violin sonata]]—as well as his later [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|seventh symphony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lvbeethoven.com/Oeuvres/ListOpus.html|title=Beethoven's music with Opus number|website=Ludwig van Beethoven's website|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The work is in four movements:

#''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]''
#''[[Adagio (music)|Adagio]] molto espressivo''
#''[[Scherzo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] molto''
#''[[Rondo]]: [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] ma non troppo''

The ''Scherzo'' and its trio are particularly brief. The entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform. The name &quot;Spring Sonata&quot; was given to it after Beethoven's death.

The ''Allegro'' movement is featured in the stage show ''[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]'' and in the syllabus of grade 8 of [[ABRSM]]'s bowed strings exam from 2016 till 2019.{{cn|date=August 2019}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://us.abrsm.org/media/62976/violincomplete16.pdf|title=ABRSM Bowed Strings Syllabus 2016–2019|last=|first=|date=2016|website=ABRSM|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While reviewing the [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|cpo]] recording of composer [[Ferdinand Ries]]'s violin sonatas Op. 8 No. 1, Op. 16, No. 2 and Op. 71, Jonathan Woolf commented that the Op. 8 No. 1 sonata was heavily inspired by this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woolf|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
