[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Opus number|Opus]] 1 is a set of three [[piano trio]]s (written for [[piano]], [[violin]], and [[cello]]), first performed in 1795 in the house of [[Karl Alois Johann-Nepomuk Vinzenz, Fürst Lichnowsky|Prince Lichnowsky]], to whom they are dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-about-beethoven.com/trios.html Beethoven's Trios for string instruments, wind instruments and for mixed ones.] All About Beethoven. Retrieved 2011-12-10&lt;/ref&gt; The trios were published in 1795.

Despite the Op. 1 designation, these trios were not Beethoven's first published compositions{{cn|date=January 2018}}; this 
distinction belongs rather to his ''Dressler Variations'' for keyboard (WoO 63). Clearly he recognized the Op. 1  compositions as the earliest ones he had produced that were substantial enough (and marketable enough) to fill out a first major publication to introduce his style of writing to the musical public.  

==Op. 1 No. 1 - Piano Trio No. 1 in E-flat major==
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] (E-flat major), {{music|time|4|4}}
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Adagio]] cantabile ([[A-flat major]]), {{music|time|3|4}}
* [[Scherzo]]. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] assai (E-flat major, with  trio in A-flat major), {{music|time|3|4}}
* [[Finale (music)|Finale]]. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Presto]] (E-flat major), {{music|time|2|4}}

The first movement opens with a similar figure to that of the third movement of [[Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)|Mozart's 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Piano Concerto]].

==Op. 1 No. 2 - Piano Trio No. 2 in G major==
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Adagio]], {{music|time|3|4}} - [[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] vivace, {{music|time|2|4}} (G major)
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Largo]] con espressione ([[E major]]), {{music|time|6|8}}
* [[Scherzo]]. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] (G major, with a trio in [[B minor]]), {{music|time|3|4}}
* [[Finale (music)|Finale]]. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Presto]] (G major), {{music|time|2|4}}

==Op. 1 No. 3 - Piano Trio No. 3 in C minor==
* [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Allegro]] con brio (C minor), {{music|time|3|4}}
* [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]] cantabile con [[variation (music)|Variazioni]] (E-flat major), {{music|time|2|4}}
* [[Minuet]]to. Quasi [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|allegro]] (C minor, with a trio in [[C major]]), {{music|time|3|4}}
* [[Finale (music)|Finale]]. [[Tempo#Italian_tempo_markings|Prestissimo]] (C minor, concluding in C major), {{music|time|2|2}}

Unlike the other piano trios in this opus, the third trio does not have a scherzo as its third movement but a [[minuet]] instead.

This third piano trio was later reworked by Beethoven into the [[String Quintet, Op. 104 (Beethoven)|C minor string quintet, Op. 104]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/tw.asp?w=W12408 String Quintet in C minor, Op. 104.] Hyperion Records. Retrieved 2011-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;
