The '''British Virgin Islands''' (abbreviated '''BVI'''),&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vi.html |title=CIA World Factbook- British Virgin Islands|accessdate= 13 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; officially simply the '''Virgin Islands''',&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1678/pdfs/uksi_20071678_en.pdf Virgin Islands Constitution Order, 2007]'', the territory's official name is simply 'Virgin Islands'.&lt;/ref&gt; are a [[British Overseas Territory]] in the [[Caribbean]], to the east of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[United States Virgin Islands|US Virgin Islands]] and north-west of [[Anguilla]]. The islands are geographically part of the [[Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands archipelago]] and are located in the [[Leeward Islands]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and part of the West Indies.

The British Virgin Islands consist of the main islands of [[Tortola]], [[Virgin Gorda]], [[Anegada]], and [[Jost Van Dyke]], along with over 50 other smaller islands and [[cay]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/British-Virgin-Islands |title=Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI |accessdate= 13 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 16 of the islands are inhabited.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; The capital, [[Road Town]], is on Tortola, the largest island, which is about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide. The islands had a population of about 28,000 at the 2010 Census, of whom approximately 23,500 lived on Tortola;&lt;ref name=ReferenceB /&gt; current estimates put the population at 35,802 (July 2018).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

British Virgin Islanders are [[British Overseas Territories citizen]]s and since 2002 are [[British citizen]]s as well.

==Etymology==
The islands were named &quot;Santa Úrsula y las Once Mil Vírgenes&quot; by [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 after the legend of [[Saint Ursula]] and the 11,000 virgins.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; The name was later shortened to &quot;the Virgin Islands&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

The official name of the territory is still simply the &quot;Virgin Islands&quot;, but the prefix &quot;British&quot; is often used. This is commonly believed to distinguish it from the neighbouring American territory which changed its name from the &quot;[[Danish West Indies]]&quot; to &quot;[[Virgin Islands of the United States]]&quot; in 1917. However, local historians have disputed this, pointing to a variety of publications and public records dating from between 21 February 1857 and 12 September 1919 where the Territory is referred to as the ''British'' Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name=Moll&gt;{{cite news |last=Moll |first=Peter |date=15 December 2016 |title=Victorian news mined for VI history |url= |newspaper=[[BVI Beacon]] |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; British Virgin Islands government publications continue to begin with the name &quot;The territory of the Virgin Islands&quot;, and [[British Virgin Islands passport|the territory's passports]] simply refer to the &quot;Virgin Islands&quot;, and all laws begin with the words &quot;Virgin Islands&quot;. Moreover, the territory's Constitutional Commission has expressed the view that &quot;every effort should be made&quot; to encourage the use of the name &quot;Virgin Islands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bvi.gov.vg/content/about-territory|title=About the Territory|publisher=Government of the Virgin Islands|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But various public and quasi-public bodies continue to use the name &quot;British Virgin Islands&quot; or &quot;BVI&quot;, including BVI Finance, BVI Electricity Corporation, BVI Tourist Board, BVI Athletic Association, [[BVI Bar Association]] and others.

In 1968 the British Government issued a memorandum requiring that the postage stamps in the territory should say &quot;British Virgin Islands&quot; (whereas previously they had simply stated &quot;Virgin Islands&quot;), a practice which is still followed today.&lt;ref name=Moll /&gt; This was likely to prevent confusion following on from the adoption of US currency in the Territory in 1959, and the references to US currency on the stamps of the Territory.

==History==
{{Main|History of the British Virgin Islands}}

It is generally thought that the Virgin Islands were first settled by the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] from South America around 100 BC-200 AD, though there is some evidence of [[Amerindian]] presence on the islands as far back as 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Samuel M. ed. ''The Indigenous People of the Caribbean''. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8130-1692-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bvi.gov.vg/content/our-history |title=Government of the Virgin Islands - Our History|accessdate= 13 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arawaks inhabited the islands until the 15th century when they were displaced by the more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], a tribe from the [[Lesser Antilles]] islands.

The first European sighting of the Virgin Islands was by the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1493 on his second voyage to the Americas, who gave the islands their modern name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt;

The [[Spanish Empire]] claimed the islands by discovery in the early 16th century, but never settled them, and subsequent years saw the English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and Danish all jostling for control of the region, which became a notorious haunt for [[Piracy in the British Virgin Islands|pirates]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; There is no record of any native Amerindian population in the British Virgin Islands during this period; it is thought that they either fled to safer islands or were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt;

The Dutch established a [[Dutch Virgin Islands|permanent settlement]] on the island of [[Tortola]] by 1648,&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; frequently clashing with the Spanish who were based on nearby Puerto Rico. In 1672, the English captured Tortola from the Dutch, and the English annexation of [[Anegada]] and [[Virgin Gorda]] followed in 1680.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Meanwhile, over the period 1672–1733, the Danish gained control of the nearby islands of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] and [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]] (i.e. the modern US Virgin Islands).

[[File:St Phillips Church, Tortola.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of [[St. Phillip's Anglican Church (BVI)|St. Phillip's Church, Tortola]], one of the most important historical ruins in the territory]]
The British islands were considered principally a strategic possession. The British introduced [[sugar cane]] which was to become the main crop and source of foreign trade, and large numbers of [[Slavery in the British Virgin Islands|slaves]] were forcibly brought from Africa to work on the sugar cane plantations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; The islands prospered economically until the middle of the nineteenth century, when a combination of the [[abolition of slavery]] in the British Empire in 1834, a series of disastrous hurricanes, and the growth in the [[sugar beet]] crop in Europe and the United States&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, a major market for sugar from the Territory, the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846]] also created a considerable downward effect on the price of Caribbean sugar cane.&lt;/ref&gt; significantly reduced sugar cane production and led to a period of economic decline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt;

In 1917, the United States purchased the [[Danish Virgin Islands]] for US$25 million, renaming them the [[United States Virgin Islands]]. Economic linkages with the US islands prompted the British Virgin Islands to adopt the US dollar as its currency in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

The British Virgin Islands were administered variously as part of the [[British Leeward Islands]] or with [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], with an administrator representing the British Government on the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; The islands gained separate colony status in 1960 and became autonomous in 1967 under the new post of Chief Minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; Since the 1960s, the islands have diversified away from their traditionally agriculture-based economy towards tourism and financial services, becoming one of the wealthiest areas in the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; The constitution of the islands was amended in 1977, 2004 and 2007, giving them greater local autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt;

In 2017 [[Hurricane Irma]] [[Effects of Hurricane Irma in the British Virgin Islands|struck the islands]], causing four deaths and immense damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/americas/caribbean-reacts-hurricane-irma/index.html|title=Don't forget about us: Irma's desperate Caribbean survivors|author=Eliza Mackintosh and Donie O'Sullivan|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the British Virgin Islands}}
[[File:GB Virgin Islands.png|thumb|upright=2.25|Map of the British Virgin Islands (Note: Anegada is farther away from the other islands than shown)]]

The British Virgin Islands comprise around 60 tropical Caribbean islands, ranging in size from the largest, Tortola, being {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, to tiny uninhabited [[islet]]s, altogether about {{convert|150|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} in extent. They are located in the [[Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands archipelago]], a few miles east of the [[US Virgin Islands]], and about {{convert|95|km|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] mainland. About {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=on}} east south-east lies [[Anguilla]]. The [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] lies to the east of the islands, and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lies to the west. Most of the islands are volcanic in origin and have a hilly, rugged terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; The highest point is [[Mount Sage]] on Tortola at 521m.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; Anegada is geologically distinct from the rest of the group, being a flat island composed of limestone and coral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of the British Virgin Islands}}
{{wide image|British Virgin Islands WV banner.jpg|1000px}}

The British Virgin Islands have a [[tropical rainforest climate]], moderated by [[trade winds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; Temperatures vary little throughout the year. In the capital, [[Road Town]], typical daily maxima are around {{convert|32|°C|1}} in the summer and {{convert|29|°C|1}} in the winter. Typical daily minima are around {{convert|24|°C|1}} in the summer and {{convert|21|°C|1}} in the winter. Rainfall averages about {{convert|1150|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year, higher in the hills and lower on the coast. Rainfall can be quite variable, but the wettest months on average are September to November and the driest months on average are February and March.

[[File:Old LegCo Building, Road Town.jpg|right|thumb|Legislative Council building in [[Road Town]]. The High Court sits upstairs.]]
The territory operates as a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; Ultimate executive authority in the British Virgin Islands is vested in [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], and is exercised on her behalf by the [[Governor of the British Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; The governor is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the [[British Government|British government]]. Defence and most foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

The [[Constitution of the British Virgin Islands|most recent constitution]] was adopted in 2007 (the Virgin Islands Constitution Order, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1678/pdfs/uksiem_20071678_en.pdf|title=Explanatory Memorandum to the Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/1678/contents/made|title=The Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came into force when the [[Legislative Council of the British Virgin Islands|Legislative Council]] was dissolved for the [[British Virgin Islands general election, 2007|2007 general election]]. The head of government under the constitution is the [[Premier of the British Virgin Islands|Premier]] (before the new constitution the office was referred to as [[Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands|Chief Minister]]), who is elected in a general election along with the other members of the ruling government as well as the members of the opposition. [[Elections in the British Virgin Islands|Elections]] are held roughly every four years. A [[Cabinet of the British Virgin Islands|cabinet]] is nominated by the Premier and appointed and chaired by the Governor. The Legislature consists of the Queen (represented by the Governor) and a [[unicameral]] [[House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands|House of Assembly]] made up of 13 elected members plus the [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands|Speaker]] and the [[Attorney General of the British Virgin Islands|Attorney General]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt;

The current Governor is [[Augustus Jaspert]] (since 22 August 2017).&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; The current Premier is [[Andrew Fahie]] (since 26 February 2019), who is leader of the ruling [[Virgin Islands Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

===Subdivisions===
{{Main|Districts of the British Virgin Islands}}
The British Virgin Islands is a unitary territory. The territory is divided into nine electoral districts, and each voter is registered in one of those districts.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Eight of the nine districts are partly or wholly on Tortola, and encompass nearby neighbouring islands. Only the ninth district (Virgin Gorda and Anegada) does not include any part of Tortola. At elections, in addition to voting their local representative, voters also cast votes for four &quot;at-large&quot; candidates who are elected upon a territory-wide basis.

The territory is also technically divided into five administrative districts (one for each of the four largest islands, with the fifth covering all other islands), and into six civil registry districts (three for Tortola, Jost Van Dyke, Virgin Gorda and Anegada) although these have little practical relevance.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

As a British Overseas territory, defence of the islands is the responsibility of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the British Virgin Islands}}
[[File:Roadtown, Tortola.jpg|right|thumb|[[Road Town]], Tortola, British Virgin Islands]]

The twin pillars of the economy are financial services (60%) and tourism (roughly 40-45% of GDP).&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bviplatinum.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.bviplatinum.com/news.php?module=news&amp;page=Article&amp;articleID=1268586|title=New Company Incorporations Down But Premier Remains Optimistic|date=14 March 2010|accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vi.html|title=CIA World Factbook- British Virgin Islands|accessdate=13 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/British-Virgin-Islands|title=Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI|accessdate=13 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, tourism is the more important of the two, as it employs a greater number of people within the territory, and a larger proportion of the businesses in the tourist industry are locally owned, as are a number of the highly tourism-dependent sole traders (for example, taxi drivers and street vendors).{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=I suspect they would not survive without offshore services.}}

Economically however, financial services associated with the territory's status as an offshore financial center are by far the more important.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=}} 51.8% of the Government's revenue comes directly from licence fees for offshore companies, and considerable further sums are raised directly or indirectly from payroll taxes relating to salaries paid within the trust industry sector (which tend to be higher on average than those paid in the tourism sector).{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=}}

The official currency of the British Virgin Islands has been the [[United States dollar]] (US$) since 1959, the currency also used by the [[United States Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

Deemed by some to be a [[tax haven]] due to its opaque banking system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islands resent crackdown of the tax havens by G-20|url=http://www.timesherald.com/articles/2009/05/09/business/doc4a04ef4f516e1869586320.txt|first=Ben |last= Fox|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date= 2009-05-09 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090515010825/http://www.timesherald.com/articles/2009/05/09/business/doc4a04ef4f516e1869586320.txt |archive-date= 2009-05-15 |access-date=2016-04-02 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smh2013&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.smh.com.au/business/leighton-holdings-linked-to-corrupt-fees-for-iraq-pipeline-contracts-20131117-2xp8b.html |title= Leighton Holdings linked to 'corrupt' fees for Iraq pipeline contracts |work= [[The Australian]] |first1= Nick |last1= McKenzie |first2= Richard |last2= Baker |date= 2013-11-18 |accessdate= 2016-04-02}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British Virgin Islands enjoys one of the more prosperous economies of the Caribbean region, with a per capita average income of around $42,300 (2010 est.) &lt;ref&gt;CIA.

Retrieved 25 December. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The average monthly income earned by a worker in the territory was US$2,452 as at the time of the 2010 Census.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; 29% of the population fell into the &quot;low income&quot; category.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Although it is common to hear criticism in the British Virgin Islands' press about [[List of countries by income equality|income inequality]], no serious attempt has been made by economists to calculate a [[Gini coefficient]] or similar measure of income equality for the territory.  A report from 2000 suggested that, despite the popular perception, income inequality was actually lower in the British Virgin Islands than in any other [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States|OECS state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=European Bloc Imperialism|author=Dennis C.

===Tourism===
[[File:TheBaths VirginGorda BVI.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Baths]], Virgin Gorda]]

Tourism accounts for approximately 45% of national income.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bviplatinum.com&quot;/&gt; The islands are a popular destination for US citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;www2.bviplatinum.com&quot;/&gt; Tourists frequent the numerous white sand beaches, visit [[The Baths|The Baths on Virgin Gorda]], [[Snorkeling|snorkel]] the [[coral reef]]s near Anegada, or experience the well-known bars of Jost Van Dyke. The BVI are known as one of the world's greatest sailing destinations, and charter sailboats are a very popular way to visit less accessible islands. Every year since 1972 the BVI has hosted the Spring Regatta, which is a seven-day collection of sailing races throughout the islands.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} A substantial number of the tourists who visit the BVI are [[cruise ship]] passengers, and although they produce far lower revenue per head than charter boat tourists and hotel based tourists, they are nonetheless important to the substantial - and politically important - taxi driving community. Only Virgin Islanders are permitted to work as taxi drivers.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Financial services===
Financial services account for over half of the income of the territory. The majority of this revenue is generated by the licensing of [[offshore company|offshore companies]] and related services. The British Virgin Islands is a significant global player in the [[offshore financial centre|offshore financial services industry]]. In 2000 [[KPMG]] reported in its survey of [[Tax haven|offshore jurisdictions]] for the United Kingdom government that over 45% of the world's offshore companies were formed in the British Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Review of Financial Regulation in the Crown Dependencies (Cmnd Paper 4855 of 2000) |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-financial-regulation-in-the-crown-dependencies--2 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] |at=Part III, paragraph 1.3 |isbn=0-10-148554-9 |accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2001, financial services in the British Virgin Islands have been regulated by the independent [[British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission|Financial Services Commission]].

As such the British Virgin Islands is frequently labelled as a &quot;[[tax haven]]&quot; by campaigners and NGOs,&lt;ref name= GuardianNov2012 /&gt; and has been expressly named in anti-tax haven legislation in other countries on various occasions.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the [[Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Successive governments in the British Virgin Islands have fought against the tax haven label, and made various commitments to tax exchange and recording beneficial ownership information of companies following the [[39th G8 summit|2013 G8 summit]].  On 10 September 2013 British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] said &quot;I do not think it is fair any longer to refer to any of the Overseas Territories or Crown Dependencies as tax havens.  They have taken action to make sure that they have fair and open tax systems.  It is very important that our focus should now shift to those territories and countries that really are tax havens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international-adviser.com/news/tax---regulation/jersey-guernsey-iom-revel-in|title=Jersey, Guernsey, IoM revel in Cameron's 'not tax havens' comments|author=International Adviser|date=12 September 2013|access-date=17 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117144834/http://www.international-adviser.com/news/tax---regulation/jersey-guernsey-iom-revel-in|archive-date=17 November 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-isle-of-man-24034768|title=David Cameron: Crown dependency tax haven banner 'not fair'|author=BBC News|date=10 September 2013|author-link=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act====
On June 30, 2014, The British Virgin Islands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA.aspx|title=Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)|website=www.treasury.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; was deemed to have an Inter- Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States of America with respect to  the &quot;Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act&quot; of the United States of America.

The Model 1 Agreement (14 Pages)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/FATCA-Agreement-BVI-6-30-2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes that: ''The Government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland provided a copy of the Letter of Entrustment which was sent to the Government of the British Virgin Islands, to the Government of the United States of America &quot;via diplomatic note of May 28, 2014&quot;.''

The Letter of Entrustment dated July 14, 2010 was originally provided to the Government of the British Virgin Islands and authorised the Government of the BVI &quot;to negotiate and conclude Agreements relating to taxation that provide for exchange of information on tax matters to the OECD standard&quot; (Paragraph 2 of the FATCA Agreement). Via an &quot;Entrustment Letter&quot; dated March 24, 2014, The Govt of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, authorized the Govt of the BVI to sign an agreement on information exchange to facilitate the Implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/FATCA-Agreement-BVI-6-30-2014.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 27, 2017, the US Treasury site disclosed that the Model 1 agreement and related agreement were &quot;In Force&quot; on July 13, 2015.

====Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act====
Under the UK Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2018, beneficial ownership of companies in British overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands must be publicly registered for disclosure by 31 December 2020.&lt;ref name=kmppvap&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/law/overseas-territories-to-fight-public-register-demands/5066370.article|title=Overseas territories to fight public register demands|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Government of the British Virgin Islands plans to challenge this law, arguing that it violates the Constitutional sovereignty granted to the islands.&lt;ref name=kmppvap /&gt;

===Agriculture and industry===
Agriculture and industry account for only a small proportion of the islands' GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt; Agricultural produce includes fruit, vegetables, sugar cane, livestock and poultry, and industries include rum distillation, construction and boat building. Commercial fishing is also practised in the islands' waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt;

The British Virgin Islands is heavily dependent on migrant workers, and over 50% of all workers on the islands are of a foreign descent. Only 37% of the entire population were born in the territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; The national labour-force is estimated at 12,770, of whom approximately 59.4% work in the service sector but less than 0.6% are estimated to work in agriculture (the balance working in industry).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bcg.thetimes.co.uk/North_America/British_Virgin_Islands#workforce|title=British Virgin Islands – workforce|author=The Times|accessdate=2012-03-19|author-link=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;/&gt;

==Education==
{{main|Education in the British Virgin Islands}}
The British Virgin Islands operates several government schools as well as private schools. There is also a community college, [[H. Lavity Stoutt Community College]], that is located on the eastern end of Tortola. This college was named after [[Lavity Stoutt]], the first Chief Minister of the British Virgin Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvi.gov.vg/products.asp?iProd=35&amp;iCat=12&amp;hierarchy=0 British Virgin Islands Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723081334/http://www.bvi.gov.vg/products.asp?iProd=35&amp;iCat=12&amp;hierarchy=0 |date=23 July 2009 }}, BVI Government website&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely common for students from the British Virgin Islands to travel overseas for tertiary education, either to the [[University of the West Indies]], or to colleges and universities in either the United Kingdom, United States or Canada.

The literacy rate in the British Virgin Islands is high at 98%.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Times&quot;/&gt;

There is a [[University of the West Indies]] Open campus in the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open.uwi.edu/british_virgin_islands|title=The Open Campus in British Virgin Islands - Open Campus|website=open.uwi.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Virgin Islands}}

===Language===
{{Main|Virgin Islands Creole}}
The primary language is [[English language|British English]], although there is a local [[Virgin Islands Creole|dialect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopedia Britannica - BVI&quot;/&gt; Spanish is spoken by [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[People of the Dominican Republic|Dominican]] and other Hispanic immigrants.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of the Virgin Islands}}

The traditional music of the British Virgin Islands is called ''fungi'' after the local [[cornmeal]] dish with the same name, often made with [[okra]]. The special sound of fungi is due to a unique local fusion between African and European music. It functions as a medium of local history and folklore and is therefore a cherished cultural form of expression that is part of the curriculum in BVI schools.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The fungi bands, also called &quot;scratch bands&quot;, use instruments ranging from [[calabash]], washboard, [[Bongo drum|bongos]] and [[ukulele]], to more traditional western instruments like keyboard, banjo, guitar, bass, triangle and saxophone. Apart from being a form of festive dance music, fungi often contains humorous social commentaries, as well as BVI oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Penn, Dexter J.A. [http://dexterpenn.smugmug.com/gallery/4068409 Music of the British Virgin Islands: Fungi] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120526214319/http://dexterpenn.smugmug.com/gallery/4068409 |date=26 May 2012 }}. Retrieved 13 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
{{See also|Cricket in the West Indies}}
Because of its location and climate the British Virgin Islands has long been a haven for sailing enthusiasts. Sailing is regarded as one of the foremost sports in all of the BVI. Calm waters and steady breezes provide some of the best sailing conditions in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Best Sailing|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/caribbean/0217020116.html|accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sailing events are held in the waters of this country, the largest of which is a week-long series of races called the Spring Regatta, the premier sailing event of the Caribbean, with several races hosted each day. Boats include everything from full-size mono-hull yachts to dinghies. Captains and their crews come from all around the world to attend these races. The Spring Regatta is part race, part party, part festival. The Spring Regatta is normally held during the first week of April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vacationtortola.com/Yacht-Races.html|title=Yacht Races|work=vacationtortola.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the BVI have made a name for themselves as a host of international basketball events. The BVI hosted three of the last four events of the [[Caribbean Basketball Championship]] (''FIBA CBC Championship'').{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}
