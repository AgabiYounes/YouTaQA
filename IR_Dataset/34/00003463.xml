[[Sarajevo]] is the capital and largest city.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is almost an [[landlocked country]] – to the south it has a narrow coast on the [[Adriatic Sea]], about {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} long and surrounding the town of [[Neum]]. It is bordered by [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, and [[Croatia]] surrounding north and southwest. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and the northeast predominantly flatland. The inland, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, [[Herzegovina]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and mostly mountainous topography.

Bosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], it was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence of the Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995]].

[[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has grown at double digit rates in recent years. Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural environment and [[Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cultural heritage]] inherited from six historical civilizations, its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine|cuisine]], [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina#Winter sports|winter sports]], its eclectic and unique [[Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina|music]], [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|architecture]], and its [[Sarajevo#Festivals|festivals]], some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sff.ba/content.php/en/festival?set_culture=en |title=About the Sarajevo Film Festival|publisher=Sarajevo Film Festival Official Website|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104133828/http://www.sff.ba/content.php/en/festival?set_culture=en|archivedate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidefilm.com/europe.html|title=Inside Film's Guide to Film Festivals|publisher=Inside Film|accessdate=12 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115154359/http://www.insidefilm.com/europe.html|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to three main ethnic groups or, officially, [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]], as specified in the constitution. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest group of the three, with [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] second, and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] third. A native of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, is usually identified in English as a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]]. Minorities, defined [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|under the constitutional nomenclature &quot;Others&quot;]], include [[Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jews]], [[Romani people in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]], [[National minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Poles, Ukrainians, and Turks]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]], with a third unit, the [[Brčko District]], governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of 10 [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]].

==Etymology==
The first preserved widely acknowledged mention of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] is in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', a politico-geographical handbook written by the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] in the mid-10th century (between 948 and 952) describing the &quot;small land&quot; (χωρίον in [[Greek language|Greek]]) of &quot;Bosona&quot; (Βοσώνα).&lt;ref name=&quot;Moravcsik-153&quot;&gt;{{cite book|edition=Moravcsik, Gyula|author=Constantine VII''Porphyrogenitus''|authorlink=Constantine VII|date=1993|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies|title=[[De Administrando Imperio]]|location=Washington D.C.|pages=153–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is believed to have derived from the [[hydronym]] of the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] coursing through the Bosnian heartland. According to philologist Anton Mayer the name ''Bosna'' could derive from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] *&quot;Bass-an-as&quot;), which would derive from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;bos&quot; or &quot;bogh&quot;—meaning &quot;the running water&quot;.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} According to English medievalist [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]] the Slavic settlers in Bosnia &quot;adapted the Latin designation [...] Basante, to their own idiom by calling the stream Bosna and themselves ''Bosniaks'' [...]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]]|title=Essays on the Latin Orient|volume=|page=464|location= Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wpEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA464|date=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Herzegovina'' (&quot;herzog's [land]&quot;, from German word for &quot;duke&quot;){{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} originates from Bosnian magnate [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača]]'s title, &quot;Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast&quot; (1448).{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=578}} Hum, formerly [[Zahumlje]], was an early medieval principality that was conquered by the Bosnian Banate in the first half of the 14th century. The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (''Hersek'') within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] up until the formation of the short-lived [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] in the 1830s, which remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the official name was changed to Bosnia and Herzegovina.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Mogorjelo Villa Rustica.jpg|thumb|[[Mogorjelo]], ancient Roman suburban Villa Rustica from the 4th century, near [[Čapljina]]]]
{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia has been inhabited by humans since at least the [[Paleolithic]], as one of the oldest paint caving was found in [[Badanj Cave|Badanj cave]]. Major Neolithic cultures such as the [[Butmir culture|Butmir]] and [[Kakanj culture|Kakanj]] were present along the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] dated from c. 6230 BC – c. 4900 BC.

=== Ancient Illyrians ===
The bronze culture of the [[Illyrians]], an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and parts of northern [[Greece]].
[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from the 2nd century]]

From 8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in [[Illyria]] (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC. The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom. The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.

From the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Hallstatt]] cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different. Parts of Central Bosnia were inhabited by [[Daesitiates]] tribe most commonly associated with [[Central Bosnian cultural group]]. Iron Age [[Glasinac culture]] is associated with [[Autariatae]] tribe.

A very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high. ''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).

In the 4th century BC, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to [[Greece]], so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.

In the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic]] influence of the Illyrian [[Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in Ošanići near [[Stolac]]. Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze [[coins]] and sculptures.

Conflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&amp;nbsp;BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&amp;nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as ''[[Bellum Batonianum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Norma. Tacitus: Annals I, 2002, {{ISBN|1-85399-358-1}}. It had originally been joined to Illyricum, but after the great Illyrian/Pannonian revolt of AD 6 it was made a separate province with its own governor&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict arose after an attempt to recruit Illyrians, and a revolt spanned for four years (6–9 AD), after which they were subdued.&lt;ref&gt;Stipčević, Aleksandar, ''The Illyrians: History and Culture'', 1974, Noyess Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from the entire [[Roman Empire]] settled among the Illyrians, and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

Following the split of the Empire between 337 and 395 AD, Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. Illyrian cultural traits were adopted by the South Slavs, as evidenced in certain customs and traditions, placenames, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ardian, Adzanela (Axhanela)|url=https://www.academia.edu/2490281/Illyrian_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina-an_Overview_of_a_Cultural_Legacy_Ancient_Illyrians_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina|title=Illyrian Bosnia and Herzegovina-an overview of a cultural legacy|date=2004|publisher=Centre for Balkan Studies, Online Balkan Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Early Slavs]] raided the Western Balkans, including Bosnia, in the 6th and early 7th century (amid the [[Migration Period]]), and were composed of small tribal units drawn from a single Slavic confederation known to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] as the ''[[Sclaveni]]'' (whilst the related ''[[Antes people|Antes]]'', roughly speaking, colonized the eastern portions of the Balkans).&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia University Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed|author= Robert J.

Bosnia is first mentioned ''as a land (horion Bosona)'' in Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' in the mid 10th century, at the end of a chapter (Chap. 32) entitled ''Of the Serbs and the country in which they now dwell''.{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123}} This has been scholarly interpreted in several ways and used especially by the Serb national ideologists to prove Bosnia as originally a &quot;Serb&quot; land.

In the [[High Middle Ages]] political circumstance led to the area being contested between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century, Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as the [[Banate of Bosnia]] (under the rule of local ''[[Ban (title)|bans]]'').{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Paul Mojzes.

In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254.

Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the [[Šubić]] and [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromanić]] became ''Ban''. By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his ambitious nephew [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. By the year 1377, Bosnia was elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of Tvrtko as the first [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Bosnian King]] in Mile near [[Visoko during the Middle Ages|Visoko]] in the Bosnian heartland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&amp;lang=1&amp;action=view&amp;id=1341|title=Declared as national monument |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116053150/http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&amp;lang=1&amp;action=view&amp;id=1341 |archivedate=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=An&gt;Anđelić Pavao, Krunidbena i grobna crkva bosanskih vladara u Milima (Arnautovićima) kod Visokog.

Following his death in 1391 however, Bosnia fell into a long period of decline. The [[Ottoman Empire]] had started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463 after its conquest by the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and [[cultural landscape]]. The Ottomans incorporating Bosnia as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buzov |first1=Snježana |editor1-last=Koller |editor1-first=Markus |title=Ottoman Perceptions of Bosnia as Reflected in the Works of Ottoman Authors who Visited or Lived in Bosnia |date=2004 |volume=Ottoman Bosnia: A History in Peril |pages=83–92 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Bosnia the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

The four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to lack of strong Christian church organizations and continuous rivalry between the Orthodox and Catholic churches, while the indigenous [[Bosnian Church]] disappeared altogether (ostensibly by conversion of its members to Islam). The Ottomans referred to them as ''kristianlar'' while the Orthodox and Catholics were called ''gebir'' or ''kafir'', meaning &quot;unbeliever&quot;.{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|pp=29–30}} The Bosnian [[Franciscan]]s (and the Catholic population as a whole) were protected by official imperial decrees and in accordance and full extent of Ottoman laws, however in effect, these often merely affected arbitrary rule and behavior of powerful local elite.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

As the Ottoman Empire continued their rule in the [[Balkans]] ([[Rumelia]]), Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province, and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into regional centers of trade and [[urban culture]] and were then visited by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian architecture]] such as the country's first library in [[Sarajevo]], [[madrassa]]s, a school of [[Sufi philosophy]], and a [[clock tower]] (''Sahat Kula''), bridges such as the [[Stari Most]], the [[Tsar's Mosque]] and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Furthermore, several Bosnian Muslims played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and [[political history]] during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;&gt;Riedlmayer, Andras (1993).

The Bosnian Manuscript Ingathering Project.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] and [[Battle of Krbava field|Krbava field]], while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals such as [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]; generals such as [[Isa-Beg Isaković]], [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] and [[Hasan Predojević]] and [[Sarı Süleyman Paşa]]; administrators such as [[Ferhat-paša Sokolović]] and [[Osman Gradaščević]]; and [[Vizier|Grand Viziers]] such as the influential [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović]] and [[Damad Ibrahim Pasha]]. Some Bosnians emerged as [[Sufi]] mystics, scholars such as [[Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi Bosnevi]], [[Ali Džabič]]; and poets in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic]], and [[Persian language]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamović, Mustafa 1996&quot;&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996).

However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the end of the [[Great Turkish War]] with the [[treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 again made Bosnia the Empire's westernmost province. The 18th century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Koller |first1=Markus |title=Bosnien an der Schwelle zur Neuzeit : eine Kulturgeschichte der Gewalt |date=2004 |publisher=Oldenbourg |location=Munich |isbn=978-3-486-57639-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed [[Tanzimat]] reforms. This, combined with frustrations over territorial, political concessions in the north-east, and the plight of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Muslim]] refugees arriving from the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] into [[Bosnia Eyalet]], culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]], who endorsed a [[Bosnia Eyalet]] autonomous from the authoritarian rule of the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]], who persecuted, executed and abolished the [[Janissaries]] and reduced the role of autonomous [[Pasha]]s in [[Rumelia]]. Mahmud II sent his [[Grand Vizier]] to subdue Bosnia Eyalet and succeeded only with the reluctant assistance of [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamović, Mustafa 1996&quot;/&gt; Related rebellions were extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate.

New nationalist movements appeared in Bosnia by the middle of the 19th century. Bolstered by Serbia's breakaway from the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, Serbian nationalists began making contacts and sending nationalist propaganda claiming Bosnia as a Serbian province. In the neighboring Habsburg Empire across the Ottoman border, Croatian nationalists made similar claims about Bosnia as a Croatian province. The rise of these competing movements marked the beginning of nationalist politics in Bosnia, which continued to grow in the rest of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hajdarpasic |first1=Edin |title=Whose Bosnia?

Agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation that led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, the [[Austria–Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which would remain under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration until 1908, when the Austro-Hungarian troops withdrew from the Sanjak.

Although Austro-Hungarian officials quickly came to an agreement with Bosnians, tensions remained and a mass emigration of Bosnians occurred.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms they intended would make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a &quot;model&quot; colony.

Habsburg rule had several key concerns in Bosnia. It tried to dissipate the South Slav nationalism by disputing the earlier Serb and Croat claims to Bosnia and encouraging identification of Bosnian or [[Bosniak]] identity.{{sfn|Hajdarpasic|2015|p=161-165}} Habsburg rule also tried to provide for modernisation by codifying laws, introducing new political institutions, and establishing and expanding industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sugar |first1=Peter |title=Industrialization of Bosnia-Hercegovina : 1878-1918 |date=1963 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |isbn=0295738146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria–Hungary began to plan annexation of Bosnia, but due to international disputes the issue was not resolved until the annexation crisis of 1908.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=94}} Several external matters affected status of Bosnia and its relationship with Austria–Hungary. A bloody coup occurred in Serbia in 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in Belgrade.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=140}} Then in 1908, the revolt in the [[Ottoman Empire]] raised concerns the Istanbul government might seek the outright return of Bosnia-Herzegovina. These factors caused the Austro-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question sooner, rather than later.
 [[File:National Museum of BiH Aerial.JPG|thumb|left|[[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was established in 1888]]
Taking advantage of turmoil in the Ottoman Empire, Austro-Hungarian diplomacy tried to obtain provisional Russian approval for changes over the status of Bosnia Herzegovina and published the annexation proclamation on 6 October 1908.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=227}} Despite international objections to the Austro-Hungarian annexation, Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909.

Following World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over [[redistribution (economics)|property redistribution]], and formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt;

The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major [[ethnic group]]s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslavian kingdom saw few benefits for the Bosniaks; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in Austro-Hungary, Muslims (Bosniaks) owned 91.1%, Orthodox Serbians owned 6.0%, Croatian Catholics owned 2.6% and others, 0.3% of the property. Following the reforms Bosnian Muslims were dispossessed of a total of 1,175,305 hectares of agricultural and forest land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj|url=http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm|title=An International Symposium &quot;Southeastern Europe 1918–1995&quot;|publisher=Hic.hr|accessdate=14 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822164923/http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm|archive-date=22 August 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as [[Mehmed Spaho]] ensured the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Subdivisions|banates]] or ''[[banovina (region)|banovinas]]'' that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration.

The [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|Cvetković-Maček Agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of Croatia|Croatian banate]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a [[partition of Bosnia]] between Croatia and Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamović, Mustafa 1996&quot;/&gt; However the rising threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]] forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention. Following a period that saw attempts at [[appeasement]], the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact|Tripartite Treaty]], and a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]], Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

On 12 October 1941, a group of 108 prominent Sarajevan Muslims signed the [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] by which they condemned the persecution of Serbs organized by the [[Ustaše]], made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and the Muslim population as a whole, presented information about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs, and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hadžijahić|first=Muhamed|title=Istorija Naroda Bosne i Hercegovine|date=1973|publisher=Institut za istoriju radničkog pokreta|location=Sarajevo|language=Serbo-Croatian|page=277|chapter=Muslimanske rezolucije iz 1941 godine [Muslim resolutions of 1941]|chapterurl=https://www.scribd.com/doc/47323922/Muhamed-Hadzijahic-Muslimanske-rezolucije-1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]] organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]], who fought against both Axis and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943 the [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Habsburg borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Redžić |first1=Enver |title=Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Second World War |date=2005 |publisher=Frank Cass |location=London |pages=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans, resulting in the successful [[Maclean Mission]], but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead. All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in Bosnia–Herzegovina and its peoples bore the brunt of fighting.

Due to its central geographic position within the Yugoslavian federation, post-war Bosnia was selected as a base for the development of the [[Defense (military)|military defense]] industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in [[Bosnian War|the war that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was a peaceful and very prosperous country, with high employment, a strong industrial and export oriented economy, good education system and social and medical security for every citizen of S. R. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Several international corporations operated in Bosnia— [[Volkswagen]] (car factory in Sarajevo, from 1972), [[Coca-Cola]] (from 1975), SKF Sweden (from 1967), Marlboro, (a tobacco factory in Sarajevo), and [[Holiday Inn]] hotels. Sarajevo was the site of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].

During the 1950s and 1960s Bosnia was a political backwater of the Republic of Yugoslavia. In the 1970s a strong Bosnian political elite arose, fueled in part by Tito's leadership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia's [[diplomatic corps]]. While working within the Socialist system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stojic&quot;&gt;Stojic, Mile (2005).

The Serb members of parliament, consisting mainly of the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska|Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990.

Following the Srebrenica massacre, [[NATO]] launched a [[Operation Deliberate Force|bombing campaign]] against Republika Srpska in August 1995. The bombing, together with a joint HV/HVO/ARBiH ground offensive in western Bosnia, convinced the Bosnian Serb leadership to consider a negotiated settlement, which manifested itself in the [[Dayton Agreement]] of December 1995.

[[File:Bosnian social protests Tuzla.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Tuzla government building burning after anti-government clashes on 7 February 2014]]
On 4 February 2014, the protests against the government of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], one of the country's two entities, dubbed the '''Bosnian Spring''', the name being taken from the [[Arab Spring]], began in the northern town of [[Tuzla]].

The country's name comes from the two alleged regions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] whose border was never defined. Historically, Bosnia's official name never included any of its many regions until the Austria-Hungarian occupation.

The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central [[Dinaric Alps]]. The northeastern parts reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]], while in the south it borders the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. The Dinaric Alps generally run in a southeast–northwest direction, and get higher towards the south. The highest point of the country is the peak of [[Maglić (mountain)|Maglić]] at {{convert|2,386|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, on the Montenegrin border. Major mountains include [[Kozara]], [[Grmeč]], [[Vlašić (Bosnian mountain)|Vlašić]], [[Čvrsnica Mountain|Čvrsnica]], [[Prenj]], [[Romanija]], [[Jahorina]], [[Bjelašnica Mountain|Bjelašnica]] and [[Treskavica]]. The geological composition of the Dinaric chain of mountains in Bosnia consists primarily of [[limestone]] (including [[Mesozoic]] limestone), with deposits of [[iron]], [[coal]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[bauxite]], [[lead]], and [[salt]] present in some areas, especially in central and northern Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cuvalo|first1=Ante|title=The A to Z of Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2010|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Plymouth, UK|isbn=0810876477|page=lxxi, 154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, nearly 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in the centre, east and west parts of Bosnia. Herzegovina has drier Mediterranean climate, with dominant [[karst]] topography. Northern Bosnia ([[Posavina]]) contains very fertile agricultural land along the River Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Pannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The country has only {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} of coastline,&lt;ref name=&quot;coastline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neum coastline&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/place/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina Bosnia-and-Herzegovina Neum britannica.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905090118/http://www.britannica.com/place/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina |date=5 September 2015 }}, ''britannica.com'', 9 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; around the town of [[Neum]] in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton.

The Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby [[executive power]] is exercised by the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Council of Ministers and the [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Members of the Parliamentary Assembly are chosen according to a [[proportional representation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.parlament.ba/Content/Read/182?title=ParlamentarizamuBosniiHercegoviniuperiodu1945.%E2%80%931990.&amp;lang=en|title=Parliamentarism in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the period 1945 – 1990|website=www.parlament.ba|access-date=24 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913174033/http://parlament.ba/Content/Read/182?title=ParlamentarizamuBosniiHercegoviniuperiodu1945.%E2%80%931990.&amp;lang=en|archive-date=13 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ccbh.ba/public/down/USTAV_BOSNE_I_HERCEGOVINE_engl.pdf|title=Open and transparent budget process in Western Balkan countries|author=Marjan Nikolov and Borce Trenovski and Gabriela Dimovska|publisher=MPRA Paper No. 76299|year=2015|access-date=1 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028162530/http://www.ccbh.ba/public/down/USTAV_BOSNE_I_HERCEGOVINE_engl.pdf|archive-date=28 October 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a [[liberal democracy]]. It has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton Accords]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996, the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves.

The [[Brčko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000, out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Brčko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Brčko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHR&quot;&gt;OHR Bulletin 66 (3 February 1998).

}}

The third level of Bosnia and Herzegovina's political subdivision is manifested in [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. Each has a cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws to ensure the equality of all constituent people.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipality. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska into 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Besides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four &quot;official&quot; cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Istočno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).

As a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state. The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.

The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.

The Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of [[proportional representation]] (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

However, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country and is selected by the [[European Union]]. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |title='The Contradictions of &quot;Democracy&quot; without Consent', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517144513/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |archivedate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.

===Military===
{{one source|section|date=March 2018}}

The [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (OSBiH) were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] was founded in 2004.

The Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 14,725 active and 7,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces have 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPADS]] hand-held missiles, [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. The Army has recently adopted remodeled [[MARPAT]] uniforms, used by Bosnian soldiers serving with [[ISAF]] in [[Afghanistan]]. A domestic production program is now underway to ensure that army units are equipped with the correct ammunition.

Beginning in 2007, the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] undertook the army's first ever international assistance mission, enlisting the military to serve with ISAF peace missions to Afghanistan, [[Iraq]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2007. Five officers, acting as officers/advisors, served in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 45 soldiers, mostly acting as base security and medical assistants, served in Afghanistan. 85 Bosnian soldiers served as base security in Iraq, occasionally conducting infantry patrols there as well. All three deployed groups have been commended by their respective international forces as well as the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international assistance operations are still ongoing.

The Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] were merged in 2006. The Air Force has seen improvements in the last few years with added funds for aircraft repairs and improved cooperation with the [[Ground Forces]] as well as to the citizens of the country. The Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina is pursuing the acquisition of new aircraft including helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|title=Bosnia breaks through ethnic divide by merging Serb, Muslim-Croat forces|publisher=Stars and Stripes|date=11 January 2006|accessdate=13 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064503/https://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|archive-date=2 October 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|EU integration]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it initiated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] in 2007. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, Member States of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm|title=European Commission&amp;nbsp;– Enlargement&amp;nbsp;– Bosnia and Herzegovina&amp;nbsp;– Relations with the EU|work=Europa (web portal)|accessdate=3 January 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126024355/http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm|archivedate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, relations with its neighbors of [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] have been fairly stable since the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995. On 23 April 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina received the [[Membership Action Plan]] from [[NATO]], which is the last step before full membership in the alliance. Full membership was expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8638794.stm|title=Bosnia gets Nato membership plan|date=22 April 2010|access-date=9 March 2019|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328045001/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8638794.stm|archive-date=28 March 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2018, NATO approved a Bosnian Membership Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://balkaninsight.com/2018/12/05/nato-approves-membership-action-plan-with-bosnia-12-05-2018/|title=NATO Approves Membership Action Plan for Bosnia|date=5 December 2018|website=Balkan Insight|language=en-US|access-date=9 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equal status of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian was verified by the Constitutional Court in 2000.&lt;ref name=Footitt/&gt; It ruled the provisions of the Federation and Republika Srpska constitutions on language were incompatible with the state constitution, since they only recognised &quot;Bosniak&quot; and Croatian (in the case of the Federation) and Serbian (in the case of Republika Srpska) as official languages at the entity level. As a result, the wording of the entity constitutions was changed and all three languages were made official in both entities.&lt;ref name=Footitt/&gt; The three [[standard languages]] are fully [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] and are known collectively under the appellation of [[Serbo-Croatian]], despite this term not being formally recognized in the country.

One legacy of the previous era is a strong industry; under former republic president [[Džemal Bijedić]] and SFRY President [[Josip Broz Tito]], metal industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's plants; S.R.

==Education==
{{main|Education in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Sarajevo University building.JPG|thumb|right|The [[University of Sarajevo]]'s [[Sarajevo Law School|Faculty of Law]] ]]

Higher education has a long and rich tradition in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first bespoke higher-education institution was a school of [[Sufism|Sufi]] philosophy established by [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] in 1531. Numerous other religious schools then followed. In 1887, under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a [[Sharia]] law school began a five-year program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=145 University of Sarajevo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910081056/http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=145 |date=10 September 2015 }} on Sarajevo official web site&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s the [[University of Sarajevo]] became the city's first secular higher education institute. In the 1950s post-bachelaurate graduate degrees became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unsa.ba/eng/ouni.php |publisher=University of Sarajevo |title=About University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110445/http://www.unsa.ba/eng/ouni.php |archivedate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severely damaged during the war, it was recently rebuilt in partnership with more than 40 other universities. There are various other institutions of higher education, including: [[University &quot;Džemal Bijedić&quot; of Mostar]], [[University of Banja Luka]], [[University of Mostar]], [[University of East Sarajevo]], [[University of Tuzla]], [[American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which is held in high regard as one of the most prestigious creative arts academies in the region.

Also, Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to several private and international higher education institutions, some of which are:

* [[Sarajevo School of Science and Technology]]
* [[International University of Sarajevo]]
* [[American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
* [[Sarajevo Graduate School of Business]]
* International Burch University

Primary schooling lasts for nine years. Secondary education is provided by general and technical secondary schools (typically [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasiums]]) where studies typically last for four years. All forms of secondary schooling include an element of [[vocational education|vocational training]]. Pupils graduating from general secondary schools obtain the [[Matura]] and can enroll in any tertiary educational institution or academy by passing a qualification examination prescribed by the governing body or institution. Students graduating technical subjects obtain a [[Diploma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/boherco.htm |title=Education System in Bosnia and Herzegovina |website=EuroEducation.net – The European Education Directory |access-date=18 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215095037/http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/boherco.htm |archive-date=15 February 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{main|Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

The architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely influenced by four major periods where political and social changes influenced the creation of distinct cultural and architectural habits of the population. Each period made its influence felt and contributed to a greater diversity of cultures and architectural language in this region.

=== Media ===
{{Main|Media of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

[[File:Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BHRT) building, Sarajevo.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|The [[Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] headquarter in [[Sarajevo]].]]

Some television, magazines, and newspapers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are state-owned, and some are for-profit corporations funded by [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]].

As a [[country in transition]] with a post-war legacy and a [[politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|complex domestic political structure]] Bosnia and Herzegovina's media system is under transformation. In the early post-war period (1995–2005), media development was guided mainly by international donors and cooperation agencies, who invested to help reconstruct, diversify, democratize and professionalize media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;Hozić, 2008; Thompson &amp; De Luce, 2002; Kurspahić, 2003; Jusić, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EJC&quot;&gt;Tarik Jusić, &quot;[http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053605/http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina |date=4 March 2016 }}&quot;, EJC Media Landscapes&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war developments included the establishment of an independent Communication Regulatory Agency, the adoption of a Press Code, the establishment of the Press Council, the decriminalization of label and defamation, the introduction of a rather advanced Freedom of Access to Information Law, and the creation of a Public Service Broadcasting System from the formerly state-owned broadcaster.
Yet, internationally backed positive developments have been often obstructed by domestic elites, and the professionalisation of media and journalists has proceeded only slowly. High levels of partisanship and linkages between the media and the political systems hinder the adherence to professional code of conducts.&lt;ref name=EJC/&gt;

===Literature===
{{main|Literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literature, including the [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Ivo Andrić]] and poets such as Croat [[Antun Branko Šimić]], [[Aleksa Šantić]], [[Jovan Dučić]] and [[Mak Dizdar]], writers such as [[Zlatko Topčić]], [[Meša Selimović]], [[Semezdin Mehmedinović]], [[Miljenko Jergović]], [[Isak Samokovlija]], [[Safvet beg Bašagić]], [[Abdulah Sidran]], [[Petar Kočić]], [[Aleksandar Hemon]], and Nedžad Ibrišimović. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was the dramatist [[Branislav Nušić]].
Magazines such as ''[[Novi Plamen]]'' or ''[http://sveske.ba/en Sarajevske sveske]'' are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.

===Art===

[[File:Bosniangraves bosniska gravar februari 2007 stecak stecci5.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|Stećci from Radimlja, near [[Stolac]] (13th century)]]

The art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Stećci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], [[Petar Šain]], [[Roman Petrović]] and [[Lazar Drljača]].

After World War II artists like [[Mersad Berber]] and [[Safet Zec]] rose in popularity.

In 2007, [[Ars Aevi]], a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}

Typical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zonić]], [[Goran Bregović]], [[Davorin Popović]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Elvir Laković]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Hari Mata Hari]] and [[Dino Merlin]]. Other composers such as [[Đorđe Novković]], [[Al' Dino]], [[Haris Džinović]], [[Kornelije Kovač]], and many pop and [[Rock bands|rock band]]s, for example, [[Bijelo dugme|Bijelo Dugme]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Divlje Jagode]], [[Indexi]], [[Plavi orkestar|Plavi Orkestar]], [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Ambasadori]], [[Dubioza kolektiv]], who were among the leading ones in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia is home to the composer [[Dušan Šestić]], the creator of the [[national anthem]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer [[Marija Šestić]], to the world known jazz musician, educator and Bosnian jazz ambassador [[Sinan Alimanović]], composer [[Saša Lošić]] and pianist [[Saša Toperić]]. In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient ''[[Gusle]]''. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.

Probably the most distinctive and identifiably &quot;Bosnian&quot; of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[saz (musical instrument)|saz]], a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.

{{main|Bosnian root music}}
Rural folk traditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina include the shouted, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[ganga (music)|ganga]] and &quot;ravne pjesme&quot; (''flat song'') styles, as well as instruments like a droneless [[bagpipe]], wooden [[flute]] and [[šargija]]. The [[gusle]], an instrument found throughout the [[Balkans]], is also used to accompany ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[epic poetry|epic]] [[poems]]. There are also Bosnian folk songs in the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, derived from the area's Jewish population.
[[File:43. TKB - Seljo z Sarajewa (Bośnia i Hercegowina) 10.JPG|thumb|Bosnians dancing a traditional [[Kolo (dance)|Kolo]]]]

''Bosnian roots music'' came from [[Central Bosnia Canton|Middle Bosnia]], [[Posavina]], the [[Drina]] valley and [[Kalesija]]. It is usually performed by singers with two violinists and a [[sargija|šargija]] player. These bands first appeared around [[World War I]] and became popular in the 1960s. This is the third oldest music following after the [[sevdalinka]] and ilahija. Self-taught people, mostly in two or three members of the different choices of old instruments, mostly in the violin, sacking, [[Bağlama|saz]], drums, flutes (zurle) or wooden flute, as others have already called, the original performers of Bosnian music that can not be written notes, transmitted by ear from generation to generation, family is usually hereditary. It is thought to be brought from Persia-Kalesi tribe that settled in the area of present Sprecanski valleys and hence probably the name Kalesija. In this part of Bosnia it is the most common. Again, it became the leader of First World War onwards, as well as 60 years in the field Sprecanski doline. This kind of music was enjoyed by all three peoples in Bosnia, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and it contributed a lot to reconcile people socializing, entertainment and other organizations through festivala. In Kalesija it's maintained each year with the Bosnian Festival Original music.

Studio Kemix firm Dzemal Dzihanovic from [[Živinice]] together with his artists brought this kind of music to perfection at the end 20th century. With its entirely new form of modernity, it is most common in the [[Tuzla Canton]] and the cradle of this music city [[Živinice]] was named Bosnian town of original music. Songs are performed preferably in a [[diphthong]], the first and second voice which is a special secret performance of this music and some performers sing in troglasju as they do Kalesijski triple that was recorded in 1968, as the first written record of the tone on the album, along with Higurashi no naku.

{{main|List of Bosnia-Herzegovina films}}

Sarajevo is internationally renowned for its eclectic and diverse selection of festivals. The [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] was established in 1995, during the Bosnian War and has become the premier and largest film festival in the Balkans and South-East Europe.

Bosnia has a rich cinematic and film heritage, dating back to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]; many Bosnian filmmakers have achieved international prominence and some have won international awards ranging from the [[Academy Awards]] to multiple [[Palme d'Or]]s and [[Golden Bear]]s. Some notable Bosnian screenwriters, directors and producers are [[Danis Tanović]] (known for the Academy Award– and [[Golden Globe Award]]–winning 2001 film ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'' and [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize]]–winning 2016 film ''[[Death in Sarajevo]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Home Festival Awards &amp; Juries: International Jury &quot;Prizes Of The International Jury |website=www.berlinale.de/en |date=2016 |accessdate=23 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816162458/http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |archive-date=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emir Kusturica]] (won two [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes), [[Jasmila Žbanić]] (won Golden Bear), [[Zlatko Topčić]], [[Ademir Kenović]], Dino Mustafić, [[Ahmed Imamović]], [[Pjer Žalica]], [[Aida Begić]], Adis Bakrač, etc.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}
[[File:Bosnian meat platter.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Bosnian meat platter]]
Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines.
