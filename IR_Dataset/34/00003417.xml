A '''biennial plant''' is a [[flowering plant]] that takes two years to complete its biological lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/growing/annual.html |title=Annual, Perennial, Biennial? |work=Texas Cooperative Extension |accessdate=31 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814200109/http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/growing/annual.html |archive-date=14 August 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Biennial |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/biennial |access-date=August 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803070253/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/biennial |archive-date=August 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first year, the plant grows leaves, stems, and roots (vegetative structures), then it enters a period of [[dormancy]] over the colder months. Usually the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground, forming a [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]]. Many biennials require a cold treatment, or [[vernalization]], before they will flower. During the next [[spring (season)|spring]] or [[summer (season)|summer]], the stem of the biennial plant elongates greatly, or &quot;bolts&quot;.&lt;ref name=RHSbolting&gt;{{cite web |title=Bolting in vegetables |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=262 |publisher=Royal Horticultural Society |accessdate=21 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621173236/https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=262 |archive-date=21 June 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant then flowers, producing [[fruit]]s and [[seed]]s before it finally dies. There are far fewer biennials than either [[perennial plant]]s or [[annual plant]]s.

Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its life cycle rapidly (e.g., in three months instead of two years). This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were vernalized before they were planted in the ground. This behavior leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas. Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favorable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial. Some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial. True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.

From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose. Biennials grown for flowers, fruits, or seeds need to be grown for two years. Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown for just one year (and not grown on a second year to run to seed).

Examples of biennial plants are members of the [[onion]] family including [[leek]],&lt;ref name=RHSbolting/&gt; some members of the [[cabbage]] family,&lt;ref name=RHSbolting/&gt; [[Verbascum thapsus|common mullein]], [[parsley]], fennel,&lt;ref name=RHSbolting/&gt; ''[[Lunaria]]'', [[silverbeet]], [[Rudbeckia hirta|Black-eyed Susan]], [[Dianthus barbatus|Sweet William]], [[Aletris|colic weed]], [[carrot]],&lt;ref name=RHSbolting/&gt; and some [[hollyhock]]s. Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, for example, [[foxglove]] and [[Matthiola incana|stock]].
