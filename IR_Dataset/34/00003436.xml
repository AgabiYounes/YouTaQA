The '''Symphony No. 9''' in [[D minor]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 125, also known as '''Beethoven's 9th''', is the final complete symphony by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], composed between 1822 and 1824. It was first performed in Vienna on 7 May 1824. The symphony is regarded by many critics and musicologists as Beethoven's greatest work and one of the supreme achievements in the history of western music.&lt;ref name=NCookblurb /&gt;&lt;ref name=TomServiceSymphGuide&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/sep/09/symphony-guide-beethoven-ninth-choral-tom-service|title=Symphony guide: Beethoven's Ninth ('Choral')|first=Tom|last=Service|authorlink=Tom Service|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 September 2014|quote=the central artwork of Western music, the symphony to end all symphonies}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best-known works in [[Common practice period|common practice music]],&lt;ref name=NCookblurb&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|loc=Product description (blurb). &quot;Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition.

The symphony was the first example of a major composer using voices in a symphony&lt;ref name=&quot;bonds24837&quot;&gt;Bonds, Mark Evan, &quot;Symphony: II. The 19th century&quot;, ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Second Edition'' (London: Macmillan, 2001), 29 vols. {{ISBN|0-333-60800-3}}, 24:837.&lt;/ref&gt; (thus making it a [[choral symphony]]). The words are sung during the final (4th) movement of the symphony by four vocal soloists and a [[choir|chorus]]. They were taken from the &quot;[[Ode to Joy]]&quot;, a poem written by [[Friedrich Schiller]] in 1785 and revised in 1803, with text additions made by Beethoven.

In 2001, Beethoven's original, hand-written manuscript of the score, held by the [[Berlin State Library]], was added to the [[United Nations]] [[Memory of the World Programme]] Heritage list, becoming the first musical score so designated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/ludwig-van-beethoven-symphony-no-9-d-minor-op-125/ Memory of the World (2001) – Ludwig van Beethoven: Symphony No 9, D minor, Op. 125]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Beethoven.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven in 1820. Beethoven was almost totally deaf when he composed his Ninth Symphony.|240x240px]]

===Composition===
The [[Philharmonic Society of London]] originally commissioned the symphony in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maynard Solomon|Solomon, Maynard]]. ''Beethoven''. New York: Schirmer Books, 1997, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; The main composition work was done between autumn 1822 and the completion of the autograph in February 1824.&lt;ref&gt;[[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel|Breitkopf]] [[Urtext edition|Urtext]], Beethoven: [http://www.breitkopf.com/feature/download/3738/3667 Symphonie Nr. 9 d-moll] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401012840/http://www.breitkopf.com/feature/download/3738/3667 |date=1 April 2012 }}, op. 125, pbl.: Hauschild, Peter, p. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony emerged from other pieces by Beethoven that, while completed works in their own right, are also in some sense &quot;sketches&quot; (rough outlines) for the future symphony. The Choral Fantasy Opus. 80 (1808), basically a [[piano concerto]] movement, brings in a choir and vocal soloists near the end for the climax. The vocal forces sing a theme first played instrumentally, and this theme is reminiscent of the corresponding theme in the Ninth Symphony (for a detailed comparison, see [[Choral Fantasy (Beethoven)|Choral Fantasy]]).

Going further back, an earlier version of the Choral Fantasy theme is found in the song &quot;Gegenliebe&quot; (Returned Love) for piano and high voice, which dates from before 1795.{{sfn|Hopkins|1981|p=249}} According to Robert W. Gutman, Mozart's K. 222 Offertory in D minor, &quot;Misericordias Domini&quot;, written in 1775, contains a melody that foreshadows &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Gutman, ''Mozart: A Cultural Biography'', 1999, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premiere===
Although most of his major works had been premiered in Vienna, Beethoven was keen to have his latest composition performed in Berlin as soon as possible after finishing it, as he thought that musical taste in Vienna had become dominated by Italian composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ninth&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|p={{page needed|date=September 2019}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his friends and financiers heard this, they urged him to premiere the symphony in Vienna in the form of a petition signed by a number of prominent Viennese music patrons and performers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ninth&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Kärntnertortheater 1830.jpg|left|thumb|250x250px|The [[Theater am Kärntnertor]] in 1830]]

Beethoven was flattered by the adoration of Vienna, so the Ninth Symphony was premiered on 7 May 1824 in the [[Theater am Kärntnertor]] in Vienna along with the overture ''[[The Consecration of the House (overture)|The Consecration of the House]]'' ({{lang|de|Die Weihe des Hauses}}) and three parts of the ''[[Missa solemnis (Beethoven)|Missa solemnis]]'' (the Kyrie, Credo, and Agnus Dei). This was the composer's first onstage appearance in 12 years; the hall was packed with an eager audience and a number of musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy David&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2003|p={{page needed|date=September 2019}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere of Symphony No. 9 involved the largest orchestra ever assembled by Beethoven&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy David&quot; /&gt; and required the combined efforts of the Kärntnertor house orchestra, the Vienna Music Society ([[Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde]]), and a select group of capable amateurs. While no complete list of premiere performers exists, many of Vienna's most elite performers are known to have participated.&lt;ref name=&quot;First Nights&quot;&gt;[[Thomas Forrest Kelly|Kelly, Thomas Forrest]] (2000). ''First Nights: Five Musical Premiers'' (Chapter 3). Yale University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[soprano]] and [[alto]] parts were sung by two famous young singers: [[Henriette Sontag]] and [[Caroline Unger]]. German soprano Henriette Sontag was 18 years old when Beethoven personally recruited her to perform in the premiere of the Ninth.&lt;ref&gt;Elson, Louis, Chief Editor. ''University Musical Encyclopedia of Vocal Music''. University Society, New York, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Life of Henriette Sontag, Countess de Rossi. (Various Authors) Stringer &amp; Townsend, publishers. New York, 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; Also personally recruited by Beethoven, 20-year-old [[contralto]] Caroline Unger, a native of Vienna, had gained critical praise in 1821 appearing in Rossini's ''[[Tancredi]]''. After performing in Beethoven's 1824 premiere, Unger then found fame in Italy and Paris. Italian composers [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] were known to have written roles specifically for her voice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] and Bourne, Joyce (1996). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music''. Oxford University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Haizinger]] and [[Joseph Seipelt]] sang the [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]/[[baritone]] parts, respectively.

[[File:CarolineUngher.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Caroline Unger]], who sang the contralto part at the first performance and is credited with turning Beethoven to face the applauding audience.]]

Although the performance was officially directed by [[Michael Umlauf]], the theatre's [[Kapellmeister]], Beethoven shared the stage with him. However, two years earlier, Umlauf had watched as the composer's attempt to conduct a [[dress rehearsal]] of his opera ''[[Fidelio]]'' ended in disaster. So this time, he instructed the singers and musicians to ignore the almost totally deaf Beethoven. At the beginning of every part, Beethoven, who sat by the stage, gave the tempos. He was turning the pages of his score and beating time for an orchestra he could not hear.

There are a number of anecdotes about the premiere of the Ninth. Based on the testimony of the participants, there are suggestions that it was underrehearsed (there were only two full rehearsals) and rather scrappy in execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the premiere was a great success. In any case, Beethoven was not to blame, as violinist [[Joseph Böhm]] recalled:

{{quote|Beethoven himself conducted, that is, he stood in front of a conductor's stand and threw himself back and forth like a madman. At one moment he stretched to his full height, at the next he crouched down to the floor, he flailed about with his hands and feet as though he wanted to play all the instruments and sing all the chorus parts.—The actual direction was in [Louis] Duport's{{refn|group=n|Presumably, Böhm meant the conductor Michael Umlauf}} hands; we musicians followed his baton only.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the audience applauded—testimonies differ over whether at the end of the [[scherzo]] or symphony—Beethoven was several bars off and still conducting. Because of that, the contralto Caroline Unger walked over and turned Beethoven around to accept the audience's cheers and applause. According to the critic for the ''Theater-Zeitung'', &quot;the public received the musical hero with the utmost respect and sympathy, listened to his wonderful, gigantic creations with the most absorbed attention and broke out in jubilant applause, often during sections, and repeatedly at the end of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience acclaimed him through [[standing ovation]]s five times; there were handkerchiefs in the air, hats, and raised hands, so that Beethoven, who could not hear the applause, could at least see the ovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachs|2010|p=23-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editions===
The first German edition was printed by [[Schott Music|B. Schott's Söhne]] (Mainz) in 1826. The [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] edition dating from 1864 has been used widely by orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/review/02-99b/24-delmar.html|publisher=British Academy Review|author=Del Mar, Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Del Mar|date=July–December 1999|title=Jonathan Del Mar, New Urtext Edition: Beethoven Symphonies 1–9|accessdate=13 November 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023113830/http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/review/02-99b/24-delmar.html|archivedate=23 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, [[Bärenreiter]] published an edition by [[Jonathan Del Mar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baerenreiter.com/html/lvb/index.html|title=Ludwig van Beethoven The Nine Symphonies The New Bärenreiter Urtext Edition|accessdate=13 November 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017101624/http://baerenreiter.com/html/lvb/index.html|archivedate=17 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Del Mar, this edition corrects nearly 3,000 mistakes in the Breitkopf edition, some of which were &quot;remarkable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zander&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.benjaminzander.com/recordings/boston-philharmonic/beet9/review/130|title=Beethoven 9 The fundamental reappraisal of a classic|author=Zander, Benjamin|authorlink=Benjamin Zander|accessdate=13 November 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419181733/http://www.benjaminzander.com/recordings/boston-philharmonic/beet9/review/130|archivedate=19 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Benjamin Levy|David Levy]], however, criticized this edition, saying that it could create &quot;quite possibly false&quot; traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bf.press.uiuc.edu/10.1/delmar.html|title=Concerning the Review of the Urtext Edition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|accessdate=13 November 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628061833/http://bf.press.uiuc.edu/10.1/delmar.html|archivedate=28 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breitkopf also published a new edition by Peter Hauschild in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.breitkopf.com/downloads/kataloge/pdf_en/33_Beeth_Symph_en.pdf |title=Beethoven The Nine Symphonies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627152927/https://www.breitkopf.com/downloads/kataloge/pdf_en/33_Beeth_Symph_en.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for the following orchestra. These are by far the largest forces needed for any Beethoven symphony; at the premiere, Beethoven augmented them further by assigning two players to each wind part.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Wheelock Thayer|Thayer, Alexander Wheelock]].

Beethoven changes the usual pattern of [[Classical music era|Classical]] symphonies in placing the [[scherzo]] movement before the slow movement (in symphonies, slow movements are usually placed before scherzi).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson 1999, 26; Stein 1979, 106&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time he did this in a symphony, although he had done so in some previous works, including the [[String Quartet No. 5 (Beethoven)|String Quartet Op. 18 no. 5]], the [[Piano Trio, Op. 97 (Beethoven)|&quot;Archduke&quot; piano trio Op. 97]], the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' piano sonata Op. 106]]. [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], too, had used this arrangement in a number of his own works such as the [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Opus 33 No. 2|String Quartet No. 30 in E{{music|flat}} major]], as did [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] in three of the [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|Haydn Quartets]] and the [[String Quintet No. 4 (Mozart)|G minor String Quintet]].

=== I. Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso ===
The first movement is in [[sonata form]] without an [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] [[Repeat sign|repeat]]. It begins with [[open fifth]]s (A and E) played ''[[Dynamics (music)#Dynamic markings|pianissimo]]'' by [[tremolo]] strings, steadily building up until the first main theme in [[D minor]] at m. 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening, with its perfect fifth quietly emerging, resembles the sound of an orchestra [[Musical tuning|tuning up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/beethovenssympho0000youn|title=Beethoven's Symphonies: A Guided Tour|last=Young|first=John Bell|publisher=Amadeus Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1574671698|location=New York|pages=|oclc=180757068|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outset of the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] (which repeats the main melodic themes) in m. 301, the theme returns, this time played ''fortissimo'' and in D ''major'', rather than D ''minor''. The movement ends with a massive [[Coda (music)|coda]] that takes up nearly a quarter of the movement, as in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the first movement, the scherzo is in D minor, with the introduction bearing a passing resemblance to the opening theme of the first movement, a pattern also found in the [[Piano Sonata No. 29 (Beethoven)|''Hammerklavier'' piano sonata]], written a few years earlier. At times during the piece, Beethoven specifies one downbeat every three bars—perhaps because of the fast tempo—with the direction ''ritmo di tre battute'' (rhythm of three beats) and one beat every four bars with the direction ''ritmo di quattro battute'' (rhythm of four beats). Beethoven had been criticized before for failing to adhere to standard Classical form for his compositions. He used this movement to answer his critics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Normally, a scherzo is in [[Triple metre|triple time]]. Beethoven wrote this piece in triple time but punctuated it in a way that, when coupled with the tempo, makes it sound as if it is in [[Duple and quadruple metre|quadruple time]].

While adhering to the standard [[Ternary form#Compound ternary or trio form|compound ternary design]] (three-part structure) of a dance movement (scherzo-trio-scherzo or minuet-trio-minuet), the scherzo section has an elaborate internal structure; it is a complete sonata form. Within this sonata form, the first group of the exposition (the statement of the main melodic themes) starts out with a [[fugue]] in D minor on the subject below.

:&lt;score vorbis=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
    \relative c''' {
        \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot;

        gis a b
        a gis a
    }
&lt;/score&gt;

For the second subject, it modulates to the unusual key of [[C major]]. The exposition then repeats before a short [[development section]], where Beethoven explores other ideas. The recapitulation (repeating of the melodic themes heard in the opening of the movement) further develops the exposition's themes, also containing timpani solos. A new development section leads to the repeat of the recapitulation, and the scherzo concludes with a brief [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]].

The contrasting trio section is in [[D major]] and in duple time. The trio is the first time the trombones play. Following the trio, the second occurrence of the scherzo, unlike the first, plays through without any repetition, after which there is a brief reprise of the trio, and the movement ends with an abrupt coda.

The duration of the movement is about 12 minutes, but this may vary depending on whether two (frequently omitted) repeats are played.

=== III. Adagio molto e cantabile ===
The third movement is a lyrical, slow movement in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]]—a [[minor sixth]] away from the symphony's main key of D minor. It is in a [[Double variation|double variation form]], with each pair of variations progressively elaborating the rhythm and melodic ideas. The first variation, like the theme, is in {{music|time|4|4}} time, the second in {{music|time|12|8}}. The variations are separated by passages in {{music|time|3|4}}, the first in D major, the second in [[G major]], the third in [[E-flat major|E{{music|flat}} major]], the fourth in [[F-sharp major|F{{music|sharp}} major]], and the fifth in [[B major]]. The final variation is twice interrupted by episodes in which loud [[fanfare]]s from the full orchestra are answered by octaves by the first violins. A prominent French horn solo is assigned to the fourth player.

A performance lasts about 16 minutes.

===IV. Finale===
The choral finale is Beethoven's musical representation of universal brotherhood based on the &quot;[[Ode to Joy]]&quot; theme and is in theme and [[Variation (music)|variations]] form.

  }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

The movement starts with an introduction in which musical material from each of the preceding three movements—though none are literal quotations of previous music&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;—are successively presented and then dismissed by [[Recitative#Instrumental recitative|instrumental recitatives]] played by the low strings. Following this, the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; theme is finally introduced by the cellos and double basses. After three instrumental variations on this theme, the human voice is presented for the first time in the symphony by the baritone soloist, who sings words written by Beethoven himself: &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''O Freunde, nicht diese Töne!' Sondern laßt uns angenehmere anstimmen, und freudenvollere''.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; (&quot;Oh friends, not these sounds! Let us instead strike up more pleasing and more joyful ones!&quot;).

At about 24 minutes in length, the last movement is the longest of the four movements. Indeed, it is longer than some entire symphonies of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. Its form has been disputed by musicologists, as [[Nicholas Cook]] explains:

{{Quote|Beethoven had difficulty describing the finale himself; in letters to publishers, he said that it was like his Choral Fantasy, Op. 80, only on a much grander scale. We might call it a [[cantata]] constructed round a series of variations on the &quot;Joy&quot; theme. But this is rather a loose formulation, at least by comparison with the way in which many twentieth-century critics have tried to codify the movement's form. Thus there have been interminable arguments as to whether it should be seen as a kind of sonata form (with the [[Turkish music (style)|&quot;Turkish&quot; music]] of bar 331, which is in B{{music|flat}} major, functioning as a kind of second group), or a kind of [[Concerto|concerto form]] (with bars 1–207 and 208–330 together making up a double exposition), or even a conflation of four symphonic movements into one (with bars 331–594 representing a Scherzo, and bars 595–654 a slow movement). The reason these arguments are interminable is that each interpretation contributes something to the understanding of the movement, but does not represent the whole story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cook gives the following table describing the form of the movement:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with Cook's remarks, [[Charles Rosen]] characterizes the final movement as a symphony within a symphony, played without interruption.&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;[[Charles Rosen|Rosen, Charles]]. ''[[The Classical Style|The Classical Style: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven]]''. p. 440. New York: Norton, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;inner symphony&quot; follows the same overall pattern as the Ninth Symphony as a whole:
* First &quot;movement&quot;: [[Theme and variations]] with slow introduction. The main theme, first in the cellos and basses, is later recapitulated by voices.
* Second &quot;movement&quot;: [[Scherzo]] in a {{music|time|6|8}} military style. It begins at ''Alla marcia'' (m. 331) and concludes with a {{music|time|6|8}} variation of the main theme with [[Choir|chorus]].
* Third &quot;movement&quot;: Slow meditation with a new theme on the text &quot;''Seid umschlungen, Millionen!''&quot; It begins at ''Andante maestoso'' (m. 595).
* Fourth &quot;movement&quot;: [[fugue|Fugato]] finale on the themes of the first and third &quot;movements&quot;. It begins at ''Allegro energico'' (m. 763).

The movement has a thematic unity in which every part is based on either the main theme, the &quot;Seid umschlungen&quot; theme, or some combination of the two.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Indeed, Rosen also notes that the movement can also be analysed as a set of variations and simultaneously as a concerto sonata form with double exposition (with the fugato acting both as a development section and the second tutti of the concerto).&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

====Text of the fourth movement====
[[File:Friedrich Schiller by Ludovike Simanowiz.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Friedrich Schiller]] by [[Ludovike Simanowiz]] (1794)]]

Towards the end of the movement, the choir sings the last four lines of the main theme, concluding with &quot;Alle Menschen&quot; before the soloists sing for one last time the song of joy at a slower tempo. The chorus repeats parts of &quot;Seid umschlungen, Millionen!&quot;, then quietly sings, &quot;Tochter aus Elysium&quot;, and finally, &quot;Freude, schöner Götterfunken, Götterfunken!&quot;.&lt;ref name=dew /&gt;

==Reception==
Music critics almost universally consider the Ninth Symphony one of Beethoven's greatest works, and among the greatest musical works ever written.&lt;ref name=NCookblurb /&gt;&lt;ref name=TomServiceSymphGuide /&gt; The finale, however, has had its detractors: &quot;[e]arly critics rejected [the finale] as cryptic and eccentric, the product of a deaf and ageing composer.&quot;&lt;ref name=NCookblurb /&gt; [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] admired the first three movements but lamented the confused structure and the bad writing for the voices in the last movement:

{{Quote
|text=The alpha and omega is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, marvellous in the first three movements, very badly set in the last. No one will ever approach the sublimity of the first movement, but it will be an easy task to write as badly for voices as in the last movement. And supported by the authority of Beethoven, they will all shout: &quot;That's the way to do it...&lt;ref&gt;Letter of April 1878 in ''Giuseppe Verdi: Autobiografia delle Lettere'', Aldo Oberdorfer ed., Milano, 1941, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metronome markings===
Conductors in the [[historically informed performance]] movement, notably [[Roger Norrington]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Norrington|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Norrington|title=In tune with the time|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/14/beethoven|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 March 2009|accessdate=15 May 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used Beethoven's suggested tempos, to mixed reviews. [[Benjamin Zander]] has made a case for following Beethoven's metronome markings, both in writing&lt;ref name=&quot;Zander&quot; /&gt; and in performances with the [[Boston Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Philharmonia Orchestra of London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/11/arts/concert-beethoven-9th.html &quot;Concert: Beethoven 9th, Benjamin Zander and the Boston Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall&quot;] by Bernhard Holland, ''The New York Times'', 11 October 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Symphony-No-Dominique-Labelle/dp/B00000IGQ6 Recording of the Beethoven 9th] with Benjamin Zander, Dominique Labelle, D'Anna Fortunato, Brad Cresswell, David Arnold, the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra, and Chorus Pro Musica&lt;/ref&gt; Beethoven's metronome still exists and was tested and found accurate,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5-9Cdy-Y-M8C&amp;pg=PA34 Gunther Schuller, ''The Compleat Conductor'']&lt;/ref&gt; but the original heavy weight (whose position is vital to its accuracy) is missing and many musicians have considered his metronome marks to be unacceptably high.&lt;ref&gt;Sture Forsén, Harry B. Gray, L. K. Olof Lindgren, and Shirley B. Gray. October 2013. [http://www.ams.org/notices/201309/rnoti-p1146.pdf &quot;Was Something Wrong with Beethoven’s Metronome?&quot;], ''Notices of the [[American Mathematical Society]]'' 60(9):1146–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-orchestrations and alterations===
A number of conductors have made alterations in the instrumentation of the symphony. Notably, [[Richard Wagner]] doubled many woodwind passages, a modification greatly extended by [[Gustav Mahler]],&lt;ref name=Holden&gt;Raymond Holden, &quot;The iconic symphony: performing Beethoven's Ninth Wagner's Way&quot; ''[[The Musical Times]]'', Winter 2011&lt;/ref&gt; who revised the orchestration of the Ninth to make it sound like what he believed Beethoven would have wanted if given a modern orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natalie Bauer-Lechner|Bauer-Lechner, Natalie]]: ''Erinnerungen an Gustav Mahler'', p. 131. E.P. Tal &amp; Co. Verlag, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner's Dresden performance of 1864 was the first to place the chorus and the solo singers behind the orchestra as has since become standard; previous conductors placed them between the orchestra and the audience.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

====2nd bassoon doubling basses in the finale====
Beethoven's indication that the 2nd bassoon should double the basses in bars 115–164 of the finale was not included in the [[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] parts, though it was included in the full score.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Del Mar|Del Mar, Jonathan]] (1981) ''Orchestral Variations: Confusion and Error in the Orchestral Repertoire'' London: Eulenburg Books, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable performances and recordings==
The [[British première of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9|British premiere of the symphony]] was presented on 21 March 1825 by its commissioners, the [[Philharmonic Society of London]], at its [[Argyll Rooms]] conducted by [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]] and with the choral part sung in Italian. The American premiere was presented on 20 May 1846 by the newly formed [[New York Philharmonic]] at [[Castle Garden]] (in an attempt to raise funds for a new concert hall), conducted by the English-born [[George Loder]], with the choral part translated into English for the first time.

[[Richard Wagner]] conducted the symphony many times in his career. His last performance took place in 1872 at a concert to mark the foundation stone for the [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]]. Wagner later published an essay entitled &quot;The rendering of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony&quot; in which he described the changes he made to the orchestration (see above) for the 1872 performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|1993|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[London Philharmonic Choir]] debuted on 15 May 1947 performing the Ninth Symphony with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] under the baton of [[Victor de Sabata]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;debut&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/933316|title=London Concerts|journal=[[The Musical Times]]|volume=88|issue=1250|author=Anon.|date=April 1947| page=139|publisher=Musical Times Publications Ltd.|jstor=933316}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] and the [[Bayreuth Festival]] Orchestra reopened the Bayreuth Festival with a performance of the symphony, after the Allies temporarily suspended the Festival following the Second World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhilBeet&quot;&gt;{{cite web

American conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] made his first of three recordings of the Beethoven Ninth in 1964 with the [[New York Philharmonic]], for [[Columbia Masterworks]], with soloists [[Martina Arroyo]] (soprano), [[Regina Sarfaty]] (mezzo), Nicholas di Virgilio (tenor), Norman Scott (bass), and the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] Chorus. It was later reissued on CD.

Bernstein made his second recording of the piece with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] for [[Deutsche Grammophon]], in 1979. This featured [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] (soprano), [[Hanna Schwarz]] (mezzo), [[René Kollo]] (tenor), and [[Kurt Moll]] (bass), with the chorus of the [[Vienna State Opera]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leonardbernstein.com/disc_other.php?disc_other_php=&amp;disc_other.php=&amp;page=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernstein conducted a version of the Ninth at the [[Konzerthaus Berlin|Schauspielhaus]] in East Berlin, with {{Lang|de|Freiheit}} (Freedom) replacing {{Lang|de|Freude}} (Joy), to celebrate the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] during Christmas 1989.{{sfn|Makell|2002|p=98}} This concert was performed by an orchestra and chorus made up of many nationalities: from both Germanies, the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] and Chorus, the Chorus of the [[Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin)|Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra]], and members of the [[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden]], the Philharmonischer Kinderchor Dresden; from the Soviet Union, members of the orchestra of the [[Kirov Theatre]]; from the United Kingdom, members of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]; from the US, members of the New York Philharmonic; and from France, members of the [[Orchestre de Paris]]. Soloists were [[June Anderson]], soprano, [[Sarah Walker (mezzo-soprano)|Sarah Walker]], mezzo-soprano, [[Klaus König]], tenor, and [[Jan-Hendrik Rootering]], bass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Naxos 2072038&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=2072038 |title=Ode To Freedom – Beethoven: Symphony No. 9|accessdate=26 November 2006 |author=Naxos |authorlink=Naxos Records |year=2006 |work=Naxos.com Classical Music Catalogue}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last time that Bernstein conducted the symphony; he died ten months later.

Sir [[Georg Solti]] recorded the symphony with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] and [[Chicago Symphony Chorus]] on two occasions: first in 1972 with soloists [[Pilar Lorengar]], [[Yvonne Minton]], [[Stuart Burrows]], and [[Martti Talvela]]; and again in 1986 with soloists [[Jessye Norman]], Reinhild Runkel, [[Robert Schunk]], and [[Hans Sotin]]. On both occasions, the chorus was prepared by [[Margaret Hillis]]. The second recording won the [[Grammy Awards of 1988|1987 Grammy Award]] for Best Orchestral Performance.&lt;ref&gt;

The BBC Proms Youth Choir performed the piece alongside Sir [[Georg Solti]]'s UNESCO World Orchestra for Peace at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] during the 2018 [[The Proms|Proms]] at Prom 9, titled &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot; as a commemoration to the centenary of the end of [[World War I|World War One]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/emrz3d|title=Prom 9: War &amp; Peace|website=BBC Music Events|language=en|access-date=2019-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been various attempts to record the Ninth to come closer to what Beethoven's contemporaries would have heard, i.e., with [[Historically informed performance|period instruments]]:

* [[Roger Norrington]] conducting the [[London Classical Players]] recorded it with period instruments for a 1987 release by [[EMI Records]] (rereleased in 1997 under the [[Virgin Classics]] label).
* [[Benjamin Zander]] made a 1992 recording of the Ninth with the [[Boston Philharmonic Orchestra]] and noted soprano Dominique Labelle (who first performed the work with Robert Shaw), following Beethoven's own metronome markings. Following further research, Zander released a second recording with the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] in 2018 and paired it with a 3-hour audio lecture defending his new interpretation.
* [[Philippe Herreweghe]] recorded the Ninth with his period-instrument [[Orchestre des Champs-Élysées]] and his [[Collegium Vocale Gent|Collegium Vocale]] chorus for [[Harmonia Mundi]] in 1999.
* Sir [[John Eliot Gardiner]] recorded his period-instrument version of the Ninth Symphony,{{sfn|Makell|2002|p=99}} conducting his [[Monteverdi Choir]] and [[Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique]] in 1992. It was first released by [[Deutsche Grammophon]] in 1994 on their early music Archiv Produktion label as part of his complete cycle of the Beethoven symphonies. His soloists included [[Ľuba Orgonášová]], [[Anne Sofie von Otter]], [[Anthony Rolfe Johnson]] and Gilles Cachemaille.
* An additional period-instrument recording by [[Christopher Hogwood]] and the [[Academy of Ancient Music]] was released in 1997 under the label [[Éditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre]].

At 79 minutes, one of the longest Ninths recorded is [[Karl Böhm]]'s, conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in 1981 with [[Jessye Norman]] and [[Plácido Domingo]] among the soloists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Symphony-No-Ludwig-van/dp/B000001GN4/ref=sr_1_1 Beethoven: Symphony No. 9], [[Karl Böhm]] conducting the [[Vienna Philharmonic]]; [[Jessye Norman]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Brigitte Fassbaender]], [[Walter Berry (bass-baritone)|Walter Berry]]  (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Haus-UngargasseNr5-Tafel2.jpg|thumb|343x343px|Plate installed at Building Ungargasse No. 5. It says: &quot;In this house Ludwig van Beethoven finished his Symphony No. 9 during winter 1823/24. In memorial of the centenary of the world premiere on May 7, 1824 the plate was dedicated to the master and his work by the [[Wiener Schubertbund]] on May 7, 1924.&quot;]]
Many later composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]] and beyond were influenced by the Ninth Symphony.

An important theme in the finale of [[Johannes Brahms]]' [[Symphony No. 1 (Brahms)|Symphony No. 1 in C minor]] is related to the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; theme from the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. When this was pointed out to Brahms, he is reputed to have retorted &quot;Any fool can see that!&quot; Brahms's first symphony was, at times, both praised and derided as &quot;Beethoven's Tenth&quot;.

The Ninth Symphony influenced the forms that [[Anton Bruckner]] used for the movements of his symphonies. His [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 3]] is in the same D-minor key as Beethoven's 9th and makes substantial use of thematic ideas from it. The colossal slow movement of Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7]], &quot;as usual&quot;, takes the same A–B–A–B–A form as the 3rd movement of Beethoven's symphony and also uses some figuration from it.&lt;ref name=taruskin&gt;{{Cite book| first=Richard |last=Taruskin |authorlink=Richard Taruskin |year=2010 |title=Music in the Nineteenth Century |series=The Oxford History of Western Music |volume=3 |pages=747–751 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-538483-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opening notes of the third movement of his [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9 (''From the New World'')]], [[Antonín Dvořák]] pays homage to the scherzo of this symphony with his falling fourths and timpani strokes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Steinberg, Michael]]. ''The Symphony: a listeners guide''. p. 153. Oxford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, [[Béla Bartók]] borrows the opening [[Motif (music)|motif]] of the scherzo from Beethoven's Ninth symphony to introduce the second movement scherzo in his own Four Orchestral Pieces, Op. 12 (Sz 51).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Orrin|title=About the Piece {{!}} Four Orchestral Pieces, Op. 12|url=http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/four-orchestral-pieces-op-12-bela-bartok|publisher=Los Angeles Philharmonic|accessdate=27 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608004144/http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/four-orchestral-pieces-op-12-bela-bartok|archive-date=8 June 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartók|first=Béla|title=4 Pieces, Op. 12 – Violin I – (Musical Score)|year=1912|publisher=Universal Edition|pages=3|url=http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8b/IMSLP54751-PMLP46172-Bartok-Op12.Violin1.pdf|access-date=25 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225203314/http://hz.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/8/8b/IMSLP54751-PMLP46172-Bartok-Op12.Violin1.pdf|archive-date=25 December 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One legend is that the compact disc was deliberately designed to have a 74-minute playing time so that it could accommodate Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. [[Kees Immink]], Philips' chief engineer, who developed the CD, recalls that a commercial tug-of-war between the development partners, Sony and Philips, led to a settlement in a neutral 12-cm diameter format. The 1951 performance of the Ninth Symphony conducted by [[Wilhelm Furtwängler|Furtwängler]] was brought forward as the perfect excuse for the change,&lt;ref name=&quot;Immink2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

===Use as (national) anthem===
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Anthem of Europe (US Navy instrumental short version).ogg|title=Anthem of Europe (short version)}}
During the division of Germany in the [[Cold War]], the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; segment of the symphony was played in lieu of an anthem at the Olympic Games for the [[United Team of Germany]] between 1956 and 1968. In 1972, the musical backing (without the words) was adopted as the [[Anthem of Europe]] by the [[Council of Europe]] and subsequently by the [[European Communities]] (now the [[European Union]]) in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/anthem/index_en.htm|title=The European Anthem|publisher=Europa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/anthem/index_en.htm Europa – The EU at a glance – The European Anthem&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; was used as the national anthem of [[Rhodesia]] between 1974 and 1979, as &quot;[[Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cHBmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XosNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6475,5011881&amp;dq &quot;Rhodesia picks Ode to Joy&quot;], ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'', 30 August 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use as a hymn melody===
In 1907, the Presbyterian pastor [[Henry van Dyke]] wrote the hymn &quot;[[The Hymn of Joy|Joyful, Joyful, we adore thee]]&quot; while staying at [[Williams College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Dyke|first=Henry|title=The poems of Henry van Dyke|year=2004|publisher=Fredonia Books|location=Netherlands|isbn=1410105741}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn is commonly sung in English-language churches to the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; melody from this symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Rev.

===Year-end tradition===
The [[Trade unions in Germany|German]] [[workers' movement]] began the tradition of performing the Ninth Symphony on New Year's Eve in 1918. Performances started at 11pm so that the symphony's finale would be played at the beginning of the new year. This tradition continued during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi period]] and was also observed by [[East Germany]] after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hr-online.de/servlet/de.hr.cms.servlet.File/11-006.pdf?enc=d3M9aHJteXNxbCZibG9iSWQ9MTE5NDAzNDkmaWQ9NDA3NDE2MTkmZm9yY2VEb3dubG9hZD0x &quot;Beethovens 9.

The Ninth Symphony is traditionally performed throughout Japan at the end of the year. In December 2009, for example, there were 55 performances of the symphony by various major orchestras and choirs in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brasor&quot;&gt;Brasor, Philip, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101224r1.html Japan makes Beethoven's Ninth No. 1 for the holidays]&quot;, ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 24 December 2010, p. 20, retrieved on 24 December 2010; {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609215442/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20101224r1.html |date=9 June 2011 }}&lt;br /&gt;Uranaka, Taiga, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19991201a5.html Beethoven concert to fete students' wartime sendoff]&quot;, ''The Japan Times'', 1 December 1999, retrieved on 24 December 2010. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609215516/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19991201a5.html |date=9 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was introduced to Japan during World War I by German prisoners held at the [[Bandō prisoner-of-war camp]]. Japanese orchestras, notably the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], began performing the symphony in 1925 and during World War II, the [[Empire of Japan|Imperial government]] promoted performances of the symphony, including on New Year's Eve. In an effort to capitalize on its popularity, orchestras and choruses undergoing economic hard times during Japan's reconstruction, performed the piece at year's end. In the 1960s, these year-end performances of the symphony became more widespread, and included the participation of local choirs and orchestras, firmly establishing a tradition that continues today.
