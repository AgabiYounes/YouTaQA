It is a member of the [[Commonwealth Realms]] under the monarchy of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The [[archipelagic state]] consists of more than 700 [[island]]s, [[cay]]s, and [[islet]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and is located north of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] Island ([[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]), northwest of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], southeast of the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Florida]], and east of the [[Florida Keys]]. The capital is [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on the island of [[New Providence]]. The [[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]] describes the Bahamas' territory as encompassing {{convert|180000|sqmi|km2|order=flip|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of ocean space.

The Bahamas were inhabited by the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], a branch of the [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Taíno people]], for many centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bf.html |title=CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas|accessdate= 21 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] was the first European to see the islands, making his first landfall in the '[[New World]]' in 1492. Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]] shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on [[Hispaniola]], after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]].

The Bahamas became a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[crown colony]] in 1718, when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] to the Bahamas; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in the Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, the Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the [[Royal Navy]], while some [[Slavery in North America|North American slaves]] and [[Seminole]]s escaped to the Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognize the freedom of slaves carried by the ships of other nations which reached the Bahamas. Today [[Afro-Bahamians]] make up 90% of the population of 332,634.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;/&gt;

The Bahamas gained governmental independence in 1973 led by Sir Lynden O. Pindling, with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of The Bahamas|its queen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;/&gt; In terms of [[gross domestic product]] per capita, the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the [[Americas]] (following the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), with an economy based on tourism and offshore finance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html?countryName=Bahamas,%20The&amp;countryCode=bf&amp;regionCode=cam&amp;rank=49#bf Country Comparison :: GDP – per capita (PPP)].

==Etymology==
The name ''Bahamas'' is most likely derived from either the [[Taíno language|Taíno]] ''{{lang|tnq|ba ha ma}}'' (&quot;big upper middle land&quot;), which was a term for the region used by the indigenous people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bahama Saga: The epic story of The Bahama Islands |page=47 |author=Peter Barratt |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{lang|es|baja mar}}'' (&quot;shallow water or sea&quot; or &quot;low tide&quot;) reflecting the shallow waters of the area. Alternatively, it may originate from ''{{lang|tnq|[[Guanahani]]}}'', a local name of unclear meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bahamas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''The'' constitutes an integral part of the short form of the name and is, therefore, capitalized.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} So{{snd}}in contrast to &quot;the Congo&quot; and &quot;the United Kingdom&quot;{{snd}}it is proper to write &quot;The Bahamas&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} The name ''The Bahamas'' is thus comparable with certain non-English names that also use the definite article, such as Las Vegas or Los Angeles.

{{Main|History of The Bahamas}}

===Pre-colonial era===
The first inhabitants of the Bahamas were the [[Taíno people|Taino]] people, who moved into the uninhabited southern islands from [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]] around the 800s–1000s AD, having migrated there from South America; they came to be known as the [[Lucayan people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/the-Bahamas |title=Encyclopedia Britannica - The Bahamas |accessdate= 22 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 30,000 Lucayans inhabited the Bahamas at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s arrival in 1492.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The people who discovered Columbus : the prehistory of the Bahamas|last=Keegan, William F., 1955-|date=1992|publisher=University Press of Florida|others=Jay I.

===Arrival of the Spanish===
[[File:Landing of Columbus (2).jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Columbus's first landing, claiming possession of the [[New World]] for the [[Crown of Castile]] in [[caravel]]s; the ''[[Niña]]'' and the ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'', on Watling Island, an island of the Bahamas that the natives called [[Guanahani]] and that he named ''San Salvador'', on 12 October 1492.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC03615973 |title=The Journal of Christopher Columbus (during His First Voyage, 1492–93) |page=35 |author=Markham, Clements R. |year=1893 |publisher=London: The Hakluyt Society |accessdate=13 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Columbus's first landfall in what was to Europeans a 'New World' was on an island he named San Salvador (known to the Lucayans as ''[[Guanahani]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Whilst there is a general consensus that this island lay within the Bahamas, precisely which island Columbus landed on is a matter of scholarly debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Some researchers believe the site to be present-day [[San Salvador Island]] (formerly known as Watling's Island), situated in the southeastern Bahamas, whilst an alternative theory holds that Columbus landed to the southeast on [[Samana Cay]], according to calculations made in 1986 by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' writer and editor [[Joseph Judge]], based on Columbus's log.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; On the landfall island, Columbus made first contact with the Lucayans and exchanged goods with them, claiming the islands for the [[Crown of Castile]], before proceeding to explore the larger isles of the [[Greater Antilles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] theoretically divided the new territories between the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], placing the Bahamas in the Spanish sphere; however they did little to press their claim on the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; The Spanish did however make use of the native Lucayan peoples, many of whom were enslaved and sent to Hispaniola for use as forced labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; The slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting [[Infectious disease|diseases]] to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]]; half of the Taino died from [[smallpox]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edweek.org/login.html?source=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&amp;destination=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1991/10/09/06columb.h11.html&amp;levelId=2100 &quot;Schools Grapple With Columbus's Legacy: Intrepid Explorer or Ruthless Conqueror?&quot;], ''Education Week'', 9 October 1991&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these depredations the population of the Bahamas was severely diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dumene | first1 = Joanne E. | year = 1990 | title = Looking for Columbus | url = http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/DUMENE01.ART | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080919070618/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/DUMENE01.ART | url-status=dead | archive-date = 19 September 2008 | journal = Five Hundred Magazine | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 11–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of the English===
The English had expressed an interest in the Bahamas as early as 1629.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; However, it was not until 1648 that the first English settlers arrived on the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Known as the [[Eleutherian Adventurers]] and led by [[William Sayle]], they migrated to [[Bermuda]] seeking greater religious freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; These English [[Puritans]] established the first permanent European settlement on an island which they named '[[Eleuthera]]', Greek for 'freedom'. They later settled [[New Providence]], naming it Sayle's Island. Life proved harder than envisaged however, and many – including Sayle – chose to return to Bermuda.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; To survive, the remaining settlers [[Wrecking (shipwreck)#The Bahamas|salvaged goods from wrecks]].

In 1670, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the islands to the [[Lords Proprietors]] of the [[Province of Carolina|Carolinas]] in North America. They rented the islands from the king with rights of trading, tax, appointing [[Governor#British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations|governors]], and administering the country from their base on New Providence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anglican&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2009 |url=http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php |title=Diocesan History |publisher=Copyright 2009 Anglican Communications Department |accessdate=7 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505100933/http://bahamas.anglican.org/history.php |archivedate=5 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Piracy and attacks from hostile foreign powers were a constant threat.

Under the command of Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]]; [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]], the US Navy occupied Nassau in 1776, before being evacuated a few days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; In 1782 a Spanish fleet appeared off the coast of Nassau, and the city [[Capture of The Bahamas (1782)|surrendered without a fight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Spain returned possession of the Bahamas to Great Britain the following year, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Before the news was received however, the [[Capture of the Bahamas (1783)|islands were recaptured]] by a small British force led by [[Andrew Deveaux]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

After US independence, the British resettled some 7,300 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] with their African slaves in the Bahamas, including 2,000 from New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wertenbaker |first=Thomas Jefferson |date=1948 |title=Father Knickerbocker Rebels: New York City during the Revolution |location=New York |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |page=260 |author-link=Thomas J.

===19th century===
In 1807, the British abolished the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; During the following decades, the [[Royal Navy]] intercepted the trade. They resettled in the Bahamas thousands of Africans liberated from slave ships.

In the 1820s during the period of the [[Seminole Wars]] in Florida, hundreds of North American slaves and African Seminoles escaped from [[Cape Florida]] to the Bahamas. They settled mostly on northwest [[Andros Island]], where they developed the village of Red Bays. From eyewitness accounts, 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823, aided by Bahamians in 27 [[sloop]]s, with others using canoes for the journey. This was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at [[Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/subjects/ugrr/ntf_member/ntf_member_details.htm?SPFID=9173&amp;SPFTerritory=Florida&amp;SPFType=Site&amp;SPFKeywords=Bill%20Baggs%20Cape%20Florida%20State%20Park &quot;Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park&quot;], ''Network to Freedom'', National Park Service, 2010, accessed 10 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vignoles, Charles Blacker (1823) ''Observations on the Floridas'', New York: E.

Note: In trying to retrieve North American slaves off the ''Encomium'' from colonial officials (who freed them), the U.S. consul in February 1834 was told by the Lieutenant Governor that &quot;he was acting in regard to the slaves under an opinion of 1818 by Sir Christopher Robinson and Lord Gifford to the British Secretary of State&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; the Home Office in London had ruled that &quot;any slave brought to the Bahamas from outside the [[British West Indies]] would be manumitted.&quot; This led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by US nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835.&lt;ref name=&quot;horne103&quot;&gt;[[#Horne|Horne]], p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The American slave ships ''Comet'' and ''Encomium'' used in the United States domestic [[coastwise slave trade]], were wrecked off Abaco Island in December 1830 and February 1834, respectively.

There were 165 slaves on the ''Comet'' and 48 on the ''Encomium''.

These incidents, in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to US nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842, increased tension between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. They had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade. However, worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value, the United States argued that the United Kingdom should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress as part of the international trade.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The United States worried that the success of the ''Creole'' slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant ships.

During the [[American Civil War]] of the 1860s, the islands briefly prospered as a focus for [[blockade runners]] aiding the [[Confederate States]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bahamas.com/bahamas/island/templrgstandard.aspx?sectionid=4212&amp;level=2 Grand Bahama Island – American Civil War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025222208/http://www.bahamas.com/bahamas/island/templrgstandard.aspx?sectionid=4212&amp;level=2 |date=2007-10-25 }}'' The Islands of The Bahamas Official Tourism Site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, James.

=== Early 20th century===
The early decades of the 20th century were ones of hardship for many Bahamians, characterised by a stagnant economy and widespread poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Many eked out a living via subsistence agriculture or fishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The Duke of Windsor (1945).jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Edward VIII|Duke of Windsor]] (briefly King Edward VIII) and [[Governor of the Bahamas]] from 1940 to 1945]]
In August 1940, the [[Edward VIII|Duke of Windsor]] was appointed [[governor of the Bahamas]]. He arrived in the colony with his [[Wallis Simpson|wife]]. Although disheartened at the condition of Government House, they &quot;tried to make the best of a bad situation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor installed&quot;&gt;[[#Higham|Higham]], pp. 300–302&lt;/ref&gt; He did not enjoy the position, and referred to the islands as &quot;a third-class British colony&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Michael (1982). ''The Duke of Windsor's War'', London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-77947-8}}, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; He opened the small local parliament on 29 October 1940. The couple visited the &quot;Out Islands&quot; that November, on [[Axel Wenner-Gren]]'s yacht, which caused controversy;&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor opened&quot;&gt;[[#Higham|Higham]], pp. 307–309&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Foreign Office]] strenuously objected because they had been advised by United States intelligence that Wenner-Gren was a close friend of the [[Luftwaffe]] commander [[Hermann Göring]] of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor opened&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Michael (1982).

The Duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands. A 1991 biography by Philip Ziegler, however, described him as contemptuous of the Bahamians and other non-European peoples of the Empire. He was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in June 1942, when there was a &quot;full-scale riot&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windsor unrest&quot;&gt;[[#Higham|Higham]], pp. 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler said that the Duke blamed the trouble on &quot;mischief makers – [[communists]]&quot; and &quot;men of Central European [[Jewish]] descent, who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draft&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ziegler&quot;&gt;[[Philip Ziegler|Ziegler, Philip]] (1991).

===Post-Second World War===
[[File:Flag of the Bahamas (1964–1973).svg|thumb|The Bahamas used to be a [[Crown colony]] until it gained independence in 1973]]
Modern political development began after the [[Second World War]]. The first political parties were formed in the 1950s, split broadly along ethnic lines - the [[United Bahamian Party]] (UBP) representing the English-descended Bahamians (known informally as the 'Bay Street Boys'),&lt;ref name=badnews&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,843308,00.html|title=Bad News for the Boys |work=Time Magazine |date=20 January 1967 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Progressive Liberal Party]] (PLP) representing the Afro-Bahamian majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

A new constitution granting the Bahamas internal autonomy went into effect on 7 January 1964, with Chief Minister [[Sir Roland Symonette]] of the UBP becoming the first Premier.&lt;ref name=DN&gt;Nohlen, D.

===Post-independence===

Shortly after independence, the Bahamas joined the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] on 22 August 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Bahamas Joins IMF, World Bank |work= The Washington Post |date= 23 August 1973 |page= C2 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/148399257/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later the [[United Nations]] on 18 September 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 2 Germanys Join U.N. as Assembly Opens 28th Year |first= Robert |last= Alden |work= The New York Times |date= 19 September 1973 |page= 1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/119811597/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, the first two decades were dominated by Pindling's PLP, who went on to win a string of electoral victories.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Allegations of corruption, links with drug cartels and financial malfeasance within the Bahamian government failed to dent Pindling's popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, the economy underwent a dramatic growth period fuelled by the twin pillars of tourism and [[offshore finance]], significantly raising the standard of living on the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt; The Bahamas' booming economy led to it becoming a beacon for immigrants, most notably from [[Haiti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Geography of the Bahamas}}
The Bahamas consists of a [[List of islands of The Bahamas|chain of islands]] spread out over some {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip}} in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], located to the east of [[Florida]] in the [[United States]], north of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] and west of the British Overseas Territory of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] (with which it forms the [[Lucayan archipelago]]). It lies between latitudes [[20th parallel north|20°]] and [[28th parallel north|28°N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian west|72°]] and [[80th meridian west|80°W]] and straddles the [[Tropic of Cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;/&gt; There are some 700 islands and cays in total (of which 30 are inhabited) with a total land area of {{Convert|10010|km2||abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;https&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/The-Bahamas |title=Encyclopedia Britannica - The Bahamas |accessdate= 21 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], capital city of the Bahamas, lies on the island of [[New Providence]]; the other main inhabited islands are [[Grand Bahama]], [[Eleuthera]], [[Cat Island, Bahamas|Cat Island]], [[Rum Cay]], [[Long Island, Bahamas|Long Island]], [[San Salvador Island]], [[Ragged Island, Bahamas|Ragged Island]], [[Acklins]], [[Crooked Island (Bahamas)|Crooked Island]], [[Exuma]], [[Berry Islands]], [[Mayaguana]], the [[Bimini]] islands, [[Great Abaco]] and [[Great Inagua]].  The largest island is [[Andros, Bahamas|Andros]].&lt;ref name=&quot;https&quot;/&gt;

All the islands are low and flat, with ridges that usually rise no more than {{convert|15|to|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The highest point in the country is [[Mount Alvernia]] (formerly Como Hill) on Cat Island at 64m.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;/&gt;
===Climate===
{{See also|Geography of the Bahamas#Climate}}
[[File:Hurricane wilma devastation.jpg|thumb|left|Damaged homes in the Bahamas in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Wilma]] in 2005]]
[[File:Koppen-Geiger_Map_BHS_present.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|The Bahamas map of Köppen climate classification.]] According to the [[Koppen climate classification]], the climate of the Bahamas is mostly  [[tropical savannah climate]] or ''Aw'', with a hot and wet season and a warm and dry season. The low latitude, warm tropical [[Gulf Stream]], and low [[elevation]] give the Bahamas a warm and winterless climate. 

As with most tropical climates, seasonal rainfall follows the sun, and summer is the wettest season. There is only a 7&amp;nbsp;°C difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the Bahama islands. Every few decades low temperatures can fall below {{convert|10|°C}} for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes down from the North American mainland, however there has never been a frost or freeze recorded in the Bahama islands.  Only once in recorded history has snow been seen in the air anywhere in the Bahamas, this occurred in Freeport on 19 January, 1977, when snow mixed with rain was seen in the air for a short time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=40th Anniversary of Snow in South Florida |url=https://www.weather.gov/media/mfl/news/SnowArticleSouthFlorida40th.pdf |website=www.weather.gov |access-date=13 December 2018 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time, and average more than 3,000&amp;nbsp;hours or 340&amp;nbsp;days of sunlight annually. Much of the natural vegetation is tropical scrub and cactus and succulents are common in landscapes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bahamas |website=Caribbean Islands |url=http://www.caribbeanislands.org/the-bahamas/ |accessdate=4 December 2015 |date=2015-12-04 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tropical storms and hurricanes occasionally impact the Bahamas. In 1992, [[Hurricane Andrew]] passed over the northern portions of the islands, and [[Hurricane Floyd]] passed near the eastern portions of the islands in 1999. [[Hurricane Dorian]] of 2019 passed over the archipelago at destructive [[Saffir–Simpson scale|Category&amp;nbsp;5 strength]] with sustained winds of 185&amp;nbsp;mph (295&amp;nbsp;km/h) and wind gusts up to 220&amp;nbsp;mph (354&amp;nbsp;km/h), becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record to impact the northwestern islands of Grand Bahama and Great Abaco.&lt;ref name=DorianBahamas&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2019/al05/al052019.public.033.shtml? |title=Hurricane Dorian Advisory Number 33 |publisher=NHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue Lagoon.JPG|thumb|The [[Blue Lagoon Island]], Bahamas.]]
The Bahamas is part of the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], which continues into the Turks and Caicos Islands, the [[Mouchoir Bank]], the [[Silver Bank]], and the [[Navidad Bank]].&lt;ref name=Carew/&gt;

The Bahamas Platform, which includes the Bahamas, Southern Florida, Northern Cuba, the Turks and Caicos, and the [[Blake Plateau]], formed about 150 [[megaannum|Ma]], not long after the formation of the [[North Atlantic]]. The {{Convert|6.4|km||abbr=on|adj=on}} thick [[limestone]]s, which predominate in the Bahamas, date back to the [[Cretaceous]]. These limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas, assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the [[North American Plate|North American continental crust]]. Sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight. Thus, the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands. Then, at about 80 Ma, the area became flooded by the [[Gulf Stream]]. This resulted in the drowning of the Blake Plateau, the separation of the Bahamas from Cuba and Florida, the separation of the southeastern Bahamas into separate banks, the creation of the [[Cay Sal Bank]], plus the [[Bahama Banks|Little and Great Bahama Banks]]. Sedimentation from the &quot;carbonate factory&quot; of each bank, or [[atoll]], continues today at the rate of about 2&amp;nbsp;cm per [[kyr]]. [[Coral reef]]s form the &quot;retaining walls&quot; of these atolls, within which [[oolite]]s and [[pellets (petrology)|pellets]] form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sealey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sealey|first1=Neil|title=Bahamian Landscapes; An Introduction to the Geology and Physical Geography of The Bahamas|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|location=Oxford|isbn=9781405064064|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coral growth was greater through the [[Tertiary (geology)|Tertiary]], until the start of the [[ice ages]], and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m. In fact, an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one, 30 m below sea level. Oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks, increasing the temperature about 3&amp;nbsp;°C and the salinity by 0.5 per cent. [[Cementation (geology)|Cemented]] [[ooid]]s are referred to as grapestone. Additionally, giant [[stromatolite]]s are found off the [[Exuma Cays]].&lt;ref name=Sealey/&gt;{{rp|22,29–30}}

[[Sea level change]]s resulted in a drop in sea level, causing wind blown oolite to form [[sand dune]]s with distinct [[cross-bedding]]. Overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges, which become rapidly [[lithified]] through the action of rainwater, called [[eolianite]]. Most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45 m, though Cat Island has a ridge 60 m in height. The land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swamps.&lt;ref name=Sealey/&gt;{{rp|41–59,61–64}}

[[Solution weathering]] of the limestone results in a &quot;Bahamian [[Karst]]&quot; topography. This includes [[pothole (geology)|potholes]], [[blue hole]]s such as [[Dean's Blue Hole]], [[sinkhole]]s, [[beachrock]] such as the [[Bimini Road]] (&quot;pavements of Atlantis&quot;), [[caliche|limestone crust]], caves due to the lack of rivers, and [[sea caves]]. Several blue holes are aligned along the South Andros [[fault (geology)|Fault]] line. [[Tidal flat]]s and [[tidal creek]]s are common, but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as [[Great Bahama Canyon]] with the evidence of [[turbidity current]]s and [[turbidite]] deposition.&lt;ref name=Sealey/&gt;{{rp|33–40,65,72–84,86}}

The [[stratigraphy]] of the islands consists of the [[Middle Pleistocene]] Owl's Hole [[formation (geology)|Formation]], overlain by the [[Late Pleistocene]] Grotto Beach Formation, and then the [[Holocene]] Rice Bay Formation. However, these units are not necessarily stacked on top of each other but can be located laterally. The oldest formation, Owl's Hole, is capped by a [[terra rossa (soil)|terra rosa]] [[paleosoil]], as is the Grotto Beach, unless [[eroded]]. The Grotto Beach Formation is the most widespread.&lt;ref name=Carew&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carew|first1=James|last2=Mylroie|first2=John|editor1-last=Vacher|editor1-first=H.L.|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=T.|title=Geology of Bahamas, in Geology and Hydrology of Carbonate Islands, Developments in Sedimentology 54|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier Science B.V.|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780444516442|pages=91–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahamas has a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[centre-left]] [[Progressive Liberal Party]] and the [[centre-right]] [[Free National Movement]]. A handful of other political parties have been unable to win election to parliament; these have included the [[Bahamas Democratic Movement]], the Coalition for Democratic Reform, Bahamian Nationalist Party and the [[Democratic National Alliance (Bahamas)|Democratic National Alliance]].

===Foreign relations===
{{Further|Foreign relations of the Bahamas}}

The Bahamas has strong bilateral relationships with the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], represented by an ambassador in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[High Commissioner]] in [[London]]. The Bahamas also associates closely with other nations of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM).

===Armed forces===
{{Main|Royal Bahamas Defence Force}}

[[File:Hmbsnassau.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMBS|Nassau|P-61}}]]
The Bahamanian military is the Royal Bahamas Defence Force (RBDF),&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;/&gt; the navy of the Bahamas which includes a land unit called Commando Squadron (Regiment) and an Air Wing (Air Force). Under the Defence Act, the RBDF has been mandated, in the name of the [[Elizabeth II of The Bahamas|queen]], to defend the Bahamas, protect its territorial integrity, patrol its waters, provide assistance and relief in times of disaster, maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of the Bahamas, and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council. The Defence Force is also a member of the Caribbean Community ([[Caricom|CARICOM]])'s Regional Security Task Force.

The RBDF came into existence on 31 March 1980. Its duties include defending the Bahamas, stopping [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggling]], illegal immigration and poaching, and providing assistance to mariners. The Defence Force has a fleet of 26 coastal and inshore patrol craft along with 3 aircraft and over 1,100 personnel including 65 officers and 74 women.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:Districts of the Bahamas (Labeled).png|thumb|upright=1.8|Districts of the Bahamas]]
{{Main|Local government in the Bahamas}}
The districts of the Bahamas provide a system of local government everywhere except [[New Providence]] (which holds 70 percent of the national population), whose affairs are handled directly by the central government. In 1996, the Bahamian Parliament passed the &quot;Local Government Act&quot; to facilitate the establishment of family island administrators, local government districts, local district councillors and local town committees for the various island communities. The overall goal of this act is to allow the various elected leaders to govern and oversee the affairs of their respective districts without the interference of the central government. In total, there are 32 districts, with elections being held every five years. There are 110 councillors and 281 town committee members elected to represent the various districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/bahamasweb2/home.nsf/vContentW/A5FB7665F3E4341306256F0000763055 Family Island District Councillors &amp; Town Committee Members]. Bahamas.gov.bs. Retrieved on 20 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each councillor or town committee member is responsible for the proper use of public funds for the maintenance and development of their constituency.

===National flag===
{{main|Flag of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Flag of the Bahamas.svg|thumb|upright|The national flag of the Bahamas]]
The Bahamian flag was adopted in 1973. Its colours symbolise the strength of the Bahamian people; its design reflects aspects of the natural environment (sun and sea) and economic and social development.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;/&gt; The flag is a black equilateral triangle against the mast, superimposed on a horizontal background made up of three equal stripes of aquamarine, gold and aquamarine.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA World Factbook – The Bahamas&quot;/&gt;

===Coat of arms===
{{Main|Coat of arms of the Bahamas}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Bahamas.svg|thumb|upright|Bahamian Coat of Arms]]

The coat of arms of the Bahamas contains a shield with the national symbols as its focal point. The shield is supported by a [[marlin]] and a [[flamingo]], which are the national animals of the Bahamas. The flamingo is located on the land, and the marlin on the sea, indicating the geography of the islands.

On top of the shield is a conch shell, which represents the varied marine life of the island chain. The conch shell rests on a helmet. Below this is the actual shield, the main symbol of which is a ship representing the ''[[Santa Maria (ship)|Santa María]]'' of Christopher Columbus, shown sailing beneath the sun. Along the bottom, below the shield appears a banner upon which is the national motto:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamasschools.com/National%20Coat%20of%20Arms.htm ASJ-Bahamas National Coat of Arms].

===National flower===
The [[Tecoma stans|yellow elder]] was chosen as the national flower of the Bahamas because it is native to the Bahama islands, and it blooms throughout the year.

Selection of the yellow elder over many other flowers was made through the combined popular vote of members of all four of New Providence's garden clubs of the 1970s—the Nassau Garden Club, the Carver Garden Club, the International Garden Club and the [[YWCA]] Garden Club. They reasoned that other flowers grown there—such as the [[bougainvillea]], [[hibiscus]] and [[Delonix regia|poinciana]]—had already been chosen as the national flowers of other countries. The yellow elder, on the other hand, was unclaimed by other countries (although it is now also the national flower of the [[United States Virgin Islands]]) and also the yellow elder is native to the family islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahamasschools.com/Symbol%20-%20Flower.htm ASJ-Bahamas Symbol – Flower].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Bahamas}}
By the terms of [[Lists of countries by GDP per capita|GDP per capita]], the Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD GDP (current US$) | Data | Table].

===Tourism===
[[File:Atlantis paradise.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Atlantis Paradise Island]] in Nassau]]
The Bahamas relies heavily on [[tourism]] to generate most of its economic activity. Tourism as an industry not only accounts for about 50% of the Bahamian GDP, but also provides jobs for about half of the country's workforce.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/The-Bahamas-ECONOMY.html &quot;The Bahamas – Economy&quot;], ''Encyclopedia of the Nations'', Retrieved 21 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahamas attracted 5.8 million visitors in 2012, more than 70% of whom were cruise visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Spencer|first=Andrew|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LVdxDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=bahamas+2012+tourist+70%25+cruise#v=onepage&amp;q=bahamas%202012%20tourist%2070%25%20cruise&amp;f=false|title=Travel and Tourism in the Caribbean: Challenges and Opportunities for Small Island Developing States|date=2018-07-14|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-319-69581-5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial services===
After tourism, the next most important economic sector is banking and [[Offshore financial centre|offshore international financial services]], accounting for some 15% of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The government has adopted incentives to encourage foreign financial business, and further banking and finance reforms are in progress. The government plans to merge the regulatory functions of key financial institutions, including the [[Central Bank of the Bahamas]] (CBB) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The Central Bank administers restrictions and [[Capital control|controls on capital]] and money market instruments. The [[Bahamas Securities Exchange|Bahamas International Securities Exchange]] consists of 19 listed public companies. Reflecting the relative soundness of the banking system (mostly populated by Canadian banks), the impact of the global financial crisis on the financial sector was limited.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Tree map export 2009 Bahamas.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of the Bahamas exports.]]
The economy has a very competitive tax regime (classified by some as a [[tax haven]]). The government derives its revenue from import tariffs, [[VAT]], licence fees, property and stamp taxes, but there is no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributions Table|url=http://www.nib-bahamas.com/_m1722/Brochures/default.aspx|publisher=The National Insurance Board of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas|accessdate=22 December 2011|date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, overall tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was 17.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bf.html Bahamas, The].

{{Further|Agriculture in the Bahamas}}

Agriculture and manufacturing form the third largest sector of the Bahamian economy, representing 5–7% of total GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Major crops include [[onion]]s, [[okra]], [[tomato]]es, [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[grapefruit]], [[cucumber]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], and [[sweet potato]]es.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Since the colonial era of plantations, [[Africans]] or [[Afro-Bahamians]] have been the largest ethnic group in the Bahamas, whose primary ancestry was based in [[West Africa]]. The first Africans to arrive to the Bahamas were freed slaves from [[Bermuda]]; they arrived with the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]] looking for new lives.

The [[Haitians|Haitian]] community in the Bahamas is also largely of African descent and numbers about 80,000. Due to an extremely high immigration of Haitians to the Bahamas, the Bahamian government started deporting illegal Haitian immigrants to their homeland in late 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Nick (20 September 2009), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8257660.stm &quot;Bahamas outlook clouds for Haitians&quot;], BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of the Bahamas|Music of the Bahamas}}

[[File:Junkanoo.jpg|thumb|[[Junkanoo]] celebration in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]]]
The culture of the islands is a mixture of African (Afro-Bahamians being the largest ethnicity), British (as the former colonial power) and American (as the dominant country in the region and source of most tourists).&lt;ref name=&quot;https&quot;/&gt;

A form of African-based folk magic ([[obeah]]) is practised by some Bahamians, mainly in the Family Islands (out-islands) of the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2005 – Bahamas|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2005/51625.htm|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of obeah is illegal in the Bahamas and punishable by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.bahamas.gov.bs/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/1873/1873-0015/PenalCode_1.pdf &quot;Practising Obeah, etc.&quot;], Ch. 84 Penal Code. laws.bahamas.gov.bs&lt;/ref&gt;

In the less developed outer islands (or Family Islands), handicrafts include basketry made from palm fronds. This material, commonly called &quot;straw&quot;, is plaited into hats and bags that are popular tourist items. Another use is for so-called &quot;Voodoo dolls&quot;, even though such dolls are the result of foreign influences and not based in historic fact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hurbon, Laennec]] (1995). &quot;American Fantasy and Haitian Vodou.&quot; ''Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou''. Ed. Donald J. Cosentino. Los Angeles: [[UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History]], pp. 181–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Junkanoo]] is a traditional Afro-Bahamian street parade of 'rushing', music, dance and art held in Nassau (and a few other settlements) every [[Boxing Day]] and [[New Year's Day]]. Junkanoo is also used to celebrate other holidays and events such as Emancipation Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;https&quot;/&gt;

[[Regatta]]s are important social events in many family island settlements. They usually feature one or more days of sailing by old-fashioned [[Boat|work boats]], as well as an onshore festival.

Many dishes are associated with [[Bahamian cuisine]], which reflects Caribbean, African and European influences. Some settlements have festivals associated with the traditional crop or food of that area, such as the &quot;Pineapple Fest&quot; in Gregory Town, [[Eleuthera]] or the &quot;Crab Fest&quot; on Andros. Other significant traditions include [[story telling]].

Bahamians have created a rich literature of poetry, short stories, plays and short fictional works. Common themes in these works are (1) an awareness of change, (2) a striving for sophistication, (3) a search for identity, (4) nostalgia for the old ways and (5) an appreciation of beauty. Some major writers are Susan Wallace, Percival Miller, Robert Johnson, Raymond Brown, O.M. Smith, William Johnson, Eddie Minnis and [[Winston Saunders]].&lt;ref&gt;Collinwood, Dean W. and Dodge, Steve (1989) ''Modern Bahamian Society'', Caribbean Books, {{ISBN|0931209013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collinwood | first1 = Dean | last2 = Phillips | first2 = Rick | year = 1990 | title = The National Literature of the New Bahamas | url = | journal = Weber Studies | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 43–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahamas culture is rich with beliefs, traditions, folklore and legend. The best-known folklore and legends in the Bahamas include the [[lusca]] and [[chickcharney]] creatures of Andros, Pretty Molly on Exuma Bahamas and the Lost City of [[Atlantis]] on Bimini Bahamas.
