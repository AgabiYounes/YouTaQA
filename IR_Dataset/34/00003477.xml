The '''economy of the Bahamas''' is dependent upon [[tourism]] and [[offshore banking]]. The [[Bahamas]] is the richest country in the [[West Indies]] and is ranked 14th in North America for nominal GDP.&lt;ref&gt;http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-gdp/&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a stable, developing nation in the [[Lucayan archipelago]] with a population of 391,232 (2016). Steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences had led to solid GDP growth for many years, but the slowdown in the US economy and the attacks of September 11, 2001 held back growth in these sectors in 2001-03. Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for about 15% of GDP. However, since December 2000, when the government enacted new regulations on the financial sector, many international businesses have left the Bahamas. Manufacturing and agriculture together contribute approximately 10% of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives for those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector, which depends on growth in the US, the source of more than 80% of the visitors. In addition to tourism and banking, the government supports the development of a &quot;2nd-pillar&quot;, e-commerce.

==Features of the Bahamian economy==
The Bahamian economy is almost entirely dependent on tourism and financial services to generate foreign exchange earnings. The European Union lists the Bahamas as one of several Caribbean &quot;uncooperative jurisdictions&quot; because it fails to meet tax fairness and transparency benchmarks.&lt;ref name=&quot;icijbahamas&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bahamas, US Virgin Islands And St. Kitts And Nevis Added To EU Blacklist|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/bahamas-us-virgin-islands-st-kitts-nevis-added-eu-blacklist/|agency=INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM OF INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISTS|publisher=icij.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
Tourism alone provides an estimated 51% of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) and employs about half the Bahamian workforce. In 2016, over 3 million tourists visited the Bahamas, most of whom are from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismtoday.com/services/statistics/foreign-air-sea|title=Total Arrivals (Air &amp; Sea Landed &amp; Cruise)|publisher=Tourism Today Network|year=2016|accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major contribution to the recent growth in the overall Bahamian economy is Kerzner International's Atlantis Resort and Casino, which took over the former Paradise Island Resort and has provided a much needed boost to the economy. In addition, the opening of Breezes Super Club and Sandals Resort also aided this turnaround. The Bahamian Government also has adopted a proactive approach to courting foreign investors and has conducted major investment missions to the [[Far East]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], and [[Canada]]. The primary purpose of the trips was to restore the reputation of The Bahamas in these markets.

===Offshore financial services===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}
Financial services constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy, accounting for up to 17% of GDP, due to the country's status as an offshore financial center. As of December 1998, 418 banks and trust companies have been licensed in the Bahamas. The Bahamas promulgated the International Business Companies (IBC) Act in January 1990 to enhance the country's status as a leading financial center. The Act simplified and reduced the cost of incorporating offshore companies in the Bahamas. Within 9 years, more than 100,000 [[International Business Company|IBC]]-type companies had been established. In February 1991, the government also legalized the establishment of [[Asset-protection trust|Asset Protection Trusts]] in the Bahamas. In December 2000, partly as a response to appearing the plenary [[FATF Blacklist]], the government enacted a legislative package to better regulate the financial sector, including creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit and enforcement of &quot;[[Know your customer|know-your-customer]]&quot; rules. Other initiatives include the enactment of the Foundations Act in 2004 and the planned introduction of legislation to regulate [[Trust company|Private Trust Companies]].

===Agriculture===
{{see also|Agriculture in the Bahamas}}
{{see also|Bahamian cuisine}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}
[[Agriculture]] and fisheries industry together account for 5% of GDP. The Bahamas exports lobster and some fish but does not raise these items commercially. There is no large scale agriculture, and most agricultural products are consumed domestically. The Bahamas imports more than $250 million in foodstuffs per year, representing about 80% of its food consumption. The government aims to expand food production to reduce imports and generate foreign exchange. It actively seeks foreign investment aimed at increasing agricultural exports, particularly specialty food items. The government officially lists beef and pork production and processing, fruits and nuts, dairy production, winter vegetables, and mariculture (shrimp farming) as the areas in which it wishes to encourage foreign investment.

=== Trade ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}
The Bahamian Government maintains the value of the [[Bahamian dollar]] on a par with the [[U.S. dollar]]. The Bahamas is a beneficiary of the U.S.-[[Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act]] (CBTPA), Canada's [[CARIBCAN]] program, and the European Union's Lome IV Agreement. Although the Bahamas participates in the political aspects of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), it has not entered into joint economic initiatives with other Caribbean states.

===Industry===
The Bahamas has a few notable industrial firms: the Freeport pharmaceutical firm, PharmaChem Technologies (GrandBahama) Ltd. (formerly Syntex); the BORCO oil facility, also in Freeport, which transships oil in the region; the [[Commonwealth Brewery]] in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], which produces [[Heineken Pilsener|Heineken]], [[Guinness]], and [[Kalik]] beers;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burnshouse.com Commonwealth Breweries / Burnshouse website]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bacardi|Bacardi Corp.]], which distills rum in Nassau for shipment to the U.S. and European markets. Other industries include sun-dried sea salt in Great Inagua, a wet dock facility in Freeport for repair of cruise ships, and mining of aragonite — a type of limestone with several industrial uses — from the sea floor at Ocean Cay. Other smaller but more nimble players in the banking industry include Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) Ltd. (FBB) and Royal Fidelity Merchant Bank &amp; Trust Limited (RFMBT). FBB offers a wide range of innovative banking products including loan products with built-in savings plans. RFMBT is the only merchant bank in the Bahamas and is a joint venture with Royal Bank of Canada. It provides investment products and services and attracts the majority of the corporate business deals in the Bahamas, most recently acting as financial advisor and placement agent for the largest initial public offering (IPO) ever in the Bahamas with the IPO of Commonwealth Brewery, a Heineken subsidiary.

The Hawksbill Creek Agreement established a duty-free zone in Freeport, The Bahamas' second-largest city, with a nearby industrial park to encourage foreign industrial investment. The [[Hong Kong]]-based firm, [[Hutchison Whampoa]], has opened a container port in Freeport. The Bahamian Parliament approved legislation in 1993 that extended most Freeport tax and duty exemptions through 2054.

==Taxation==
{{further|Taxation in the Bahamas}}
The Bahamas has no income tax, corporate tax, capital gains tax, or wealth tax. Payroll taxes fund social insurance benefits and amount to 3.9% paid by the employee and 5.9% paid by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contributions Table|url=http://www.nib-bahamas.com/_m1722/Brochures/default.aspx|publisher=The National Insurance Board of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas|accessdate=2011-12-22|date=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, overall tax revenue was 17.2% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahamas, The|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bf.html|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[value-added tax]] (VAT) of 7.5% has been levied 1 January 2015. It then increased from 7.5% to 12% effective from 1 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://inlandrevenue.finance.gov.bs/value-added-tax/about-vat/&lt;/ref&gt;
