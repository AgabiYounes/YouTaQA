'''''...Baby One More Time''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by American singer [[Britney Spears]]. It was released on January 12, 1999 through [[Jive Records]]. In June 1997, while Spears negotiated with her manager at the time, [[Lou Pearlman]], to join female pop group [[Innosense]], her mother, [[Lynne Spears]], asked a family friend and entertainment lawyer, [[Larry Rudolph]], for his opinion. Rudolph took interest and decided to pitch her to record labels. Rudolph submitted a tape of Britney Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] [[karaoke]] song, along with a demo tape of an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]. Jive Records was interested and appointed the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. After hearing the recorded material, Jive signed Spears to a multi-album deal.

Spears traveled to Sweden to work with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]], and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others. Martin presented a track titled &quot;Hit Me Baby (One More Time)&quot; to Spears and her management, which had been rejected by the girl group [[TLC (band)|TLC]]. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. Her debut album was completed in June 1998, and the song was released as &quot;[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]&quot; as Spears' debut single in October. The single became a global success, reaching number one in every country it charted in, became the best-selling song of 1999 in the UK, and has since become one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all-time]], selling over 10 million copies.

Upon release, the album received mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], with many labeling it silly and premature. ''...Baby One More Time'' was a large commercial success, debuting atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and [[Canadian Albums Chart]], and reached the top 5 in several countries. It received worldwide certifications, including a [[RIAA certification|14× platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of over 14 million copies in the US, of which [[Nielsen SoundScan]] recognizes 10.6 million copies sold.&lt;ref name=billboard2015/&gt; ''...Baby One More Time'' is Spears' most successful album with sales of over 25 million copies worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;bomtsales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/content/curious-case-britney-spears-5-reasons-why-princess-pop-rules-0 |title=The Curious Case Of Britney Spears: 5 Reasons Why The Princess of Pop Rules |website=VIBE |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all-time]].

Four additional singles were released from the album and Spears heavily promoted it through interviews and performances on national television. Furthermore, Spears embarked on her first headlining concert tour, entitled the [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] in 1999, and later continued on a second leg title the [[(You Drive Me) Crazy Tour]]. ''...Baby One More Time'' earned Spears [[Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; at the [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2000.

{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFC7E9|width=30%|align=left|quote=&quot;I had been in the studio for about six months listening and recording material, but I hadn't really heard a hit yet.

It just felt really right. I went into the studio and did my own thing with it, trying to give it a little more attitude than the demo. In 10 days, I never even saw Sweden. We were so busy.&quot;|source=—Spears talking to Chuck Taylor of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=|year=1998|title=JIVE's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time'|journal=Billboard|volume=110|issue=43|page=104|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=%22...baby+one+more+time%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22...baby%20one%20more%20time%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with the manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional [[demo (music)|demo]]. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and &quot;there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another [[Debbie Gibson]] or another [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]].&quot; Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.&lt;ref name=&quot;hughes145&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] Jeff Fenster stated, &quot;It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=April 15, 1999|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|last=Daly|first=Steven|issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from &quot;lower and less poppy&quot; delivery to &quot;distinctively, unmistakably Britney.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears recorded thirteen songs with White, including &quot;Autumn Goodbye&quot;, &quot;E-Mail My Heart&quot;, &quot;From the Bottom of My Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;I'm So Curious&quot;, &quot;I Will Still Love You&quot;, &quot;Luv The Hurt Away&quot;, &quot;Let Me Take You There&quot;, &quot;Soda Pop&quot;, &quot;Thinkin' About You&quot;, &quot;Nothing Less Than Real&quot;, &quot;Wishing on a Falling Star&quot; and &quot;You Got It All&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;liner&quot;&gt;''...Baby One More Time'' liner notes.

After hearing the material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot; /&gt; Spears flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], where half of the album was recorded from May 1998,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jorgenelofsson.com/biography/the-story-behind-britney-spears-sometimes/&lt;/ref&gt; with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rsintw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/britneyspears/articles/story/5938512/cover_story_britney_spears|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears|date=April 15, 1999|website=[[Rolling Stone]].

==Music and lyrics==
Spears originally envisioned &quot;[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary&quot;, but felt alright with her label's producers, since &quot;It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot; /&gt; The album opens with the first single &quot;[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]&quot;, a [[teen pop]] and [[dance-pop]] song that begins with a three-note [[motif (music)|motif]] in the bass range of the [[piano]]. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as &quot;[[We Will Rock You]]&quot; (1977), &quot;[[Start Me Up]]&quot; (1981), &quot;[[These Words]]&quot; (2004) and the theme song of the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' due to the fact the track &quot;makes its presence known in exactly one second&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;blender&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0027207|title=Britney Spears Baby One More Time – Sheet Music|work=Music Notes|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]|accessdate=November 21, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225042903/http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0027207|archivedate=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/baby-one-more-time-us-cd-single-r377377|title=...Baby One More Time (US CD Single) – Britney Spears|website=[[AllMusic]].

''...Baby One More Time'' received mixed reviews from critics.

Kyle Anderson of [[MTV]] said he &quot;was surprised in more ways than one &quot;with his first listening of ''...Baby One More Time'', commenting he &quot;expected there to be a lot of filler (there sort of is), though I didn't expect it to be as odd (at least sonically) as it ended up being. There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;popology&quot; /&gt; Barry Walters of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album two stars out of five,&lt;ref name=&quot;...Baby One More Time Album Review&quot; /&gt; and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and [[Samantha Fox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;...Baby One More Time Album Review&quot; /&gt; Walters also said that &quot;while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', is pure spam.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;...Baby One More Time Album Review&quot; /&gt; A ''[[NME]]'' reviewer rated ''...Baby One More Time'' 1 out of 10, saying that &quot;we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nme&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/britney-spears/853|title=...Baby One More Time|date=March 6, 1999|accessdate=October 4, 2011|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201446/http://www.nme.com/reviews/britney-spears/853|archivedate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found the album premature, commenting, &quot;hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched life that we all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking so fucking smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the happier for it.
