A '''bomber''' is a [[combat aircraft]] designed to attack ground and naval targets by dropping [[air-to-ground weaponry]] (such as [[bomb]]s), launching [[aerial torpedo|torpedoes]], or deploying [[air-launched cruise missile]]s. The first use of bombs dropped from an aircraft occurred in the [[Italo-Turkish War]], with the first major deployments coming in the [[World War I|First World War]] and [[World War II|Second World War]] by all major airforces causing devastating damage to cities, towns, and rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Strategic bombing during World War II|date=2020-01-03|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II&amp;oldid=933884551|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first purpose built bombers were the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Caproni Ca 30]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Bristol T.B.8]], both of 1913. Some bombers were decorated with [[Nose art]] or [[Victory marking]]s.

There are two major classifications of bomber, strategic, and tactical. [[Strategic bombing]] is done by [[heavy bomber]]s primarily designed for long-range bombing missions against [[strategic target]]s to diminish the enemy's ability to wage war by limiting access to resources through crippling infrastructure or reducing industrial output. Whilst tactical bombing is aimed at countering enemy military activity and in supporting offensive operations, and is typically assigned to smaller aircraft operating at shorter ranges, typically near the troops on the ground or against enemy shipping.
  
During [[WWII]] with engine power as a major limitation, combined with the desire for accuracy and other operational factors, bomber designs tended to be tailored to specific roles. However, in during the [[Cold War]] bombers were the only means of carrying [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear]] weapons to enemy targets, and held the role of [[deterrence theory|deterrence]]. With the advent of guided air-to-air missiles, bombers needed to avoid interception. High-speed and high-altitude flying became a means of evading detection and attack. With the advent of [[ICBM]]'s the role of the bomber was brought to a more tactical focus in close air support roles, and a focus on [[stealth technology]] for strategic bombers.

===Strategic===
{{further|Carpet bombing|Strategic bomber}}
[[Strategic bombing]] is done by [[heavy bomber]]s primarily designed for long-range bombing missions against [[strategic target]]s such as supply bases, bridges, factories, shipyards, and cities themselves,  to diminish the enemy's ability to wage war by limiting access to resources through crippling infrastructure or reducing industrial output. Current examples include the strategic [[nuclear bomb|nuclear-armed]] bombers: [[B-2 Spirit]], [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[Tupolev Tu-95]] 'Bear', and [[Tupolev Tu-22M]] 'Backfire'; historically notable examples are the: [[Gotha G.IV]], [[Avro Lancaster]], [[Heinkel He 111]], [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]], [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]], [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], and [[Tupolev Tu-16]] 'Badger'.

===Tactical===
{{further|interdictor|Attack aircraft}}
[[Tactical bombing]], aimed at countering enemy military activity and in supporting offensive operations, is typically assigned to smaller aircraft operating at shorter ranges, typically near the troops on the ground or against enemy shipping. This role is filled by tactical bomber class, which crosses and blurs with various other aircraft categories: [[light bomber]]s, [[medium bomber]]s, [[dive bomber]]s, [[interdictor]]s, [[fighter-bomber]]s, [[attack aircraft]], [[multirole combat aircraft]], and others.

*Current examples: [[Xian JH-7]], Dassault-Breguet [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D|Mirage 2000D]], and the [[Panavia Tornado|Panavia Tornado IDS]]
*Historical examples: [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ''Shturmovik'', [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'', [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]], [[Hawker Typhoon]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-27]].

In 1912, during the [[First Balkan War]], [[Bulgarian Air Force]] [[Aviator|pilot]] [[Christo Toprakchiev]] suggested the use of aircraft to drop &quot;bombs&quot; (called [[grenade]]s in the Bulgarian army at this time) on Turkish positions.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Simeon Petrov]] developed the idea and created several [[prototype]]s by adapting different types of grenades and increasing their payload.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth of a Legend&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Birth of a Legend | first = Arthur H.

[[File:Bristol two seater.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bristol T.B.8]], first purpose-built British bomber, 1913]]
The first heavier-than-air aircraft purposely designed for bombing were the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Caproni Ca 30]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Bristol T.B.8]], both of 1913.&lt;ref name= &quot;Aerial&quot;&gt;{{cite book|pages=9–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kr2Gc7btCxEC&amp;pg=PA9|title=Aerial Interdiction: Air Power and the Land Battle in Three American Wars|isbn=978-0-7881-1966-8|author1=Mark|date=July 1995|access-date=2015-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501083900/https://books.google.com/books?id=kr2Gc7btCxEC&amp;pg=PA9|archive-date=2016-05-01|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bristol T.B.8 was an early [[United Kingdom|British]] single [[Piston engine|engined]] [[biplane]] built by the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]]. They were fitted with a prismatic [[Bombsight]] in the front [[cockpit]] and a cylindrical bomb carrier in the lower forward fuselage capable of carrying twelve 10&amp;nbsp;lb (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) bombs, which could be dropped singly or as a salvo as required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mason, Francis K|title=The British Bomber since 1914|publisher=Putnam Aeronautical Books|location=London|year=1994|isbn=0-85177-861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft was purchased for use both by the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] and the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC), and three T.B.8s, that were being displayed in [[Paris]] during December 1913 fitted with bombing equipment, were sent to France following the outbreak of war. Under the command of [[Charles Rumney Samson]], a bombing attack on [[Germany|German]] gun batteries at [[Middelkerke]], [[Belgium]] was executed on 25 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Michael J.

The dirigible, or airship, was developed in the early 20th century.  Early airships were prone to disaster, but slowly the airship became more dependable, with a more rigid structure and stronger skin.  Prior to the outbreak of war, [[Zeppelin]]s, a larger and more streamlined form of [[airship]] designed by German Count [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]], were outfitted to carry bombs to attack targets at long range.  These were the first long range, strategic bombers. Although the German air arm was strong, with a total of 123 airships by the end of the war, they were vulnerable to attack and engine failure, as well as navigational issues.  German airships inflicted little damage on all 51 raids, with 557 Britons killed and 1,358 injured.  The German Navy lost 53 of its 73 airships, and the German Army lost 26 of its 50 ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roadman|first1=LTC Julian A.|title=A Combat Nightmare in WWII|date=2013|publisher=Triumph Press|isbn=9781484911846|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caproni Ca.32(300hp-Ca.2) with Gianni Caproni on board.jpg|thumb|right|[[Caproni Ca.3]], an Italian World War I heavy bomber, 1915.]]

The  Caproni Ca 30 was built by [[Gianni Caproni]] in [[Italy]]. It was a twin-boom [[biplane]] with three 67&amp;nbsp;kW (80&amp;nbsp;hp) [[Gnome rotary engine]]s and first flew in October [[1914 in aviation|1914]]. Test flights revealed power to be insufficient and the engine layout unworkable, and Caproni soon adopted a more conventional approach installing three 81&amp;nbsp;kW (110&amp;nbsp;hp) [[Fiat A.10]]s. The improved design was bought by the [[Italian Army]] and it was delivered in quantity from August [[1915 in aviation|1915]].

While mainly used as a [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]], Avro 504s were also briefly used as bombers at the start of the [[World War I|First World War]] by the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS) when they were used for raids on the German airship sheds.&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Francis K.

===Strategic bombing===

[[File:14082007-Illya-Muromec-1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets]], an early strategic heavy bomber.]]
[[File:Handley Page O-400.jpg|thumb|left|British [[Handley Page Type O]], 1918]]
Bombing raids and interdiction operations were mainly carried out by French and British forces during the War as the [[Luftstreitkräfte|German air arm]] was forced to concentrate its resources on a defensive strategy. Notably, bombing campaigns formed a part of the British offensive at the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915, with [[Royal Flying Corps]] squadrons attacking German railway 
stations in an attempt to hinder the logistical supply of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]]. The early, improvised attempts at bombing that characterized the early part of the war slowly gave way to a more organized and systematic approach to strategic and tactical bombing, pioneered by various air power strategists of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]], especially Major [[Hugh Trenchard]]; he was the first to advocate that there should be &quot;... sustained  [strategic bombing] attacks with a view to interrupting the enemy's railway communications ... in conjunction with the main operations of the Allied Armies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aerial&quot;/&gt;

When the war started, bombing was very crude (hand-held bombs were thrown over the side) yet by the end of the war long-range bombers equipped with complex mechanical bombing computers were being built, 
designed to carry large loads to destroy enemy industrial targets. The most important bombers used in World War I were the French [[Breguet 14]], British [[de Havilland DH-4]], German [[Albatros C.III]] and Russian 
[[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets]]. The [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[Sikorsky Ilya Muromets]], was the first four-engine bomber to equip a dedicated strategic bombing unit during [[World War I]]. This heavy bomber was unrivaled in the early stages of the war, as the Central Powers had no comparable aircraft until much later.

Long range bombing raids were carried out at night by multi-engine [[biplane]]s such as the [[Gotha G.IV]] (whose name was synonymous with all multi-engine German bombers) and later the [[Handley Page Type O]]; the majority of bombing was done by single-engined biplanes with one or two crew members flying short distances to attack enemy lines and immediate hinterland. As the effectiveness of a bomber was dependent on the weight and accuracy of its bomb load, ever larger bombers were developed starting in World War I, while considerable money was spent developing suitable bombsights.{{clear}}

With engine power as a major limitation, combined with the desire for accuracy and other operational factors, bomber designs tended to be tailored to specific roles. By the start of the war this included:

* [[dive bomber]] — ''specially strengthened for vertical diving attacks for greater accuracy.''
* [[light bomber]], [[medium bomber]] and [[heavy bomber]] — ''subjective definitions based on size.''
* [[torpedo bomber]] — ''specialized aircraft armed with torpedoes.''
* [[ground attack aircraft]] — ''aircraft used against targets on a battlefield such as troop or tank concentrations.
* [[night bomber]] — ''specially equipped to operate at night when opposing defences are limited.''
* [[Maritime patrol aircraft|maritime patrol]] — ''long range bombers that were used against enemy shipping, particularly submarines.''
* [[Fighter-bomber]] - a modified fighter aircraft used as a light bomber

Bombers are not intended to attack other aircraft although most were fitted with defensive weapons. World War II saw the beginning of the widespread use of high speed bombers which dispensed with defensive weapons to be able to attain higher speed, such as with the [[de Havilland Mosquito]], a philosophy that continued with many Cold War bombers.

Some smaller designs have been used as the basis for [[night fighter]]s, and a number of fighters, such as the [[Hawker Hurricane]] were used as ground attack aircraft, replacing earlier conventional light bombers that proved unable to defend themselves while carrying a useful bomb load.

===Cold War===
[[File:Tu-95 Bear D (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|a Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-95]] ''Bear'' bomber]]

At the start of the Cold War, bombers were the only means of carrying [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear]] weapons to enemy targets, and had the role of [[deterrence theory|deterrence]]. With the advent of guided air-to-air missiles, bombers needed to avoid interception. High-speed and high-altitude flying became a means of evading detection and attack. Designs such as the [[English Electric Canberra]] could fly faster or higher than contemporary fighters. When surface-to-air missiles became capable of hitting high-flying bombers, bombers were flown at low altitudes to evade radar detection and interception.

Once &quot;stand off&quot; nuclear weapon designs were developed, bombers did not need to pass over the target to make an attack; they could fire and turn away to escape the blast. Nuclear strike aircraft were generally finished in bare metal or [[anti-flash white]] to minimize absorption of [[thermal radiation]] from the [[Effects of nuclear explosions|flash]] of a [[nuclear explosion]]. The need to drop conventional bombs remained in conflicts with non-nuclear powers, such as the [[Vietnam War]] or [[Malayan Emergency]].

[[File:Boeing B-52 dropping bombs.jpg|thumb|left|A USAF B-52F over the North Vietnam.]]

The development of large strategic bombers stagnated in the later part of the Cold War because of spiraling costs and the development of the [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) – which was felt to have similar deterrent value while being impossible to intercept. Because of this, the United States Air Force [[XB-70 Valkyrie]] program was cancelled in the early 1960s; the later [[B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] and [[B-2 Spirit]] aircraft entered service only after protracted political and development problems. Their high cost meant that few were built and the 1950s-designed B-52s are projected to remain in use until the 2040s. Similarly, the Soviet Union used the intermediate-range [[Tupolev Tu-22M|Tu-22M]] 'Backfire' in the 1970s, but their [[Mach number|Mach 3]] bomber project stalled. The Mach 2 [[Tu-160|Tu-160 'Blackjack']] was built only in tiny numbers, leaving the 1950s Tupolev Tu-16 and [[Tupolev Tu-95|Tu-95]] 'Bear' heavy bombers to continue being used into the 21st century.

[[File:Avro Vulcan Bomber RAF.JPEG|thumb|The [[Avro Vulcan]] was part of the [[RAF]] [[V bomber]] force]]
The [[United Kingdom|British]] strategic bombing force largely came to an end when the [[V bomber]] force was phased out; the last of which left service in 1983. The French [[Mirage IV]] bomber version was retired in 1996, although the Mirage 2000N and the Rafale have taken on this role. The only other nation that fields strategic bombing forces is [[China]], which has a number of [[Xian H-6]]s.

===Modern era===

At present, the U.S. and Russia are involved in developing replacements for their legacy bomber fleets, the USAF with the [[Northrop Grumman B-21]] and the Russian Air Force with the [[PAK DA]]. A 1999 USAF report calls for the US bomber fleet to remain in service until the late 2030s-early 2040s, and the B-21 is scheduled to reach deployment in the 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;Tirpak, John A.

Also, it has been chosen to be able to stand against rising superpowers and other countries with semi-advanced military capability. Finally, a third reason is the role of long-term air support for areas with a low threat level (Iraq, Afghanistan), the latter referred to as close air support for the global [[war on terror]] (CAS for GWOT). The B-21 would thus be able to stay for extended periods on a same location (called persistence).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/12/214539/speed-bump-usaf-sets-modest-goals-for-new-bomber.html |title=Persistence in 2018 bomber |access-date=2009-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905013823/http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2007/06/12/214539/speed-bump-usaf-sets-modest-goals-for-new-bomber.html |archive-date=2008-09-05 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
