'''Baker Island''' (previously '''New Nantucket'''&lt;ref&gt;Rauzon, Mark J. (2016). ''Isles of Amnesia: The History, Geography, and Restoration of America's Forgotten Pacific Islands''. University of Hawai'i Press, Latitude 20.

The island lies almost halfway between [[Hawaii]] and [[Australia]]. Its nearest neighbor is [[Howland Island]], {{convert|42|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north-northwest; both have been claimed as [[territories of the United States]] since 1857, though the [[United Kingdom]] considered them part of the [[British Empire]] between 1885 and 1936.

The island covers {{convert|2.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=CIAWF&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges|work=The World Factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/um.html|accessdate=25 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328140738/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/um.html|archivedate=March 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with {{convert|4.8|km|abbr=on}} of coastline.&lt;ref name=CIAWF /&gt; The [[climate]] is [[equatorial climate|equatorial]], with little rainfall, constant wind, and strong sunshine. The terrain is low-lying and sandy: a [[coral island]] surrounded by a narrow [[fringing reef]] with a depressed central area devoid of a [[lagoon]] with its highest point being {{convert|8|m|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]].&lt;ref name=CIAWF /&gt;

The island now forms the Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge and is an [[Territories of the United States|unincorporated]] and [[unorganized territory]] of the U.S. which vouches for its [[Defense (military)|defense]]. It is visited annually by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]]. For statistical purposes, Baker is grouped with the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]]. Baker Island and [[Howland Island]] are also the last pieces of land that experience the [[New Year]] (earliest time zone - [[UTC−12:00]]).

Baker Island is one of three U.S. equatorial possessions, along with [[Jarvis Island]] and [[Howland Island]]. Baker Island is one of the most remote U.S. equatorial possessions.&lt;ref&gt;Rauzon, Mark J. (2016).

==Description==
A cemetery and rubble from earlier settlements are located near the middle of the west coast, where the boat landing area is located. There are no ports or harbors, with anchorage prohibited offshore. The narrow fringing reef surrounding the island can be a maritime hazard, so there is a [[day beacon]] near the old village site. Baker's abandoned [[World War II]] runway, {{convert|5,463|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, is completely covered with vegetation and is unserviceable.&lt;ref name=FWShistory /&gt;

The United States claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km|lk=in}} and [[territorial waters|territorial sea]] of {{convert|12| nmi|km|abbr=on}} around Baker Island.

During a 1935–1942 colonization attempt, the island was most likely on Hawaii time, which was then 10.5 hours behind [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Elgen M. |last1=Long|first2=Marie K.|last2= Long|title=Amelia Earhart: the mystery solved|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2000|page=206|quote=Thursday, July 1, &lt;nowiki&gt;[1937]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ... Howland Island was using the 10+30 hour time zone—the same as Hawaii standard time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is uninhabited the island's time zone is unspecified, but it lies within a [[Nautical time|nautical time zone]] 12 hours behind UTC ([[UTC−12:00]]).

==History==
[[File:Orthographic projection over Baker Island.png|thumb|left|Orthographic projection over Baker Island.]]
Baker was discovered in 1818 by Captain Elisha Folger of the [[Nantucket]] whaling ship ''Equator'', who called the island &quot;New Nantucket&quot;. In August 1825 Baker was sighted by Captain [[Starbuck (whaling family)#Obed Starbuck|Obed Starbuck]] of the ''Loper'', also a Nantucket whaler. The island is named for Michael Baker, who visited the island in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Evans Maude|title=Of islands and men: studies in Pacific history|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other references state that he visited in 1832, and again on August 14, 1839, in the [[whaler]] ''Gideon Howland'', to bury an American seaman.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan, 1941&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Baker claimed the island in 1855, then he sold his interest to a group who later formed the American Guano Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GAO/OGC-98-5 - U.S. Insular Areas: Application of the U.S. Constitution|date=November 7, 1997|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GAOREPORTS-OGC-98-5/content-detail.html|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=March 23, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927192012/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GAOREPORTS-OGC-98-5/content-detail.html|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Guano Companies in Litigation--A Case of Interest to Stockholders|date=May 3, 1865|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/03/news/guano-companies-litigation-case-interest-stockholders-supreme-court-general-term.html|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=March 23, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510145955/http://www.nytimes.com/1865/05/03/news/guano-companies-litigation-case-interest-stockholders-supreme-court-general-term.html|archivedate=May 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States took possession of the island in 1857, claiming it under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edwin Horace Bryan|title=American Polynesia: coral islands of the Central Pacific|publisher=Tongg Publishing Company|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|year=1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[guano]] deposits were mined by the American Guano Company from 1859 to 1878. As an example of the scale of the guano mining and its destination the following ship movements were reported in late 1868.&lt;ref&gt;Baker's Island Report, H.L.R. Johnson, Pacific Commercial Advertiser, 19 Dec 1868&lt;/ref&gt;
* British ship ''Montebello'', Capt Henderson, arrived Aug 17th 104 days from [[Liverpool]], loaded 650 tons guano, departed for [[Liverpool]] 9th Sep.
* American ship ''Eldorado'', Capt Woodside, arrived Sept 14th from [[Honolulu]], loaded 1550 tons guano, departed for [[Liverpool]] Oct 5th.
* British [[Barque|bark]] ''Florence Chipman'', Capt Smith, arrived Oct 13th from [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]], loaded 1400 tons guano, departed for [[Liverpool]] Nov 5th.

On February 27, 1869 the British ship ''Shaftsbury'' under Captain John Davies, which had arrived at Baker's Island on 5 February from [[Montevideo]], was wrecked after being driven onto the reef by a sudden wind shift and squall from the northwest, dragging her moorings with her.&lt;ref&gt;The loss of the British ship Shaftsbury, Pacific Commercial Advertiser, 12 Jun 1869&lt;/ref&gt; American ship ''Robin Hood'' was destroyed by fire while loading on 30 August 1869.&lt;ref&gt;Report from the guano islands, Pacific Commercial Advertiser, 25 Dec 1869&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 1886, the American Guano Company sold all its rights to the British firm [[John T. Arundel]] and Company, which made the island its headquarters for guano digging operations in the Pacific from 1886 to 1891. Arundel applied in 1897 to the British Colonial Office for a licence to work the island on the presumption that the U.S. had abandoned their claim. The United Kingdom then considered Baker Island to be a British territory, although they never formally annexed it. The United States raised the question at the beginning of the 1920s and after some diplomatic exchanges, they launched in 1935 the [[American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project]] and issued on May 1936 Executive Order 7358 to clarify their sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.att.net/~higley.family/HullMemo.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109003852/http://home.att.net/~higley.family/HullMemo.htm |archivedate=January 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all |title= Memorandum of Secretary of State Cordell Hull to the president, February 18, 1936 |year=1936|publisher=Franklin D.

Roosevelt|access-date=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This short-lived attempt at colonization, via the [[American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project]], began when American colonists arrived aboard the USCGC ''[[USCGC Itasca (1929)|Itasca]]'', the same vessel that brought colonists to neighboring [[Howland Island]], on April 3, 1935. They built a lighthouse and substantial dwellings, and they attempted to grow various plants. The settlement was named [[Meyerton, Baker Island|Meyerton]], after Captain H.A. Meyer of the [[United States Army]], who helped establish the camps in 1935. One sad-looking clump of coconut palms was jokingly called King-Doyle Park after two well-known citizens of Hawaii who visited on the ''Taney'' in 1938. This clump was the best on the island, planted near a water seep, but the dry climate and seabirds, eager for anything upon which to perch, did not give the trees or shrubs much of a chance to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anytravels.com/oceania/baker |accessdate=February 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723085352/http://www.anytravels.com/oceania/baker/ |archivedate=July 23, 2011 |title=Baker Island |website=Any Travels}}&lt;/ref&gt; King-Doyle Park was later adopted as a geographic name by the [[United States Geological Survey]]. Its population was four American civilians, all of whom were evacuated in 1942 after [[Japan]]ese air and naval attacks. During [[World War II]] it was occupied by the U.S. military.

On August 11, 1943, a US Army defense force arrived on Baker Island as part of the [[Battle of Kwajalein#Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]]. In September 1943 a {{convert|5463|ft|adj=on}} airfield was opened and was subsequently used as a staging base by [[Seventh Air Force]] [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] bombers for attacks on [[Mili Atoll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon|title=World War Two Pacific Island Guide| publisher=Greenwood Publishing| year=2002| isbn=9780313313950|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[45th Fighter Squadron]] operating [[Curtis P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] fighters operated from the airfield from September 1 - November 27, 1943.

[[LORAN]] radio navigation station Baker was a radio operations base in operation from September 1944 to July 1946. The station unit number was 91 and the radio call sign was NRN-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loran-history.info/Baker/baker.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824071630/http://www.loran-history.info/Baker/baker.htm |archivedate=August 24, 2010 }} LORAN STATION BAKER ISLAND 0 11 46.23 N 176 28 26.14 W&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
Baker has no natural fresh water sources. It is treeless, with sparse vegetation consisting of four kinds of grass,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Dept. of Interior. [http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/bhpage.htm Baker Island.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419040523/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Islandpages/bhpage.htm |date=April 19, 2012 }}  Retrieved July 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; prostrate vines and low-growing shrubs. The island is primarily a nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat for seabirds, shorebirds, and marine wildlife.

Several varieties of shorebirds and other species inhabit the island and nearby waters, some considered endangered. The [[ruddy turnstone]], [[bar-tailed godwit]], [[sanderling]] and [[Pacific golden plover]] are considered species of least concern. The [[bristle-thighed curlew]] is considered vulnerable on the national conservation priority scheme. [[Green turtles]] and [[hawksbill turtle]]s, both critically endangered, can be found along the reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/bakerisland/|title=Redirect Page|website=www.fws.gov|accessdate=April 29, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617053519/https://www.fws.gov/bakerisland/|archivedate=June 17, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seabird species such as the [[lesser frigatebird]], [[brown noddy]] and [[sooty tern]] use the island for nesting and roosting. The island is also believed to be a rest stop for arctic-breeding shorebirds.

==National Wildlife Refuge==
On June 27, 1974, Secretary of the Interior [[Rogers Morton]] created Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge which was expanded in 2009 to add submerged lands within {{convert|12|nmi|km}} of the island. The refuge now includes {{convert|531|acre|ha}} of land and {{convert|410184|acre|ha}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = White | first = Susan | title = Welcome to Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge | publisher = U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service | date = August 26, 2011 | url = http://www.fws.gov/bakerisland/ | accessdate = March 4, 2012 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120327151719/http://www.fws.gov/bakerisland/ | archivedate = March 27, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker, along with six other islands, was administered by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as part of the Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex. In January 2009, that entity was redesignated the [[Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument]] by President [[George W.

Public entry to the island is only by special use permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and it is generally restricted to scientists and educators. Representatives from the agency visit the island on average once every two years, usually coordinating transportation with an [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge| publisher =U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service| url =http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=12511| accessdate =April 23, 2013| url-status =live| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130516183112/http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=12511| archivedate =May 16, 2013| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruins and artifacts==
Debris from past human occupation is scattered throughout the island and in offshore waters. Most is from the U.S. military occupation of the island from 1942 to 1946. The most noticeable remnant is the {{convert|5,400|by|150|ft|m|adj=on}} airstrip. It is completely overgrown with vegetation and unusable.&lt;ref name=FWShistory&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/History.cfm?ID=12511|title=Baker Island : History|publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the northeast section, apparently the main camp area, are the remains of several buildings and heavy equipment. Five wooden antenna poles about {{convert|40|ft|m}} in height remain standing in the camp. Debris from several crashed airplanes and large equipment such as bulldozers is scattered around the island. Numerous bulldozer excavations containing the remnants of metal, fuel and water drums are scattered about the north central portion and northern edge of the island. The Navy reported the loss of 11 landing craft in the surf during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/pacific/planning/main/docs/HI-PI/HBJ/Baker%20Draft%20CCP.pdf|work=Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge Complex|title=Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge: Draft Comprehensive Conservation Plan and Environmental Assessment|date=August 2007|accessdate=December 3, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511083037/http://www.fws.gov/pacific/planning/main/docs/HI-PI/HBJ/Baker%20Draft%20CCP.pdf|archivedate=May 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
