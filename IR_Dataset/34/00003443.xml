'''Barratry''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ær|ə|t|r|i}} {{Respell|BARR|ə|tree}}) is a legal term with several meanings. In [[common law]], barratry is the offense committed by people who are &quot;overly officious in instigating or encouraging prosecution of groundless litigation&quot; or who bring &quot;repeated or persistent acts of litigation&quot; for the purposes of profit or harassment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/barratry Barratry at freedictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although it remains a crime in some jurisdictions, barratry has frequently been abolished as being anachronistic and obsolete. 

If barratrous litigation is deemed to be for the purpose of silencing critics, it is known as a [[strategic lawsuit against public participation]] (SLAPP). Jurisdictions that otherwise have no barratry laws may have SLAPP laws.

In [[admiralty law]], [[Barratry (admiralty law)|barratry]]  is misconduct by the master or crew of a vessel against the [[shipowner]] (or [[demise charter]]er), such misconduct damaging the ship or its cargo.

===== History =====

Being a common barrator was an offence under the [[common law]] of England. It was classified as a [[misdemeanor]]&lt;!--Note that &quot;misdemeanor&quot; is a correct spelling in British English usage for the legal term of art--&gt;. It consisted of &quot;persistently stirring up quarrels in the Courts or out of them&quot;. It is uncertain whether, in the ordinary way, persons charged with commission of the offence were dealt with by [[indictment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bailii.org&quot;&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]], [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1966/3.html Proposals to Abolish Certain Ancient Criminal Offences] (Law Com 3), paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two such cases tried at the [[Old Bailey]], one in 1735 and the other in 1741. In both cases, the finding was ''not guilty''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/search.jsp?count=0&amp;_offences_offenceCategory_offenceSubcategory=breakingPeace_barratry&amp;form=stats_offences Searched for all offences where offence category is barratry] [[Old Bailey Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Commission]] recommended for the offence to be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Law Commission (England and Wales)|The Law Commission]], [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1966/3.html Proposals to Abolish Certain Ancient Criminal Offences] (Law Com 3), paragraphs 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt; It said that there had been no indictments for this offence for &quot;many years&quot; and that, as an indictable misdemeanor, it was &quot;wholly obsolete&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bailii.org&quot;/&gt; Its recommendation was implemented by the Criminal Law Act 1967.

==== Scotland ====
In Scots law, barratry referred to the crime committed by a judge who is induced by bribery to pronounce judgment.

===United States===
Several jurisdictions in the United States have declared barratry (in the sense of a frivolous or harassing litigant) to be a [[crime]] as part of their [[tort reform]] efforts. For example, in the [[U.S. state]]s of [[California]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], barratry is a [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;''People v. Sanford'', 202 Cal. App. 3d Supp. 1 (1988); 18 Pa.C.S. 5109.  [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA3/202CA3dS1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okla. Stat. tit. 21 § 550-551.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Texas]], barratry is a misdemeanor on the first conviction, but a [[felony]] on subsequent convictions.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Penal Code section 38.12&lt;/ref&gt;

* California Penal Code Section 158: &quot;Common barratry is the practice of exciting groundless judicial proceedings, and is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six months and by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000).&quot;
* California Penal Code Section 159: &quot;No person can be convicted of common barratry except upon proof that he has excited suits or proceedings at law in at least three instances, and with a corrupt or malicious intent to vex and annoy.&quot;
* Revised Code of Washington 9.12.010: &quot;Every person who brings on his or her own behalf, or instigates, incites, or encourages another to bring, any false suit at law or in equity in any court of this state, with intent thereby to distress or harass a defendant in the suit, or who serves or sends any paper or document purporting to be or resembling a judicial process, that is not in fact a judicial process, is guilty of a misdemeanor; and in case the person offending is an attorney, he or she may, in addition thereto be [[disbarment|disbarred]] from practicing law within this state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rcw&quot;&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.12.010 RCW 9.12.010 Barratry], Revised Code of Washington. Accessed 2012-3-3.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Virginia laws on barratry, [[champerty and maintenance|champerty, and maintenance]] were overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States in ''[[NAACP v. Button]]'' 371 U.S. 415 (1963).
* Vermont Statutes [https://codes.findlaw.com/vt/title-13-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/vt-st-tit-13-sect-701.html Title 13, § 701]: &quot;A person who is a common barrator shall be fined not more than $50.00 and become bound with sufficient surety for his or her good behavior for not less than one year.&quot;
