'''Claude Louis Berthollet''' (9 December 1748 in [[Talloires]], France – 6 November 1822 in Arcueil, France) was a [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]]ard-French [[chemist]] who became vice president of the [[French Senate]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R. |last=Po-chia Hsia|author2=[[Lynn Hunt]], Thomas R. Martin, Barbara H. Rosenwein and Bonnie G. Smith|title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Culture, A Concise History, Volume II: Since 1340|edition=2nd|location=New York|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2007|page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his scientific contributions to theory of chemical equilibria via the mechanism of reverse chemical reactions, and for his contribution to modern chemical nomenclature. On a practical basis, Berthollet was the first to demonstrate the bleaching action of chlorine gas, and was first to develop a solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]] as a modern bleaching agent.

==Biography==
Claude Louis Berthollet was born in [[Talloires]], near [[Annecy]], then part of the [[Duchy of Savoy]], in 1749.

He started his studies at Chambéry and then in Turin where he graduated in medicine. Berthollet's great new developments in works regarding chemistry made him, in a short period of time, an active participant of the Academy of Science in 1780.

Berthollet, along with [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and others, devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names, which serves as the basis of the modern system of naming chemical compounds.

He also carried out research into [[dye]]s and [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]es, being first to introduce the use of [[chlorine]] gas as a commercial bleach in 1785. He first produced a modern bleaching liquid in 1789 in his laboratory on the quay [[Javel - André Citroën (Paris Métro)|Javel]] in [[Paris]], France, by passing [[chlorine]] gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as &quot;''Eau de Javel''&quot; (&quot;Javel water&quot;), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. Another strong chlorine oxidant and bleach which he investigated and was the first to produce, [[potassium chlorate]] (KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is known as ''Berthollet's Salt''.

Berthollet first determined the elemental composition of the gas [[ammonia]], in 1785.

Berthollet was one of the first chemists to recognize the characteristics of a [[Reversible reaction|reverse reaction]], and hence, [[chemical equilibrium]].

Berthollet was engaged in a long-term battle with another French chemist, [[Joseph Proust]], on the validity of the [[law of definite proportions]]. While Proust believed that chemical compounds are composed of a fixed ratio of their constituent elements irrespective of the methods of production, Berthollet believed that this ratio can change according to the ratio of the reactants initially taken. Although Proust proved his theory by accurate measurements, his theory was not immediately accepted partially due to Berthollet's authority. His law was finally accepted when [[Berzelius]] confirmed it in 1811, but it was found later that Berthollet was not completely wrong because there exists a class of compounds that do not obey the law of definite proportions. These [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s are also named ''berthollides'' in his honor.

Berthollet was one of several scientists who went with [[Napoleon]] to Egypt and was a member of the physics and natural history section of the [[Institut d'Égypte]].

==Awards and honours==
In April, 1789 Berthollet was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27berthollet%27%29 | title= Library and Archive Catalogue | publisher= Royal Society | accessdate= 13 December 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111121051838/http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27berthollet%27%29 | archive-date= 21 November 2011 | url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1809, Berthollet was elected an associate member first class of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, predecessor of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00002075 |title=Claude-Louis Berthollet (1748 - 1822) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1820&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsoced.org.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1822.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude-Louis Berthollet's 1788 publication entitled ''Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique'', published with colleagues [[Antoine Lavoisier]], [[Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], and [[Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy]],&lt;ref name=publication&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guyton de Morveau|first1=Louis Bernard|last2=Lavoisier|first2=Antoine Laurent|last3=Berthollet|first3=Claude-Louis|last4=Fourcroy|first4=Antoine-François de|title=Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0MMPAAAAQAAJ_2|date=1787|publisher=Chez Cuchet (Sous le Privilége de l'Académie des Sciences)|location=Paris, France}}&lt;/ref&gt; was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented at the Académie des Sciences (Paris) in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Award&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= 2015 Awardees|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/CCB-2015_Awardees.php|website=American Chemical Society, Division of the History of Chemistry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Chemical Sciences|date=2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Breakthrough&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/Citations/2015-Guyton%20de%20Morveau%20Lavoisier%20plaque.pdf|website=American Chemical Society, Division of the History of Chemistry|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Chemical Sciences|date=2015|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A French High School located in [[Annecy]] is named after him (Lycée Claude Louis Berthollet).

==Personal life==
Berthollet married Marguerite Baur in 1788.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsoced.org.uk&quot;/&gt;

Berthollet was accused of being an atheist.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated274&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Napoleon]] replies: &quot;How comes it, then, that [[Laplace]] was an atheist? At the Institute neither he nor [[Monge]], nor [[Berthollet]], nor [[Lagrange]] believed in God. But they did not like to say so.&quot; Baron [[Gaspard Gourgaud]], ''Talks of Napoleon at St. Helena with General Baron Gourgaud'' (1904), page 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Arcueil]], France in 1822.
