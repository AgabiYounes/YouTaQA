A '''Christmas tree''' is a decorated tree, usually an [[evergreen]] [[pinophyta|conifer]], such as a [[spruce]], [[pine]] or [[fir]], or an artificial tree of similar appearance, associated with the celebration of [[Christmas]], hence its name, originating in [[Northern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-19/the-history-of-the-christmas-tree/8106078|title=The history of the Christmas tree|last=Travers|first=Penny |date=19 December 2016 |website=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |language=en-AU|access-date=8 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom was developed in medieval [[Livonia]] (present-day [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]), and in [[early Modern history of Germany|early modern Germany]] where [[Protestant Germany|Protestant Germans]] brought decorated trees into their homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Joe|title=Christmas in Germany: A Cultural History|date=27 September 2010|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780807899410|page=32|quote=A chronicle from Stasbourg, written in 1604 and widely seen as the first account of a Christmas tree in German-speaking lands, records that Protestant artisans brought fir trees into their homes in the holiday season and decorated them with &quot;roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, tinsel, sweetmeats, etc.&quot;{{nbsp}}...

The tree was traditionally decorated with &quot;roses made of colored paper, apples, wafers, [[tinsel]], [and] sweetmeats&quot;. In the 18th century, it began to be illuminated by candles, which were ultimately replaced by [[Christmas lights]] after the advent of [[electrification]]. Today, there is a wide variety of [[Christmas ornament|traditional and modern ornaments]], such as [[garland]]s, [[Christmas ornament|baubles]], [[tinsel]], and [[candy cane]]s.

==History==
===Origin of the modern Christmas tree===

{{further|Christmas tree#Religious issues|Hanging of the greens}}

Modern Christmas trees originated during the [[German Renaissance|Renaissance]] in [[early Modern history of Germany|early modern Germany]]. Its 16th-century origins are sometimes associated with Protestant Christian reformer [[Martin Luther]], who is said to have first added lighted candles to an [[evergreen]] tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;History.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Christmas Trees |url=http://www.history.com/topics/history-of-christmas-trees |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] |accessdate=15 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225093550/http://www.history.com/topics/history-of-christmas-trees |archive-date=25 December 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/christmaslegends0000haid |url-access=registration |author=Helen Haidle |title=Christmas Legends to Remember' |publisher=David C Cook |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-56292-534-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/christmaslegends0000haid/page/119 119] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://booheyheyks.google.com/books?id=YDx3g-05fNoC&amp;lpg=PA22 |author=Debbie Trafton O'Neal, David LaRochelle |title=Before and After Christmas |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8066-4156-0 |page=22 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known firmly dated representation of a Christmas tree is on the keystone sculpture of a private home in [[Turckheim]], Alsace (then part of Germany, today France), with the date 1576.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le Vieux Turckheim|last=Ehrsam|first=Roger|publisher=Jérôme Do Bentzinger|year=1999|isbn=978-2906238831|location=Ville de Turckheim|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Christmas trees have been related to the &quot;[[tree of life (biblical)|tree of paradise]]&quot; of medieval [[mystery play]]s that were given on 24 December, the commemoration and [[name day]] of [[Adam and Eve]] in various countries. In such plays, a tree decorated with apples (to represent the forbidden fruit) and wafers (to represent the [[Eucharist]] and redemption) was used as a setting for the play. Like the [[Nativity scene|Christmas crib]], the Paradise tree was later placed in homes. The apples were replaced by round objects such as shiny red balls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dues&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lazowski&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIhIPIYLQ6QC&amp;pg=PA204 |author=Philip Lazowski |title=Understanding Your Neighbor's Faith |publisher=KTAV Publishing House |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-88125-811-0 |pages=203–04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XstmMVLDzIIC&amp;pg=PA18 |author=Michael P.

The main prop of a popular medieval play about Adam and Eve was a fir tree hung with apples (paradise tree) representing the Garden of Eden. The Germans set up a paradise tree in their homes on December 24, the religious feast day of Adam and Eve. They hung wafers on it (symbolizing the host, the Christian sign of redemption); in a later tradition, the wafers were replaced by cookies of various shapes. Candles, too, were often added as the symbol of Christ. In the same room, during the Christmas season, was the [[Christmas pyramid]], a triangular construction of wood, with shelves to hold Christmas figurines, decorated with evergreens, candles, and a star. By the 16th century, the Christmas pyramid and paradise tree had merged, becoming the Christmas tree. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Middle Ages, an early predecessor appears referred in the Regiment of the [[Cistercians|Order of Cister]] around 1400, in Alcobaça, Portugal. The Regiment of the local ''high-Sacristans'' of the Cistercian Order refers to what may be considered the oldest references to the Christmas tree: &quot;Note on how to put the Christmas branch, ''scilicet'': On the Christmas eve, you will look for a large Branch of green laurel, and you shall reap many red oranges, and place them on the branches that come of the laurel, specifically as you have seen, and in every orange you shall put a candle, and hang the Branch by a rope in the pole, which shall be by the candle of the ''altar-mor''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal'' (National Library of Portugal)—''Codices Alcobacenses'' ([http://www.bnportugal.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195%3Acodices-alcobacences&amp;catid=71%3Areservados-manuscritos&amp;Itemid=212&amp;lang=pt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221070531/http://www.bnportugal.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=195%3Acodices-alcobacences&amp;catid=71%3Areservados-manuscritos&amp;Itemid=212&amp;lang=pt |date=21 February 2013 }} ); [BN: cod. alc.

E em cada hua laranja, poeras hua candea. E pendurarás o dicto Ramo per hua corda na polee que ha de star acerca da lampada do altar moor''&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevance of ancient pre-Christian customs to the 16th-century German initiation of the Christmas tree custom is disputed.{{By whom|date=December 2019}} Resistance to the custom was often because of its supposed Lutheran origins.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Cooke, ''A Celebration of Christmas'', 1980, page 62: &quot;Martin Luther has been credited with the creation of the Christmas tree.{{nbsp}}... The Christmas tree did not spring fully fledged into{{nbsp}}... tree was slow to spread from its Alsatian home, partly because of resistance to its supposed Lutheran origins.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources have offered a connection between the symbolism of the first documented Christmas trees in Alsace around 1600 and the trees of pre-Christian traditions. For example, according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', &quot;The use of [[evergreen|evergreen trees]], wreaths, and garlands to symbolize eternal life was a custom of the ancient [[Egyptians]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and [[Hebrews]]. Tree worship was common among the pagan Europeans and survived their conversion to Christianity in the Scandinavian customs of decorating the house and barn with evergreens at the New Year to scare away the devil and of setting up a tree for the birds during Christmas time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2012 |title=Christmas tree |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115737/Christmas-tree |accessdate=2 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030053259/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115737/Christmas-tree |archivedate=30 October 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Roman mid-winter festival of [[Saturnalia]], houses were decorated with [[wreaths]] of evergreen plants, along with other antecedent customs now associated with Christmas.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/20617780 |title=BBC Religion &amp; Ethics—Did the Romans invent Christmas?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=14 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207095037/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/20617780 |archive-date=7 December 2016 |url-status=live |newspaper=BBC Religion &amp; Ethics |date=17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Viking]]s and [[Saxon]]s worshiped trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The story of [[Saint Boniface]] cutting down [[Donar's Oak]] illustrates the pagan practices in 8th century among the Germans. A later folk version of the story adds the detail that an evergreen tree grew in place of the felled oak, telling them about how its triangular shape reminds humanity of the [[Trinity]] and how it points to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe|title=Christmas|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2010|quote=His biographer, Eddius Stephanus, relates that while Boniface was serving as a missionary near Geismar, Germany, he had enough of the locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an axe to an oak tree dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the Christian trinity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The story, not recounted in the ''[[hagiography|vitae]]'' written in his time, appears in a [[BBC]] Devon website, &quot;Devon Myths and Legends&quot;, and in a number of educational storybooks, including ''St. Boniface and the Little Fir Tree: A Story to Color'' by Jenny Melmoth and Val Hayward (Warrington: Alfresco Books 1999 {{ISBN|1-873727-15-1}}), ''The Brightest Star of All: Christmas Stories for the Family'' by Carrie Papa (Abingdon Press 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-687-64813-9}}) and [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_BdEAAAAAYAAJ/page/n208 &lt;!-- pg=207 --&gt; &quot;How Saint Boniface Kept Christmas Eve&quot;] by Mary Louise Harvey in ''The American Normal Readers: Fifth Book'', 207–22.

[[File:Podlaznik.jpg|thumb|The hanging of a ''[[:pl:Podłaźniczka|podłaźniczka]]'' is an old Polish folk custom dating back to [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] pagan traditions.]]

In [[Poland]], there is a folk tradition dating back to an old [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] pagan custom of suspending a branch of fir, spruce or pine from the ceiling, called ''[[:pl:Podłaźniczka|podłaźniczka]]'', during the time of the [[Koliada]] winter festival.&lt;ref&gt;Janota E. Lud i jego zwyczaje. Lwów, 1878, str. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; The branches were decorated with apples, nuts, acorns and stars made of straw. In more recent times, the decorations also included colored paper cutouts (''[[wycinanki]]''), [[wafers]], [[cookies]] and [[Christmas baubles]]. According to old pagan beliefs, the branch's powers were linked to good harvest and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kmt.pl/pozycja.asp?ksid=5025|title=Zwyczaje, obrzędy i tradycje w Polsce.

Customs of erecting decorated trees in wintertime can be traced to Christmas celebrations in Renaissance-era [[guild]]s in [[Northern Germany]] and [[Livonia]]. The first evidence of decorated trees associated with Christmas Day are trees in guildhalls decorated with sweets to be enjoyed by the apprentices and children. In [[Livonia]] (present-day [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]), in 1441, 1442, 1510 and 1514, the [[Brotherhood of Blackheads]] erected a tree for the holidays in their guild houses in Reval (now [[Tallinn]]) and [[Riga]]. On the last night of the celebrations leading up to the holidays, the tree was taken to the [[Town Hall Square, Tallinn|Town Hall Square]], where the members of the brotherhood danced around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedrich Amelung |title=Geschichte der Revaler Schwarzenhäupter: von ihrem Ursprung an bis auf die Gegenwart: nach den urkundenmäßigen Quellen des Revaler Schwarzenhäupter-Archivs 1, Die erste Blütezeit von 1399–1557 |language=de|trans-title=History of the Tallinn Blackheads: from their origins until the present day: from the testimonial sources of the Tallinn Blackheads archive. 1: The first golden age of 1399–1557 |location=[[Tallinn|Reval]] |publisher=Wassermann |year=1885 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Bremen]] guild chronicle of 1570 reports that a small tree decorated with &quot;apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers&quot; was erected in the guild-house for the benefit of the guild members' children, who collected the dainties on Christmas Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1jgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22aus+Deutschland%22|title=Das Weihnachtsfest.

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], such trees are seen in the houses of upper-class Protestant families as a counterpart to the Catholic [[Nativity scene|Christmas cribs]]. This transition from the guild hall to the bourgeois family homes in the Protestant parts of Germany ultimately gives rise to the modern tradition as it developed in the 18th and 19th centuries.

By the early 18th century, the custom had become common in towns of the upper [[Rhineland]], but it had not yet spread to rural areas. Wax candles, expensive items at the time, are found in attestations from the late 18th century.

Along the lower Rhine, an area of Roman Catholic majority, the Christmas tree was largely regarded as a Protestant custom. As a result, it remained confined to the upper Rhineland for a relatively long period of time. The custom did eventually gain wider acceptance beginning around 1815 by way of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] officials who emigrated there following the [[Congress of Vienna]].

In the 19th century, the Christmas tree was taken to be an expression of [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] and of {{lang|de|[[Gemütlichkeit]]}}, especially among [[ethnic Germans|emigrants]] overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Johannes Marbach |title=Die heilige Weihnachtszeit nach Bedeutung, Geschichte, Sitten und Symbolen|language=German |trans-title=The holy Christmas season for meaning, history, customs and symbols |year=1859 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXhEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA416 |page=416 |quote={{lang|de|Was ist auch eine deutsche Christenfamilie am Christabend ohne Christbäumchen?

A decisive factor in winning general popularity was the German army's decision to place Christmas trees in its barracks and military hospitals during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Only at the start of the 20th century did Christmas trees appear inside churches, this time in a new brightly lit form.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hermelink&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Jan Hermelink |chapter=Weihnachtsgottesdienst |trans-chapter=Christmas worship |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOrt4xXGSKcC&amp;pg=PA290 |editor=Christian Grethlein |editor2=Günter Ruddat |title=Liturgisches Kompendium|language=German |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-525-57211-5 |page=290 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, the custom became popular among the nobility and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. [[Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg]] introduced the Christmas tree to [[Vienna]] in 1816, and the custom spread across Austria in the following years. In [[France]], the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the [[Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans|duchesse d'Orléans]]. In Denmark a Danish newspaper claims that the first attested Christmas tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to the Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] in 1865. He had published a fairy tale called ''[[The Fir-Tree]]'' in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir tree being used as a Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 |work=Kristelig Dagblad |title=Danmarks første juletræ blev tændt i 1808 |date=17 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213095846/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 |archivedate=13 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fewer than ten years their use in better-off homes was widespread. By 1856 a northern provincial newspaper contained an advert alluding casually to them,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Now the best Christmas box / You can give to the young / Is not toys, nor fine playthings, / Nor trees gaily hung{{nbsp}}...&quot;: Manchester Guardian, Saturday, 5{{nbsp}}January 1856, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reporting the accidental death of a woman whose dress caught fire as she lit the tapers on a Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;''Manchester Guardian'', 24 January 1856, p.&amp;nbsp;3: the death of Caroline Luttrell of [[Kilve Court]], Somerset.&lt;/ref&gt; They had not yet spread down the social scale though, as a report from Berlin in 1858 contrasts the situation there where &quot;Every family has its own&quot; with that of Britain, where Christmas trees were still the preserve of the wealthy or the &quot;romantic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London, England), 28 December 1858, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their use at public entertainments, charity bazaars and in hospitals made them increasingly familiar however, and in 1906 a charity was set up specifically to ensure even poor children in London slums &quot;who had never seen a Christmas tree&quot; would enjoy one that year.&lt;ref&gt;The Poor Children's Yuletide Association. ''The Times'' (London, England), 20 December 1906, p.&amp;nbsp;2. &quot;The association sent 71 trees 'bearing thousands of toys' to the poorest districts of London.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-German sentiment after World War{{nbsp}}I briefly reduced their popularity&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Merry Christmas&quot;: ''The Times'' (London, England), 27 December 1918, p.&amp;nbsp;2: &quot;...{{nbsp}}the so-called &quot;Christmas tree&quot; was out of favour.

The tradition was introduced to [[North America]] in the winter of 1781 by [[Germans in the American Revolution|Hessian soldiers]] stationed in the [[Province of Québec (1763–1791)]] to garrison the colony against [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|American attack]]. General [[Friedrich Adolf Riedesel]] and his wife, [[Frederika Charlotte|the Baroness von Riedesel]], held a Christmas party for the officers at [[Sorel-Tracy|Sorel]], Quebec, delighting their guests with a fir tree decorated with candles and fruits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Werner&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=In Pursuit of Liberty: Coming of Age in the American Revolution |author=Emmy E.

The Christmas tree became very common in the United States in the early nineteenth century. The first image of a Christmas tree was published in 1836 as the frontispiece to ''The Stranger's Gift'' by Hermann Bokum. The first mention of the Christmas tree in American literature was in a story in the 1836 edition of ''The Token and Atlantic Souvenir'', titled &quot;New Year's Day&quot;, by Catherine Maria Sedgwick, where she tells the story of a German maid decorating her mistress's tree. Also, a woodcut of the British Royal family with their Christmas tree at Windsor Castle, initially published in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'' December 1848, was copied in the United States at Christmas 1850, in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]''. ''Godey's'' copied it exactly, except for the removal of the Queen's tiara and Prince Albert's moustache, to remake the engraving into an American scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Alfred Lewis Shoemaker |origyear=1959 |title=Christmas in Pennsylvania: a folk-cultural study |pages=52–53 |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8117-0328-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The republished ''Godey's'' image became the first widely circulated picture of a decorated evergreen Christmas tree in America.

Decorations, such as figurines of airplanes, bicycles, space rockets, [[cosmonaut]]s, and characters of Russian fairy tales, were produced.

The TV special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' (1965) was influential on the pop culture surrounding the Christmas tree. [[Aluminum Christmas tree]]s were popular during the early 1960s in the US. They were satirized in the Charlie Brown show and came to be seen as symbolizing the commercialization of Christmas. The term ''Charlie Brown Christmas tree'', describing any poor-looking or malformed little tree, also derives from the 1965 TV special, based on the appearance of [[Charlie Brown]]'s Christmas tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/|title = Materialism and the Modern U.S. Christmas|last = Belk|first = Russell|year = 2000|journal = Advertising &amp; Society Review|accessdate = 5 October 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140506133533/http://muse.jhu.edu/|archive-date = 6 May 2014|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public Christmas trees====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-12787, Prag, Weihnachtsfeier für Erwerbslose.jpg|thumb|An early example of public Christmas tree for the children of unemployed parents in [[Prague]], 1931]]
Since the early 20th century, it has become common in many cities, towns, and department stores to put up public Christmas trees outdoors, such as the [[Macy's Great Tree]] in [[Atlanta]] (since 1948), the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]] in New York City, and the large Christmas tree at [[Victoria Square, Adelaide|Victoria Square]] in [[Adelaide]].

The use of fire retardant allows many indoor public areas to place real trees and be compliant with code. Licensed applicants of fire retardant solution spray the tree, tag the tree, and provide a certificate for inspection. Real trees are popular with high end visual merchandising displays around the world. Leading global retailers such as [[Apple (company)|Apple]] often place real trees in their window displays. In 2009, Apple placed two [[Fraser fir]] trees in every one of [[Apple Store|its retail establishments]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The United States' [[National Christmas Tree (United States)|National Christmas Tree]] has been lit each year since 1923 on the South Lawn of the [[White House]], becoming part of what evolved into a major holiday event at the White House. President [[Jimmy Carter]] lit only the crowning star atop the tree in 1979 in honor of the Americans being [[Iran hostage crisis|held hostage in Iran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;npspp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/lighting-of-the-national-christmas-tree-history.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115224842/http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/lighting-of-the-national-christmas-tree-history.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 January 2008 |title=Lighting of the National Christmas Tree |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=5 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same was true in 1980, except the tree was fully lit for 417 seconds, one second for each day the hostages had been in captivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;npspp&quot;/&gt;

During most of the 1970s and 1980s, the largest decorated Christmas tree in the world was put up every year on the property of the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' in [[Lantana, Florida]]. This tradition grew into one of the most spectacular and celebrated events in the history of southern Florida, but was discontinued on the death of the paper's founder in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flashback Blog: The World's Largest Decorated Christmas Tree |work=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |date=3 December 2009 |url=http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree |accessdate=4 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205193345/http://www.historicpalmbeach.com/flashback/2009/12/the-worlds-largest-decorated-christmas-tree/ |archivedate=5 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities, a charity event called the [[Festival of Trees]] is organized, in which multiple trees are decorated and displayed.

The giving of Christmas trees has also often been associated with the end of hostilities. After the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] in 1918 the city of [[Manchester]] sent a tree, and £500 to buy chocolate and cakes, for the children of the much-bombarded town of [[Lille]] in northern France.&lt;ref&gt;'Manchester's Gift To Lille{{nbsp}}... (FROM G. WARD PRICE.)' ''The Times'' (London, England),21 December 1918, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the trees represent special commemorative gifts, such as in [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]], where the City of [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] presents a tree to the people of London as a token of appreciation for the British support of Norwegian resistance during the [[World War II|Second World War]]; in [[Boston]], where the tree is a gift from the province of [[Nova Scotia]], in thanks for rapid deployment of supplies and rescuers to the 1917 [[Halifax Explosion|ammunition ship explosion]] that leveled the city of [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]]; and in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], where the main civic Christmas tree is an annual gift from the city of [[Bergen]], in thanks for the part played by soldiers from Newcastle in liberating Bergen from [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/twintownbergen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425202440/http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/core.nsf/a/twintownbergen |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 April 2007 |title=Town twinning: Bergen, Norway |publisher=[[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle City Council]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway also annually gifts a Christmas tree to [[Washington, D.C.]] as a symbol of friendship between Norway and the US and as an expression of gratitude from Norway for the help received from the US during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DC: Christmas Tree Lighting at Union Station |url=http://www.norway.org/News_and_events/Christmas-2012/DC-Christmas-Tree-Lighting-at-Union-Station/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209100844/http://www.norway.org/News_and_events/Christmas-2012/DC-Christmas-Tree-Lighting-at-Union-Station/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 December 2012 |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |accessdate=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both setting up and taking down a Christmas tree are associated with specific dates. Traditionally, Christmas trees were not brought in and decorated until [[Christmas Eve]] (24 December){{Citation needed |date=December 2011}} or, in the traditions celebrating Christmas Eve rather than [[Twelve Days of Christmas|the first day of Christmas]], 23 December, and then removed the day after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] (5 January); to have a tree up before or after these dates was even considered bad luck,{{Citation needed |date=December 2011}} and that to avoid bad luck from affecting the house's residents, the tree must be left up until after the following [[Twelfth Night]] passes.

In many areas, it has become customary to set up one's Christmas tree at the beginning of the [[Advent]] season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Mazar |title=School Year, Church Year: Customs and Decorations for the Classroom |year=2000 |publisher=Liturgy Training Publications |isbn=978-1568542409 |page=161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans will put up a Christmas tree after [[Thanksgiving]] (the fourth Thursday of November),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WATCH: It's Never Too Early to Put Up Your Christmas Tree—and Here's Why |url=https://www.southernliving.com/christmas/decor/when-should-christmas-tree-go-up |website=Southern Living |accessdate=3 November 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Christmas decorations can show up even earlier in retail stores, often the day after [[Halloween]] (31 October).

In Germany, traditionally the tree is put up on 24 December and taken down on 7{{nbsp}}January, though many start one or two weeks earlier, and in Roman Catholic homes the tree may be kept until 2{{nbsp}}February ([[Candlemas]]).{{why |date=December 2012}}{{citation needed |date=December 2012}}

In [[Italy]], [[Ireland]] and [[Argentina]], along with many countries in Latin America, the Christmas tree is put up on 8{{nbsp}}December ([[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate Conception day]]) and left up until 6{{nbsp}}January. In Australia, the Christmas tree is usually put up on 1{{nbsp}}December, which occurs about two weeks before the school summer holidays (except for South Australia, where most people put up their tree in November following the completion of the [[Adelaide Christmas Pageant]], a time frame that has started to filter into other states as the official time Christmas decorations and in store Santa Claus start to appear) and is left up until it is taken down.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Some traditions suggest that Christmas trees may be kept up until no later than 2{{nbsp}}February, the feast of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] (Candlemas), when the Christmas season effectively closes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holytrinitygerman.org/postepiphanycustoms.html |title=Customs of the Weeks after Epiphany |publisher=Holy Trinity (German) Catholic Church, Boston |accessdate=2 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730170514/http://www.holytrinitygerman.org/postepiphanycustoms.html |archive-date=30 July 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Superstitions say that it is a bad sign if Christmas greenery is not removed by Candlemas Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/superstitions.asp |title=Christmas Superstitions |date=December 2006 |website=[[Snopes.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christmas ornaments are decorations (usually made of glass, metal, wood, or ceramics) that are used to decorate a Christmas tree. The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers. [[Glass]] baubles were first made in [[Lauscha]], [[Germany]], and also garlands of glass beads and [[tin]] figures that could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations grew into the production of glass figures made by highly skilled [[artisans]] with [[clay]] molds.

Tinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Silvered [[saran (plastic)|saran]]-based tinsel was introduced later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments were a specialty of the glass factories in the [[Thuringian Forest]], especially in Lauscha in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.
Lighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom, fairy lights) is commonly done. A [[tree-topper]], sometimes an angel but more frequently a star, completes the decoration.

In the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree.
In the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s, [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] was very popular on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners. In the 1980s some trees were sprayed with fluffy white flocking to simulate snow.

Each year, 33 to 36 million Christmas trees are produced in America, and 50 to 60 million are produced in Europe. In 1998, there were about 15,000 growers in America (a third of them &quot;choose and cut&quot; farms). In that same year, it was estimated that Americans spent $1.5{{nbsp}}billion on Christmas trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apsnet.org/education/feature/1225tree/top.htm |title=The Christmas Tree |accessdate=8 December 2006 |author=Gary A.

===Natural trees===

{{See also|Christmas tree cultivation}}

The most commonly used species are [[fir]] (''Abies''), which have the benefit of not shedding their needles when they dry out, as well as retaining good foliage color and scent; but species in other [[genus|genera]] are also used.

In northern [[Europe]] most commonly used are:
* [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]] ''Picea abies'' (the original tree, generally the cheapest)
* [[Abies alba|Silver fir]] ''Abies alba''
* [[Abies nordmanniana|Nordmann fir]] ''Abies nordmanniana''
* [[Noble fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Picea omorika|Serbian spruce]] ''Picea omorika''
* [[Scots pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Swiss pine]] ''Pinus cembra''

In [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]] and [[Australia]] most commonly used are:
* [[Douglas fir]] ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''
* [[Abies balsamea|Balsam fir]] ''Abies balsamea''
* [[Fraser Fir]] ''Abies fraseri''
* [[Abies grandis|Grand fir]] ''Abies grandis''
* [[Abies guatemalensis|Guatemalan fir]] ''Abies guatemalensis''
* [[Noble fir]] ''Abies procera''
* [[Abies nordmanniana|Nordmann fir]] ''Abies nordmanniana''
* [[Abies magnifica|Red fir]] ''Abies magnifica''
* [[Abies concolor|White fir]] ''Abies concolor''
* [[Colorado Pinyon|Pinyon pine]] ''Pinus edulis''
* [[Jeffrey pine]] ''Pinus jeffreyi''
* [[Scots pine]] ''Pinus sylvestris''
* [[Stone pine]] ''Pinus pinea'' (as small table-top trees)
* [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]] ''Araucaria heterophylla''

Several other species are used to a lesser extent. Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]], [[Leyland cypress]], [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]] and [[Juniperus virginiana|eastern juniper]]. Various types of [[spruce]] tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the [[Picea pungens|blue spruce]] and, less commonly, the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]]); but spruces begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is faded. The long-needled [[Pinus strobus|eastern white pine]] is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes used, particularly in [[Oceania]], and in [[Australia]], some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the Pinus radiata [[Pinus radiata|Monterey pine]]. ''[[Adenanthos sericeus]]'' or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.

Some trees, frequently referred to as &quot;living Christmas trees&quot;, are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[plant nursery]], to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter [[dormancy]], leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |title=Living Christmas Trees |publisher=[[Clemson University]] |accessdate=12 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606222650/https://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |archive-date=6 June 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |title=Christmas tree |publisher=Department of Forestry, [[Michigan State University]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315150004/http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |archivedate=15 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |title=BLM and Forest Service Christmas tree permits available |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=30 November 2004 |accessdate=18 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114174843/http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |archive-date=14 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.

In the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s. Almost all Christmas trees in the United States are grown on Christmas tree farms where they are cut after about ten years of growth and new trees planted. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s agriculture census for 2007, 21,537 farms were producing conifers for the cut Christmas tree market in America, {{convert|5717.09|km2|acre|0}} were planted in Christmas trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/Specialty_Crops/speccrop.pdf |title=2007 Census of Agriculture: Specialty Crops (Volume 2, Subject Series, Part 8) |at=Table 1, page 1 |date=November 2009 |format=PDF |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |access-date=19 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216135500/http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2007/Online_Highlights/Specialty_Crops/speccrop.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2013 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The life cycle of a Christmas tree from the seed to a {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} tree takes, depending on species and treatment in cultivation, between eight and twelve years. First, the seed is extracted from cones harvested from older trees. These seeds are then usually grown in nurseries and then sold to Christmas tree farms at an age of three to four years. The remaining development of the tree greatly depends on the climate, soil quality, as well as the cultivation and how the trees are tended by the Christmas tree farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weihnachtsbaumversand.de/Wissenswertes:_:35.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125213649/http://www.weihnachtsbaumversand.de/Wissenswertes%3A_%3A35.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 November 2007 |title=Unsere kleine Baumschule—Wissenswertes |trans-title=Our little nursery: Trivia |language=de |year=2010 |accessdate=18 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most artificial trees are made of recycled PVC rigid sheets using tin stabilizer in the recent years. In the past, [[lead]] was often used as a stabilizer in PVC, but is now banned by Chinese laws.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
The use of lead stabilizer in Chinese imported trees has been an issue of concern among politicians and scientists over recent years.

The earliest legend of the origin of the Christmas tree dates back to 723, involving [[Saint Boniface]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.franciscanmedia.org/saint-boniface/|title=Saint Boniface|first=|last=|date=5 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he was evangelizing Germany. According to a story not mentioned in his biographies (''vitae''), he stumbled upon a pagan gathering where a group of people dancing under a decorated oak tree were about to sacrifice a baby in the name of [[Thor]]. Boniface took an axe and called on the name of [[Jesus]]. In one swipe, he managed to take down the entire tree, to the crowd's astonishment. Behind the fallen tree was a baby [[fir]]. Boniface said, &quot;let this tree be the symbol of the true God, its leaves are ever green and will not die.&quot; The tree's needles pointed to heaven.

Under the [[Marxist-Leninist atheism|Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine of [[state atheism]] in the Soviet Union, after its foundation in 1917, Christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were prohibited as a result of the Soviet [[Anti-religious campaign during the Russian Civil War|anti-religious campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asia.rbth.com/articles/2010/12/15/and_so_is_this_christmas05210.html|title=And so, is this Christmas?|date=15 December 2010|author=Jennifer Eremeeva|work=[[Russia Beyond the Headlines]]|quote=Russian Christians adhere to the Eastern Orthodox calendar, which lags 13 days behind the modern day calendar. This discrepancy was corrected in 1918, by the fledgling Bolshevik regime, but Christmas never reverted to December 25th in Russia, because the Bolsheviks began a systematic campaign to phase out traditional religious holidays and replace them with Soviet ones. Christmas was shifted to New Year's Eve. At the beginning, stringent measures were put in place to see off any holdover of the old days: Christmas trees, introduced to Russia by Tsar Peter The Great in the 17th century, were banned in 1916 by the Holy Synod as too German. The Bolsheviks kept the tree ban in place.

[[Pope John Paul II]] introduced the Christmas tree custom to the Vatican in 1982.
