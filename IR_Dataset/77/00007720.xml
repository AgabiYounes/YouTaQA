'''Coprophagia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|p|ɹ|ə|ˈ|f|eɪ|dʒ|i|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/coprophagia &quot;Coprophagia&quot;]. [[Dictionary.com]]. September 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''coprophagy''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|p|ɹ|ɒ|f|ə|dʒ|i}}) is the consumption of [[feces]]. The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] κόπρος ''{{lang|grc-Latn|copros}}'', &quot;feces&quot; and φαγεῖν ''{{lang|grc-Latn|phagein}}'', &quot;to eat&quot;. ''Coprophagy'' refers to many kinds of feces-eating, including eating feces of other species (heterospecifics), of other individuals (allocoprophagy), or one's own (autocoprophagy) – those once deposited or taken directly from the [[anus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hirakawa |first1=H | year=2001 | title=Coprophagy in leporids and other mammalian herbivores | journal=Mammal Review | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=61–80| doi=10.1046/j.1365-2907.2001.00079.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, coprophagia has been described since the late nineteenth century in individuals with mental illnesses and in unconventional sexual acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/16512235.2018.1535737 |pmid = 30425610|pmc = 6225515|title = Coprophagy in nineteenth-century psychiatry|journal = Microbial Ecology in Health and Disease|volume = 29|issue = 2|pages = 1535737|year = 2018|last1 = Moore|first1 = Alison M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some animal species eat feces as a normal behavior, in particular [[Lagomorpha|lagomorphs]] who do so to allow tough plant materials to be digested more thoroughly by passing twice through the digestive tract. Other species may eat feces [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|under certain conditions]].

== Coprophagia by humans ==
=== As a supposed medical treatment ===
[[Ttongsul]], or &quot;feces wine&quot; has been used in old Korean medicine. Ideally, a child's excrement is used in the preparation with alcohol content up to 9% by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/7b7zmg/how-to-make-faeces-wine |title=Korean Poo Wine |work=VICE Japan|date=August 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vc|date=July 2019}}

Centuries ago, physicians tasted their patients' feces, to better judge their state and condition.&lt;ref&gt;notes to ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qsv_Y0DOVUsC The Works of Francis Rabelais, Volume II, Volume 2]'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewin reported that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;consumption of fresh, warm [[camel]] feces has been recommended by [[Bedouin]]s as a remedy for bacterial [[dysentery]]; its efficacy (probably attributable to the antibiotic [[subtilisin]] from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'') was anecdotally confirmed by German soldiers in Africa during World War II&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lewin, Ralph A.| title=More on merde| journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine| year=2001| volume=44| issue=4| pages=594–607| doi = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0067 | pmid = 11600805 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a paraphilia ===
[[Coprophilia]] is a [[paraphilia]] ([[DSM-5]]), where the object of sexual interest is feces, and may be associated with coprophagia. Coprophagia is sometimes depicted in [[pornography]], usually under the term ''scat'' (from ''[[scatology]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 47893709 |page= 244|date= 2001-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notorious example of this is the pornographic [[shock video]] ''[[2 Girls 1 Cup]]''. &lt;ref name=2girls1cup&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Girls, 1 Cup: The Real Poop |publisher=[[The Smoking Gun]] |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/1130071onecup1.html |date=November 30, 2007 |accessdate=December 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102035152/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/1130071onecup1.html |archivedate=January 2, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a 1785 novel by [[Marquis de Sade]] is full of detailed descriptions of erotic sadomasochistic coprophagia.&lt;ref&gt;le Marquis de Sade (1785) Les 120 journées de Sodome, ou L'École du Libertinage&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian actor and pornographic director {{ill|Simon Thaur|de}} created the series &quot;Avantgarde Extreme&quot; and &quot;Portrait Extrem&quot;, which explores coprophagy, coprophilia, and urolagnia. [[GG Allin]], an American [[shock rock]] singer-songwriter, often featured coprophagy in his performances.

Coprophagia has also been observed in some people with [[schizophrenia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Harada KI, Yamamoto K, Saito T| title = Effective treatment of coprophagia in a patient with schizophrenia with the novel atypical antipsychotic drug perospirone | journal = Pharmacopsychiatry | year = 2006 | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | page = 113 | doi = 10.1055/s-2006-941487  | pmid = 16721701 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pica (disorder)|pica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rose, E.A. | author2 = Porcerelli, J.H. | author3 = Neale, A.V. | last-author-amp = yes | title = Pica: Common but commonly missed | journal = The Journal of the American Board of Family Practice | year = 2000 | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 353–358 | pmid = 11001006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In literature ===
[[François Rabelais]], in his classic ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', often employs the expression ''mâche-merde'' or ''mâchemerde'', meaning ''shit-chewer''. This in turn comes from the Greek comedians [[Aristophanes]] and particularly [[Menander]], who often use the term skatophagos (''σκατοφάγος'').&lt;ref&gt;Rabelais, Book 1, ch. 40 and Book 3 chap. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Pynchon]]'s award-winning 1973 novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' contains a detailed scene of coprophagia.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pynchon (1973) ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', Part 2, episode 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Russian writer [[Vladimir Sorokin]]'s novel ''Norma'' describes a society where coprophagia is institutionalised and mandatory.

Coprophagous insects consume and [[digestion|redigest]] the feces of large animals. These feces contain substantial amounts of semi-digested [[food]], particularly in the case of [[herbivore]]s, owing to the inefficiency of the large animals' [[Digestion|digestive systems]]. There are thousands of species of coprophagous insects, especially among the orders [[Fly|Diptera]] and [[Beetle|Coleoptera]]. Examples of such fies are ''[[Scathophaga stercoraria]]'' and ''[[Sepsis cynipsea]]'', dung flies commonly found in Europe around cattle droppings. Among beetles, [[dung beetle]]s are a diverse lineage many of which feed on the microorganism-rich liquid component of mammals' dung, and lays their eggs in balls composed mainly of the remaining fibrous material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2008.04.011  |title = Ecological functions and ecosystem services provided by Scarabaeine dung beetles|journal = Biological Conservation|volume = 141|issue = 6|pages = 1461–1474|year = 2008|last1 = Nichols|first1 = E.|last2 = Spector|first2 = S.|last3 = Louzada|first3 = J.|last4 = Larsen|first4 = T.|last5 = Amezquita|first5 = S.|last6 = Favila|first6 = M.E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Termite]]s eat one another's feces as a means of obtaining their [[hindgut]] [[protist]]s. Termites and protists have a [[symbiotic]] relationship (e.g. with the protozoan that allows the termites to digest the cellulose in their diet). For example, in one group of termites, there is a three-way symbiotic relationship: termites of the family Rhinotermitidae, cellulolytic protists of the genus ''Pseudotrichonympha'' in the guts of these termites, and intracellular bacterial symbionts of the protists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cospeciation in the triplex symbiosis of termite gut protists (''Pseudotrichonympha'' spp.), their hosts, and their bacterial endosymbionts.|author=Noda, S.|author2=Kitade, O.|author3=Inoue, T.|author4=Kawai, M.|author5=Kanuka, M.|author6=Hiroshima, K.|author7=Hongoh, Y.|author8=Constantino, R.|author9=Uys, V.|author10=Zhong, J.|author11=Kudo, T.|author12=Ohkuma, M.|last-author-amp=yes|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=16|issue=6|year=2007|pages=1257–1266|url=http://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/citation/17391411/Cospeciation_in_the_triplex_symbiosis_of_termite_gut_protists__Pseudotrichonympha_spp___their_hosts_and_their_bacterial_endosymbionts_|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2006.03219.x|pmid=17391411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domesticated and wild mammals are sometimes coprophagic, and in some species this forms an essential part of their method of digesting tough plant material.

Dogs may be coprophagic, possibly to rebalance their [[microbiome]] or to ingest missing nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brogan|first1=Jacob|title=Everyone Poops. Some Animals Eat It. Why?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/everyone-poops-some-animals-eat-it-why-180961020/|accessdate=10 November 2016|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species within the [[Lagomorpha]] ([[rabbit]]s, [[hare]]s, and [[pika]]s) produce two types of fecal pellets: hard ones, and soft ones called [[cecotrope]]s. Animals in these species reingest their cecotropes, to extract further nutrients. Cecotropes derive from chewed plant material that collects in the [[cecum]], a chamber between the large and small intestine, containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. After [[egestion|excretion]] of the soft [[cecotrope]],  it is again eaten whole by the animal and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables these animals to extract nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = rabbit | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | location = Chicago | edition = Standard | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process serves the same purpose within these animals as [[ruminant|rumination]] (cud-chewing) does in cattle and sheep.&lt;ref&gt;''The Private Life of the Rabbit'', R. M. Lockley, 1964. Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This reference is for the whole section, as written 30 July 2007 --&gt;

[[Cattle]] in the United States are often fed [[chicken litter]]. There are concerns that the practice of feeding chicken litter to cattle could lead to [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (mad-cow disease) because of the crushed [[meat and bone meal|bone meal]] in chicken feed. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates this practice by attempting to prevent the introduction of any part of a cow's brain or spinal cord into [[livestock]] feed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/18835/fda-urged-to-ban-feeding-chicken-litter-to-cattle FDA Urged to Ban Feeding Chicken Litter to Cattle], 2009-11-02, L.A. Times&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, like Canada, have banned chicken litter for use as a livestock feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/feeds/regulatory-guidance/rg-2/eng/1328859106165/1328859287377|website=Canadian Food Inspection Agency|title=Feeding of Poultry Manure to Cattle Prohibited|date=2012-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young of [[elephant]]s, [[Giant Panda|giant pandas]], [[koala]]s and [[Hippopotamus|hippo]]s eat the feces of their mothers or other animals in the herd, in order to obtain the [[bacteria]] required to properly digest [[vegetation]] found in their ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/adaptations/Coprophagia |title=BBC Nature&amp;nbsp;— Dung eater videos, news and facts |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When such animals are born, their [[intestine]]s are sterile and do not contain these bacteria. Without doing this they would be unable to obtain any nutritional value from plants.

Hamsters, [[guinea pigs]], [[chinchillas]], [[hedgehogs]] and [[naked mole-rat]]s eat their own droppings, which are thought to be a source of [[vitamin]]s [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin K|K]], produced by gut bacteria.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924051143075;view=1up;seq=380 |title=Journal The Cornell Veterinarian |accessdate=2019-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On rare occasions [[gorilla]]s have been observed consuming their feces, possibly out of boredom, a desire for warm food, or to reingest seeds contained in the feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pages.nycep.org/rothman/6PWUnutr.pdf |title=Nutritional Aspects of the Diet of Wild Gorillas |accessdate=2013-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
