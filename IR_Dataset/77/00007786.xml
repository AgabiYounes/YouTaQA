[[Image:Marianatrenchmap.png|thumb|300px|Location of Challenger Deep within the [[Mariana Trench]] and Western Pacific Ocean]]

The '''Challenger Deep''' is the deepest known point in the [[Earth]]'s [[seabed]] [[hydrosphere]] (the oceans), with a depth of {{convert|10902|to|10929|m|ft|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} by direct measurement from deep-diving [[submersible]]s, [[remotely operated vehicle]]s and [[benthic lander]]s and (sometimes) slightly more by [[sonar]] [[bathymetry]].

The Challenger Deep is located in the Western [[Pacific Ocean]], at the southern end of the [[Mariana Trench]] near the [[Mariana Islands]] group. According to the August 2011 version of the [[General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans|GEBCO]] Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, the Challenger Deep is {{convert|10920|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep at {{Coord|11|22.4|N|142|35.5|E}}.

The depression is named after the British [[Royal Navy]] survey ship {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}}, whose [[Challenger expedition|expedition of 1872–1876]] made the first recordings of its depth. The high water pressure at this depth makes designing and operating exploratory craft difficult. The first descent by any vehicle was by the manned [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'' in January 1960; unmanned visits followed in 1996, 1998 and 2009. In March 2012 a manned solo descent was made by film director [[James Cameron]] in the deep-submergence vehicle ''[[Deepsea Challenger]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGS-20120325&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Than|first=Ker |title=James Cameron Completes Record-Breaking Mariana Trench Dive|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/03/120325-james-cameron-mariana-trench-challenger-deepest-returns-science-sub/|date=25 March 2012 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20120325&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad|first=William J. |title=Filmmaker in Submarine Voyages to Bottom of Sea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/26/science/james-camerons-submarine-trip-to-challenger-deep.html|date=25 March 2012 |work=New York Times |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC-20120325&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=AP Staff |title=James Cameron has reached deepest spot on Earth |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46850002 |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=[[NBC News]] |accessdate=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 28 April and 4 May 2019, the ''[[Triton Submarines|DSV Limiting Factor]]'' completed four manned dives to the bottom of Challenger Deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fivedeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/FDE-Challenger-Release-FINAL-5132019.pdf |title=Deepest Submarine Dive in History, Five Deeps Expedition Conquers Challenger Deep |work=fivedeeps.com |accessdate=13 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Challenger Deep is a relatively small slot-shaped depression in the bottom of a considerably larger crescent-shaped [[oceanic trench]], which itself is an unusually [[Hadal zone|deep feature]] in the ocean floor. The Challenger Deep consists of three {{convert|6|to|10|km|mi|1|abbr=on|lk=on}} long about {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} wide basins, each over {{convert|10850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in depth, oriented in echelon from west to east, separated by mounds between the basins {{convert|200|to|300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} higher. The three basins feature extends about {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=on}} west to east if measured at the {{convert|10650|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[isobath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11001-011-9134-0 |title=A precise bathymetric map of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench |first1=Masao |last1=Nakanishi |first2=Jun |last2=Hashimoto |journal=Marine Geophysical Research |date=December 2011 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=455–463 |doi=10.1007/s11001-011-9134-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the western and eastern basins have recorded depths (by sonar bathymetry) in excess of {{convert|10920|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, while the center basin is slightly shallower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart, Heather &amp; Jamieson, Alan.

Over many years, the search for, and investigation of, the location of the maximum depth of the world's oceans has involved many different vessels, and continues into the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nakanishi|first=Masao |title=A precise bathymetric map of the world's deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench |journal=Marine Geophysical Research |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=455–463 |url=http://naosite.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10069/25460/1/MGR_Hashimoto.pdf |date=10 April 2011 |accessdate=30 March 2012 |bibcode=2011MarGR..32..455N |doi=10.1007/s11001-011-9134-0 |citeseerx=10.1.1.453.5784 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy of determining geographical location, and the beamwidth of (multibeam) echosounder systems, limits the horizontal and vertical bathymetric [[sensor resolution]] hydrographers can obtain from onsite data. This is especially important when sounding in deep water, as the resulting footprint of an acoustic pulse gets large once it reaches a distant sea floor. Further, sonar operation is affected by variations in [[Speed of sound#Seawater|sound speed]], particularly in the vertical plane. The speed is determined by the water's [[bulk modulus]], [[mass]], and [[density]]. The bulk modulus is affected by temperature, [[pressure]], and dissolved impurities (usually [[salinity]]).

'''1875 – [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']] ––''' In 1875, during her transit from the [[Admiralty Islands]] to [[Yokohama, Japan|Yokohama]], the three-masted sailing corvette HMS ''[[HMS Challenger (1858)|''Challenger'']] ''attempted to make landfall at [[Guam, Mariana Islands|Guam]], but was set to the west by “baffling winds” preventing them from “visiting either the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] or the [[Mariana Islands|Ladrones]].”&lt;ref&gt;Spry, W.J.J., “The Cruise of the Challenger”, 1877, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; ''These winds pushed her track to the west, across the 35-mile-long depression which, 85-years later, would achieve prominence as the Challenger Deep. Even more amazing, one of her thirteen sampling stations on that 2,300 nm track to Japan was within fifteen miles of the deepest depression in the world’s oceans.'' 
On 23 March 1875, at sample station number #225, HMS ''Challenger'' recorded the bottom at {{convert|4475|fathom|lk=on}} deep, (the deepest sounding of her three-plus-year eastward [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth) at {{Coord|11|24|N|143|16|E}}—and confirmed it with a second sounding at the same location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep&quot;/&gt; [[Sounding line|Depth soundings]] were by Baillie-weighted marked rope, and geographical locations were determined by [[celestial navigation]] (to an estimated accuracy of two nautical miles).
The serendipitous discovery of Earth’s deepest depression by [[Challenger expedition|history’s first major scientific expedition devoted entirely to the emerging science of oceanography]], was incredibly good fortune, and especially notable when compared to the Earth’s third deepest site (the [[Sirena Deep]] only 150 nautical miles east of the Challenger Deep), which would remain undiscovered for another 122 years.

'''1951 – SV [[HMS Challenger (1931)|HMS ''Challenger II'']] ––''' Seventy-five years later, the 1,140-ton British survey vessel HMS ''Challenger II'', on her three-year westward [[circumnavigation]] of Earth, investigated the extreme depths southwest of Guam reported in 1875 by her predecessor, HMS ''Challenger''. On her southbound track from Japan to New Zealand (May–July 1951), ''Challenger II'' conducted a survey of “the [[Mariana Trench|Marianas Trench]] between Guam and [[Ulithi Atoll|Ulithi]] {{sic}},” using seismic-sized bomb-soundings and recorded a maximum depth of {{convert|5663|fathom|0}}. The depth was beyond ''Challenger II''{{'s}} [[echo sounder]] capability to verify, so they resorted to using a taut wire with “140-lbs of scrap iron”, and documented a depth of {{convert|5899|fathom|0}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritchie, G.S. 1958 p.225&quot;&gt;Ritchie, G.S., “Challenger, the Life of a Survey Ship, Abelard-Shuman (1958), p.225&lt;/ref&gt;
In New Zealand, the ''Challenger II'' team gained the assistance of the Royal New Zealand Dockyard, “who managed to boost the echo sounder to record at the greatest depths.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritchie, G.S. 1958 p.225&quot;/&gt; They returned to the “Marianas Deep” (sic)&lt;ref&gt;Gaskell, T.F., “HMS Challenger’s World Voyage 1950-52, Part I. Atlantic &amp; Pacific Oceans”, International Hydrographic Review, Vol. XXX, no. 2 (2018), p.119&lt;/ref&gt; in October, 1951. Using their newly improved echo sounder, they ran survey lines at right angles to the axis of the trench and discovered “a considerable area of a depth greater than {{convert|5900|fathom|0}}” -- later identified as the Challenger Deep’s ''western'' basin. The greatest depth recorded was {{convert|5940|fathom|0}},&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, G.S., “Challenger, the Life of a Survey Ship, Abelard-Shuman (1958), p.229&lt;/ref&gt; at {{Coord|11|19|N|142|15|E}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fujioka |first=K |display-authors=et al |title=Morphology and origin of the Challenger Deep in the Southern Mariana Trench |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=29 |issue=10 |date=18 May 2002 |pages=10-1-10-4|doi=10.1029/2001GL013595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navigational accuracy of several hundred meters was attained by celestial navigation and [[LORAN|LORAN-A]]. Note that the term “Challenger Deep” came into use after this 1951-52 ''Challenger'' circumnavigation, and commemorates both British ships of that name involved with the discovery of the deepest basin of the world’s oceans.

'''1957–1958 – RV [[RV Vityaz (1939)|''Vityaz'']] ––''' In August 1957, the 3,248-ton Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry research vessel ''Vityaz'' recorded a maximum depth of {{convert|11034|m|ft}}±{{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11|20.9|N|142|11.5|E}} in the western basin of the Challenger Deep during a brief transit of the area on Cruise #25.  She returned in 1958, Cruise #27, to conduct a detailed single beam bathymetry survey involving over a dozen transects of the Deep, with extensive examination of the western basin and a quick peek into the eastern basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/ |title=Bathymetric Data Viewer |publisher=[[NOAA]]}} [Single-Beam Surveys; Survey ID - VIT27, then zoom into Challenger Deep]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, P. P., “Maximum Depths of the Pacific Ocean”, Priroda no .6 (in Russian), 1959, p. 84-88.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher records a total of three ''Vityaz'' sounding locations on Fig.2 &quot;Trenches&quot; (1963), one within yards of the 142°11.5' E location, and a third at {{Coord|11|20.0|N|142|07|E}}, all with {{convert|11034|m|ft}} ±{{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} depth.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R. L., and H. H. Hess, Trenches, in The Sea, vol. 3, Fig. 2, p. 417, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The depths were considered [[Outlier|statistical outliers]], and a depth greater than 11,000 m has never been proven. Taira reports that if ''Vityaz''{{'s}} depth was corrected with the same methodology used by the Japanese RV ''Hakuho Maru'' expedition of December 1992, it would be presented as {{convert|10983|m|ft}} ±{{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;Taira, K., “Deep CTD Casts in the Challenger Deep, Mariana Trench”, ''Journal of Oceanography'', Vol. 61, p. 453, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to modern depths from multibeam echosounder systems greater than {{convert|10900|m|ft}} with the NOAA accepted maximum of {{convert|10995|m|ft}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the western basin.&lt;ref&gt;Nakanishi, M., “A precise bathymetric map of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench” ''Marine Geophysical Research'', Table 3, p.13, 10 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/ |title=Bathymetric Data Viewer |publisher=[[NOAA]]}} [zoom into Challenger Deep to 1km]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1959 – RV ''Stranger'' ––''' The first definitive verification of both depth and location of the Challenger Deep (western basin) was determined by Dr. R. L. Fisher from the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], aboard the 325-ton research vessel ''Stranger''. Using explosive soundings, they recorded {{convert|10850|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at/near {{Coord|11|18|N|142|14|E}} in July 1959. ''Stranger'' used celestial and [[LORAN-C]] for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/gazetteer/ |title=GEBCO Undersea Feature Names Gazetteer |publisher=[[NOAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R. L., and H. H. Hess, Trenches, in &quot;The Earth Beneath the Sea&quot;, vol. 3, 411 – 436, Table 1, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; LORAN-C navigation provided geographical accuracy of {{convert|460|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} or better.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, P.A., “Ocean Basalts”, ''Springer'', 1991, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
According to another source RV ''Stranger'' using bomb-sounding surveyed a maximum depth of {{convert|10915|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11|20.0|N|142|11.8|E}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep&quot;/&gt;
Discrepancies between the geographical location (lat/long) of ''Stranger''{{'s}} deepest depths and those from earlier expeditions (''Challenger II'' 1951; ''Vityaz'' 1957 &amp; 1958) “are probably due to uncertainties in fixing the ships’ positions.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher, Trenches p. 416&quot;&gt;Fisher, Trenches, The Earth Beneath the Sea, p. 416, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;
''Stranger''{{'s}} north-south zig-zag survey passed well to the east of the eastern basin southbound, and well to the west of the eastern basin northbound, thus failed to discover the eastern basin of the Challenger Deep.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Trenches, &quot;The Earth Beneath the Sea&quot;, p. 417, Fig.2, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum depth measured near longitude 142°30’E was {{convert|10760|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, about 10 kms west of the eastern basin’s deepest point. This was an important gap in information, as the eastern basin was later reported as deeper than the other two basins.
''Stranger'' crossed the center basin twice, measuring a maximum depth of {{convert|10830|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the vicinity of 142°22’E. At the western end of the central basin (approximately 142°18’E), they recorded a depth of {{convert|10805|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;jproc.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jproc.ca/hyperbolic/loran_c.html |title=Loran-C Introduction |website=Hyperbolic Radionavigation Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2020}}
The western basin received four [[transects]] by ''Stranger'', recording depths of {{convert|10830|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} toward the central basin, near where ''Trieste'' dove in 1960 (vicinity {{Coord|11|18.5|N|142|15.5|E}}, and where ''Challenger II'', in 1950, recorded {{convert|10863|m|ft}} ±{{convert|35|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. At the far western end of the ''western'' basin (about 142°11’E), the ''Stranger'' recorded {{convert|10850|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, some 6 km south of the location where ''Vityaz'' recorded {{convert|11034|m|ft}} ±{{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in 1957-1958. Fisher stated: “…differences in the ''Vitiaz'' (sic) and ''Stranger''-''Challenger II'' depths can be attributed to the [sound] velocity correction function used…”&lt;ref name=&quot;Fisher, Trenches p. 416&quot;/&gt; 
After investigating the Challenger Deep, ''Stranger'' proceeded to the [[Philippine Trench]] and transected the trench over twenty times in August 1959, finding a maximum depth of {{convert|10030|m|ft}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and thus established that the Challenger Deep was about {{convert|800|m|ft}} deeper than the Philippine Trench.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Trenches, &quot;The Earth Beneath the Sea&quot;, Table I, p 418&lt;/ref&gt; The 1959 ''Stranger'' surveys of the Challenger Deep and of the Philippine Trench informed the U.S. Navy as to the appropriate site for ''Trieste''{{'s}} record dive in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Robert L., &quot;Meanwhile, Back on the Surface,&quot; ''Marine Journal Technology,'' vol.43, no.5, Winter 2009, pp.16-19&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1962 – RV ''Spenser F. Baird'' ––''' The ''Proa Expedition, Leg 2'', returned Fisher to the Challenger Deep on 12–13 April 1962 aboard the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography|Scripps]] research vessel ''Spencer F. Baird'' (formerly the steel-hulled US Army large tug ''LT-581'') and employed a Precision Depth Recorder (PDR) to verify the extreme depths previously reported. They recorded a maximum depth of {{convert|10915|m|}} (location not available).&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Trenches, The Earth Beneath the Sea, Table I, p 418 Table1&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at location “H-4” in the Challenger Deep, the expedition cast three taut-wire soundings: on 12 April, the first cast was to 5078 fathoms (corrected for wire angle) {{convert|9287|m|ft}} at {{Coord|11|23|N|142|19.5|E}} in the central basin. (Up until 1965, US research vessels recorded soundings in fathoms.)  The second cast, also on 12 April, was to 5000&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fathoms at {{Coord|11|20.5|N|142|22.5|E}} in the central basin. On 13 April, the final cast recorded 5297 fathoms (corrected for wire angle) {{convert|9687|m|ft}} at {{Coord|11|17.5|N|142|11|E}} (the western basin).&lt;ref&gt;”Physical And Chemical Data, PROA Expedition 12 April – 6 July 1962,” SIO 66-16, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; They were chased off by a hurricane after only two days on-site.  Once again, Fisher entirely missed the eastern basin of the Challenger Deep, which later proved to contain the deepest depths.

'''1975–1980 – [[USNS Thomas Washington (T-AGOR-10)|RV ''Thomas Washington'']] ––''' The Scripps Institution of Oceanography deployed the 1,490-ton Navy-owned, civilian-crewed research vessel ''[[USNS Thomas Washington (T-AGOR-10)|Thomas Washington]]'' (AGOR-10) to the Mariana Trench on several expeditions from 1975 to 1986.  The first of these was the ''Eurydice Expedition, Leg 8'' which brought Fisher back to the Challenger Deep’s western basin from 28–31 March 1975.&lt;ref&gt;”Eurydice Expedition, Leg 8, R/V ''Thomas Washington'', Informal Report 24–31 March 1975,” [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography|SIO]] Geological Data Center, June 27, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Thomas Washington'' established geodetic positioning by ([[Satellite navigation|SATNAV]]) with Autolog Gyro and EM Log. [[Bathymetry|Bathymetrics]] were by a 12 kHz Precision Depth Recorder (PDR) with a single 60° beam.  They mapped one, “possibly two,” axial basins with a depth of {{convert|10915|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;”Eurydice Expedition, Leg 8, R/V ''Thomas Washington'', Informal Report 24–31 March 1975,” [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography|SIO]] Geological Data Center, June 27, 1975, Track Plot, page four&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maps.continentalshelf.org/geodas/ERDC08WT.htm |publisher=Continental Shelf Programme |title=Survey Identifier: ERDC08WT}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five dredges were hauled 27–31 March, all into or slightly north of the deepest depths of the western basin. Fisher noted that this survey of the Challenger Deep (western basin) had &quot;...provided nothing to support and much to refute recent claims of depths there greater than {{convert|10915|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R., [http://siox.sdsc.edu/secureGetObj.php?filename=SIOGDC_ERDC08WT_20070608200108001_20070608200108001_ERDC08WT_weekly_reports.txt&amp;col=ERDC08WT &quot;Eurydice Expedition Leg 08, Weekly Reports&quot;], Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 1975; &lt;/ref&gt; While Fisher missed the eastern basin of the Challenger Deep (for the third time), he did report a deep depression about 150 nautical miles east of the western basin.  The 25 March dredge haul at {{Coord|12|03.72|N|142|33.42|E}} encountered {{convert|10015|m|ft}}, which pre-shadowed by 22 years the discovery of HMRG [[HMRG Sirena Deep|''Sirena Deep'']] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;ERDC08WT-024D/SIO001559 {{full citation needed|date=January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deepest waters of the HMRG Deep/Serina Deep at {{convert|10714|m|ft}} ±{{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} are centered at/near {{Coord|12|03.94|N|142|34.866|E}}, approximately 2.65&amp;nbsp;km from Fisher's 25 March 1975 {{convert|10015|m|ft}} dredge haul.

Quickly repaired, it was again put down on the 15th to {{convert|10559|m|ft}} depth at {{Coord|11|23.3|N|142|13.8|E}}. It was recovered on the 17th with excellent photography of [[amphipods]] (shrimp) from the Challenger Deep’s western basin.  The benthic lander was put down for the third and last time on the 17th, at {{Coord|11|20.1|N|142|25.2|E}}, in the central basin at a depth of {{convert|10285|m|ft}}.  The benthic lander was not recovered and may remain on the bottom in the vicinity of {{Coord|11|20.1|N|142|25.2|E}}. Free traps and pressure-retaining traps were put down at eight location from 13 to 19 January into the western basin, at depths ranging from {{convert|7353|m|ft}} to {{convert|10715|m|ft}}.  Both the free traps and the pressure-retaining traps brought up good sample amphipods for study. While the ship briefly visited the area of the eastern basin, the expedition did not recognize it as potentially the deepest of the three Challenger Deep basins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/?layers=multibeam&amp;minx=144.00209&amp;maxx=155.49962&amp;miny=-41.348255&amp;maxy=13.947198 |title=Bathymetric Data Viewer |publisher=[[NOAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
''Thomas Washington'' returned briefly to the Challenger Deep on 17–19 October 1978 during ''Mariana Expedition Leg 5'' under chief scientist James W.

Another miss. On ''Mariana Expedition Leg 8'',  under chief scientist Yayanos, ''Thomas Washington'' was again involved, from 12–21 December 1978, with an intensive biological study of the western and central basins of the Challenger Deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maps.continentalshelf.org/geodas/MARA08WT.htm |publisher=Continental Shelf Programme |title=Survey Identifier: MARA08WT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen traps and pressure-retaining traps were put down to depths ranging from {{convert|10455|m|ft}} to {{convert|10927|m|ft}} meters, the greatest depth was at {{Coord|11|20.0|N|142|11.8|E}}. All of the 10,900-plus m recordings were in the western basin.  The {{convert|10455|m|ft}} depth was furthest east at 142°26.4’ E (in the central basin), about 17&amp;nbsp;km west of the eastern basin.  Again, focused efforts on the known areas of extreme depths (the western and central basins) was so tight that the eastern basin again was missed by this expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Yayanos, A.A. et.al, “Dependence of Reproduction Rate on Pressure as a Hallmark of Deep-Sea Bacteria,” Applied and Environmental Microbiolgy, Dec. 1982, pp.1356-1361&lt;/ref&gt;

From 20 to 30 November 1980, ''Thomas Washington'' was on site at the western basin of the Challenger Deep, as part of ''Rama Expedition Leg 7'', again with chief-scientist Dr. A.A. Yayanos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maps.continentalshelf.org/geodas/RAMA07WT.htm |publisher=Continental Shelf Programme |title=Survey Identifier: RAMA07WT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yayanos directed ''Thomas Washington'' in arguably the most extensive and wide-ranging of all single-beam bathymetric examinations of the Challenger Deep ever undertaken, with dozens of transits of the western basin, and ranging far into the [[backarc]] of the Challenger Deep (northward), with significant excursions into the Pacific Plate (southward) and along the trench axis to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/bathymetry/ |title=Bathymetric Data Viewer |publisher=[[NOAA]]}} [select single beam and enter RAMA07WT]&lt;/ref&gt; They hauled eight dredges in the western basin to depths ranging from {{convert|10015|m|ft}} to {{convert|10900|m|ft}}; and between hauls, cast thirteen free vertical traps. The dredging and traps were for biological investigation of the bottom. In the first successful retrieval of a live animal from the Challenger Deep, on November 21, 1980 in the western basin at {{Coord|11|18.7|N|142|11.6|E}}, Yayanos recovered a live amphipod from about 10,900 meters depth with a pressurized trap.&lt;ref&gt;Yayanos, A.

'''1976–1977 – RV ''Kana Keoki'' ––''' On Leg 3 of the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics' (HIG) expedition 76010303, the 156-foot research vessel ''Kana Keoki'' departed Guam primarily for a [[seismic]] investigation of the Challenger Deep area, under chief scientist Donald M. Hussong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=ftp://soest.hawaii.edu/dkarl/misc/dave/UH&amp;theSea/Q-Chapter13.pdf |title=UH and the Sea |first=David |last=Karl |chapter=UH Fleet Assets (1962–2003} |pages=15-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship was equipped with [[Seismic source|air guns]] (for seismic reflection soundings deep into the [[Earth's mantle]]), [[magnetometer]], [[gravimeter]], 3.5-kHz and 12-kHz sonar transducers, and precision depth recorders. They ran the Deep from east to west, collecting single beam bathymetry, magnetic and gravity measurements, and employed the air guns along the trench axis, and well into the [[backarc]] and [[forearc]], from 13–15 March 1976. Thence they proceeded south to the [[Ontong Java Plateau]].  All three deep basins of the Challenger Deep were covered, but ''Kana Keoki'' recorded a maximum depth of {{convert|7800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;MGD77-398858 {{full citation needed|date=January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seismic information developed from this survey was instrumental in gaining an understanding of the [[subduction]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Philippine Sea Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;”International Decade of Ocean Exploration, Progress Report Volume 7, April 1977 to April 1978,” US Dept of Commerce, NOAA, Environmental Data and Information Service, October 1978, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, ''Kana Keoki'' returned to the Challenger Deep area for wider coverage of the forearc and backarc.

'''1984 – SV ''Takuyo'' ––''' The Hydrographic Department, Maritime Safety Agency, Japan (JHOD) deployed the newly commissioned 2,600-ton survey vessel ''Takuyo'' (HL 02) to the Challenger Deep 17–19 February 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Nakanishi,  A., New Japanese Survey Vessel “Takuyo,” International Hydrographic Review, Monaco, LXII (s), July 1985; pp. 51-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Takuyo'' was the first Japanese ship to be equipped with the new narrowbeam [[SeaBeam]] [[Multibeam echosounder|multi-beam sonar echosounder]], and was the first [[survey ship]] with multi-beam capability to survey the Challenger Deep. The system was so new that JHOD had to develop their own software for drawing bathymetric charts based on the SeaBeam digital data.&lt;ref&gt;Asada, A., “Contour Processing of 3-D Image Processing of Sea Beam Bathymetric Data,” International Hydrographic Review, Monaco, LXV(1), January 1988; pp. 65-80.&lt;/ref&gt;  In just three days, they tracked 500 miles of sounding lines, and covered about 140&amp;nbsp;km² of the Challenger Deep with multibeam ensonification.  Under chief scientist Hideo Nishida, they used [[CTD (instrument)|CTD]] temperature and salinity data from the top {{convert|4500|m|ft|0}} of the [[water column]] to correct depth measurements, and later conferred with Scripps Institution of Oceanography (including Fisher), and other [[GEBCO]] experts to confirm their depth correction methodology.  They employed a combination of [[NAVSAT]], [[LORAN-C]] and [[Omega (navigation system)|OMEGA]] systems for geodetic positioning with accuracy better than {{convert|400|m|ft}}. The deepest location recorded was {{convert|10920|m|ft}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11|22.4|N|142|35.5|E}}; for the first time documenting the eastern basin as the deepest of the three [[en echelon]] pools.&lt;ref&gt;Yashima, K., [https://www.gebco.net/about_us/gebco_symposium/documents/poster_worlds_greatest_depth.pdf World’s Greatest Depth in Challenger Deep (Mariana Trench)], 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, [[GEBCO]] recognized the  {{convert|10920|m|ft}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} report as the deepest depth of the world’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;GEBCO 5.06, 1993 Guiding Committee Minutes&lt;/ref&gt;  Technological advances such as improved [[multi-beam sonar]] would be the driving force in uncovering the mysteries of the Challenger Deep into the future.

'''1986 – RV ''Thomas Washington'' ––''' The Scripps research vessel ''Thomas Washington''{{'s}} returned to the Challenger Deep in 1986 during the ''Papatua Expedition, Leg 8'',  mounting one of the first commercial multi-beam echosounders capable of reaching into the deepest trenches, i.e. the 16-beam Seabeam “Classic”.  This allowed chief scientist Yayanos an opportunity to transit the Challenger Deep with the most modern depth-sounding equipment available. During the pre-midnight hours of 21 April 1986, the multibeam echosounder produced a map of the Challenger Deep bottom with a [[Swathe|swath]] of about 5–7 miles wide. The maximum depth recorded was {{convert|10,804|m|ft}} (location of depth is not available).  Yayanos noted: “The lasting impression from this cruise comes from the thoughts of the revolutionary things that Seabeam data can do for deep biology.”&lt;ref&gt;Yayanos, A.A., R/V Thomas Washington KGWU, Weekly Report, Papatua Expedition Leg 8, 212218Z April 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1988 – RV ''Moana Wave'' ––''' On August 22, 1988, the U.S. Navy-owned 1,000-ton research vessel ''Moana Wave'' (AGOR-22), operated by the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics (HIG), [[University of Hawaii]], under the direction of chief scientist [[Robert Thunell|Robert C. Thunell]] from the [[University of South Carolina]], transited northwesterly across the central basin of the Challenger Deep, conducting a single-beam bathymetry track by their 3.5 kHz narrow (30-degs) beam echosounder with a Precision Depth Recorder. In addition to sonar bathymetry, they took 44 gravity cores and 21 box cores of bottom sediments. The deepest echosoundings recorded were 10,656 metres (34,961&amp;nbsp;ft) to 10,916 metres (35,814&amp;nbsp;ft), with the greatest depth at 11°22′N 142°25′E in the central basin.&lt;ref&gt;Physical and Chemical Data, RISEPAC Expedition 7-23 Dec 1961; Proa Expedition 12 April - 6 Juy 1962; and Zephyrus Expedition 12 July -26 Sep 1962; SIO Reference 66-16&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first indication that all three basins contained depths in excess of 10,900 metres (35,800&amp;nbsp;ft).

'''1992 – RV ''Hakuhō Maru''  ––''' The 3,987-ton Japanese research vessel ''Hakuhō Maru'', an Ocean Research Institute - University of Tokyo sponsored ship, on cruise KH-92-5 cast three Sea-Bird SBE-9 ultra-deep [[CTD (instrument)|CTD]] (conductivity-temperature-depth) profilers in a transverse line across the Challenger Deep on December 1, 1992. The center CTD was located at {{Coord|11|22.78|N|142|34.95|E}}, in the eastern basin, at {{convert|10,989|m|ft}} by the SeaBeam depth recorder and {{convert|10,884|m|ft}} by the CTD. The other two CTDs were cast 19.9&amp;nbsp;km to the north and 16.1&amp;nbsp;km to the south.  ''Hakuhō Maru'' was equipped with a narrow beam SeaBeam 500 multi-beam echosounder for depth determination, and had an Auto-Nav system with inputs from [[Satellite Transit System|NAVSAT/NNSS]], GPS, Doppler Log, EM log and track display, with a [[Geodetic datum|geodetic positioning]] accuracy approaching {{convert|100|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/coop/hakuhomaru.html |title=Research Vessel Hakuho Maru |publisher=Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, The University of Tokyo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When conducting CTD operations in the Challenger deep, they used the SeaBeam as a single beam depth recorder. At {{Coord|11|22.6|N|142|35.0|E}} the corrected depth was {{convert|10,989|m|ft}}, and at {{Coord|11|22.0|N|142|34.0|E}} the depth was {{convert|10,927|m|ft}}; both in the ''eastern'' basin. This may demonstrate that the basins might not be flat [[Sedimentary basin|sedimentary pools]] but rather undulate with a difference of {{convert|50|m|ft}} or more.  Taira revealed, “We considered that a [[Trough (geology)|trough]] deeper that ''Vitiaz''{{'s}} record by {{convert|5|m|ft}} was detected.  There is a possibly that a depth exceeding {{convert|11000|m|ft|0}} with a horizontal scale less that the [[beam width]] of measurements exists in the Challenger Deep.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/JO/pdf/6103/61030447.pdf Deep CTD Casts in the Challenger Deep, Mariana Trench] – Keisuke Taira, Daigo Yanagimoto and Shoji Kitagawa – 447 ''Journal of Oceanography'', Vol. 61, pp. 447–454, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since each SeaBeam 2.7 degree beam width sonar ping expands to cover a circular area about {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} in diameter at {{convert|11000|m|ft|0}} depth, dips in the bottom that are less that that size would be difficult to detect from a sonar-emitting platform seven miles above.

'''1996 – RV ''Yokosuka'' ––''' For most of 1995 and into 1996, the [[Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology]] (JAMSTEC) employed the 4,439-ton Research Vessel vessel ''Yokosuka'' to conduct the testing and workup of the 11,000 meter remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) ''[[Kaikō ROV|Kaikō]]'', and the 6,500 meter ROV ''Shinkai.''  It was not until February 1996, during ''Yokosuka''{{'s}} cruise Y96-06, that ''Kaikō'' was ready for its first full depth dives.  On this cruise, JAMSTEC established an area of the Challenger Deep (11°10’N to 11°30’ N, by 141°50’ E to 143°00’ E{{snd}}which later was recognized as containing three separate pools/basins en echelon, each with depths in excess of {{convert|10900|m|0|abbr=on}}) toward which JAMSTEC expeditions would concentrate their investigations for the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Kairei Cruise Report KR-08-05, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kairei Cruise Report KR-14-01, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  The Yokosuka employed a 151-beam SeaBeam 2112 12-kHz multibeam echosounder, allowing search swaths 12–15&amp;nbsp;km in width at {{convert|11000|m|ft|0}} depth. The depth accuracy of ''Yokosuka''{{'s}} Seabeam was about 0.1% of water depth (i.e. ± {{convert|110|m|ft|0}} for {{convert|11000|m|ft|0}} depth). The ship’s dual GPS systems attained geodetic positioning within double digit meter ({{convert|100|m|ft|0}} or better) accuracy.

'''1998, 1999 and 2002 – RV ''Kairei'' –– ''' Cruise KR98-01 sent JAMSTEC's two-year-old the 4,517-ton Deep Sea Research Vessel RV ''Kairei'' south for a quick but thorough depth survey of the Challenger Deep, 11–13 January 1998, under chief scientist Kantaro Fujioka. Tracking largely along the trench axis of 070°-250° they made five 80-km bathymetric survey tracks, spaced about 15-km apart, overlapping their SeaBeam 2112-004 (which now allowed sub-bottom profiling penetrating as much as 75 m below the bottom) while gaining gravity and magnetic data covering the entire Challenger Deep: western, central, and eastern basins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/darwin/mapsearch/e#11.328883171084,142.59120750425,11; search parameters &quot;Kairei&quot;, &quot;KR98-01&quot;)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okino, K. et.al., [https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/2006/171/data/cruise-reports/2001/html/4ins/95.htm Subbottom profiler]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fujioka, K. et.al., [https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2001GL013595 “Morphology and origin of the Challenger Deep in the Southern Marian Trench”], ''Geophysical Research Letters'', Vol. 29, no. 10, 1372, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JAMSTEC Deep Sea Research Ship Kairei.jpg|right|thumb|The Deep Sea Research Vessel RV ''Kairei'' was also used as the support ship for the ROV ''Kaikō'']]

''Kairei'' returned in May 1998, cruise KR98-05, with [[Kaikō ROV|ROV ''Kaikō'']], under the direction of chief scientist Jun Hashimoto with both geophysical and biological goals. Their bathymetric survey from May 14 – 26 was the most intensive and thorough depth and seismic survey of the Challenger Deep performed to date. Each evening, ''Kaikō'' deployed for about four hours of bottom time for biological-related sampling, plus about seven hours of vertical transit time. When ''Kaikō'' was onboard for servicing, ''Kairei'' conducted bathymetric surveys and observations. ''Kairei'' gridded a survey area about 130 km N-S by 110 km E-W.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/darwin/mapsearch/e#11.328883171084,142.59120750425,11 - search parameters: &quot;Kairei&quot;, &quot;KR98-05&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Kaikō'' made six dives (#71 - #75) all to the same location, (11°20.8' N, 142°12.35' E), near the {{convert|10900|m|ft}} bottom contour line in the western basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/darwin/dive/kaiko/71/e |title=KAIKO Dive 71 Dive Data |website=DARWIN |publisher=JAMSTEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regional bathymetric map made from the data obtained in 1998 shows that the greatest depths in the eastern, central, and western depressions are {{convert|10922|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|74|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|10898|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|62|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|10908|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|36|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively, making the eastern depression the deepest of the three.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep&quot;/&gt;

In 1999, ''Kairei'' revisited the Challenger Deep during cruise KR99-06. The results of the 1998-1999 surveys include the first recognition that the Challenger Deep consists of three “right-stepping en echelon individual basins bounded by the {{convert|10500|m|ft}} depth contour line. The size of [each of] the deeps are almost identical, 14-20 km long, 4 km wide.”  They concluded with the proposal “that these three individual elongated deeps constitute the ‘Challenger Deep’, and [we] identify them as the East, Central and West Deep. The deepest depth we obtained during the swath mapping is {{convert|10938|m|ft}} in the West Deep (11°20.34’ N, 142°13.20 E).”&lt;ref&gt;Fujioka, K. et.al., “Morphology and origin of the Challenger Deep in the Southern Marian Trench”, Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 29, no. 10, 1372, 2002, p. 10-2&lt;/ref&gt; The depth was “obtained during swath mapping... confirmed in both N-S and E-W swaths.”  Speed of sound corrections were from XBT to {{convert|1800|m|ft}}, and CTD below {{convert|1800|m|ft}}.

The cross track survey of the 1999 ''Kairei'' cruise shows that the greatest depths in the eastern, central, and western depressions are {{convert|10920|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|10|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|10894|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|14|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|10907|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|13|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, respectively, which supports the results of the previous survey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bathymetric mapping of the world’s deepest seafloor, Challenger Deep&quot;/&gt;

In 2002 ''Kairei'' revisited the Challenger Deep 16–25 October 2002, as cruise KR02-13 (a cooperative Japan-US-South Korea research program) with chief scientist Jun Hashimoto in charge; again with Kazuyoshi Hirata managing the ROV ''Kaikō'' team. On this survey, the size of each of the three basins was refined to 6–10&amp;nbsp;km long by about 2&amp;nbsp;km wide and in excess of {{convert|10850|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep. In marked contrast to the ''Kairei'' surveys of 1998 and 1999, the detailed survey in 2002 determined that the deepest point in the Challenger Deep is located in the eastern basin around {{Coord|11|22.260|N|142|35.589|E}}, with a depth of {{convert|10920|m|0|abbr=on}} ±{{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, located about {{convert|290|m|abbr=on}} southeast of the deepest site determined by the survey vessel ''Takuyo'' in 1984. The 2002 surveys of both the western and eastern basins were tight, with especially meticulous cross-gridding of the eastern basin with ten parallel tracks N-S and E-W less than 250 meters apart. On the morning of 17 October, ROV ''Kaikō'' dive #272 began and recovered over 33 hours later, with the ROV working at the bottom of the western basin for 26 hours (vicinity of 11°20.148' N, 142°11.774 E at {{convert|10893|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}). Five ''Kaikō'' dives followed on a daily basis into the same area to service benthic landers and other scientific equipment, with dive #277 recovered on 25 October. Traps brought up large numbers of amphipods (sea fleas), and cameras recorded holothurians ([[sea cucumber]]s), White [[polychaete]]s (bristle worms), tube worms, and other biological species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/darwin/mapsearch/e#11.332868380845,142.23056034137,14 DR02-13, Kaikō/Kairei Cruise in the Challenger Deep Onboard Report], input criteria &quot;Kairei&quot; and &quot;KR02-13&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During its 1998, 1999 surveys, ''Kairei'' was equipped with a GPS satellite-based [[Radionavigation-satellite service|radionavigation]] system.

'''2009 – RV ''Yokosuka''''' – Cruise YK09-08 brought the JAMSTEC 4,429-ton research vessel ''Yokosuka'' back to the [[Mariana Trough]] and to the Challenger Deep June-July 2009. Their mission was a two-part program: surveying three [[hydrothermal vent]] sites in the southern Mariana Trough backarc basin near 12°57’N, 143°37’E about 130 nmi northeast of the central basin of the Challenger Deep, using the autonomous underwater vehicle ''Urashima''.  AUV ''Urashima'' dives #90-94, were to a maximum depth of 3500 meters, and were successful in surveying all three sites with a Reson SEABAT7125AUV multibeam echosounder  for bathymetry, and multiple water testers to detect and map trace elements spewed into the water from hydrothermal vents, white smokers, and hot spots. Kyoko OKINO from the Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo, was [[principal investigator]] for this aspect of the cruise.
The second goal of the cruise was to deploy a new “10K free fall camera system” called ''Ashura'', to sample sediments and biologics at the bottom of the Challenger Deep. The principal investigator at the Challenger Deep was Taishi Tsubouchi of JAMSTEC. The lander ''Ashura'' made two descents: on the first, 6 July 2009, ''Ashura'' bottomed at {{Coord|11|22.3130|N|142|25.9412|E}} at {{convert|10867|m|ft|0}}.

The results were reported in 2017. Using a Kongsberg Maritime EM 122 multi-beam echosounder system coupled to positioning equipment that can determine latitude and longitude the team determined that the Challenger Deep has a maximum depth of {{convert|10925|m|ft|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11|19.945|N|142|12.123|E}} ({{Coord|11.332417|N|142.20205|E|scale:100000}}), with an estimated vertical uncertainty of ±{{convert|12|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at one standard deviation (≈ 68.3%) confidence level.

The cruise title was: “Sea trial of a full depth ROV ''UROV11K'' system in the Mariana Trench”. ''UROV11K'' carried a new [[4K resolution|4K High Definition]] video camera system, and new sensors to monitor the hydrogen-sulfide, methane, oxygen, and hydrogen content of the water.  Unfortunately, on ''UROV11K''{{'s}} ascent from {{convert|10899|m|ft|0}} (at about 11°22.30’N 142°35.8 E, in the ''eastern'' basin) on May 14, 2017, the ROV’s buoyancy failed at {{convert|5320|m|ft|0}} depth, and all efforts to retrieve the ROV were unsuccessful. The rate of descent and drift is not available, but the ROV bottomed to the east of the deepest waters of the eastern basin as revealed by the ship's maneuvering on 14 May. Murashima then directed the Kairei to a location about 35 nmi east of the eastern basin of the Challenger Deep to test a new “Compact Hadal Lander” which made three descents to depths from 7,498 to 8,178 m for testing the Sony 4K camera and for photography of fish and other macro-biologics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/darwin/cruise/kairei/kr17-08c/e R/V KAIREI Final Report, KR17-08C, Sea trial of a full depth ROV “UROV11K” system in the Mariana Trench,  2017/05/05 – 2017/05/25.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2018 – RV ''Shen Kuo'' ––''' On its maiden voyage, the 2,150-ton twin-hulled scientific research vessel ''Shen Kuo'' (also ''Shengkuo'', ''Shen Ko'', or ''Shen Quo''), departed Shanghai on 25 November 2018 and returned 8 January 2019.  They operated in the Mariana Trench area, and on 13 December tested a system of underwater navigation at a depth exceeding 10,000 metres, during a field trial of the ''Tsaihungyuy'' (ultra-short baseline) system. Project leader Tsui Veichen stated that, with the tsaihungyuy equipment at depth, it was possible to obtain a signal and determine exact [[geolocation]]s. The research team from [[Shanghai Ocean University]] and [[Westlake University]] was led by Cui Weicheng, director of Shanghai Ocean University’s Hadal Science and Technology Research Center (HSRC).{{cn|date=December 2019}}&lt;ref&gt;[Shanghai newspaper article to be adding ref here]&lt;/ref&gt;
The equipment to be tested included a manned submersible (NOT full ocean depth -- depth achieved not available) and two deep-sea landers, all capable of diving to depths of 10,000 meters, as well as a ROV that can go to 4,500 meters. They took photographs and obtained samples from the trench, including water, sediment, macro-organisms and micro-organisms. “If we can take photos of fish more than 8,145 meters under water,” said Cui, “we will break the current world record. We will test our new equipment including the landing devices. They are second generation. The first generation could only take samples in one spot per dive, but this new second generation can take samples at different depths in one dive. We also tested the ultra short baseline acoustic positioning system on the manned submersible, the future of underwater navigation.”{{cn|date=December 2019}}

'''2019 – [[RV Sally Ride (AGOR-28)|RV ''Sally Ride'']] ––''' In November 2019, as cruise SR1916, a NIOZ team led by chief scientist Hans van Haren, with Scripps technicians, deployed to the Challenger Deep aboard the 2,641-ton research vessel ''Sally Ride'', to recover a mooring line from the western basin of the Challenger Deep. The {{convert|7|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} long mooring line in the Challenger Deep consisted of top-floatation positioned around {{convert|4|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} depth, two sections of Dyneema neutrally buoyant {{convert|6|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} line, two Benthos acoustic releases and two sections of self-contained instrumentation to measure and store current, salinity and temperature. Around the {{convert|6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} depth position two current meters were mounted below a {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long array of 100 high-resolution temperature sensors. In the lower position starting {{convert|600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the sea floor 295 specially designed high-resolution temperature sensors were mounted, the lowest of which was {{convert|8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the trench floor. The mooring line was deployed and left by the NIOZ team during the November 2016 RV ''Sonne'' expedition with the intention to be recovered in late 2018 by ''Sonne''.

==Study of the depth and location of the Challenger Deep==
In 2014, a study was conducted regarding the determination of the depth and location of the Challenger Deep based on data collected previous to and during the 2010 sonar mapping of the Mariana Trench with a Kongsberg Maritime EM 122 multibeam echosounder system aboard USNS ''Sumner''. This study by James. V. Gardner et al. of the Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire splits the measurement attempt history into three main groups: early single-beam echo sounders (1950s-1970s), early multibeam echo sounders (1980s - 21st century), and modern (i.e., post-GPS, high-resolution) multibeam echo sounders. Taking uncertainties in depth measurements and position estimation into account the raw data of the 2010 bathymetry of the Challenger Deep vicinity consisting of 2,051,371 soundings from eight survey lines was analyzed. The study concludes that with the best of 2010 multibeam echosounder technologies after the analysis a depth uncertainty of ±{{convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (95% confidence level) on 9 degrees of freedom and a positional uncertainty of ±{{convert|20|to|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (2drms) remain and the location of the deepest depth recorded in the 2010 mapping is {{convert|10984|m|ft|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11.329903|N|142.199305|E|scale:100000}}. The depth measurement uncertainty is a composite of measured uncertainties in the spatial variations in sound-speed through the water volume, the ray-tracing and bottom-detection algorithms of the multibeam system, the accuracies and calibration of the motion sensor and navigation systems, estimates of spherical spreading, attenuation throughout the water volume, and so forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Gardner-et-al-2014-Challenger-Deep.pdf |title=So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench? |date=5 March 2014 |publisher=Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 maximal sonar mapping depths reported by Gardner et.al. in 2014 have not been confirmed by subsequent direct descent (pressure gauge/manometer) measurements at full-ocean depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Gardner-et-al-2014-Challenger-Deep.pdf |title=So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench? |date=5 March 2014 |publisher=Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions have reported maximal depths in a narrow range from the 1960 depth of {{convert|10913|m|ft|abbr=on}} ({{ship|Bathyscaphe|Trieste||2}}) to the 2019 depth of {{convert|10925|m|ft|abbr=on}} reported by the RV {{ship||Sally Ride}} in the ''western'' basin. In the ''eastern'' basin: deepest depths were reported as {{convert|10911|m|ft|abbr=on}} (ROV {{ship||Kaikō}}), {{convert|10902|m|ft|abbr=on}} ([[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|ROV ''Nereus'']]), {{convert|10908|m|ft|abbr=on}} ({{ship||Deepsea Challenger}}), {{convert|10929|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[benthic lander]] &quot;Leggo&quot;, and {{Convert|10,925|m|ft|abbr=on}} ±{{Convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} by  (''[[Triton Submarines|DSV Limiting Factor]]'') in May 2019. Both the RV ''Sonne'' expedition in 2016, and the RV ''Sally Ride'' expedition in 2019 expressed strong reservations concerning the depth corrections applied by the Gardner et al. study of 2014, and serious doubt concerning the accuracy of the deepest depth calculated by Gardner (in the ''western'' basin), of {{convert|10984|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Dr. Hans van Haren, chief scientist on the RV ''Sally Ride'' cruise SR1916, indicated that Gardner's calculations were 69 m too deep due to the &quot;sound velocity profiling by Gardner et al. (2014).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hansvanharen.nl/publications/cruise-reports/ van Haren, H., 2019, Cruise report PAC16: R/V Sally Ride cruise SR1916, 31 October - 4 November 2019, NIOZ, 10 pp.]&lt;/ref&gt;

No one has claimed that a measurement of any maximal depth of the Challenger Deep (either by water pressure or by ensonification) defines either the absolute deepest depth or the geophysical location of the deepest point in the Challenger Deep. Such a claim will require a survey of all three basins by both echosounders and pressure gauges, such that all depths are measured by one set of equipment and use the same correction calculations. Even then, there will remain uncertainty (error bars) of one or two standard deviations in both location and depth.  Technology will improve, but uncertainty will continue to drive efforts to fully describe the Challenger Deep.

====Planned manned descents====
In January, 2020, Caladan Oceanic commenced its second year of deep diving with the ''[[Triton Submarines|DSV Limiting Factor]]'', piloted by Victor Vescovo. The first dives of the 2020 season commenced with dives to the French submarine ''Minerve'' in the Mediterranean Sea on February 1-2, and are to include several dives in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean before returning to the Challenger Deep in June/July 2020. Caladan's &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; expedition in the Pacific is planned to include as many as eight dives into all three basins of the Challenger Deep.

====2009 – ''Nereus''====
[[File:Nereus (underwater vehicle) hydro20100720-full.jpg|thumb|HROV Nereus]]

{{Main|Nereus (underwater vehicle)}}
From May 2 to June 5, 2009, the RV ''Kilo Moana'' hosted the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] ([[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|WHOI]]) hybrid remotely operated vehicle (HROV) ''[[Nereus (underwater vehicle)|Nereus]]'' team for the first operational test of the ''{{ship||Nereus|underwater vehicle|2}}'' in its 3-ton teathered ROV mode.  The ''Nereus'' team was headed by Dr. Louis Whitcomb of [[Johns Hopkins University]], and Dr. Dana Yoerger and Andy Bowen of WHOI. The University of Hawaii sent two chief scientists: biologist Tim Shank, and geologist Patricia Fryer, to head the science team exploiting the ship’s [[bathymetry]] and organizing the science experiments deployed by the ''Nereus''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/press-room/news-release/hybrid-remotely-operated-vehicle-nereus-reaches-deepest-part-of-the-ocean/ Hybrid Remotely Operatied Vehicle Nereus Reaches Deepest Part of the Ocean]&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Nereus'' dive #007ROV to {{convert|880|m|0|abbr=on}} just south of Guam, to dive #010ROV into the [[Mariana Trench|Nero Deep]] at {{convert|9050|m|0|abbr=on}}, the testing gradually increased depths and complexities of activities at the bottom.

Dive #011ROV, on May 31, 2009, saw the ''Nereus'' piloted on a 27.8-hour underwater mission, with about ten hours transversing the ''eastern'' basin of the Challenger Deep -- from the south wall, northwest to the north wall -- streaming live video and data back to its mothership. A maximum depth of {{convert|10902|m|0|abbr=on}} was registered at {{Coord|11|22.10|N|142|35.48|E}}. The ''{{ship|RV|Kilo Moana}}'' then relocated to the ''western'' basin, where a 19.3-hour underwater dive found a maximum depth of {{convert|10899|m|0|abbr=on}} on dive #012ROV, and on dive #014ROV in the same area (11°19.59 N, 142°12.99 E) encountered a maximum depth of {{convert|10176|m|0|abbr=on}}. The ''Nereus'' was successful in recovering both sediment and rock samples from the ''eastern'' and the ''western'' basins with its manipulator arm for further scientific analysis. The HROV’s final dive was about {{convert|80|nmi|km|1|abbr=on}} to the north of the Challenger Deep, in the [[backarc]], where they dove {{convert|2963|m|0|abbr=on}} at the TOTO Caldera (12°42.00 N, 143°31.5 E).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unols.org/sites/default/files/200912desap15.pdf Operations of the Nereus Underwater Robotic Vehicle, DESSC, December 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot sub reaches deepest ocean&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8080324.stm|title=Robot sub reaches deepest ocean|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=3 June 2009|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nereus thus became the first vehicle to reach the Mariana Trench since 1998 and the deepest-diving vehicle then in operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot sub reaches deepest ocean&quot;/&gt; Project manager and developer Andy Bowen heralded the achievement as &quot;the start of a new era in ocean exploration&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot sub reaches deepest ocean&quot;/&gt; ''Nereus'', unlike ''Kaikō'', did not need to be powered or controlled by a cable connected to a ship on the ocean surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nereus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news163167519.html|title='Nereus' reaches deepest part of the ocean|date=2 June 2009|accessdate=2 June 2009|publisher=physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robot sub reaches deepest ocean&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA April and May 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/UMC/cms/ship-daily-reports/|title=Daily Reports for R/V KILO MOANA April and May 2009|date=31 May 2009|publisher=University of Hawaii Marine Center|accessdate=31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nereus Mission&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=7545&amp;tid=282&amp;cid=57586&amp;ct=162 |title=Hybrid Remotely Operated Vehicle &quot;Nereus&quot; Reaches Deepest Part of the Ocean|date=2 June 2009|publisher= Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=2 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unols.org/sites/default/files/200912desap15.pdf Operations of the Nereus Underwater Robotic Vehicle, DESSC, December 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|ABISMO}}

In June 2008, the [[Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology]] (JAMSTEC) deployed the research vessel ''Kairei'' to the area of [[Guam]] for cruise KR08-05 Leg 1 and Leg 2.
On 1-3 June 2008, during Leg 1, the Japanese robotic deep-sea probe ''[[ABISMO]]'' (Automatic Bottom Inspection and Sampling Mobile) on dives 11-13 almost reached the bottom about {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of the Challenger Deep: &quot;Unfortunately, we were unable to dive to the sea floor because the legacy primary cable of the Kaiko system was a little bit short. The 2-m long gravity core sampler was dropped in free fall, and sediment samples of 1.6m length were obtained. Twelve bottles of water samples were also obtained at various depths...&quot;  ABISMO's dive #14 was into the TOTO caldera (12°42.7777 N, 143°32.4055 E), about 60 nmi northeast of the deepest waters of the ''central'' basin of the Challenger Deep, where they obtained videos of the hydrothermal plume.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globaloceandesign.com/uploads/3/0/7/4/30747513/2009_into_the_trench_part_1.pdf Yoshida, H. et.al., The ABISMO Mud and Water Sampling ROV for Surveys at 11,000 m Depth, Marine Technology Society Journal, Winter 2009, Volume 43, No. 5, pp.87-96.]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon successful testing to {{convert|10000|m|0|abbr=on}}, JAMSTEC’ ROV ''ABISMO'' became, briefly, the only full-ocean-depth rated ROV in existence.

On their 1960 descent, the crew of the ''Trieste'' noted that the floor consisted of [[diatom]]aceous ooze and reported observing &quot;some type of flatfish&quot; lying on the seabed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1992/1/1992_1_28.shtml &quot;To the bottom of the sea&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203173230/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1992/1/1992_1_28.shtml |date=3 December 2008 }}, T.

{{quote |And as we were settling this final fathom, I saw a wonderful thing. Lying on the bottom just beneath us was some type of [[flatfish]], resembling a [[sole (fish)|sole]], about {{convert|1|ft|cm|disp=sqbr||}} long and {{convert|6|in|cm|disp=sqbr||}} across. Even as I saw him, his two round eyes on top of his head spied us{{spnd}}a monster of steel{{spnd}}invading his silent realm. Eyes? Why should he have eyes? Merely to see phosphorescence? The floodlight that bathed him was the first real light ever to enter this hadal realm. Here, in an instant, was the answer that biologists had asked for the decades. Could life exist in the greatest depths of the ocean? It could! And not only that, here apparently, was a true, bony [[teleost]] fish, not a primitive ray or [[elasmobranch]]. Yes, a highly evolved vertebrate, in time's arrow very close to man himself. Slowly, extremely slowly, this flatfish swam away. Moving along the bottom, partly in the ooze and partly in the water, he disappeared into his night. Slowly too{{spnd}}perhaps everything is slow at the bottom of the sea{{spnd}}Walsh and I shook hands.&lt;ref&gt;Seven Miles Down: The Story of the Bathyscaph Trieste (1961) by J. Piccard and R. S.

Many marine biologists are now skeptical of this supposed sighting, and it is suggested that the creature may instead have been a [[sea cucumber]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/18/james-cameron-dives-deep-avatar &quot;James Cameron dives deep for Avatar&quot;], ''Guardian'', 18 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/james-cameron-heads-into-the-abyss-1.10246 &quot;James Cameron heads into the abyss&quot;], ''Nature'', 19 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The video camera on board the ''Kaiko'' probe spotted a sea cucumber, a [[Polynoidae|scale worm]] and a [[shrimp]] at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15220548.100-mission-to-marianas--if-mount-everest-was-dropped-into-the-worlds-deepest-trench-it-woulddrown-kaiko-hit-bottom----and-came-back-to-tell-the-tale.html &quot;Mission to Marianas&quot;], ''New Scientist'', 2 November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,983295-6,00.html &quot;The last frontier&quot;], ''Time'', 14 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt; At the bottom of the Challenger deep, the ''Nereus'' probe spotted one [[polychaete]] worm (a multi-legged predator) about an inch long.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns.gov.gu/geography.html Accessed 8 Oct 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961027163532/http://ns.gov.gu/geography.html |date=1996-10-27 }} Geography of the ocean floor near Guam with some notes on exploration of the Challenger Deep.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of the sediment samples collected by ''Kaiko'' found large numbers of simple organisms at {{convert|10900|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Todo |first=Yuko |year=2005 |title=Simple Foraminifera Flourish at the Ocean's Deepest Point |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=307 |issue=5710 |page=689 |doi=10.1126/science.1105407 |url= |quote= |pmid=15692042 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower ocean trenches (&gt; 7,000 m) and on the [[abyssal plain]], the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep possibly represent [[taxon|taxa]] distinct from those in shallower ecosystems.

Most of the organisms collected were simple, soft-shelled [[foraminifera]] (432 species according to National Geographic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John |last=Roach |title=Life Is Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html |work=National Geographic News |date=3 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), with four of the others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera ''[[Leptohalysis]]'' and ''[[Reophax]]''. Eighty-five percent of the specimens were organic, soft-shelled [[allogromiid]]s, which is unusual compared to samples of [[sediment-dwelling organisms]] from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of [[Foraminifera#Organic-walled|organic-walled foraminifera]] ranges from 5% to 20%. As small organisms with hard, calcareous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because of the high solubility of [[calcium carbonate]] in the pressurized water, scientists theorize that the preponderance of soft-shelled organisms in the Challenger Deep may have resulted from the typical [[biosphere]] present when the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the course of six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment died out or were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roach|first1=John|title=Life If Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species that survived the change in depth were the ancestors of the Challenger Deep's current denizens.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}
