[https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-chiropractic-quackery-20170630-story.html Column: Chiropractic treatment, a $15-billion industry, has its roots in a ghost story.] &quot;Daniel David Palmer, the 'father' of chiropractic who performed the first chiropractic adjustment in 1895, was an avid spiritualist. He maintained that the notion and basic principles of chiropractic treatment were passed along to him during a seance by a long-dead doctor. 'The knowledge and philosophy given me by Dr. Jim Atkinson, an intelligent spiritual being ... appealed to my reason,' Palmer wrote in his memoir ''The Chiropractor,'' which was published in 1914 after his death in Los Angeles. Atkinson had died 50 years prior to Palmer's epiphany.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times.'' Retrieved: September 25, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|B. J.

== Conceptual basis ==

=== Philosophy ===
Chiropractic is generally categorized as [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM),&lt;ref name=Chapman-Smith/&gt; which focuses on manipulation of the [[musculoskeletal system]], especially the [[vertebral column|spine]].&lt;ref name=Nelson /&gt; Its founder, D.D. Palmer, called it &quot;a science of healing without drugs&quot;.&lt;ref name=Ernst-eval/&gt;

Chiropractic's origins lie in the [[folk medicine]] of [[bonesetter|bonesetting]],&lt;ref name=Ernst-eval /&gt; and as it evolved it incorporated [[vitalism]], [[spirituality|spiritual inspiration]] and [[rationalism]].&lt;ref name=Keating05 /&gt; Its early philosophy was based on [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[dogma|irrefutable doctrine]], which helped distinguish chiropractic from medicine, provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession.&lt;ref name=Keating05 /&gt; This &quot;straight&quot; philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejects the [[Inference|inferential reasoning]] of the [[scientific method]],&lt;ref name=Keating05 /&gt; and relies on deductions from vitalistic first principles rather than on the [[materialism]] of science.&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs /&gt; However, most practitioners tend to incorporate scientific research into chiropractic,&lt;ref name=&quot;Keating05&quot; /&gt; and most practitioners are &quot;mixers&quot; who attempt to combine the materialistic [[reductionism]] of science with the [[metaphysics]] of their predecessors and with the [[Holistic medicine|holistic paradigm of wellness]].&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs /&gt; A 2008 commentary proposed that chiropractic actively divorce itself from the straight philosophy as part of a campaign to eliminate [[Testability|untestable]] dogma and engage in [[critical thinking]] and evidence-based research.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphy DR, Schneider MJ, Seaman DR, Perle SM, Nelson CF | title = How can chiropractic become a respected mainstream profession?

Although a wide diversity of ideas exist among chiropractors,&lt;ref name=Keating05 /&gt; they share the belief that the spine and health are related in a fundamental way, and that this relationship is mediated through the [[nervous system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Gay RE, Nelson CF |chapter= Chiropractic philosophy|chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=altrehab.section.336|veditors=Wainapel SF, Fast A |title= Alternative Medicine and Rehabilitation: a Guide for Practitioners|year=2003|isbn=978-1-888799-66-8|location= New York|publisher= [[Demos Medical Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chiropractors claim spinal manipulation can have an effect on a variety of ailments such as [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=nhs-choices&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chiropractic/Pages/Introduction.aspx |title=Chiropractic |publisher=[[NHS Choices]] |date=20 August 2014 |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiropractic philosophy includes the following perspectives:&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/chapter2.htm|chapter= Chiropractic belief systems|vauthors=Mootz RD, Phillips RB |year=1997|title= Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice, and Research|pages=9–16|veditors=Cherkin DC, Mootz RD |location= Rockville, MD|publisher= [[Agency for Health Care Policy and Research]]|oclc=39856366}} AHCPR Pub No. 98-N002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holism]] assumes that health is affected by everything in an individual's environment; some sources also include a spiritual or [[Existentialism|existential]] dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Freeman J | title = Towards a definition of holism | journal = The British Journal of General Practice | volume = 55 | issue = 511 | pages = 154–55 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15720949 | pmc = 1463203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, reductionism in chiropractic reduces causes and cures of health problems to a single factor, [[#Vertebral subluxation|vertebral subluxation]].&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod /&gt; [[Homeostasis]] emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities. Chiropractic's early notion of innate intelligence can be thought of as a metaphor for homeostasis.&lt;ref name=Keating05&gt;{{cite book|author= Keating JC Jr|chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic|pages=77–98|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|veditors=Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-07-137534-4|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer, and retain metaphysical definitions and vitalistic qualities.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an &quot;innate intelligence&quot; exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for many diseases.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints, which they consider to be the &quot;secondary effects&quot; of subluxations, to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not &quot;mix&quot; other types of therapies into their practice style.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and they prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon terminology such as &quot;perform spinal analysis&quot;, &quot;detect subluxation&quot;, &quot;correct with adjustment&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt; They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt; Although considered the minority group, &quot;they have been able to transform their status as purists and heirs of the lineage into influence dramatically out of proportion to their numbers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt;

''Mixer'' chiropractors &quot;mix&quot; diagnostic and treatment approaches from chiropractic, medical or osteopathic viewpoints and make up the majority of chiropractors.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt; Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and hence they tend to be open to mainstream medicine.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/&gt; Many of them incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ conventional treatments including techniques of [[physical therapy]] such as exercise, [[stretching]], [[massage]], [[ice pack]]s, [[electrical muscle stimulation]], [[therapeutic ultrasound]], and [[moist heat]].&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt; Some mixers also use techniques from alternative medicine, including [[Dietary supplement|nutritional supplements]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]], and [[biofeedback]].&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg /&gt;

Although mixers are the majority group, many of them retain belief in vertebral subluxation as shown in a 2003 survey of 1,100 North American chiropractors, which found that 88 percent wanted to retain the term &quot;vertebral subluxation complex&quot;, and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62 percent.&lt;ref name=McDonald /&gt; A 2008 survey of 6,000 American chiropractors demonstrated that most chiropractors seem to believe that a subluxation-based clinical approach may be of limited utility for addressing [[visceral disorder]]s, and greatly favored non-subluxation-based clinical approaches for such conditions.&lt;ref name=Smith-Carber /&gt; The same survey showed that most chiropractors generally believed that the majority of their clinical approach for addressing musculoskeletal/biomechanical disorders such as back pain was based on subluxation.&lt;ref name=Smith-Carber&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Chiropractic Humanities|year=2008|volume=15|pages=19–26|title=Survey of US Chiropractor Attitudes and Behaviors about Subluxation|vauthors=Smith M, Carber LA|url=http://archive.journalchirohumanities.com/Vol%2015/JChiroprHumanit2008v15-19-26.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425234244/http://archive.journalchirohumanities.com/Vol%2015/JChiroprHumanit2008v15-19-26.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-04-25|doi=10.1016/s1556-3499(13)60166-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractors often offer conventional therapies such as physical therapy and lifestyle counseling, and it may for the lay person be difficult to distinguish the unscientific from the scientific.&lt;ref name=Benedetti2002&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zHxockt9CWQC|title=Spin Doctors: The Chiropractic Industry Under Examination|last=Benedetti|first=Paul|last2=MacPhail|first2=Wayne|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=9781550024067|language=en|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed ''vertebral subluxations'', interfered with the body's function and its inborn ability to heal itself.&lt;ref name=History-PPC&gt;{{cite book|author= Keating JC Jr|chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession|pages=23–64|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|veditors = Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2005|isbn=978-0-07-137534-4|display-editors=etal|author-link= Joseph C. Keating, Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; D. D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ.&lt;ref name=Keating1995 /&gt; D. D. Palmer, using a vitalistic approach, imbued the term ''subluxation'' with a metaphysical and philosophical meaning.&lt;ref name=Keating1995 /&gt; He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.&lt;ref name=Keating1995&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf|title= D.

Palmer, and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic from conventional medicine. In 1910, D. D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:&quot;[[Physiologist]]s divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] and [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]]. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory, their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality&amp;nbsp;– too much or not enough action&amp;nbsp;– which is disease.&quot;&lt;ref name=ChiropractorsAdjuster1910 /&gt;

Vertebral subluxation, a core concept of traditional chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation /&gt; In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach. While straight chiropractic still retains the traditional vitalistic construct espoused by the founders, evidence-based chiropractic suggests that a mechanistic view will allow chiropractic care to become integrated into the wider health care community.&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Keating JC, Charlton KH, Grod JP, Perle SM, Sikorski D, Winterstein JF | title = Subluxation: dogma or science? | journal = Chiropractic &amp; Osteopathy| volume = 13 | issue =  | page = 17 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16092955 | pmc = 1208927 | doi = 10.1186/1746-1340-13-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is still a continuing source of debate within the chiropractic profession as well, with some schools of chiropractic still teaching the traditional/straight subluxation-based chiropractic, while others have moved towards an [[evidence-based]] chiropractic that rejects metaphysical foundings and limits itself to primarily neuromusculoskeletal conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Chiropractic Education|year=2000|volume=14|issue=2|pages=71–77|title=A survey of the use of evidence-based health care in chiropractic college clinics|vauthors=Rose KA, Adams A|url=http://www.journalchiroed.com/2000/JCEFall2000Rose.PDF|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081002073736/http://www.journalchiroed.com/2000/JCEFall2000Rose.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Manual &amp; Manipulative Therapy|year=2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=E14–18|title=Can chiropractors and evidence-based manual therapists work together? an opinion from a veteran chiropractor|author=Homola S|url=http://jmmtonline.com/documents/HomolaV14N2E.pdf|doi=10.1179/jmt.2006.14.2.14E|citeseerx=10.1.1.366.2817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[vertebral subluxation|chiropractic subluxation]] was defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as &quot;a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact.&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines /&gt; It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity.&quot;&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines /&gt; This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as [[Radio diagnostics|X-rays]].&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines&gt;{{cite book |author= World Health Organization|year=2005|title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf|isbn= 978-92-4-159371-7|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exposes patients to harmful [[ionizing radiation]] for no evidentially supported reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=HJ|title=Awareness of radiographic guidelines for low back pain: a survey of Australian chiropractors.|journal=Chiropractic &amp; Manual Therapies|date=5 October 2016|volume=24|page=39|doi=10.1186/s12998-016-0118-7|pmc=5051064|pmid=27713818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ammendolia /&gt; The 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' states &quot;X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, because they do not exist.&quot;&lt;ref name=Trick-or-Treatment&gt;{{cite book|pages=145–90|chapter=The truth about chiropractic therapy|title=Trick or Treatment: The Undeniable Facts about Alternative Medicine |last1=Singh |first1=S |last2=Ernst |first2=E |year=2008|publisher=W.W.

As of 2014, the [[National Board of Chiropractic Examiners]] states &quot;The specific focus of chiropractic practice is known as the chiropractic subluxation or joint dysfunction.

Spinal manipulation, which chiropractors call &quot;spinal adjustment&quot; or &quot;chiropractic adjustment&quot;, is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care.&lt;ref name=NBCE_techniques /&gt; Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP /&gt; Its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP /&gt; High-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) thrusts have physiological effects that signal neural discharge from paraspinal muscle tissues, depending on duration and amplitude of the thrust are factors of the degree in paraspinal muscle spindles activation.&lt;ref name=Pickar2007 /&gt; Clinical skill in employing HVLA-SM thrusts depends on the ability of the practitioner to handle the duration and magnitude of the load.&lt;ref name=Pickar2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pickar JG, Sung PS, Kang YM, Ge W | title = Response of lumbar paraspinal muscles spindles is greater to spinal manipulative loading compared with slower loading under length control | journal = The Spine Journal| volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 583–95 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17905321 | pmc = 2075482 | doi = 10.1016/j.spinee.2006.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, [[spinal manipulative therapy]] (SMT) describes techniques where the hands are used to manipulate, massage, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, apply traction to, or otherwise influence the spine and related tissues.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf|title=Spinal manipulation policy statement|vauthors=Winkler K, Hegetschweiler-Goertz C, Jackson PS|accessdate=2008-05-24|year=2003|publisher=American Chiropractic Association|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720114044/http://www.acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf|archive-date=2011-07-20|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other procedures are used by chiropractors for treating the spine, other joints and tissues, and general health issues. The following procedures were received by more than one-third of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey: Diversified technique (full-spine manipulation; mentioned in previous paragraph), [[physical fitness]]/exercise promotion, corrective or therapeutic exercise, [[ergonomic]]/[[Neutral spine|postural]] advice, [[self-care]] strategies, [[activities of daily living]], changing risky/unhealthy behaviors, [[Diet (nutrition)|nutritional/dietary]] recommendations, [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]]/[[stress reduction]] recommendations, [[Cryotherapy|ice pack/cryotherapy]], extremity adjusting (also mentioned in previous paragraph), trigger point therapy, and [[disease prevention]]/early [[Screening (medicine)|screening]] advice.&lt;ref name=NBCE_techniques&gt;{{cite book|title= Job Analysis of Chiropractic|chapter= Professional functions and treatment procedures|year=2005|pages=121–38|vauthors=Christensen MG, Kollasch MW |location= Greeley, CO|publisher= [[National Board of Chiropractic Examiners]]|chapterurl=http://nbce.org/pdfs/job-analysis/chapter_10.pdf|accessdate=2008-08-25|isbn=978-1-884457-05-0 |url= http://nbce.org/pdfs/job-analysis/chapter_10.pdf|archive-url= https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080910235612/http://nbce.org/pdfs/job-analysis/chapter_10.pdf|url-status= dead|archivedate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Practice guidelines ===

Reviews of research studies within the chiropractic community have been used to generate practice guidelines outlining standards that specify which chiropractic treatments are &quot;legitimate&quot; (i.e. supported by evidence) and conceivably reimbursable under [[managed care]] health payment systems.&lt;ref name=Villanueva-Russell /&gt; Evidence-based guidelines are supported by one end of an ideological continuum among chiropractors; the other end employs [[antiscientific]] reasoning and makes unsubstantiated claims.&lt;ref name=Nelson /&gt;&lt;ref name=History-Primer2&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiropractic history: a primer |author=Joseph C.

=== Risk-benefit ===

A 2012 systematic review concluded that no accurate assessment of risk-benefit exists for cervical manipulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes&quot; /&gt; A 2010 systematic review stated that there is no good evidence to assume that neck manipulation is an effective treatment for any medical condition and suggested a [[precautionary principle]] in healthcare for chiropractic intervention even if a causality with [[vertebral artery dissection]] after neck manipulation were merely a remote possibility.&lt;ref name=Ernst-death/&gt; The same review concluded that the risk of death from manipulations to the neck outweighs the benefits.&lt;ref name=Ernst-death /&gt; Chiropractors have criticized this conclusion, claiming that the author did not evaluate the potential benefits of spinal manipulation.&lt;ref name=Ernst-response /&gt; [[Edzard Ernst]] stated &quot;This detail was not the subject of my review. I do, however, refer to such evaluations and should add that a report recently commissioned by the General Chiropractic Council did not support many of the outlandish claims made by many chiropractors across the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ernst-response&gt;{{cite journal | author = E Ernst | title = Response to critiques of deaths after chiropractic | journal = International Journal of Clinical Practice| volume = 65 | issue = 1 | page = 106 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02568.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review evaluating maintenance chiropractic care found that spinal manipulation is routinely associated with considerable harm and no compelling evidence exists to indicate that it adequately prevents symptoms or diseases, thus the risk-benefit is not evidently favorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ernst E | title = Chiropractic maintenance treatment, a useful preventative approach? | journal = Preventive Medicine| volume = 49 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 99–100 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19465044 | doi = 10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.05.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cost-effectiveness ===

A 2006 systematic cost-effectiveness review found that the reported cost-effectiveness of spinal manipulation in the United Kingdom compared favorably with other treatments for back pain, but that reports were based on data from clinical trials without sham controls and that the specific cost-effectiveness of the treatment (as opposed to non-specific effects) remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Canter PH, Coon JT, Ernst E | title = Cost-Effectiveness of Complementary Therapies in the United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– A Systematic Review† | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine| volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17173105 | pmc = 1697737 | doi = 10.1093/ecam/nel044 | url = http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/4/425 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511154423/http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/4/425 | archivedate = 2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 American systematic review of economic evaluations of conservative treatments for low back pain found that significant quality problems in available studies meant that definite conclusions could not be drawn about the most cost-effective intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Roer N, Goossens ME, Evers SM, van Tulder MW | title = What is the most cost-effective treatment for patients with low back pain? a systematic review | journal = Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Rheumatology| volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 671–84 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15949783 | doi = 10.1016/j.berh.2005.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care is unknown.&lt;ref name=Leboeuf-Yde-C /&gt;

{{Main|History of chiropractic}}
[[File:Harvey Lillard.jpg|thumb|left|169px|[[William Harvey Lillard|Harvey Lillard]], first chiropractic patient]]
Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Palmer, a [[Magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease.&lt;ref name=Baer /&gt; The first chiropractic patient of D.D. Palmer was [[Harvey Lillard]], a worker in the building where Palmer's office was located.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; He claimed that he had severely reduced hearing for 17 years, which started soon following a &quot;pop&quot; in his spine.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; A few days following his adjustment, Lillard claimed his hearing was almost completely restored.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Chiropractic competed with its predecessor osteopathy, another medical system based on magnetic healing and [[bonesetting]]; both systems were founded by charismatic midwesterners in opposition to the conventional medicine of the day, and both postulated that manipulation improved health.&lt;ref name=Baer&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|year=1987 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=176–93 |title=Divergence and convergence in two systems of manual medicine: osteopathy and chiropractic in the United States |author=Baer HA |doi=10.1525/maq.1987.1.2.02a00030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially keeping chiropractic a family secret, in 1898 Palmer began teaching it to a few students at his new [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; One student, his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer]], became committed to promoting chiropractic, took over the Palmer School in 1906, and rapidly expanded its enrollment.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of innate intelligence, a [[vitalistic]] nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; D.D. Palmer said he &quot;received chiropractic from the other world&quot;.&lt;ref name=Religion&gt;[http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf D.D. Palmer's Religion of Chiropractic]&amp;nbsp;–  Letter from D.D. Palmer to P.W. Johnson, D.C., May 4, 1911. In the letter, he often refers to himself with [[Royal we|royal third person terminology]] and also as &quot;Old Dad&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|legal protection under the U.S. constitution]], but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]].&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf|author= Palmer DD|title= D.D. Palmer's Religion of Chiropractic: Letter to P.W. Johnson, D.C|date=1911-05-04|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early chiropractors also tapped into the [[Populism|Populist]] movement, emphasizing craft, hard work, competition, and advertisement, aligning themselves with the common man against intellectuals and [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]], among which they included the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;
[[File:Bartlett joshua palmer.JPG|thumb|right|169px|[[B. J. Palmer]], early developer of chiropractic]]
Chiropractic has seen considerable [[Chiropractic controversy and criticism|controversy and criticism]].&lt;ref name=DeVocht /&gt;&lt;ref name=Homola/&gt; Although D.D. and B.J. were &quot;straight&quot; and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called &quot;mixers&quot;, advocated the use of instruments.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; In 1910, B.J. changed course and endorsed X-rays as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt; That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights. By the 1930s, chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Martin /&gt;

Chiropractors faced heavy opposition from organized medicine.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; DD Palmer was jailed in 1907 for practicing medicine without a license.&lt;ref name=Jail&gt;[http://www.chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/Gregory,Alva-chrono.pdf] — Chiro.org&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of chiropractors were prosecuted for [[Health care provider#Practicing without a license|practicing medicine without a license]], and D.D. and many other chiropractors were jailed.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; To defend against medical statutes, B.J. argued that chiropractic was separate and distinct from medicine, asserting that chiropractors &quot;analyzed&quot; rather than &quot;diagnosed&quot;, and &quot;adjusted&quot; subluxations rather than &quot;treated&quot; disease.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; B.J. cofounded the Universal Chiropractors' Association (UCA) to provide legal services to arrested chiropractors.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; Although the UCA won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; The longstanding feud between chiropractors and [[medical doctor]]s continued for decades. The AMA labeled chiropractic an &quot;unscientific [[cult]]&quot; in 1966,&lt;ref name=Chiro-PH&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson C, Baird R, Dougherty PE, Globe G, Green BN, Haneline M, Hawk C, Injeyan HS, Killinger L, Kopansky-Giles D, Lisi AJ, Mior SA, Smith M | title = Chiropractic and public health: current state and future vision | journal = Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics| volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 397–410 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18722194 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and until 1980 advised its members that it was unethical for medical doctors to associate with &quot;unscientific practitioners&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cherkin D | title = AMA policy on chiropractic | journal = American Journal of Public Health| volume = 79 | issue = 11 | pages = 1569–70 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2817179 | pmc = 1349822 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.79.11.1569-a }}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in a landmark 1987 decision, ''[[Wilk v. American Medical Association|Wilk v. AMA]]'', in which the court found that the AMA had engaged in unreasonable restraint of trade and conspiracy, and which ended the AMA's de facto boycott of chiropractic.&lt;ref name=CooperMcKee2003/&gt;

Serious research to test chiropractic theories did not begin until the 1970s, and is continuing to be hampered by antiscientific and [[pseudoscientific]] ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine.&lt;ref name=History-Primer /&gt; By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain.&lt;ref name=History-Primer&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiropractic history: a primer |author1=Keating JC Jr |author2=Cleveland CS III |author3=Menke M |url=http://ahc.memberclicks.net/assets/documents/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher=Association for the History of Chiropractic |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424011335/http://ahc.memberclicks.net/assets/documents/ChiroHistoryPrimer.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and [[health plan]]s, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services.&lt;ref name=CooperMcKee2003/&gt; However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, evidence-based medicine insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, managed care restricted payment, and competition grew from [[massage therapist]]s and other health professions.&lt;ref name=CooperMcKee2003/&gt; The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into alternative medicine and primary care.&lt;ref name=CooperMcKee2003/&gt;

The word ''chiropractic'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] χειρο- ''[[wikt:chiro#English|chiro-]]'' (itself from [[wikt:χείρ#Ancient Greek|χείρ]] ''cheir'' &quot;hand&quot;), &quot;hand&quot; and [[wikt:πρακτικός#Ancient Greek|πρακτικός]] ''praktikos'', &quot;practical&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiropractic |title=Definition of ''chiropractic'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiro- |title=Definition of ''chiro-'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractic is classified as a field of [[pseudomedicine]] on account of its [[esoteric]] origins.&lt;ref name=Swanson2015&gt;{{cite book |author=Swanson ES |title=Science and Society: Understanding Scientific Methodology, Energy, Climate, and Sustainability |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQmhCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65 |year=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-21987-5 |page=65 |chapter=Pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public health ==
{{further|Vaccine controversy#Alternative medicine|Water fluoridation controversy}}
Some chiropractors oppose [[vaccination]] and [[water fluoridation]], which are common [[public health]] practices.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod /&gt; Within the chiropractic community there are significant disagreements about vaccination, one of the most cost-effective public health interventions available.&lt;ref name=WardleFrawley2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wardle|first1=Jon|last2=Frawley|first2=Jane|last3=Steel|first3=Amie|last4=Sullivan|first4=Elizabeth|title=Complementary medicine and childhood immunisation: A critical review|journal=Vaccine|volume=34|issue=38|year=2016|pages=4484–4500|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.07.026|pmid=27475472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects,&lt;ref name=Busse /&gt; claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but a significant portion of the profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; The extent to which anti-vaccination views perpetuate the current chiropractic profession is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Busse /&gt; The American Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; The [[Canadian Chiropractic Association]] supports vaccination;&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt; a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating themselves or their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell ML, Injeyan HS, Verhoef MJ, Eliasziw M | title = Beliefs and behaviours: understanding chiropractors and immunization | journal = Vaccine| volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 372–79 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15530683 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.05.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early opposition to water fluoridation included chiropractors, some of whom continue to oppose it as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jones RB, Mormann DN, Durtsche TB | title = Fluoridation referendum in La Crosse, Wisconsin: contributing factors to success | journal = American Journal of Public Health| volume = 79 | issue = 10 | pages = 1405–08 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2782512 | pmc = 1350185 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.79.10.1405 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional chiropractic opposition to water fluoridation and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive lifelong chiropractic treatment.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod /&gt;
