'''Clara Petacci''', known as '''Claretta Petacci''' ({{IPA-it|klaˈretta peˈtattʃi|lang}}; 28 February 1912 – 28 April 1945), was a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] of the Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] and was executed with him by [[Italian resistance|partisans]].

==Family==
Clara Petacci's father was Dr. Francesco Petacci, primary physician of Pope [[Pius XI]]. Her sister was actress [[Miriam di San Servolo]] (31 May 1923 &amp;ndash; 24 May 1991), also known as Miriam Petacci or Miriam Day. Petacci's brother, Marcello Petacci, was captured with Mussolini and Petacci.  However, rather than being executed in [[Dongo (CO)|Dongo]], he was shot while trying to escape.
