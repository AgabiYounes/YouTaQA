'''Compactrons''' are a type of [[vacuum tube|thermionic valve]], or vacuum tube, which contain multiple electrode structures packed into a single enclosure. They were designed to compete with early transistor electronics and were used in [[television]]s, [[radio]]s, and similar roles.

== History ==
The '''Compactron''' was a trade name applied to multi-electrode structure tubes specifically constructed on a 12-pin Duodecar base. This [[vacuum tube]] family was introduced in 1961 by [[General Electric]] in [[Owensboro, Kentucky]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electronicdesign.com/4g/multi-function-compactrons-promise-two-tube-radio |title=Multi-Function Compactrons Promise Two-Tube Radio |publisher=Electronic Design |page=74 |date=July 20, 1960 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; to compete with transistorized electronics during the [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] transition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.junkbox.com/electronics/CompactronTubesIndex.shtml  |title=Compactron Tubes: A Junkbox Guide |publisher=Copperwood Media LLC. |first=Jeff |last=Duntemann |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Television]] sets were a primary application. The idea of multi-electrode tubes itself was far from new and indeed the Loewe company of Germany was producing multi-electrode tubes as far back as 1926, and they even included all of the required passive components as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_3nf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Use was prevalent in televisions because transistors were slow to achieve the high power and frequency capabilities needed particularly in color television sets. The first portable color television, the General Electric [[Porta-Color]], was designed using 13 tubes, 10 of which were Compactrons. Even before the compactron design was unveiled, nearly all tube based electronic equipment used multi-electrode tubes of one type or another. Virtually every AM/FM radio receiver of the 1950s and 60's used a 6AK8 (EABC80) tube (or equivalent) consisting of three diodes and a triode which was designed in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.r-type.org/exhib/abc0014.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Compactron's integrated valve design helped lower power consumption and heat generation (they were to tubes what [[integrated circuits]] were to [[transistors]]). Compactrons were also used in a few high end Hi-Fi stereos.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They were also used by the Ampeg guitar amplifier company in some of their guitar amps. No modern tube based Hi-Fi systems are known to use this tube type, as simpler and more readily available tubes have again filled this niche. One tube, the 7868, is used in some Hi-Fi systems made today. This tube is a Novar tube. It has the same physical dimensions as the compactron, but a 9 pin base. The exhaust tip is on the top or bottom of the tube, depending on the manufacturer's preference. It is currently in production by Electro-Harmonix.(The new power amp, Linear Tube Audioâ€™s Ultralinear, uses 4 17JN6 compactron tubes as the power tube in the amp.) The amp generates 20 watts of power with these inexpensive TV tubes.

== Notable features ==
[[Image:Duodekar.JPG|thumb|right|The evacuation tip is in the center of the circular pin pattern.]]
A distinguishing feature of most Compactrons is the placement of the [[evacuation tip]] on the bottom end, rather than the top end as was customary with &quot;miniature&quot; tubes, and a characteristic 3/4&quot; diameter circle pin pattern.
* Most Compactrons ranged in glass envelope diameter from 1{{fraction|1|8}}&quot; to 2{{fraction|3|4}}&quot; depending upon the internal configuration. Variations of the Compactron design were made by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]] and by some Japanese firms.

== Examples ==
Examples of Compactrons type types include:
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6ag11.html 6AG11] double diode similar to 6AL5, double triode high-mu similar to [[12AT7]]. Designed for FM stereo multiplex service. 
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6bk11.html 6BK11] triple triode. Two of the triodes are similar to [[12AX7]] and one of them is similar to 5751.
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6c10.html 6C10] high-mu triple triode for color matrix amplifiers in television by [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]], etc.... ''not related to the [[Ediswan|Edison Swan (later Mazda)]] 6C10 triode-hexode''
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6m11.html 6M11] twin triode - pentode. Designed for sync separators and [[Automatic gain control|AGC]] amplifier circuits. 
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6k11.html 6K11] triple triode. Designed for sync separators and [[Automatic gain control|AGC]] amplifier circuits. 
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_6lf6.html 6LF6] beam power pentode with anode cap. Designed for horizontal output service. 
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_8b10.html 8B10] twin triode - twin diode. Designed for horizontal phase detector service, and horizontal oscillator service. 
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_12ae10.html 12AE10] twin pentode. Designed for FM discriminator/detector, and audio output. 
*[https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_38hk7.html 38HK7] pentode diode. Designed for horizontal output service and as a damper diode

Due to their specific applications in television circuits, many different Compactron types were produced. Almost all were assigned using standard US tube numbers.

== Technological obsolescence ==
{{Original research|section|date=July 2016}}Integrated circuits (of the analogue and digital type) gradually took over all of the functions that the Compactron was designed for. &quot;Hybrid&quot; television sets produced in the early to mid-1970s made use of a combination of tubes (typically Compactrons), transistors, and integrated circuits in the same set. By the mid-1980s this type of tube was functionally obsolete. Compactrons simply don't exist in any TV sets designed after 1986. Other specialist uses of the tube declined in parallel with the television set manufacture. Manufacture of Compactrons ceased in the early 1990s. [[New old stock]] replacements for almost all Compactron types produced are easily found for sale on the Internet.
