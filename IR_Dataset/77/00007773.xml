The '''Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight''' is a medium-lift [[tandem rotors|tandem-rotor]] [[transport helicopter]] powered by twin [[turboshaft]] [[aircraft engine|engines]]. It was designed by [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol]] and manufactured by [[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Vertol]] following Vertol's acquisition by [[Boeing]].

Development of the Sea Knight, which was originally designated by the firm as the '''Vertol Model 107''', commenced during 1956. It was envisioned as a successor to the first generation of rotorcraft, such as the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] &quot;Flying Banana&quot;, that had been powered by [[Reciprocating engine|piston engines]]; in its place, the '''V-107''' made use of the emergent [[turboshaft]] engine. On 22 April 1958, the V-107 prototype performed its [[maiden flight]]. During June 1958, the US Army awarded a contract for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft, designated as the '''YHC-1A''', based on the V-107; this initial order was later cut down to three YHC-1As though. During 1961, the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC), who had been studying its requirements for a medium-lift, twin-turbine cargo/troop assault helicopter, selected Boeing Vertol's '''Model 107M''' as the basis from which to manufacture a suitable rotorcraft to meet their needs. Known colloquially as the &quot;Phrog&quot; and formally as the &quot;Sea Knight&quot;, it was operated across all US Marine Corps' operational environments between its introduction during the [[Vietnam War]] and its frontline retirement during 2014.
 
The Sea Knight was operated by the USMC to provide all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment until it was replaced by the [[MV-22 Osprey]] during the 2010s. The USMC also used the helicopter for [[combat support#United States Marine Corps|combat support]], [[search and rescue]] (SAR), [[CASEVAC|casualty evacuation]] and Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP). The Sea Knight also functioned as the [[US Navy]]'s standard medium-lift [[utility helicopter]] prior to the type being phased out of service in favor of the [[MH-60S Knighthawk]] during the early 2000s. Several overseas operators acquired the rotorcraft as well. [[Canada]] operated the Sea Knight, designated as '''CH-113'''; the type was used predominantly in the [[search and rescue]] (SAR) role until 2004. Other export customers for the type included [[Japan]], [[Sweden]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The commercial version of the rotorcraft is the '''BV 107-II''', commonly referred to simply as the &quot;Vertol&quot;.

==Development==
===Origins===
During the 1940s and 1950s, American rotorcraft manufacturer [[Piasecki Helicopter]] emerged as a pioneering developer of [[Tandem rotors|tandem-rotor]] helicopters; perhaps the most famous of these being the piston-powered [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] &quot;Flying Banana&quot;, an early utility and transport helicopter. During 1955, Piasecki was officially renamed as [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol Corporation]] (standing for [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]]); it was around this time that work commenced on the development of a new generation of tandem rotor helicopter. During 1956, the new design received the internal company designation of ''Vertol Model 107'', or simply ''V-107''; this rotorcraft differed from its predecessors by harnessing the newly developed [[turboshaft]] engine instead of piston-based counterparts. During that year, construction of a prototype, powered by a pair of [[Lycoming T53]] [[turboshaft]] engines, each one being capable of producing 877 shp (640&amp;nbsp;kW), commenced.&lt;ref name=Apostolo&gt;Apostolo, Giorgio. &quot;Boeing Vertol Model 107&quot;. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters''. New York: Bonanza Books. 1984. {{ISBN|978-0-517-43935-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 1958, the V-107 prototype performed its [[maiden flight]].&lt;ref name=Donald_V-107/&gt; In order to garner publicity for the newly developed rotorcraft, it was decided to use the prototype to conduct a series of publicised flight demonstrations during a tour across the United States and several overseas nations. During June 1958, it was announced that the U.S. Army had awarded a contract to Vertol for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft based on the V-107, which were designated ''YHC-1A''.&lt;ref name=&quot;whirly&quot;&gt;Spenser, Jay P. ''Whirlybirds, A History of the U.S. Helicopter Pioneers''. University of Washington Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-295-97699-3}} {{page needed|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this order was later decreased to three helicopters; according to aviation author Jay P. Spenser, the cutback had been enacted in order that the U.S. Army would be able to divert funds for the development of the rival ''V-114'' helicopter, which was also a turbine-powered tandem rotor design but substantially larger than the V-107.&lt;ref name=&quot;whirly&quot;/&gt; All of the U.S. Army's three YHC-1As were powered by pairs of [[General Electric T58|GE-T-58]] engines. During August 1959, the first YHC-1A-model rotorcraft conducted its first flight; independently, it was shortly followed by the maiden flight of an improved model intended for the commercial and export markets, designated ''107-II''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm CH-46 history page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202119/http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm |date=3 December 2007 }}. U.S. Navy, 16 November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marines CH-46 Helicopter.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines of the [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] boarding a CH-46, August 2006]]
During 1960, the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] evolved a requirement for a medium-lift, twin-turbine troop/cargo assault helicopter to replace the various piston-engined types that were then in widespread use with the service.&lt;ref name=&quot;vert_Tandom&quot;&gt;&quot;Tandem Twosome&quot;, ''Vertical Magazine'', February–March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, American aviation company [[Boeing]] acquired Vertol, after which the group was consequently renamed [[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Vertol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whirly&quot;/&gt; Following a competition between several competing designs, during early 1961, it was announced that Boeing Vertol had been selected to manufacture its model 107M for the U.S. Marine Corps, where it was designated ''HRB-1''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt; During 1962, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] placed its own order for 12 ''XCH-46B Sea Knight'' helicopters, which used the ''XH-49A'' designation; however, the service later decided to cancel the order due to delays in its delivery; instead, the U.S. Air Force opted to procure the rival [[Sikorsky S-61R]] in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.helis.com/database/modelorg/423/|title= US Air Force CH-46B |accessdate=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Sea Knight's first flight in August 1962, the military designation was changed to ''CH-46A''. During November 1964, the introduction of the Marines' CH-46A and the Navy's UH-46As commenced. The UH-46A variant was a modified version of the rotorcraft to perform the [[vertical replenishment]] mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt; The CH-46A was equipped with a pair of T58-GE8-8B turboshaft engines, each being rated at 1,250 shp (930&amp;nbsp;kW); these allowed the Sea Knight to carry up to 17 passengers or a maximum of 4,000 pounds (1,815&amp;nbsp;kg) of cargo.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt;

===Further developments===
During 1966, production of the improved ''CH-46D'' commenced with deliveries following shortly thereafter. This model featured various improvements, including modified [[rotor blade]]s and the adoption of more powerful T58-GE-10 turboshaft engines,&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt; rated at {{convert|1400|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each. The increased power of these new engines allowed the CH-46D to carry an increased payload, such as up to 25 troops or a maximum of {{convert|7000|lb|kg|sigfig=3}} of cargo.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt; During late 1967, the improved model was introduced to the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam theater]], where it supplemented the U.S. Marine Corps' existing CH-46A fleet, which had proven to be relatively unreliable and problematic in service.&lt;ref&gt;Rottman and Hook 2007, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the USMC's CH-46Ds, the U.S. Navy also acquired a small number of UH-46Ds for ship resupply purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eden&quot;&gt;Eden, Paul, ed. &quot;Boeing-Vertol H-46 Sea Knight&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. Amber Books, 2004. {{ISBN|1-904687-84-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, approximately 33 CH-46As were progressively re-manufactured to the CH-46D standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt;

Between 1968 and 1971, the U.S. Marine Corps received a number of CH-46F standard rotorcraft. This model retained the T58-GE-10 engines used on the CH-46D while featuring revised avionics and featured a number of other modifications. The CH-46F was the final production model of the type.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt; During its service life, the Sea Knight received a variety of upgrades and modifications. Over time, the majority of the U.S. Marine Corps' Sea Knights were upgraded to the improved CH-46E standard. This model featured [[fiberglass]] rotor blades, reinforcement measures throughout the airframe, along with the refitting of further uprated T58-GE-16 engines, capable of producing {{convert|1870|shp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} each; in addition, several CH-46Es were modified to double their maximum fuel capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt; Starting in the mid-1990s, the Dynamic Component Upgrade (DCU) programmes was enacted, focusing on the implementation of strengthened drive systems and modified rotor controls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The commercial variant, the ''BV 107-II'', was first ordered by [[New York Airways]] during 1960. During July 1962, they took delivery of their first three aircraft, which was configured to seat up to 25 passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;vert_Tandom&quot;/&gt; During 1965, Boeing Vertol sold the manufacturing rights of the 107 to Japanese [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]. Under this arrangement, all Model 107 civilian and military aircraft [[#Japanese versions|built in Japan]] were referred to by the ''KV 107'' designation.&lt;ref name=&quot;vert_Tandom&quot;/&gt; On 15 December 2006, [[Columbia Helicopters, Inc]] acquired the [[type certificate]] for the BV 107-II; at the time, the company was reportedly in the process of acquiring a Production Certificate from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). Plans for actual production of the aircraft were not announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;vert_Tandom&quot;/&gt;

The ''Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight'' is a medium-lift [[tandem rotors|tandem-rotor]] [[transport helicopter]], furnished with a set of counter-rotating main rotors in a [[tandem rotor|tandem-rotor]] configuration. It was typically powered by a pair of [[General Electric T58]] [[turboshaft]] engines, which were mounted on each side of the rear rotor pedestal; power to the forward rotor was transferred from the rear-mounted engines via a [[drive shaft]]. For redundancy, both engines are coupled so that either one would be capable of powering both of the main rotors in the event of a single engine failure or a similar emergency situation. Each of the rotors feature three [[rotor blade|blade]]s, which can be folded to better facilitate storage and naval operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;&gt;[http://www.airvectors.net/avch47_1.html &quot;Boeing Sea Knight&quot;]. Vectorsite.net, 1 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The CH-46 features a fixed [[tricycle landing gear]], complete with twin wheels on all three legs of the landing gear; this configuration results in a nose-up stance, helping to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. Two of the main landing gear were installed within protruding rear [[sponson]]s; the free interior space of the sponsons are also used to house fuel tanks, possessing a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt;

The interior of the CH-46 was largely taken up by its cargo bay, complete with a rear loading ramp that could be removed or left open in flight for the carriage of extended cargoes or for parachute drops. Various furnishings were normally provided to aid in its use as a utility rotorcraft, such as an internal [[winch]] mounted within the forward cabin, which can be used to assisting loading by pulling external cargo on [[pallet]]s into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers, and an optionally-attached belly-mounted [[Cargo hook (helicopter)|cargo hook]], which would be usually rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} for carrying cargoes externally underneath the Sea Knight; despite the hook having been rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, this was safety restricted to less payload as they got older. When operated in a typical configuration, the CH-46 would usually be operated by a crew of three; a larger crew could be accommodated when required, which would be dependent upon mission specifics. For example, a [[search and rescue]] (SAR) variant would usually carry a crew of five (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Crew Chief, Swimmer, and Medic) to facilitate all aspects of such operations. For self-defense, a [[pintle]]-mounted [[M2 Browning|0.50 in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) Browning]] [[machine gun]] could be mounted on each side of the helicopter.&lt;ref name=&quot;vect_CH-46&quot;/&gt; Service in southeast Asia resulted in the addition of [[armor]] along with the machine guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;CH-46_hist_USN&quot;/&gt;

Known colloquially as the &quot;Phrog&quot;, the Sea Knight was used in all U.S. Marine operational environments between its introduction during the [[Vietnam War]] and its frontline retirement in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helis.com/60s/h_h46.php|title=Boeing Vertol 107 – CH-46 Sea Knight|publisher=Helis.com|work=Helicopter History Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type's longevity and reputation for reliability led to mantras such as &quot;phrogs phorever&quot; and &quot;never trust a helicopter under 30&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask A Marine|publisher=HMM-364 Purple Foxy Ladies|url=http://www.purplefoxyladies.com/ask.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230060309/http://purplefoxyladies.com/ask.html|archivedate=30 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; CH-46s transported personnel, evacuated wounded, supplied forward arming and refueling points (FARP), performed vertical replenishment, search and rescue, recovered downed aircraft and crews and other tasks.

====Vietnam War====
During the Vietnam War, the CH-46 was one of the prime US Marine troop transport helicopters in the theater, slotting between the smaller [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] and larger [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion]]. CH-46 operations were plagued by major technical problems; the engines, being prone to [[foreign object damage]] (FOD) from debris being ingested when hovering close to the ground and subsequently suffering a [[compressor stall]], had a lifespan as low as 85 flight hours; on 21 July 1966, all CH-46s were grounded until more efficient filters had been fitted.&lt;ref&gt;Dunstan 2003, pp. 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 May 1967, a CH-46D at [[Marine Corps Air Station Tustin|Marine Corps Air Facility Santa Ana]] crashed, killing all four members of the crew. Within three days the accident investigators had determined that the mounting brackets of the main transmission had failed, allowing the front and rear overlapping rotors to intermesh. All CH–46s were temporarily grounded for inspection. On 13 May, a CH–46A crashed off the coast of Vietnam when the tail pylon containing the engines, main transmission and aft rotors broke off in flight. All four crew members were killed. On 20 June, another CH–46A crashed, though two of the four-man crew survived. Once again, even though the aircraft was not recovered from the water, failure of some sort in the rear pylon was suspected. On 30 June a CH-46D at Santa Ana crashed when a rotor blade separated from the aircraft, all three of the crew survived. As a result of this latest accident, all CH-46Ds were immediately grounded, but the CH-46As continued flying. On 3 July another CH-46A crashed in Vietnam, killing all four Marines of its crew. The cause of the crash again was traced to failure of the main transmission.&lt;ref name=Fails&gt;{{cite book|last=Fails|first=William|title=Marines and Helicopters 1962-1973|publisher=History and Museums Division United States Marine Corps|year=1978|url=https://www.marines.mil/Portals/1/Publications/Marines%20and%20Helicopters%201962-1973%20%20PCN%2019000307400_2.pdf|isbn=978-1482313598}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|121-2}}

On 31 August 1967, a CH-46A on a medical evacuation mission to {{USS|Tripoli|LPH-10|6}} disintegrated in midair killing all its occupants. The following day another CH-46A experienced a similar incident at [[Marble Mountain Air Facility]] leading to the type being grounded for all except emergency situations and cutting Marine airlift capacity in half.&lt;ref name=Telfer&gt;{{cite book|last=Telfer|first=Gary I.|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: Fighting the North Vietnamese 1967|publisher=History and Museums Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps|year=1984|url=https://archive.org/details/FightingTheNorthVietnamese|isbn=978-1482538878}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|170}} An investigation conducted by a joint Naval Air Systems Command/Boeing Vertol accident investigation team revealed that structural failures were occurring in the area of the rear pylon resulting in the rear rotor tearing off in flight and may have been the cause of several earlier losses. The team recommended structural and systems modifications to reinforce the rear rotor mount as well as installation of an indicator to detect excessive strain on critical parts of the aircraft. 80 CH-46As were shipped to [[Marine Corps Air Station Futenma]], [[Okinawa]] where they received the necessary modifications by a combined force of Marine and Boeing Vertol personnel. The modified CH-46As began returning to service in December 1967 and all had been returned to service by February 1968.&lt;ref name=Telfer/&gt;{{rp|210–1}}&lt;ref name=Fails/&gt;{{rp|123}}

During the 1972 [[Easter Offensive]], Sea Knights saw heavy use to convey US and [[South Vietnam]]ese ground forces to and around the front lines.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Molly.

====Post Vietnam====
In February 1968 the [[United States Marine Corps Training and Education Command|Marine Corps Development and Education Command]] obtained several CH-46s to perform herbicide dissemination tests using HIDAL (Helicopter, Insecticide Dispersal Apparatus, Liquid) systems; testing indicated the need for redesign and further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Darrow | first=Robert A. | title=Historical, Logistical, Political and Technical Aspects of the Herbicide/Defoliant Program, 1967–1971 | publisher=Plant Sciences Laboratories, US Army Chemical Corps | location=Fort Detrick, Frederick MD | date=September 1971 | page=30 }} A Resume of the Activities of the Subcommittee on Defoliation/Anticrop Systems (Vegetation Control Subcommittee) for the Joint Technical Coordinating Group/Chemical-Biological.&lt;/ref&gt; Tandem-rotor helicopters were often used to transport nuclear warheads; the CH-46A was evaluated to deploy Naval [[Special Forces]] with the [[Special Atomic Demolition Munition]] (SADM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osti.gov/opennet/forms.jsp?formurl=films/data/0800031.html |title=0800031 Special Atomic Demolition Munition (SADM) Delivery by Parachutist/Swimmer/ Declassified U.S. Nuclear Test Film #31|website=osti.gov |publisher=Department of Energy |accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear Weapon Accident Exercise 1983 (NUWAX-83), simulating the crash of a Navy CH-46E carrying 3 nuclear warheads, was conducted at the [[Nevada Test Site]] on behalf of several federal agencies; the exercise, which used real radiological agents, was depicted in a [[Defense Nuclear Agency]]-produced documentary.&lt;ref name=&quot;DTIC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=NUCLEAR WEAPON ACCIDENT EXERCISE AFTER ACTION REPORT VOLUME I -EXECUTIVE QUICK LOOK |date=17 October 1983 |publisher=JOINT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE/DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY/FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY |location=KirtlandAir Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a136977.pdf |accessdate=6 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Marine CH-46s were used to deploy the [[8th Marine Regiment]] into [[Grenada]] during [[Operation Urgent Fury]], evacuated the surviving crewmember of a downed AH-1 Cobra, and then carried infantry from the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] to secure and evacuate U.S. students at the Grand Anse campus of [[St. George's University]], though one crashed after colliding with a palm tree.

CH-46E Sea Knights were also used by the U.S. Marine Corps during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. In one incident on 1 April 2003, Marine CH-46Es and CH-53Es carried U.S. Army Rangers and Special Operations troops on an extraction mission for captured Army Private [[Jessica Lynch]] from an Iraqi hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Stout, Jay A.

===Canada===
The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] procured six CH-113 Labrador helicopters for the SAR role and the [[Canadian Army]] acquired 12 of the similar ''CH-113A Voyageur'' for the medium-lift transport role. The RCAF Labradors were delivered first with the first one entering service on 11 October 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milberry&quot;&gt;Milberry, Larry: ''Sixty Years – The RCAF and Air Command 1924–1984'', p. 472.

The refurbished Voyageurs were re-designated as CH-113A Labradors, thus a total of 15 Labradors were ultimately in service.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAM&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Labrador helicopter landing Bell Island.jpg|thumb|upright|left|CH-113 Labrador landing on &quot;The Clapper&quot;, a [[sea stack]] off the tip of [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]] in Newfoundland]]
The Labrador was fitted with a watertight hull for marine landings, a 5,000 kilogram cargo hook and an external rescue hoist mounted over the right front door. It featured a 1,110 kilometer flying range, emergency medical equipment and an 18-person passenger capacity. By the 1990s, heavy use and hostile weather conditions had taken their toll on the Labrador fleet, resulting in increasing maintenance costs and the need for prompt replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAM&quot; /&gt; In 1981, a mid-life upgrade of the fleet was carried out by [[Boeing Canada]] in [[Arnprior, Ontario]]. Known as the SAR-CUP (Search and Rescue Capability Upgrade Program), the refit scheme included new instrumentation, a nose-mounted weather radar, a tail-mounted auxiliary power unit, a new high-speed rescue hoist mounted over the side door and front-mounted searchlights. A total of six CH-113s and five CH-113As were upgraded with the last delivered in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAM&quot; /&gt;

In 1992, it was announced that the Labradors were to be replaced by 15 new helicopters, a variant of the [[AgustaWestland EH101]], designated ''CH-149 Chimo''. The order was subsequently cancelled by the [[Jean Chrétien]] [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government in 1993, resulting in cancellation penalties, as well as extending the service life of the Labrador fleet. However, in 1998, a CH-113 from [[CFB Greenwood]] crashed on Quebec's [[Gaspé Peninsula]] while returning from a SAR mission, resulting in the deaths of all crewmembers on board. The crash placed pressure upon the government to procure a replacement, thus an order was placed with the manufacturers of the EH101 for 15 aircraft to perform the search-and-rescue mission, designated ''[[CH-149 Cormorant]]''. CH-149 deliveries began in 2003, allowing the last CH-113 to be retired in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAM&quot; /&gt; In October 2005 [[Columbia Helicopters]] of [[Aurora, Oregon]] purchased eight of the retired CH-113 Labradors to add to their fleet of 15 Vertol 107-II helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&amp;ID=c186be12-8152-418b-9b56-ec198753da2e|title=Columbia Helicopters Acquires eight CH-113 Labrador helicopters from Canadian military|publisher=RotorHub.com|work=RotorHub|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222234834/http://www.shephard.co.uk/Rotorhub/default.aspx?Action=745115149&amp;ID=c186be12-8152-418b-9b56-ec198753da2e |archivedate=22 December 2007|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
In 1963, Sweden procured ten UH-46Bs from the US as a transport and anti-submarine helicopter for the Swedish armed forces, designated Hkp 4A. In 1973, a further eight Kawasaki-built KV-107s, which were accordingly designated Hkp 4B, were acquired to replace the older [[Piasecki H-21]]. During the Cold War, the fleet's primary missions were anti-submarine warfare and troop transportation, they were also frequently employed in the search and rescue role. In the 1980s, the Hkp 4A was phased out, having been replaced by the [[Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma]]; the later Kawasaki-built Sea Knights continued in operational service until 2011, they were replaced by the [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] &amp; [[NH90]].
