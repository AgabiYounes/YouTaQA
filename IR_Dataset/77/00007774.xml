The '''Chief of Naval Operations''' ('''CNO''') is the head of the [[United States Navy]].  The position is a statutory office ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|5033}}) held by a [[Admiral (United States)|four-star admiral]] who is a military adviser and deputy to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. In a separate capacity as a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|151}}) the CNO is a military adviser to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[President of the United States|President]]. The current Chief of Naval Operations is [[Michael M. Gilday| Admiral Michael M. Gilday]]. 

Despite the title, the CNO does not have operational command authority over Naval forces. The CNO is an administrative position based in [[the Pentagon]], and exercises supervision of Navy organizations as the designee of the Secretary of the Navy. Operational command of naval forces falls within the purview of the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commanders]] who report to the Secretary of Defense.

==Responsibilities==
The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is typically the highest-ranking officer on [[active duty]] in the U.S. Navy unless the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman]] and/or the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] are naval officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;

As per {{UnitedStatesCode|10|5035}}, whenever there is a vacancy for the Chief of Naval Operations or during the absence or disability of the Chief of Naval Operations, and unless the President directs otherwise, the [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]] performs the duties of the Chief of Naval Operations until a successor is appointed or the absence or disability ceases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 USC 5035. Vice Chief of Naval Operations |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5035 |accessdate= August 25, 2018 |website=[[Legal Information Institute]] |publisher=Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of the Navy===
The CNO also performs all other functions prescribed under {{UnitedStatesCode|10|5033}}, such as presiding over the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV), exercising supervision of [[Structure of the United States Navy|Navy organizations]], and other duties assigned by the Secretary or higher lawful authority, or the CNO delegates those duties and responsibilities to other officers in OPNAV or in organizations below.&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher= United States Navy |title= Chief of Naval Operations |url= http://www.navy.mil/navydata/leadership/cno_resp.asp |accessdate= 31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;authority&quot;/&gt;

Acting for the Secretary of the Navy, the CNO also designates naval personnel and naval forces available to the commanders of [[Unified Combatant Command]]s, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;authority&quot;&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5013-#f 10 USC 5013(f). Secretary of the Navy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/165- 10 USC 165. Combatant commands: administration and support]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint Chiefs of Staff===
The CNO is a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] as prescribed by {{UnitedStatesCode|10|151}} and {{UnitedStatesCode|10|5033}}. Like the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the CNO is an administrative position, with no operational command authority over the United States Navy forces.

Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, individually or collectively, in their capacity as military advisers, shall provide advice to the President, the [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] (NSC), or the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) on a particular matter when the President, the NSC, or SECDEF requests such advice. Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (other than the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]) may submit to the Chairman advice or an opinion in disagreement with, or advice or an opinion in addition to, the advice presented by the Chairman to the President, NSC, or SECDEF.

When performing his JCS duties, the CNO is responsible directly to the SECDEF, but keeps SECNAV fully informed of significant military operations affecting the duties and responsibilities of the SECNAV, unless SECDEF orders otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 USC 5033. Chief of Naval Operations |url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5033 |accessdate= August 25, 2018 |website=[[Legal Information Institute]] |publisher=Cornell University Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointment==
The Chief of Naval Operations is nominated by the President for appointment and must be confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=10 USC 5033. Chief of Naval Operations|url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/5033-|accessdate=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement for being Chief of Naval Operations is having significant experience in joint duty assignments, which includes at least one full tour of duty in a joint duty assignment as a flag officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNO&quot;/&gt; However, the president may waive those requirements if he determines that appointing the officer is necessary for the national interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNO&quot;/&gt; By statute, the CNO is appointed as a four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNO&quot;/&gt;

==Official Residence==
[[Number One Observatory Circle]], located on the northeast grounds of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] in Washington, DC, was built in 1893 for its superintendent. The Chief of Naval Operations liked the house so much that in 1923 he took over the house as his own [[official residence]]. It remained the residence of the CNO until 1974, when [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized its transformation to an official residence for the  [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/vp_residence/ |title=The Vice President's Residence | publisher=The White House | url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021225638/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/vp_residence/ |archivedate=21 October 2009 |df=dmy-all | accessdate=31 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Chief of Naval Operations currently resides in [[Officers Quarters, Washington Navy Yard#Quarters A|Quarters A]] in the [[Washington Naval Yard]].
