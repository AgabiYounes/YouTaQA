The '''California Department of Transportation''' ('''Caltrans''') is an [[Executive (government)|executive]] department of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. The department is part of the [[Government of California#State agencies|cabinet]]-level [[California State Transportation Agency]] (CalSTA). Caltrans is headquartered in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.dot.ca.gov/mail.htm Caltrans Mail Addresses].&quot; California Department of Transportation. Retrieved on November 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caltrans manages the state's [[State highways in California|highway system]], which includes the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]], and is involved with [[public transport]]ation systems throughout the state. It supports [[Amtrak California]] and Amtrak's [[Capitol Corridor]]. 

In 2015, Caltrans released a new mission statement: &quot;Provide a safe, sustainable, integrated and efficient transportation system to enhance California’s economy and livability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dot.ca.gov/mission.html|title=Caltrans Mission, Vision, Goals &amp; Values|publisher=Caltrans|access-date=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Cal Trans District7 HD.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Caltrans District 7 Headquarters]] in [[Los Angeles]], designed by [[Thom Mayne]].]]

[[File:CalTrans headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Caltrans headquarters in [[Sacramento]]]]
The earliest predecessor of Caltrans was the Bureau of Highways, which was created by the [[California State Legislature|California Legislature]] and signed into law by Governor [[James Budd]] in 1895.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 11&lt;/ref&gt; This agency consisted of three commissioners who were charged with analyzing the state road system and making recommendations. At the time, there was no state highway system, since roads were purely a local responsibility. California's roads consisted of crude dirt roads maintained by county governments, as well as some paved roads within city boundaries, and this [[wikt:ad hoc|ad hoc]] system was no longer adequate for the needs of the state's rapidly growing population. After the commissioners submitted their report to the governor on November 25, 1896, the legislature replaced the Bureau with the Department of Highways.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the state's weak fiscal condition and corrupt politics, little progress was made until 1907, when the legislature replaced the Department of Highways with the Department of Engineering, within which there was a Division of Highways.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11/&gt; California voters approved an $18 million bond issue for the construction of a state highway system in 1910, and the first [[California Highway Commission]] was convened in 1911.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11/&gt;  On August 7, 1912, the department broke ground on its first construction project, the section of [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] between [[South San Francisco, California|South San Francisco]] and [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]], which later became part of [[California State Route 82]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The year 1912 also saw the founding of the Transportation Laboratory and the creation of seven administrative divisions, which are the predecessors of the 12 district offices in use {{Asof|2018|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11/&gt; The original seven division headquarters were located in:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellis |first=W.R. |year=1913 |title=Division Engineers – Office Addresses |journal=California Highway Bulletin |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=2&amp;3 |publisher=California Highway Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, the [[California State Legislature]] began requiring vehicle registration and allocated the resulting funds to support regular highway maintenance.&lt;ref name=ForsythHagwood11/&gt;

In 1921, the state legislature turned the Department of Engineering into the Department of Public Works.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Caltrans and its predecessor agencies during the 20th century was marked by many firsts. It was one of the first agencies in the United States to paint [[June McCarroll|centerlines on highways]] statewide; the first to build a [[Arroyo Seco Parkway|freeway west of the Mississippi River]]; the first to build a [[Four Level Interchange|four-level stack interchange]]; the first to develop and deploy non-reflective raised pavement markers, better known as [[Botts' dots]]; and one of the first to implement dedicated freeway-to-freeway connector ramps for [[high-occupancy vehicle lane]]s.

In late 1972, the legislature approved a reorganization, suggested by a study initiated by then-Governor [[Ronald Reagan]], in which the Department of Public Works was merged with the Department of Aeronautics to become the modern California Department of Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Forsyth and Joseph Hagwood, ''One Hundred Years of Progress'' (Sacramento: California Transportation Foundation, 1996): 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
For administrative purposes, Caltrans divides the State of California into 12 districts, supervised by district offices. Most districts cover multiple [[County (United States)|counties]]; District 12 ([[Orange County, California|Orange County]]) is the only district with one county. The largest districts by population are District 4 ([[San Francisco Bay Area]]) and District 7 ([[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] counties). Like most state agencies, Caltrans maintains its headquarters in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], which is covered by District 3.
