==Legacy==
Krulak famously referred to the &quot;Strategic Corporal&quot; and the [[Three Block War]] as two of the key lessons identified from the deployments in [[Somalia]], [[Haiti]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. These concepts are still considered vital in understanding the increasing complexity of modern [[battle]]fields.

Krulak explained some of his warfighting philosophy in an interview with [[Tom Clancy]] in Clancy's nonfiction book ''[[Marine (book)|Marine]]''. Clancy referred to Krulak as &quot;Warrior Prince of the Corps.&quot; Krulak also rewrote the Marine Corps' basic combat study text, ''[[MCDP 1: Warfighting]]'', incorporating his theories on operations in the modern battlefield.

==Family==
Krulak is married to Zandi Meyers from Annapolis. They have two sons: CAPT.  David C. Krulak, the current Commanding Officer for Naval Hospital Okinawa, Japan&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dvidshub.net/image/1535107/krulak-gets-promoted-captain&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Todd C. Krulak, PhD., a retired freelance rave DJ who is now a professor at Samford University; and five grandchildren: 2ndLT Brian Krulak, Katie, Mary, Matthew and Charles.
He is the son of Lieutenant General [[Victor H. Krulak]], Sr., and the younger brother of Commander Victor H. Krulak Jr, [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|Navy Chaplain Corps]] and Colonel William Krulak, United States Marine Corps Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;Coram, Robert (2010). Brute: The Life of Victor Krulak, U.S. Marine. Little, Brown &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Krulak's [[Godparent|godfather]] was [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[General officer|general]] [[Holland Smith|Holland McTyeire &quot;Howlin' Mad&quot; Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;https://apnews.com/f3c6e24700c44d5880e107f065a00ade&lt;/ref&gt;
