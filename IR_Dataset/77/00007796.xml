[[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] '''Sir Claude John Eyre Auchinleck''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100|sep=,|GCB|GCIE|CSI|DSO|OBE}} (21 June 1884 – 23 March 1981) was a [[British Army]] commander during the Second World War. He was a career soldier who spent much of his military career in [[India]], where he rose to become Commander-in-Chief of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] by early 1941. In July 1941 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre, but after initial successes, the war in North Africa turned against the British, and he was relieved of the post in 1942 during the crucial Alamein campaign.

In June 1943, he was once again appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], where his support through the organisation of supply, maintenance and training for [[William Slim]]'s Fourteenth Army played an important role in its success. He served as Commander-in-Chief, India until the [[Partition of India|Partition]] in 1947, when he assumed the role of Supreme Commander of all British forces in India and Pakistan until late 1948.

==Early life and career==
Born at 89 Victoria Road in [[Aldershot]], the son of Colonel John Claud Alexander Auchinleck and Mary Eleanor (Eyre) Auchinleck, Auchinleck attended [[Eagle House School]] at [[Crowthorne]] and then [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]] on scholarships.&lt;ref name=heath29&gt;Heathcote, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; After attending the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], Auchinleck was commissioned as an unattached second lieutenant in the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] on 21 January 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=27517| date=20 January 1903|page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined to the [[62nd Punjabis]] in April 1904.&lt;ref name=heath29/&gt; He soon learnt several Indian languages&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1981), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and, able to speak fluently with his soldiers, he absorbed a knowledge of local dialects and customs: this familiarity engendered a lasting mutual respect, enhanced by his own personality.&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1991), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] on 21 April 1905&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=28376| date=24 May 1910|page=3640}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then spent the next two years in [[Tibet]] and [[Sikkim]] before moving to [[Varanasi|Benares]] in 1907 where he caught [[diphtheria]].&lt;ref name=heath29/&gt; After briefly serving with the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]] at Aldershot he returned to Benares in 1909 and became adjutant of the 62nd Punjabis with promotion to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] on 21 January 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=28590| date=15 March 1912|page=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auchinleck was an active [[freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://blackpool.westlancsfreemasons.org.uk/about-freemasonry/famous-masons/|title=Famous Freemasons|date= 10 December 2015|work= Blackpool Group of Lodges and Chapters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auchinleck saw active service in the [[First World War]] and was deployed with his regiment to defend the [[Suez Canal]]: in February 1915 he was in action against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] at [[Ismaïlia]].&lt;ref name=heath29/&gt; His regiment moved into [[Aden]] to counter the Turkish threat there in July 1915.&lt;ref name=heath29/&gt; The [[Indian 6th Infantry Division|6th Indian Division]], of which the 62nd Punjabis were a part, was landed at [[Basra]] on 31 December 1915 for the [[Mesopotamian campaign]].&lt;ref name=heath29/&gt; In July 1916 Auchinleck was promoted acting [[major]] and made second in command of his battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=30138|page=6058| date=19 June 1917| Supp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took part in a series of fruitless attacks on the Turks at the [[Battle of Hanna]] in January 1916 and was one of the few British officers in his regiment to survive these actions.&lt;ref name=heath29/&gt; He became acting commanding officer of his battalion in February 1917 and led his regiment at the [[Second Battle of Kut]] in February 1917 and the [[Fall of Baghdad (1917)|Fall of Baghdad]] in March 1917.&lt;ref name=heath29/&gt; Having been [[mentioned in despatches]] and having received the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1917 for his service in Mesopotamia,&lt;ref name=heath30&gt;Heathcote, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; he was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 21 January 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=31123| date=14 January 1919|page=719}}&lt;/ref&gt; to temporary lieutenant-colonel on 23 May 1919&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=32084|page=9968 |date= 14 October 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[lieutenant-colonel]] on 15 November 1919 for his &quot;distinguished service in Southern and Central Kurdistan&quot; on the recommendation of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=31777| date=10 February 1920|page=1802| supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the world wars==
Auchinleck attended the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College, Quetta]] between 1920 and 1921.&lt;ref name=heath30/&gt; He married Jessie Stewart in 1921. Jessie had been born in 1900 in [[Tacoma, Washington]], to Alexander Stewart, head of the [[Blue Funnel Line]] that plied the west coast of the United States. When he died about 1919, their mother took her, her twin brother Alan and her younger brother Hepburne back to Bun Rannoch, the family estate at Innerhadden in [[Perthshire]]. Holidaying at [[Grasse]] on the [[French Riviera]], Auchinleck, who was on leave from India at the time, met Jessie on the tennis courts. She was a high-spirited, blue-eyed beauty. Things moved quickly, and they were married within five months. Sixteen years younger than Auchinleck, Jessie became known as 'the little American girl' in India, but adapted readily to life there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|title=Claude Auchinleck| date=8 July 1941| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=By J.

Auchinleck became temporary Deputy Assistant Quartermaster-General at [[India Command|Army Headquarters]] in February 1923 and then second-in-command of his regiment, which in the 1923 reorganisation of the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] had become the 1st battalion, [[1st Punjab Regiment]], in September 1925.&lt;ref name=heath30/&gt; He attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in 1927 and, having been promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 21 January 1929&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33475| date=8 March 1929|page=1678}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed to command his regiment.&lt;ref name=heath30/&gt; Promoted to full [[colonel]] on 1 February 1930 with seniority from 15 November 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33600| date=25 April 1930|page=2596}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became an instructor at the Staff College, Quetta in February 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33604| date=9 May 1930|page=2870}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he remained until April 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33952| date=23 June 1933|page=4206}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary [[brigadier]] on 1 July 1933&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=33976| date=8 September 1933|page=5864}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given command of the [[Peshawar Brigade]], which was active in the pacification of the adjacent tribal areas during the Mohmand and Bajaur Operations between July and October 1933: during his period of command he was [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MID1934&quot;/&gt; He led a second punitive expedition during the [[Second Mohmand Campaign]] in August 1935 for which he was again mentioned in despatches, promoted to [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|major-general]] on 30 November 1935&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34239| date=3 January 1936|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Star of India]] on 8 May 1936.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSI&quot;/&gt;

On leaving his brigade command in April 1936, Auchinleck was on the unemployed list (on half pay)&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34275| date=17 April 1936|page=2490}}&lt;/ref&gt; until September 1936 when he was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff and Director of Staff Duties in [[Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34338| date=6 November 1936|page=7127}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then appointed to command the Meerut District in India in July 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34536| date=29 July 1938|page=4884}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 Auchinleck was appointed to chair a committee to consider the modernisation, composition and re-equipment of the [[British Indian Army]]: the committee's recommendations formed the basis of the 1939 [[Ernle Chatfield, 1st Baron Chatfield|Chatfield Report]] which outlined the transformation of the Indian Army – it grew from 183,000 in 1939 to over 2,250,000 men by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==

===Norway 1940===
On the outbreak of war Auchinleck was appointed to command the [[Chindits|Indian 3rd Infantry Division]] but in January 1940 was summoned to the United Kingdom to command [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]], the only time in the war that a wholly British corps was commanded by an Indian Army officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead52&quot;&gt;Mead, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; He received promotion to acting [[Lieutenant General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] on 1 February 1940&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34811| date=15 March 1940|page=1531| supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the substantive rank of Lieutenant-General on 16 March 1940.&lt;ref name=heath31&gt;Heathcote, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1940 Auchinleck took over command of the Anglo-French ground forces in [[Norway]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead52&quot;/&gt; a military operation that was doomed to fail.&lt;ref name=heath31/&gt; After the fall of Norway, in June 1940 he briefly commanded [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] before becoming General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] in July 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=34902| date=19 July 1940|page=4493| supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he had an uneasy relationship with his subordinate [[Bernard Montgomery]], the new V Corps commander.&lt;ref name=heath31/&gt; Montgomery later wrote: &quot;In the 5th Corps I first served under Auchinleck... I cannot recall that we ever agreed on anything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

===India and Iraq January–May 1941===
Promoted to full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] on 26 December 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35023| date=27 December 1940|page=7251|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auchinleck was recalled to India in January 1941 to become [[Commander-in-Chief, India]] in which position he also was appointed to the Executive Council of the [[Governor-General of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35037| date=7 January 1941|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed [[Aide-de-Camp General|ADC General to the King]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35183| date=6 June 1941|page=3243}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ceremonial position he held until after the end of the War.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37875| date=7 February 1947|page=662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1941, [[RAF Habbaniya]] was threatened by the new pro-Axis regime of [[Rashid Ali]]. This large Royal Air Force station was west of Baghdad in [[Iraq]] and General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]], was reluctant to intervene, despite the urgings of [[Winston Churchill]], because of his pressing commitments in the Western Desert and Greece. Auchinleck, however, acted decisively, sending a battalion of the [[King's Own Royal Regiment]] by air to Habbaniya and shipping the [[Indian 10th Infantry Division]] by sea to [[Basra]]. Wavell was prevailed upon by London to send ''[[Habforce]]'', a relief column, from the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] but by the time it arrived in Habbaniya on 18 May the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] was virtually over.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead53&quot;&gt;Mead, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Africa July 1941 – August 1942===
[[File:Auchinleck (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|upright|Claude Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East.]]
Following the see-saw of Allied and Axis successes and reverses in North Africa, Auchinleck was appointed to succeed General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Sir Archibald Wavell]] as Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]] in July 1941;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=35218| date=11 July 1941|page=4048| supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wavell took up Auchinleck's post as Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, swapping jobs with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35247|date=15 August 1941|page=4740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The British Army in the Middle East 1941 E5450.jpg|thumb|upright|left|General Sir Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief India and General Sir Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief Middle East, 8 September 1941.]]

As Commander-in-Chief Middle East Auchinleck, based in [[Cairo]], held responsibility not just for North Africa but also for [[Iran|Persia]] and the Middle East. He launched an offensive in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]], [[Operation Crusader]], in November 1941: despite some tactical reverses during the fighting which resulted in Auchinleck replacing the Eighth Army commander [[Alan Cunningham]] with [[Neil Ritchie]], by the end of December [[70th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|the besieged garrison]] of [[Tobruk]] had been relieved and Rommel obliged to withdraw to El Agheila. Auchinleck appears to have believed that enemy had been defeated, writing on 12 January 1942 that the Axis forces were &quot;beginning to feel the strain&quot; and were &quot;hard pressed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart46&quot;&gt;Stewart, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the Axis forces had managed to withdraw in good order and a few days after Auchinleck's optimistic appreciation, having reorganised and been reinforced, struck at the dispersed and weakened British forces, driving them back to the Gazala positions near [[Tobruk]].&lt;ref name=heath32&gt;Heathcote, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The British Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]], wrote in his diary that it was &quot;nothing less than bad generalship on the part of Auchinleck. He has been overconfident and has believed everything his overoptimistic [DMI] Shearer has told him&quot;. Brooke commented that Auchinleck &quot;could have been one of the finest of commanders&quot; but lacked the ability to select the men to serve him. Brooke sent him one of his best armoured division commanders [[Richard McCreery]], whose advice was ignored in favour of Dorman-Smith's.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB19420130&quot;&gt;Alanbrooke Diaries, 30 January 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Generals 1939-1945 E8454.jpg|thumb|upright|Major-General [[Jock Campbell (British Army officer)|John &quot;Jock&quot; Campbell]] and General Sir Claude Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief Middle East, in the Western Desert.]]

[[Rommel]]'s attack at the [[Battle of Gazala]] of 26 May 1942 resulted in a significant defeat for the British. Auchinleck's appreciation of the situation written to Ritchie on 20 May had suggested that the armoured reserves be concentrated in a position suitable to meet both a flanking attack around the south of the front or a direct attack through the centre (which was the likelihood more favoured by Auchinleck).&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1982), pp.181 &amp; 182&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Ritchie chose a more dispersed and rearward positioning of his two armoured divisions&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1982), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; and when the attack in the centre came, it proved to be a diversion and the main attack, by Rommel's armoured formations, came round the southern flank. Poor initial positioning and subsequent handling and coordination of Allied formations by Ritchie and his corps commanders resulted in their heavy defeat and the Eighth Army retreating into [[Egypt]]; [[Axis capture of Tobruk|Tobruk fell to the Axis]] on 21 June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Playfair, pp. 261–275&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June Auchinleck stepped in to take direct command of the Eighth Army, having lost confidence in [[Neil Ritchie]]'s ability to control and direct his forces. Auchinleck discarded Ritchie's plan to stand at [[Mersa Matruh]], deciding to fight only a delaying action there, while withdrawing to the more easily defendable position at [[El Alamein]]. Here Auchinleck tailored a defence that took advantage of the terrain and the fresh troops at his disposal, stopping the exhausted German/Italian advance in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. Enjoying a considerable superiority of material and men over the weak German/Italian forces, Auchinleck organised a series of counter-attacks. Poorly conceived and badly coordinated, these attacks achieved little.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr83-184&quot;&gt;Barr, pp.83–184&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;The Auk&quot;, as he was known, appointed a number of senior commanders who proved to be unsuitable for their positions, and command arrangements were often characterised by bitter personality clashes. Auchinleck was an Indian Army officer and was criticised for apparently having little direct experience or understanding of British and Dominion troops. His controversial chief of operations, Major-General [[Eric Dorman-Smith|Dorman-Smith]], was regarded with considerable distrust by many of the senior commanders in Eighth Army. By July 1942 Auchinleck had lost the confidence of Dominion commanders and relations with his British commanders had become strained.{{#tag:ref|Alanbrooke in a footnote to his diary entry of 30 January wrote: &quot;Auchinleck, to my mind, had most of the qualifications to make him one of the finest of commanders, but unfortunately he lacked the most important of all – the ability to select the men to serve him. The selection of [[Thomas Corbett (Indian Army officer)|Corbett]] as his Chief of Staff, [[Eric Dorman-Smith|Dorman-Smith]] as his chief advisor, and (Eric) Shearer as his head of intelligence service contributed most of all to his downfall&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AB19420130&quot;/&gt;|group=note}}

Like his foe Rommel (and his predecessor Wavell and successor Montgomery), Auchinleck was subjected to constant political interference, having to weather a barrage of hectoring telegrams and instructions from Prime Minister Churchill throughout late 1941 and the spring and summer of 1942. Churchill constantly sought an offensive from Auchinleck, and was downcast at the military reverses in Egypt and Cyrenaica. Churchill was desperate for some sort of British victory before the planned Allied landings in North Africa, [[Operation Torch]], scheduled for November 1942. He badgered Auchinleck immediately after the Eighth Army had all but exhausted itself after the first battle of El Alamein. Churchill and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, [[Alan Brooke]], flew to Cairo in early August 1942, to meet Auchinleck, where it emerged he had lost the confidence of both men.&lt;ref&gt;Alanbrooke (2001), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]] by General [[Harold Alexander|Sir Harold Alexander]] (later Field Marshal Earl Alexander of Tunis).&lt;ref name=heath33&gt;Heathcote, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph M. Horodyski and Maurice Remy both praise Auchinleck as an underrated military leader who contributed the most to the successful defence of El Alamein and consequently the final defeat of Rommel in Africa. The two historians also criticize Churchill for the unreasonable decision to put the blame on Auchinleck and to relieve him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horodyski|first1=Joseph M.|title=Sir Claude Auchinleck: Overshadowed Equal to Erwin Rommel|date=23 September 2016|publisher=2016 Sovereign Media|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/sir-claude-auchinleck-overshadowed-equal-to-erwin-rommel/|accessdate=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=107}}

===India 1942–1945===
[[File:AuchinleckNepal.jpg|thumb|Auchinleck receiving the [[Star of Nepal]] in October 1945 from the King of Nepal, Tribhubana Bir Vikram Sah]]Churchill offered Auchinleck command of the newly created [[Persia and Iraq Command]] (this having been separated from Alexander's command), but Auchinleck declined this post, as he believed that separating the area from the Middle East Command was not good policy and the new arrangements would not be workable. He set his reasons out in his letter to the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] dated 14 August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=38177| date=15 January 1948|pages=398–400|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he returned to India, where he spent almost a year &quot;unemployed&quot; before in June 1943 being again appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=36133 |date=13 August 1943 |page=3653}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Wavell meanwhile having been appointed [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]]: on this appointment it was announced that responsibility for the prosecution of the war with Japan would move from the Commander-in-Chief India to a newly created South East Asia Command. However, the appointment of the new command's Supreme Commander, Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], was not announced until August 1943 and until Mountbatten could set up his headquarters and assume control (in November) Auchinleck retained responsibility for operations in India and Burma while conducting a review and revision of Allied plans based on the decisions taken by the Allied Combined Chiefs of Staff at the [[Quadrant Conference]] which ended in August.&lt;ref&gt;Woodburn Kirby, pp. 4–11&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Mountbatten's arrival, Auchinleck's India Command (which had equal status with South East Asia Command in the military hierarchy) was responsible for the internal security of India, the defence of the [[Military history of the North-West Frontier|North West Frontier]] and the buildup of India as a base, including most importantly the reorganisation of the Indian Army, the training of forces destined for SEAC and the lines of communication carrying men and material to the forward areas and to China. Auchinleck made the supply of Fourteenth Army, with probably the worst lines of communication of the war, his immediate priority;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead57&quot;&gt;Mead, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; as [[William Slim]], commander of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] was later to write:{{blockquote|It was a good day for us when he [Auchinleck] took command of India, our main base, recruiting area and training ground. The Fourteenth Army, from its birth to its final victory, owed much to his unselfish support and never-failing understanding. Without him and what he and the Army of India did for us we could not have existed, let alone conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Slim, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Divorce===
Auchinleck suffered a personal disappointment when his wife Jessie left him for his friend Air Chief Marshal [[Richard Peirse|Sir Richard Peirse]]. Peirse and Auchinleck had been students together at the Imperial Defence College, but that was long before. Peirse was now Allied Air Commander-in-Chief, South-East Asia, and also based in India. The affair became known to Mountbatten in early 1944, and he passed the information to the Chief of the RAF, [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Sir Charles Portal]], hoping that Peirse would be recalled. The affair was common knowledge by September 1944, and Peirse was neglecting his duties. Mountbatten sent Peirse and Lady Auchinleck back to England on 28 November 1944,&lt;ref&gt;Bond, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; where they lived together at a Brighton hotel. Peirse had his marriage dissolved, and Auchinleck obtained a divorce in 1946.&lt;ref name=heath34&gt;Heathcote, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Auchinleck was reportedly very badly affected. According to his sister, he was never the same after the break-up.&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1982), p.264&lt;/ref&gt; He always carried a photograph of Jessie in his wallet even after the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1982), p.264.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is scholarly dispute whether Auchinleck was homosexual. His biographer, Philip Warner, addressed the rumours but dismissed them;{{sfn|Warner|1982|p=262}} however historian Ronald Hyam has alleged that &quot;sexually based moral-revulsion&quot; was the reason for Montgomery's inability to get on with Auchinleck, and further, that Auchinleck was &quot;let off with a high-level warning&quot; over his relationships with Indian boys.&lt;ref&gt;Hyam, Ronald ''Empire and Sexuality: The British Experience'', Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7190-2505-1}} 1990, pp. 14,p32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partition of India and later years==
[[File:Claude Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Claude Auchinleck as the last Commander in Chief of British India]]
Auchinleck continued as Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army after the end of the war&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37586| date=28 May 1946|page=2617| supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping, though much against his own convictions, to prepare the future Indian and Pakistani armies for the [[Partition of India]]: in November 1945 he was forced to commute the more serious judicial sentences awarded against officers of the [[Indian National Army]] in face of growing unease and unrest both within the Indian population, and the [[British Indian Army]].&lt;ref name=heath33/&gt; On 1 June 1946 he was promoted to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette| issue=37586| date=31 May 1946|page=2617|supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he refused to accept a peerage, lest he be thought associated with a policy (i.e. Partition) that he thought fundamentally dishonourable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mead57&quot;/&gt;

Sending a report to British Government on 28 September 1947 Auchinleck wrote: &quot;I have no hesitation, whatever, in affirming that the present Indian Cabinet are implacably determined to do all in their power to prevent the establishment of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] on firm basis.&quot; He stated in the second, political part of his assessment, &quot;Since 15th August, the situation has steadily deteriorated and the Indian leaders, cabinet ministers, civil officials and others have persistently tried to obstruct the work of partition of the armed forces.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bajwa, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nawaz, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

When partition was effected in August 1947, Auchinleck was appointed Supreme Commander of all British forces remaining in India and Pakistan&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1982), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in this role until the winding up and closure of the Supreme H.Q. at the end of November 1948. This marked his effective retirement from the army (although technically field marshals in the British Army never retire, remaining on the active list on half pay{{sfn|Warner|1982|p=301}}). He left India on 1 December.&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1982), p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

After a brief period in Italy in connection with an unsuccessful business project, Auchinleck retired to London, where he occupied himself with a number of charitable and business interests and became a respectably skilled watercolour painter.&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1982), p. 291-294&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960 he settled in [[Beccles]] in the county of Suffolk, remaining there for seven years until, at the age of eighty-four, he decided to emigrate and set up home in [[Marrakesh]],&lt;ref&gt;Warner (1982), p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; where he died on 23 March 1981.&lt;ref name=heath35&gt;Heathcote, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
Auchinleck was buried in [[Ben M'Sik European Cemetery]], [[Casablanca]], in the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] plot in the cemetery, next to the grave of [[Raymond Steed]] who was the second youngest non-civilian Commonwealth casualty of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/2022403 |title=Cemetery details—Ben M'Sik European Cemetery|publisher= Commonwealth War Graves Commission|accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorial plaque was erected in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The tour guides relate how in 1979, as plaques for the other great Second World War military leaders were being installed, no one in the establishment had been in contact with his family for some years. Cathedral officials telephoned to enquire the date of his death only to be told &quot;Auchinleck here – but I won't be keeping you much longer!&quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Source of quote, Richard Palmer of St Paul's cathedral.&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze statue of Auchinleck can be seen on Broad Street adjacent to Auchinleck House, Five Ways, Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/auchinleck-statue-prime-position-birmingham-3913372|title=Auchinleck statue to get prime position in Birmingham Five Ways shopping centre plan|date=1 March 2012|newspaper=Birmingham Post|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
