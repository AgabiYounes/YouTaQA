==Biography==
Kornbluth was born and grew up in the uptown Manhattan neighborhood of [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]], in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Rich | first = Mark | title = C. M. Kornbluth | publisher = McFarland | year = 2009 | location = Jefferson, NC | pages = 20 | isbn = 978-0-7864-4393-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of Polish Jewish descent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.forward.com/the-arty-semite/125474/cyril-kornbluth-s-postwar-dystopias/|title=Cyril Kornbluth’s Postwar Dystopias|publisher=|accessdate=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of a &quot;second-generation [American] Jew&quot; who ran his own tailor shop. According to his widow, Kornbluth was a &quot;precocious child&quot;, learning to read by the age of three and writing his own stories by the time he was seven. He graduated from high school at thirteen, received a [[CCNY]] scholarship at fourteen, and was &quot;thrown out for leading a student strike&quot; without graduating.&lt;ref name=Platt/&gt;

As a teenager, he became a member of the [[Futurians]], an influential group of [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]] and writers. While a member of the Futurians, he met and became friends with [[Frederik Pohl]], [[Donald A. Wollheim]], [[Robert A. W. Lowndes]], and his future wife Mary Byers. He also participated in the [[Fantasy Amateur Press Association]].

Kornbluth served in the [[United States Army|US Army]] during [[World War II]] ([[European Theatre of World War II|European 'Theatre']]).&lt;ref name=&quot;strangehorizons.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/2005/20050103/kornbluth-a.shtml |title=Obituary at StrangeHorizons.com, 2005 |accessdate=2016-03-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194137/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2005/20050103/kornbluth-a.shtml |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his service in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], where he served as a member of a [[heavy machine gun]] crew. Upon his discharge, he returned to finish his education at the [[University of Chicago]] under the [[G.I. Bill]].&lt;ref name=&quot;strangehorizons.com&quot;/&gt; While living in Chicago he also worked at Trans-Radio Press, a news wire service. In 1951 he started writing full-time,&lt;ref name=Platt&gt;[[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]], &quot;C. M. Kornbluth: A Study Of His Work and Interview With His Widow&quot;, ''[[Foundation (journal)|Foundation]]'' 17, September 1979, pp.57-63&lt;/ref&gt; returning to the East Coast where he collaborated on novels with his old Futurian friends Frederik Pohl and [[Judith Merril]].

==Work==
Kornbluth began writing at 15. His first solo story, &quot;The Rocket of 1955&quot;, was published in [[Richard Wilson (author)|Richard Wilson]]'s [[fanzine]] ''Escape'' (Vol. 1, No 2, August 1939); his first collaboration, &quot;Stepsons of Mars,&quot; written with Richard Wilson and published under the name &quot;Ivar Towers&quot;, appeared in the April 1940 ''[[Astonishing Stories|Astonishing]]''. His other short fiction includes &quot;[[The Little Black Bag]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Marching Morons]]&quot;, &quot;The Altar at Midnight&quot;, &quot;MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie&quot;, &quot;Gomez&quot; and &quot;The Advent on Channel 12&quot;.

&quot;The Little Black Bag&quot; was first adapted for television live on the television show ''Tales of Tomorrow'' on May 30, 1952. It was later adapted for television by the [[BBC]] in 1969 for its ''[[Out of the Unknown]]'' series. In 1970, the same story was adapted by [[Rod Serling]] for an episode of his ''[[Night Gallery]]'' series. This dramatization starred [[Burgess Meredith]] as the alcoholic Dr. William Fall, who had long lost his doctor's license and become a homeless alcoholic. He finds a bag containing advanced medical technology from the future, which, after an unsuccessful attempt to pawn it, he uses benevolently.

&quot;[[The Marching Morons]]&quot; is a look at a far future in which the world's population consists of five billion idiots and a few million geniuses&amp;nbsp;– the precarious minority of the &quot;elite&quot; working desperately to keep things running behind the scenes. In his introduction to ''The Best of C.M. Kornbluth'', Pohl states that &quot;The Marching Morons&quot; is a direct sequel to &quot;The Little Black Bag&quot;: it is easy to miss this, as &quot;Bag&quot; is set in the contemporary present while &quot;Morons&quot; takes place several centuries from now, and there is no character who appears in both stories. The titular black bag in the first story is actually an artifact from the time period of &quot;The Marching Morons&quot;: a medical kit filled with self-driven instruments enabling a far-future moron to &quot;play doctor&quot;. A future Earth similar to &quot;The Marching Morons&quot;&amp;nbsp;– a civilisation of morons protected by a small minority of hidden geniuses&amp;nbsp;– is used again in the final stages of Kornbluth &amp; Pohl's ''Search the Sky''.&lt;ref name= &quot;Best&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Rich |first= Mark |chapter= ''The Best of C. M. Kornbluth'' |title= Classics of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 1: [[Aegypt]]—[[Make Room! Make Room!]] |editor= [[Fiona Kelleghan]] |location= Pasadena, CA |publisher= Salem Press |year= 2002 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/classicsofscienc0000unse/page/45 45–47] |isbn= 1-58765-051-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;MS. Found in a Chinese Fortune Cookie&quot; (1957) is supposedly written by Kornbluth using notes by &quot;Cecil Corwin&quot;, who has been declared insane and incarcerated, and who smuggles out in [[fortune cookie]]s the ultimate secret of life. This fate is said to be Kornbluth's response to the unauthorized publication of &quot;Mask of Demeter&quot; (as by &quot;Corwin&quot; and &quot;Martin Pearson&quot; ([[Donald A. Wollheim]])) in Wollheim's anthology ''Prize Science Fiction'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last = Rich |first = Mark |title = C. M. Kornbluth |publisher = McFarland |year = 2009 |location = Jefferson, NC |pages = 222–223 |quote= According to Kornbluth's friend [[James Blish|Blish]], &quot;The belated appearance of this antique collaboration so upset C.M. Kornbluth...that he wrote a story explaining that the hapless Corwin had been confined in a mental hospital under LSD-25 since around 1950. The story also contains an attack on [[Forrest J Ackerman|the agent]] who sold the collaboration without Kornbluth's permission.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Mark Rich describes the 1958 story &quot;Two Dooms&quot; as one of several stories which are &quot;concern[ed] with the ethics of theoretical science&quot; and which &quot;explore moral quandaries of the atomic age&quot;:

{{bquote|&quot;Two Dooms&quot; follows atomic physicist Edward Royland on his accidental journey into an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universe]] where the Nazis and Japanese rule a divided United States. In his own world, Royland debated whether to delay progress at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos nuclear research site]] or to help the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] achieve its terrifying result. Encountering both a slave village and a [[Internment#Concentration camp|concentration camp]] in the alternative America, he comes to grips with the idea of life under bondage.&lt;ref name= &quot;Best&quot; /&gt;}}

Many of Kornbluth's novels were written as collaborations: either with [[Judith Merril]] (using the pseudonym [[Cyril Judd]]), or with Frederik Pohl. These include  ''[[Gladiator-At-Law]]'' and ''[[The Space Merchants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Coats |first= Daryl R |chapter= ''The Space Merchants'' and ''The Merchants' War'' |title= Classics of Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2: [[The Man in the High Castle]]—[[Zothique]] |editor= [[Fiona Kelleghan]] |location= Pasadena, CA |publisher= Salem Press |year= 2002 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/classicsofscienc0000unse/page/485 485–488] |isbn= 1-58765-052-5 |quote= ''The Space Merchants'' remains the best-known of his satirical works, and its influence can be seen in a number of subsequent works forecasting futures in which a particular group or institution dominates society. }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Space Merchants'' contributed significantly to the maturing and to the wider academic respectability of the science fiction genre, not only in America but also in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: [[Zoran Živković (writer)|Zoran Živković]], ''Contemporaries of the Future&amp;nbsp;– Savremenici budućnosti'', Belgrade, Serbia, 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;250–261.&lt;/ref&gt; Kornbluth also wrote several novels under his own name, including ''[[The Syndic]]'' and ''[[Not This August]]''.

==Death==
Kornbluth died at age 34 in [[Levittown, New York]]. Scheduled to meet with [[Robert P. Mills|Bob Mills]] in New York City to interview for the position of editor of ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Mark, ''C. M. Kornbluth: The Life and Works of a Science Fiction Visionary'' (McFarland &amp; Co., 2010) p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; Kornbluth had to shovel snow from his driveway, which delayed him.  Running to meet his train, he suffered a fatal heart attack on the platform of the station.&lt;ref name=&quot;strangehorizons.com&quot;/&gt;

A number of short stories remained unfinished at Kornbluth's death; these were eventually completed and published by Pohl. One of these stories, &quot;[[The Meeting (short story)|The Meeting]]&quot; (''The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction'', November 1972), was the co-winner of the 1973 [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]]; it tied with [[R. A. Lafferty]]'s &quot;Eurema's Dam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcon.org/hy.html#73 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731112501/http://www.worldcon.org/hy.html |date=July 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of Kornbluth's solo SF stories have been collected as ''His Share of Glory: The Complete Short Science Fiction of C. M. Kornbluth'' ([[NESFA Press]], 1997).

==Personality and habits==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}

Frederik Pohl, in his autobiography ''The Way the Future Was'', [[Damon Knight]], in his memoir ''The Futurians'', and [[Isaac Asimov]], in his memoirs ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'' and ''I. Asimov: A Memoir'', all give descriptions of Kornbluth as a man of odd personal habits and eccentricities.

Kornbluth, for example, decided to educate himself by reading his way through an entire encyclopedia from A to Z; in the course of this effort, he acquired a great deal of esoteric knowledge that found its way into his stories, in alphabetical order by subject. When Kornbluth wrote a story that mentioned the ''[[ballista]]'', an Ancient Roman weapon, Pohl knew that Kornbluth had finished the 'A's and had started on the 'B's.

According to Pohl, Kornbluth never brushed his teeth, and they were literally green. Deeply embarrassed by this, Kornbluth developed the habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth when speaking.

Kornbluth disliked black coffee, but felt obliged to acquire a taste for it because he believed that professional authors were &quot;supposed to&quot; drink black coffee. He trained himself by putting gradually less cream into each cup of coffee he drank, until he eventually &quot;weaned himself&quot; (Knight's description) and switched to black coffee.

[[Spider Robinson]] praised this collection, saying &quot;I haven't enjoyed a book so much in years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Galaxy Bookshelf&quot;, ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', August 1977, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Rich wrote, &quot;Critics judging Kornbluth by this anthology, edited by Pohl, have seen a growing bitterness in his later stories. This reflects editorial choice more than reality, because Kornbluth also wrote delightful humor in his last years, in stories not collected here. These tales demonstrate Kornbluth's effective use of everyday individuals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds as well as his well-tuned ear for dialect.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Best&quot; /&gt;
