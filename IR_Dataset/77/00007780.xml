The '''Costa Smeralda''' ({{IPA-it|ˈkɔsta zmeˈralda|lang}}, {{lit|&quot;Emerald Coast&quot;}}; {{lang-sdn|'''Monti di Mola'''}}; {{lang-sc|'''Montes de Mola'''}}) is a coastal area and tourist destination in northern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]], with a length of some 20&amp;nbsp;km, although the term originally designated only a small stretch in the commune of [[Arzachena]]. With white sand beaches, golf clubs, private jet and helicopter services, and exclusive hotels, the area has drawn celebrities, business leaders, and other affluent visitors.

Costa Smeralda is the most expensive location in Europe. House prices reach up to 300,000 euros ($392,200) per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.engelvoelkers.com/blog/2013/europes-most-expensive-addresses-romazzino-bay-on-sardinia-leads-current-ranking/ |title=Europe’s most expensive addresses: Romazzino Bay on Sardinia |publisher=Engel &amp; Völkers Group|date=September 16, 2013 |access-date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main towns and villages in the area, built according to a detailed [[urban planning|urban plan]], are [[Porto Cervo]], [[Liscia di Vacca]], [[Capriccioli]], and [[Romazzino]]. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] sites include the Li Muri [[Giants' grave]]s.

Each September the Sardinia Cup [[sailing]] [[regatta]] is held off the coast. [[Polo]] matches are held between April and October at Gershan near Arzachena. Other attractions include a film festival in Tavolara and a vintage car rally.

Development of the area started in 1961, and was financed by a consortium of companies led by Prince [[Aga Khan IV|Karim Aga Khan]]. Spiaggia del Principe, one of the beaches along the Costa Smeralda, was named after this [[Isma'ilism|Ishmaelite]] prince.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharmingSardinia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Olbia-Costa%20Smeralda-Badesi.pdf | format=web | title=Guide to Olbia, Costa Smeralda, Badesi | publisher=CharmingSardinia.com | date=January 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711062529/http://www.charmingsardinia.com/booksardegna/SARDINIA-Olbia-Costa%20Smeralda-Badesi.pdf | archivedate=2009-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Architects involved in the project included [[Michele Busiri Vici]], [[Jacques Couëlle]], Savin Couëlle, and Vietti.
