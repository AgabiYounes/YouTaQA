'''Human cannibalism''' is the act or practice of humans eating the flesh or internal organs of other human beings. A person who practices [[cannibalism]] is called a '''cannibal'''. The expression ''cannibalism'' has been extended into [[zoology]] to mean one individual of a species [[cannibalism (zoology)|consuming all or part]] of another individual of the same species as food, including [[sexual cannibalism]].

The [[Island Carib]] people of the [[Lesser Antilles]], from whom the word &quot;cannibalism&quot; is derived, acquired a long-standing reputation as cannibals after their legends were recorded in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief history&quot;/&gt; Some controversy exists over the accuracy of these legends and the prevalence of actual cannibalism in the culture. Cannibalism was practiced in [[New Guinea]] and in parts of the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands]], and flesh markets existed in some parts of [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YM18gG16Z7YC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false From primitive to post-colonial in Melanesia and anthropology]''.

Cannibalism has recently been both practiced and fiercely condemned in several wars, especially in [[Liberia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/110728/ritual-killing-liberia-elections-politics Liberia’s elections, ritual killings and cannibalism] August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2661365.stm|title=UN condemns DR Congo cannibalism|publisher=BBC|date=January 15, 2003|accessdate=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was still practiced in [[Papua New Guinea]] as of 2012, for cultural reasons&lt;ref name=&quot;nzherald.co.nz&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cannibal cult members arrested in PNG|url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10817610|work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |date = 2012-07-05|access-date = 2015-11-28|issn = 1170-0777|language = en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Raffaele |first=Paul |date=September 2006 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/cannibals.html |title=Sleeping with Cannibals |work=Smithsonian Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ritual and in war in various [[Melanesians|Melanesian tribes]].

Salisbury, August 15, 2001, ''Exploration'', Vanderbuilt University.
&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars even argue that no firm evidence exists that cannibalism has ever been a socially acceptable practice anywhere in the world, at any time in history, although this has been consistently debated against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XsHB69txxdEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=arens+cannibalism#v=onepage&amp;q=arens%20cannibalism&amp;f=false|title=The Man-Eating Myth : Anthropology and Anthropophagy: Anthropology and Anthropophagy|last=Arens|first=William|date=1979-04-26|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780199763443|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannibalism has occasionally been practiced as a last resort by people suffering from [[famine]], even in modern times. Famous examples include the ill-fated [[Donner Party]] (1846–47) and, more recently, the crash of [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] (1972), after which some survivors ate the bodies of dead passengers. Additionally, there are cases of people suffering from mental illness engaging in cannibalism for sexual pleasure, such as [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] and [[Albert Fish]]. There is resistance to formally labeling cannibalism a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;straightdope&quot;&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2515/eat-or-be-eaten Eat or be eaten: Is cannibalism a pathology as listed in the DSM-IV?] ''[[The Straight Dope]]'' by Cecil Adams. Retrieved March 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word &quot;cannibalism&quot; is derived from ''Caníbales'', the Spanish name for the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cannibalism?r=66 |title=Cannibalism Definition |dictionary=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[West Indies]] tribe that may have practiced cannibalism,&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica cannibalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/92701/cannibalism |title=cannibalism (human behaviour) |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Spanish ''canibal'' or ''caribal'', &quot;a savage&quot;. It is also called ''anthropophagy''.

==Reasons==
[[File:Cannibalism on Tanna.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|A cannibal feast on [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]], Vanuatu, c. 1885–1889]]
In some societies, especially tribal societies, cannibalism is a [[cultural norm]]. Consumption of a person from within the same community is called [[endocannibalism]]; ritual cannibalism of the recently deceased can be part of the grieving process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woznicki |first=Andrew N. |year=1998 |title=Endocannibalism of the Yanomami |url=http://users.rcn.com/salski/No18-19Folder/Endocannibalism.htm |journal=The Summit Times |volume=6 |issue=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be seen as a way of guiding the souls of the dead into the bodies of living descendants.&lt;ref name=DowEncyc&gt;
{{cite book |last=Dow |first=James W. |editor-last=Tenenbaum |editor-first=Barbara A. |chapter-url=https://files.oakland.edu/users/dow/web/personal/papers/cannibal/cannibal.html |chapter=Cannibalism |title=Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture – Volume 1 |pages=535–537 |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |location=New York |access-date=September 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007090705/https://files.oakland.edu/users/dow/web/personal/papers/cannibal/cannibal.html |archive-date=October 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Exocannibalism]] is the consumption of a person from outside the community, usually as a celebration of victory against a rival tribe.&lt;ref name=DowEncyc/&gt; Both types of cannibalism can also be fueled by the belief that eating a person's flesh or internal organs will endow the cannibal with some of the characteristics of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Goldman |editor-first=Laurence |year=1999 |title=The Anthropology of Cannibalism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyiDClqjwSUC&amp;pg=PA16 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |page=16 |isbn=978-0-89789-596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of the world, cannibalism is not a societal norm, but is sometimes resorted to in situations of extreme necessity. The survivors of the shipwrecks of the ''[[Essex (1799 whaleship)|Essex]]'' and ''[[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Méduse]]'' in the 19th century are said to have engaged in cannibalism, as did the members of [[Franklin's lost expedition]] and the [[Donner Party]]. Such cases generally involve necro-cannibalism (eating the corpse of someone who is already dead) as opposed to homicidal cannibalism (killing someone for food). In English law, the latter is always considered a crime, even in the most trying circumstances. The case of ''[[R v Dudley and Stephens]]'', in which two men were found guilty of murder for killing and eating a cabin boy while adrift at sea in a lifeboat, set the precedent that [[Necessity in English law|necessity]] is no defence to a charge of murder.

In pre-modern medicine, the explanation given by the now-discredited theory of [[humorism]] for cannibalism was that it came about within a black acrimonious humor, which, being lodged in the linings of the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]], produced the voracity for human flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Cyclopaedia01.p0147&amp;q1=anthropophagy |publisher=1728 Cyclopaedia|title=Anthropophagy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical aspects ==
A well-known case of mortuary cannibalism is that of the [[Fore (people)|Fore]] tribe in [[New Guinea]], which resulted in the spread of the [[prion]] disease [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lindenbaum S |title=Understanding kuru: the contribution of anthropology and medicine |journal=Philos.

However, some scholars argue that although post-mortem dismemberment was the practice during funeral rites, cannibalism was not.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} [[Marvin Harris]] theorizes that it happened during a famine period coincident with the arrival of Europeans and was rationalized as a religious rite.

In 2003, a publication in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' received a large amount of press attention when it suggested that early humans may have practiced extensive cannibalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mead S, Stumpf MP, Whitfield J |title=Balancing selection at the prion protein gene consistent with prehistoric kurulike epidemics |journal=Science |volume=300 |issue=5619 |pages=640–43 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12690204 |doi=10.1126/science.1083320 |url=http://www.gs.washington.edu/news/article.pdf|ref=harv |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/us/gene-study-finds-cannibal-pattern.html |title=Gene Study Finds Cannibal Pattern |work=New York Times |author=Nicholas Wade |date=April 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this research, genetic markers commonly found in modern humans worldwide suggest that today many people carry a gene that evolved as protection against the [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|brain diseases]] that can be spread by consuming human brain tissue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannibalism Normal&quot;/&gt; A 2006 reanalysis of the data questioned this hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Soldevila M, Andrés AM, Ramírez-Soriano A |title=The prion protein gene in humans revisited: Lessons from a worldwide resequencing study |journal=Genome Res. |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=231–9 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16369046 |pmc=1361719 |doi=10.1101/gr.4345506|ref=harv  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it claimed to have found a data collection bias, which led to an erroneous conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/22927/|magazine=New Scientist|title=No cannibalism signature in human gene}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claimed bias came from incidents of cannibalism used in the analysis not being due to local cultures, but having been carried out by explorers, stranded seafarers or escaped convicts.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.warriors.egympie.com.au/cannibalism.html ''Cannibalism – Some Hidden Truths''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417140731/http://www.warriors.egympie.com.au/cannibalism.html |date=April 17, 2010 }} for an example documenting escaped convicts in Australia who initially blamed natives, but later confessed to conducting the practice themselves out of desperate hunger.&lt;/ref&gt; The original authors published a subsequent paper in 2008 defending their conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mead S, Whitfield J, Poulter M |title=Genetic susceptibility, evolution and the kuru epidemic |journal=Philos.

==Myths, legends and folklore==
[[File:Hansel-and-gretel-rackham.jpg|thumb|170px|''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'', illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
[[File:Francisco de Goya, Saturno devorando a su hijo (1819-1823).jpg|thumb|170px|alt=Painting of a ghoulish, naked man holding a bloody, naked body and devouring the arm.|''[[Saturn Devouring His Son]]'', from the [[Black Paintings]] series by [[Francisco de Goya]], 1819]]

Cannibalism features in the folklore and legends of many cultures and is most often attributed to evil characters or as extreme retribution for some wrongdoing. Examples include the witch in &quot;[[Hansel and Gretel]]&quot;, [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]] of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Baba Yaga]] of [[Slavic folklore]].

A number of stories in [[Greek mythology]] involve cannibalism, in particular cannibalism of close family members, e.g., the stories of [[Thyestes]], [[Tereus]] and especially [[Cronus]], who was [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] in the Roman pantheon. The story of [[Tantalus]] also parallels this.

The [[wendigo]] is a creature appearing in the [[Native American mythology|legends]] of the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] people. It is thought of variously as a malevolent cannibalistic spirit that could [[spiritual possession|possess]] humans or a monster that humans could physically transform into. Those who indulged in cannibalism were at particular risk,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brightman |first=Robert A. |year=1988 |title=The Windigo in the Material World |journal=Ethnohistory |volume=35 |issue=4 |doi=10.2307/482140 |pages=337–379 |jstor=482140 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the legend appears to have reinforced this practice as [[taboo]]. The [[Zuni people]] tell the story of the [[Átahsaia]] – a giant who cannibalizes his fellow demons and seeks out human flesh.

The [[wechuge]] is a [[demon]]ic [[cannibal]]istic creature that seeks out human flesh. It is a creature appearing in the [[Native American mythology]] of the [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilmore|first1=David D.|title=Monsters : Evil Beings, Mythical Beasts and All Manner of Imaginary Terrors|date=2009|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0812220889|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be half monster and half human-like; however, it has many shapes and forms.

==Accusations==
William Arens, author of ''[[The Man-Eating Myth|The Man-Eating Myth: Anthropology and Anthropophagy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(New York: Oxford University Press, 1979; {{ISBN|0-19-502793-0}})&lt;/ref&gt; questions the credibility of reports of cannibalism and argues that the description by one group of people of another people as cannibals is a consistent and demonstrable ideological and rhetorical device to establish perceived [[Cultural imperialism|cultural superiority]]. Arens bases his thesis on a detailed analysis of numerous &quot;classic&quot; cases of cultural cannibalism cited by explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists. He asserts that many were steeped in racism, unsubstantiated, or based on second-hand or hearsay evidence.

Accusations of cannibalism helped characterize indigenous peoples as &quot;uncivilized&quot;, &quot;primitive&quot;, or even &quot;inhuman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Earle, ''The Body of the Conquistador: Food, race, and the Colonial Experience in Spanish America, 1492–1700''. New York: Cambridge University Press 2012, pp. 123–24.&lt;/ref&gt; These assertions promoted the use of military force as a means of &quot;civilizing&quot; and &quot;pacifying&quot; the &quot;savages&quot;. The [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] and its earlier conquests in the Caribbean where there were widespread reports of cannibalism, justifying the conquest. Cannibals were exempt from [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]]'s prohibition on enslaving the indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;Earle, ''The Body of the Conquistador'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of the sensationalism of cannibalism and its connection to [[imperialism]] occurred during [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874)|Japan's 1874 expedition to Taiwan]]. As Eskildsen describes, there was an exaggeration of cannibalism by [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]] in Japan's popular media such as newspapers and illustrations at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Pre-history===
[[Image:Homo antecessor female.jpg|thumb|170px|Model of a female ''[[Homo antecessor]]'' of [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] practicing cannibalism.]]
There is evidence, both archaeological and genetic, that cannibalism has been practiced for hundreds of thousands of years by early Homo Sapiens and archaic hominins.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural born cannibals|journal=New Scientist|date=Jul 10, 2004|page=30|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18324555.400-natural-born-cannibals.html?full=true|author=Richard Hollingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human bones that have been &quot;de-fleshed&quot; by other humans go back 600,000 years. The oldest ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' bones (from [[Ethiopia]]) show signs of this as well.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; Some anthropologists, such as [[Tim D.

''[[Why do People Sing? Music in Human Evolution]]''. Logos. pp. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Corbett]] proposed that after major [[epidemic]]s, when human corpses are easily accessible to predators, there are more cases of man-eating leopards,&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Jim (2003).

Oxford University Press, 26th impression. pp. xv–xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; so removing dead bodies through ritual cannibalism (before the cultural traditions of burying and burning bodies appeared in human history) might have had practical reasons for hominids and early humans to control predation.

The tomb of [[ancient Egyptian]] king [[Unas]] contained a hymn in praise to the king portraying him as a cannibal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experience-ancient-egypt.com/egyptian-religion-mythology/ancient-egyptian-mythology/pyramid-texts-cannibal-hymn The Pyramid Texts - Cannibal Hymn]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polybius]] records that [[Hannibal Monomachus]] once suggested [[Hannibal Barca]] to teach his army to adopt cannibalism in order to be properly supplied in his travel to Italy, although Barca and his officers could not bring themselves to practice it. In [[Second Punic War|the same war]], [[Gaius Terentius Varro]] once claimed to the citizens of [[Capua]] that Barca's [[Gaul]] and [[Mercenaries of the ancient Iberian peninsula|Spanish mercenaries]] fed on human flesh, though this claim seemed to be acknowledged as false.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Rawlings, [https://www.academia.edu/3451102/_Hannibal_the_Cannibal_Polybius_on_Barcid_atrocities_Cardiff_Historical_Papers_9_Cardiff_Cardiff_School_of_History_and_Archaeology_pp._1-30 Hannibal the Cannibal?

[[Cassius Dio]] recorded cannibalism practiced by the ''bucoli'', Egyptian tribes led by [[Isidorus]] against Rome. They [[Human sacrifice|sacrificed]] and devoured two Roman officers in ritualistic fashion, swearing an oath over their entrails.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' LXXII.4&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Appian]], during the Roman [[Siege of Numantia]] in the second century BCE, the population of [[Numantia]] was reduced to cannibalism and [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Appian.

Cannibalism was reported by [[Josephus]] during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|siege of Jerusalem by Rome in 70 CE]].&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus.

[[Jerome]], in his letter ''[[Against Jovinianus]]'', discusses how people come to their present condition as a result of their heritage, and he then lists several examples of peoples and their customs. In the list, he mentions that he has heard that [[Attacotti]] eat human flesh and that [[Massagetae]] and ''Derbices'' (a people on the borders of India) kill and eat old people.&lt;!--(The [[Tibareni]] crucify those whom they have loved before when they have grown old.)--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Reports of cannibalism were recorded during the [[First Crusade]], as Crusaders were alleged to have fed on the bodies of their dead opponents following the [[Siege of Ma'arra]].

The Moroccan Muslim explorer [[ibn Battuta]] reported that one African king advised him that nearby people were cannibals (although this may have been a prank played on ibn Battuta by the king to fluster his guest). Ibn Batutta reported that Arabs and Christians were safe, as their flesh was &quot;unripe&quot; and would cause the eater to fall ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The odyssey of Ibn Battuta : uncommon tales of a medieval adventurer|last=David.|first=Waines|date=2010|publisher=I.B.

For a brief time in Europe, an unusual form of cannibalism occurred when thousands of [[Mummy#Egyptian mummies as a commodity|Egyptian mummies]] preserved in [[bitumen]] were ground up and sold as medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice developed into a wide-scale business which flourished until the late 16th century. This &quot;fad&quot; ended because the mummies were revealed actually to be recently killed slaves. Two centuries ago, mummies were still believed to have medicinal properties against bleeding, and were sold as [[pharmaceutical]]s in powdered form (see [[Mellified Man|human mummy confection]] and [[mummia]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Daly flesh&quot;&gt;Quotes from [[John Sanderson (merchant)|John Sanderson]]'s ''Travels'' (1586) in ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1345912 That Obscure Object of Desire: Victorian Commodity Culture and Fictions of the Mummy]'', [[Nicholas Daly]], NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 28, No. 1 (Autumn, 1994), pp. 24–51. {{doi|10.2307/1345912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China during the [[Tang dynasty]], cannibalism was supposedly resorted to by rebel forces early in the period (who were said to raid neighboring areas for victims to eat), as well as both soldiers and civilians besieged during the rebellion of [[An Lushan Rebellion|An Lushan]]. Eating an enemy's heart and liver was also claimed to be a feature of both official punishments and private vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benn |first=Charles |title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang Dynasty |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-517665-0 |pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to cannibalizing the enemy have also been seen in poetry written in the [[Song dynasty]] (for example, in ''[[Man Jiang Hong]]''), although the cannibalizing is perhaps poetic symbolism, expressing hatred towards the enemy.

Charges of cannibalism were levied against the [[Qizilbash]] of the Safavid Ismail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bashir |first=Shahzad |date=2006 |title=Shah Ismaʿil and the Qizilbash: Cannibalism in the Religious History of Early Safavid Iran |journal=History of Religions |volume=45 |issue=3 |page=235&lt;!-- |pages=234–256--&gt; |publisher=The University of Chicago |doi=10.1086/503715 |url=https://www.academia.edu/2189010 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is universal agreement that some [[Mesoamerican]] people practiced [[human sacrifice]], but there is a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether [[cannibalism in pre-Columbian America]] was widespread. At one extreme, anthropologist Marvin Harris, author of ''[[Cannibals and Kings]]'', has suggested that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the [[Aztec]] diet was lacking in [[protein]]s. While most historians of the pre-Columbian era believe that there was ritual cannibalism related to human sacrifices, they do not support Harris's thesis that human flesh was ever a significant portion of the Aztec diet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DE1F3DF935A35752C0A961948260 To Aztecs, Cannibalism Was a Status Symbol], New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/montellano.htm |title=Aztec Cannibalism: An Ecological Necessity? |publisher=Latinamericanstudies.org |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805031701/http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/montellano.htm |archivedate=August 5, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ortiz de Montellano | first1 = Bernard R. | year = 1978 | title = Aztec Cannibalism: An Ecological necessity? | url = | journal = Science | volume = 200 | issue = 4342| pages = 611–617 | doi=10.1126/science.200.4342.611| pmid = 17812682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have hypothesized that cannibalism was part of a blood revenge in war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QauRWfX4NTcC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=cannibal+brazil&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=6 The cannibal within] By Lewis F.

In Spain's overseas expansion to the New World, the practice of cannibalism was reported by [[Christopher Columbus]] in the Caribbean islands, and the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] were greatly feared because of their supposed practice of it.

The [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]], and the [[Attacapa]], [[Tonkawa]], and other Texas tribes were known to their neighbours as 'man-eaters.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/encyclopedia/cannibalism.htm cannibalism], James WHITE, ed., Handbook of Indians of Canada, Published as an Appendix to the Tenth Report of the Geographic Board of Canada, Ottawa, 1913, 632p., pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; The forms of cannibalism described included both resorting to human flesh during famines and ritual cannibalism, the latter usually consisting of eating a small portion of an enemy warrior.

As with most lurid tales of native cannibalism, these stories are treated with a great deal of scrutiny, as accusations of cannibalism were often used as justifications for the subjugation or destruction of &quot;savages&quot;.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} However, there were several well-documented cultures that engaged in regular eating of the dead, such as New Zealand's [[Māori people|Māori]].

Other islands in the Pacific were home to cultures that allowed cannibalism to some degree.

This period of time was also rife with instances of explorers and seafarers resorting to cannibalism for survival.
* The survivors of the sinking of the French ship ''[[French frigate Méduse (1810)|Méduse]]'' in 1816 resorted to cannibalism after four days adrift on a raft, and their plight was made famous by [[Théodore Géricault]]'s painting [[Raft of the Medusa]].

After several days, one of the crew, a seventeen-year-old cabin boy, fell unconscious due to a combination of the famine and drinking seawater. The others (one possibly objecting) decided then to kill him and eat him. They were picked up four days later. Two of the three survivors were found guilty of murder.

[[Roger Casement]], writing to a consular colleague in Lisbon on August 3, 1903 from Lake Mantumba in the [[Congo Free State]], said:
{{quote|&quot;The people round here are all cannibals. You never saw such a weird looking lot in your life. There are also dwarfs (called Batwas) in the forest who are even worse cannibals than the taller human environment. They eat man flesh raw! It's a fact.&quot; Casement then added how assailants would &quot;bring down a dwarf on the way home, for the marital cooking pot&amp;nbsp;... The Dwarfs, as I say, dispense with cooking pots and eat and drink their human prey fresh cut on the battlefield while the blood is still warm and running.

Many instances of cannibalism by necessity were recorded during World War II. For example, during the 872-day [[Siege of Leningrad]], reports of cannibalism began to appear in the winter of 1941–1942, after all birds, rats, and pets were eaten by survivors.

Almost all of them were sent to POW camps in [[Siberia]] or Central Asia where, due to being chronically underfed by their Soviet captors, many resorted to cannibalism.

====Japanese====
The Australian War Crimes Section of the [[Tokyo tribunal]], led by prosecutor [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]] (the future Judge-in-Chief), collected numerous written reports and testimonies that documented Japanese soldiers' acts of cannibalism among their own troops, on enemy dead, as well as on Allied prisoners of war in many parts of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. In September 1942, Japanese daily rations on New Guinea consisted of 800&amp;nbsp;grams of rice and tinned meat. However, by December, this had fallen to 50&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name=&quot;happell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Happell|first=Charles|title=The Bone Man of Kokoda|year=2008| publisher=Macmillan| location=Sydney| isbn=978-1-4050-3836-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|78–80}} According to historian Yuki Tanaka, &quot;cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Yuki. ''Hidden horrors: Japanese War Crimes in World War II'', Westview Press, 1996, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, flesh was cut from living people. A prisoner of war from the [[British Indian Army]], [[Lance Naik]] Hatam Ali, testified that in [[New Guinea]]: &quot;the Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place by the Japanese. The remainder of us were taken to another spot {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive and they were thrown into a ditch where they later died.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lord Russell of Liverpool]] (Edward Russell), ''The Knights of Bushido, a short history of Japanese War Crimes'', Greenhill Books, 2002, p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-documented case occurred in [[Chichijima incident|Chichi-jima]] in February 1945, when Japanese soldiers killed and consumed five American airmen. This case was investigated in 1947 in a war crimes trial, and of 30 Japanese soldiers prosecuted, five (Maj. Matoba, Gen. Tachibana, Adm. Mori, Capt.

{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
Cannibalism was reported by the journalist [[Neil Davis (cameraman)|Neil Davis]] during the South East Asian wars of the 1960s and 1970s. Davis reported that [[Cambodia]]n troops ritually ate portions of the slain enemy, typically the [[liver]]. However he and many refugees also reported that cannibalism was practiced non-ritually when there was no food to be found. This usually occurred when towns and villages were under [[Khmer Rouge]] control, and food was strictly rationed, leading to widespread starvation. Any civilian caught participating in cannibalism would have been immediately executed.

[[File:Cannibalism during Russian famine 1921.jpg|thumb|160px|Cannibalism during the [[Russian famine of 1921]].]]

In his book, ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', Soviet writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] described cases of cannibalism in 20th-century [[USSR]]. Of the [[Russian famine of 1921|famine in Povolzhie]] (1921–1922) he wrote: &quot;That horrible famine was up to cannibalism, up to consuming children by their own parents&amp;nbsp;— the famine, which Russia had never known even in [[Time of Troubles]] [in 1601–1603]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A. Solzhenitsyn, ''The Gulag Archipelago'' Part I, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[dekulakization]] process in the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s, many deportees were forced to eat one another by genocidal Soviet authorities, e.g. [[Nazino affair|on the Nazino island]] or during [[Holodomor]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

During the 1930s, multiple acts of cannibalism were reported from [[Ukraine]] and Russia's Volga, South Siberian and Kuban regions during the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3229000.stm|title=Ukraine marks great famine anniversary|date=November 22, 2003|accessdate=July 27, 2007 |work=BBC News | first=Yaroslav | last=Lukov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Survival was a moral as well as a physical struggle. A woman doctor wrote to a friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was &quot;not sure that I shall not be one by the time my letter reaches you&quot;. The good people died first. Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.&amp;nbsp;... At least 2,505 people were sentenced for cannibalism in the years 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine, though the actual number of cases was certainly much higher.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder.

Basic Books, 2010, pp. 50–51. {{ISBN|0-465-00239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Solzhenitsyn said of the [[Siege of Leningrad]] (1941–1944): &quot;Those who consumed human flesh, or dealt with the human liver trading from dissecting rooms&amp;nbsp;... were accounted as the political criminals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;A. Solzhenitsyn, ''The Gulag Archipelago'', Part I, comments to Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; And of the building of Northern Railway Labor Camp (&quot;[[Sevzheldorlag]]&quot;) Solzhenitsyn reports, &quot;An ordinary hard working political prisoner almost could not survive at that penal camp. In the camp Sevzheldorlag (chief: colonel Klyuchkin) in 1946–47 there were many cases of cannibalism: they cut human bodies, cooked and ate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A. Solzhenitsyn ''The Gulag Archipelago'', Part III, Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet journalist [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] was a long-term political prisoner who spent time in the Soviet prisons, [[Gulag]] camps and settlements from 1938 to 1955. She described in her memoir, ''Harsh Route'' (or ''Steep Route''), of a case which she was directly involved in during the late 1940s, after she had been moved to the prisoners' hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Yevgenia Ginzburg, ''Harsh Route'', Part 2, Chapter 23 &quot;The Paradise On A Microscope View&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The chief warder shows me the black smoked pot, filled with some food: &quot;I need your medical expertise regarding this meat.&quot; I look into the pot, and hardly hold vomiting. The fibres of that meat are very small, and don't resemble me anything I have seen before. The skin on some pieces bristles with black hair&amp;nbsp;... A former smith from Poltava, Kulesh worked together with Centurashvili. At this time, Centurashvili was only one month away from being discharged from the camp&amp;nbsp;... And suddenly he surprisingly disappeared. The wardens looked around the hills, stated Kulesh's evidence, that last time Kulesh had seen his workmate near the fireplace, Kulesh went out to work and Centurashvili left to warm himself more; but when Kulesh returned to the fireplace, Centurashvili had vanished; who knows, maybe he got frozen somewhere in snow, he was a weak guy&amp;nbsp;... The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed that it was an escape case, though they wondered why, since his imprisonment period was almost over&amp;nbsp;... The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place.&amp;nbsp;... Just yesterday, one body part was found under two crossed logs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prior to 1931, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[William Buehler Seabrook]], in the interests of research, obtained from a hospital intern at the [[Sorbonne (building)|Sorbonne]] a chunk of human meat from the body of a healthy human killed in an accident, then cooked and ate it. He reported, &quot;It was like good, fully developed [[veal]], not young, but not yet beef. It was very definitely like that, and it was not like any other meat I had ever tasted. It was so nearly like good, fully developed veal that I think no person with a palate of ordinary, normal sensitiveness could distinguish it from veal. It was mild, good meat with no other sharply defined or highly characteristic taste such as for instance, goat, high game, and pork have. The steak was slightly tougher than prime veal, a little stringy, but not too tough or stringy to be agreeably edible. The roast, from which I cut and ate a central slice, was tender, and in color, texture, smell as well as taste, strengthened my certainty that of all the meats we habitually know, veal is the one meat to which this meat is accurately comparable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Seabrook, William Bueller| title=Jungle Ways|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.207052|location= London, Bombay, Sydney|publisher=George G.

When [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]] crashed into the [[Andes]] on October 13, 1972, the survivors resorted to eating the deceased during their 72 days in the mountains.

Because England does not have a specific law against cannibalism, he legally ate a [[canapé]] of donated human [[tonsils]] in Walthamstow High Street, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Hard to stomach, but Rick eats human parts | work= Waltham Forest Guardian | page= 6 | location= London, United Kingdom | date= 29 July 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Young | first = Andrew | title = Rick eats his mate's tonsils on a cracker! | work= The Sun | page= 3 | location= Plymouth, United Kingdom | date= 4 August 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, on April 15, 1989, he publicly ate a slice of human testicle in Lewisham High Street, London.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = White | first = Kim | title = Now Rick's really gone nuts! | work= Guardian &amp; Gazette Newspapers | page= 8 | location= London, United Kingdom | date= 14 April 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Rick's food for thought | work= The Mercury | page= 5 | location= London, United Kingdom | date= 20 April 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he tried to eat another slice of human testicle at the Pitt International Galleries in Vancouver on July 14, 1989, the Vancouver police confiscated the testicle [[hors d'œuvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Stueck | first = Wendy | title = Would-be cannibal's appetizer confiscated | work= Vancouver Sun | pages= A7 | location= Vancouver, Canada | date= 15 July 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the charge of publicly exhibiting a disgusting object was dropped, and he finally ate the piece of human testicle on the steps of the Vancouver court house on September 22, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = No charges laid over artist's testicle claim | work= Vancouver Sun | pages= B1 | location= Vancouver, Canada | date= 22 August 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] of [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin was arrested after one of his intended victims managed to escape.
