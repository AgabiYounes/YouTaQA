'''Courtney Michelle Love''' ([[née]] '''Harrison'''; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her &quot;one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=icon/&gt;

Born to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Miloš Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.

Love continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.

Love has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).

===Musical style and lyrics===
Musically, Love's work with Hole and her solo efforts have been characterized as [[alternative rock]];{{sfn|Ladd-Taylor|Umanski|1998|p=319}} Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive [[punk rock]].{{sfn|Lankford|2009|p=77–8}} ''Spin''{{'}}s October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements.&lt;ref name=&quot;oct91&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=Spin|date=October 1991|title=Hole Lotta Love|page=32|first=Daisy|last=Von Furth|issn=0886-3032|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yGjqAHJs488C|via=Google Books|volume=7|issue=7}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, she stated that Hole had &quot;always been a pop band.

The songs are fueled by adolescent traumas, feelings of disgust about the body, passionate friendships with women and the desire to escape domesticity. Her lyrical style could be described as emotional nudism.&quot;&lt;ref name=reynolds/&gt; Journalist and critic [[Kim France]], in critiquing Love's lyrics, referred to her as a &quot;dark genius&quot; and likened her work to that of Anne Sexton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Bookforum]]|title=Kim France on ''Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Women'' by Elizabeth Wurtzel|pages=7–8|volume=5–7|year=1998|issn=1098-3376|author=France, Kim|author-link=Kim France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love has remarked that lyrics have always been the most important component of songwriting for her: &quot;The important thing for me...&amp;nbsp; is it has to look good on the page.

In a 1991 interview with [[Everett True]], she said: &quot;I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things&amp;nbsp;...
