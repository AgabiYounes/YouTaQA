'''Centime''' (from {{lang-la|centesimus}}) is [[French language|French]] for &quot;[[Cent (currency)|cent]]&quot;, and is used in English as the name of the fraction [[currency]] in several [[Francophone countries]] (including [[Switzerland]], [[Algeria]], [[Belgium]], [[Morocco]] and [[France]]).

In France the usage of ''centime'' goes back to the introduction of the [[decimal currency|decimal monetary system]] under [[Napoleon]]. This system aimed at replacing non-decimal fractions of older coins. A five-centime coin was known as a ''sou'', i.e. a [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] or [[shilling]].

In [[Francophone Canada]] {{frac|1|100}} of a Canadian dollar is officially known as a ''cent'' (pronounced /sɛnt/) in both English and French. However, in practice, the form of ''cenne'' (pronounced /sɛn/) has completely replaced the official ''cent''. Spoken and written use of the official form ''cent'' in Francophone Canada is exceptionally uncommon.
In the Canadian French vernacular ''sou'', ''sou noir'' (''noir'' means &quot;black&quot; in French), ''cenne'', and ''cenne noire'' are all widely known, used, and accepted monikers when referring to either {{frac|1|100}} of a Canadian dollar or the 1¢ coin (colloquially known as a &quot;penny&quot; in North American English).

==Subdivision of euro: cent or centime?==
In the European community ''cent'' is the official name for one hundredth of a [[euro]]. However, in French-speaking countries the word ''centime '' is the preferred term. Indeed, the [[Conseil supérieur de la langue française (Belgium)|Superior Council of the French language]] of Belgium recommended in 2001 the use of ''centime'', since ''cent'' is also the French word for &quot;hundred&quot;. An analogous decision was published in the ''[[Journal officiel]]'' in France (2 December 1997).

In Morocco, [[dirham]]s are divided into 100 ''centime''s and one may find prices in the country quoted in ''centime''s rather than in dirhams. Sometimes ''centime''s are known as francs or in [[Spanish Morocco|former Spanish areas]], [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]].
