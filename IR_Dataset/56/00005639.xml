The '''Cyrillic script''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ᵻ|ˈ|r|ɪ|l|ɪ|k}}) is a [[writing system]] used for various languages across [[Eurasia]] and is used as the national script in various [[Slavs|Slavic]]-, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]- and [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking countries in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Northern Asia]].

In the 9th century AD the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] [[Tsar]] [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I the Great]], following the cultural and political course of his father [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]], commissioned a new script, the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]], to be made at the [[Preslav Literary School]] in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], which would replace the [[Glagolitic script]], produced earlier by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] and the same [[Saint Naum|disciples]] that created the new [[Slavs|Slavic]] script in [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. The usage of the Cyrillic script in [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] was made official in 893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francis |last=Dvornik |title=The Slavs: Their Early History and Civilization |quote=The Psalter and the Book of Prophets were adapted or &quot;modernized&quot; with special regard to their use in Bulgarian churches, and it was in this school that the [[Glagolitic script]] was replaced by the so-called Cyrillic writing, which was more akin to the Greek uncial, simplified matters considerably and is still used by the Orthodox Slavs. |year=1956 |place=Boston |publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt |url-access=registration |title=Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500–1250 |series=Cambridge Medieval Textbooks |first=Florin |last=Curta |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-521-81539-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/southeasterneuro0000curt/page/221 221]–222 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J-H9BTVHKRMC&amp;pg=PR98 |chapter=The Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire |title=Oxford History of the Christian Church |first1=J. M. |last1=Hussey |first2=Andrew |last2=Louth |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-19-161488-0 |pages=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new script became the basis of [[alphabet]]s used in various languages, especially those of [[Orthodox Slavs|Orthodox Slavic]] origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian. {{As of|2019||df=}}, around 250 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages, with [[Russia]] accounting for about half of them.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by population]]&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[accession of Bulgaria to the European Union]] on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the [[European Union]], following [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Leonard |last1=Orban |title=Cyrillic, the third official alphabet of the EU, was created by a truly multilingual European |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-07-330_en.pdf |publisher=[[European Union]] |accessdate=3 August 2014 |date=24 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyrillic is derived from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[uncial script]], augmented by letters from the older [[Glagolitic alphabet]], including some [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s. These additional letters were used for [[Old Church Slavonic]] sounds not found in Greek. The script is named in honor of the two [[Byzantine]] brothers,&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–05, s.v. &quot;Cyril and Methodius, Saints&quot;; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Encyclopædia Britannica Incorporated, Warren E. Preece – 1972, p. 846, s.v., &quot;Cyril and Methodius, Saints&quot; and &quot;Eastern Orthodoxy, Missions ancient and modern&quot;; ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures'', David H. Levinson, 1991, p. 239, s.v., &quot;Social Science&quot;; Eric M. Meyers, ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'', p. 151, 1997; Lunt, ''Slavic Review'', June 1964, p. 216; Roman Jakobson, ''Crucial problems of Cyrillo-Methodian Studies''; Leonid Ivan Strakhovsky, ''A Handbook of Slavic Studies'', p. 98; V. Bogdanovich, ''History of the ancient Serbian literature'', Belgrade, 1980, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on. Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by the early disciples of Cyril and Methodius, particularly by [[Clement of Ohrid]].

In the early 18th century, the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by [[Peter the Great]], who had recently returned from his [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|Grand Embassy]] in [[western Europe]]. The new letterforms became closer to those of the Latin alphabet; several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great. West European typography culture was also adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Civil Type&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Type and Kis Cyrillic|url=http://typejournal.ru/en/articles/Civil-Type|website=typejournal.ru|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letters==
Cyrillic script spread throughout the East Slavic and some South Slavic territories, being adopted for writing local languages, such as [[Old East Slavic]]. Its adaptation to local languages produced a number of Cyrillic alphabets, discussed below.

Capital and lowercase letters were not distinguished in old manuscripts.

Yeri ({{script|Cyrs|Ы}}) was originally a [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of Yer and I ({{script|Cyrs|Ъ}} + {{script|Cyrs|І}} = {{script|Cyrs|Ы}}). [[Iotation]] was indicated by ligatures formed with the letter І: {{script|Cyrs|[[Iotated A (Cyrillic)|Ꙗ]]}} (not an ancestor of modern Ya, Я, which is derived from {{script|Cyrs|Ѧ}}), {{script|Cyrs|Ѥ}}, {{script|Cyrs|Ю}} (ligature of {{script|Cyrs|І}} and {{script|Cyrs|ОУ}}), {{script|Cyrs|Ѩ}}, {{script|Cyrs|Ѭ}}. Sometimes different letters were used interchangeably, for example {{script|Cyrs|И}} = {{script|Cyrs|І}} = {{script|Cyrs|Ї}}, as were typographical variants like {{script|Cyrs|О}} = {{script|Cyrs|Ѻ}}. There were also commonly used ligatures like {{script|Cyrs|ѠТ}} = {{script|Cyrs|Ѿ}}.

The letters also had numeric values, based not on Cyrillic alphabetical order, but inherited from the letters' [[Greek numerals|Greek ancestors]].

The early Cyrillic alphabet is difficult to represent on computers. Many of the letterforms differed from those of modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in [[manuscript]]s, and changed over time. Few fonts include [[glyph]]s sufficient to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with [[Unicode]] policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character.

The Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern [[Church Slavonic]] language. In Microsoft Windows, the [[Segoe UI]] user interface font is notable for having complete support for the archaic Cyrillic letters since Windows 8.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Letterforms and typography==
The development of Cyrillic [[typography]] passed directly from the [[medieval]] stage to the late [[Baroque]], without a [[Renaissance]] phase as in [[Western Europe]]. Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (still found on many [[icon]] inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.

[[Peter the Great]], Tsar of Russia, mandated the use of [[Civil script|westernized letter forms]] ([[:ru:Гражданский шрифт|ru]]) in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of [[serif]]s, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.

[[File:Cyrillic upright-cursive-n.svg|frame|right|Letters Ge, De, I, I kratkoye, Me, Te, Tse, Be and Ve in upright (printed) and cursive (handwritten) variants. (Top is set in Georgia font, bottom in Odessa Script.)]]
Cyrillic [[capital letters|uppercase]] and [[lower case|lowercase]] letter forms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially [[small caps|small capitals]] (with exceptions: Cyrillic {{angle bracket|а}}, {{angle bracket|е}}, {{angle bracket|і}}, {{angle bracket|ј}}, {{angle bracket|р}}, and {{angle bracket|у}} adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase {{angle bracket|ф}} is typically designed under the influence of Latin {{angle bracket|p}}, lowercase {{angle bracket|б}}, {{angle bracket|ђ}} and {{angle bracket|ћ}} are traditional handwritten forms), although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Bringhurst (2002) writes &quot;in Cyrillic, the difference between normal lower case and small caps is more subtle than it is in the Latin or Greek alphabets,{{nbsp}}...&quot; (p 32) and &quot;in most Cyrillic faces, the lower case is close in color and shape to Latin small caps&quot; (p 107).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have [[roman type|roman]] and [[italic type|italic]] types (practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both). However, the native font terminology in most Slavic languages (for example, in Russian) does not use the words &quot;roman&quot; and &quot;italic&quot; in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Name ''{{lang|ru-Latn|ital'yanskiy shrift}}'' (Italian font) in Russian refers to a particular font family [http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg JPG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926182512/http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg |date=26 September 2007 }}, whereas ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rimskiy shrift}}'' (roman font) is just a synonym for Latin font, Latin alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns:

[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Cyrillic letters in cursive]]
*Roman type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|pryamoy shrift}}'' (&quot;upright type&quot;)—compare with ''{{lang|de|Normalschrift}}'' (&quot;regular type&quot;) in German
*Italic type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursiv}}'' (&quot;cursive&quot;) or ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursivniy shrift}}'' (&quot;cursive type&quot;)—from the German word ''{{lang|de|Kursive}}'', meaning italic typefaces and not cursive writing
*[[Cursive]] handwriting is ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rukopisniy shrift}}'' (&quot;handwritten type&quot;) in Russian—in German: ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Kurrentschrift|Kurrentschrift]]}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Laufschrift}}'', both meaning literally 'running type'

As in Latin typography, a [[sans-serif]] face may have a mechanically sloped oblique type (''{{lang|ru-Latn|naklonniy shrift}}''—&quot;sloped&quot;, or &quot;slanted type&quot;) instead of italic.

Similarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters (typically lowercase; uppercase only for handwritten or stylish types) are very different from their upright roman types. In certain cases, the correspondence between uppercase and lowercase glyphs does not coincide in Latin and Cyrillic fonts: for example, italic Cyrillic &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: larger&quot;&gt;{{angle bracket|''т''}}&lt;/span&gt; is the lowercase counterpart of {{angle bracket|''Т''}} not of {{angle bracket|''М''}}.

A boldfaced type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|poluzhirniy shrift}}'' (&quot;semi-bold type&quot;), because there existed fully boldfaced shapes that have been out of use since the beginning of the 20th century. A bold italic combination (bold slanted) does not exist for all font families.

In Standard Serbian, as well as in Macedonian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pravopis na makedonskiot jazik |date=2017 |publisher=Institut za makedonski jazik Krste Misirkov |location=Skopje |isbn=978-608-220-042-2 |page=3 |url=http://www.pravopis.mk/sites/default/files/Pravopis-2017.PDF |ref=MakedonskiPravopis}}&lt;/ref&gt; some italic and cursive letters are allowed to be different to resemble more to the handwritten letters. The regular (upright) shapes are generally standardized among languages and there are no officially recognized variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peshikan |first1=Mitar |last2=Jerković |first2=Jovan |last3=Pižurica |first3=Mato |title=Pravopis srpskoga jezika |date=1994 |publisher=Matica Srpska |location=Beograd |isbn=978-86-363-0296-5 |page=42 |ref=PravopisSrpskog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyrillic alphabets==
{{Main|Cyrillic alphabets}}

Among others, Cyrillic is the standard script for writing the following languages:
*'''Slavic languages''': [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Serbo-Croatian]] (for [[Serbian language|Standard Serbian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]), [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]
*'''Non-Slavic languages''': [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], [[Aleut language|Aleut]] (now mostly in church texts), [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Erzya language|Erzya]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] (to be replaced by Latin script by 2025&lt;ref name=&quot;KazSwitch&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/26/kazakhstan-switch-official-alphabet-cyrillic-latin|title=Alphabet soup as Kazakh leader orders switch from Cyrillic to Latin letters|last=Reuters|date=2017-10-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Kildin Sami language|Kildin Sami]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Dungan language|Dungan]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Moksha language|Moksha]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]], [[Romani orthography|Romani]] (some dialects), [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Tlingit alphabet#Cyrillic alphabets|Tlingit]] (now only in church texts), [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]], [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]], [[Siberian Yupik language|Yuit]] (Siberian Yupik), and [[Yupik languages#Writing systems|Yupik]] (in [[Alaska]]).

The Cyrillic script has also been used for languages of Alaska,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asna.ca/alaska/ &quot;Orthodox Language Texts&quot;], Retrieved 2011-06-20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavic Europe]] (except for [[Western Slavs|Western Slavic]] and some [[Southern Slavs|Southern Slavic]]), the [[Caucasus]], [[Siberia]], and the [[Russian Far East]].

The first alphabet derived from Cyrillic was [[Abur]], used for the [[Komi language]]. Other Cyrillic alphabets include the [[Molodtsov alphabet]] for the Komi language and various alphabets for [[Caucasian languages]].

==Name==
[[File:Cyrillic monument.jpg|thumb|165px|Cyrillic Script Monument in [[Antarctica]]]]
Since the script was conceived and popularised by the followers of [[Cyril and Methodius]], rather than by Cyril and Methodius themselves, its name denotes homage rather than authorship. The name &quot;Cyrillic&quot; often confuses people who are not familiar with the script's history, because it does not identify a country of origin (in contrast to the &quot;Greek alphabet&quot;). Among the general public, it is often called &quot;the Russian alphabet,&quot; because Russian is the most popular and influential alphabet based on the script. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably [[Stefan Tsanev]], have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic script be called the &quot;Bulgarian alphabet&quot; instead, for the sake of historical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Tsanev, Stefan. ''Български хроники, том 4 (Bulgarian Chronicles, Volume 4)'', Sofia, 2009, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; It must be noted here that 'alphabet' is not the same as 'script' (e.g. letter Її exists in the Cyrillic script since its very invention and is still used in Ukrainian, but is absent in the modern Bulgarian alphabet, that is Cyrillic as used in Bulgarian), so the accurate name is actually 'the Bulgarian script'.

In Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, and Serbian, the Cyrillic alphabet is also known as ''azbuka'', derived from the old names of the first two letters of most Cyrillic alphabets (just as the term ''alphabet'' came from the first two Greek letters ''alpha'' and ''beta''). In the Russian language syllabaries, especially the Japanese [[kana]], are commonly referred to as 'syllabic azbukas' rather then 'syllabic scripts'.

==History==
{{Main|Early Cyrillic alphabet}}
[[File:Azbuka 1574 by Ivan Fyodorov.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|A page from Азбука (Читанка) (ABC (Reader)), the first Ruthenian language textbook, printed by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1574. This page features the Cyrillic alphabet.]]
{{Alphabet}}

The Cyrillic script was created in the [[First Bulgarian Empire]].&lt;ref name=Cubberley1996&gt;Paul Cubberley (1996) &quot;The Slavic Alphabets&quot;. In Daniels and Bright, eds. ''The World's Writing Systems.'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-507993-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its first variant, the [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]], was created at the [[Preslav Literary School]]. It is derived from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek uncial script]] letters, augmented by [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s and consonants from the older [[Glagolitic alphabet]] for sounds not found in Greek. Tradition holds that Cyrillic and Glagolitic were formalized either by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] who brought Christianity to the southern Slavs, or by their disciples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia Encyclopedia 1972, p.846&quot;&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Sixth Edition. 2001–05, s.v. &quot;Cyril and Methodius, Saints&quot;; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Encyclopædia Britannica Incorporated, Warren E.

Cyrillic and [[Glagolitic]] were used for the [[Church Slavonic language]], especially the [[Old Church Slavonic]] variant. Hence expressions such as &quot;И is the tenth Cyrillic letter&quot; typically refer to the order of the Church Slavonic alphabet; not every Cyrillic alphabet uses every letter available in the script.

The Cyrillic script came to dominate Glagolitic in the 12th century. The literature produced in the Old Bulgarian language soon spread north and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Balkans and Eastern Europe, where it came to also be known as [[Old Church Slavonic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;On the relationship of old Church Slavonic to the written language of early Rus'&quot; Horace G.

''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; The alphabet used for the modern [[Church Slavonic language]] in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] rites still resembles early Cyrillic. However, over the course of the following millennium, Cyrillic adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reform and political decrees. A notable example of such linguistic reform can be attributed to [[Vuk Karadžić|Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] who updated the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] by removing certain graphemes no longer represented in the vernacular, and introducing graphemes specific to Serbian (i.e. Љ Њ Ђ Ћ Џ Ј), distancing it from Church Slavonic alphabet in use prior to the reform. Today, [[Languages using Cyrillic|many languages]] in the [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkans]], Eastern Europe, and [[Eurasiatic languages|northern Eurasia]] are written in Cyrillic alphabets.

==Relationship to other writing systems==
===Latin script===
A number of languages written in a Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a [[Latin alphabet]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Romanian Language|Romanian]] (in the [[Republic of Moldova]] until 1989, in [[Romania]] throughout the 19th century). After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except the breakaway region of [[Transnistria]], where [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Moldovan Cyrillic]] is official), [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Azerbaijan]]. [[Uzbekistan]] still uses both systems, and [[Kazakhstan]] has officially begun a transition from Cyrillic to Latin (scheduled to be complete by 2025). The [[Russia]]n government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all [[federal subjects of Russia]], to promote closer ties across the federation.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]] speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.

{{legend|#0b280b|Cyrillic is the sole official script.}}

{{legend|#87de87|Cyrillic is not official, but is in common use as a legacy script.}}{{legend|#999999|Cyrillic is not widely used}}]]

Standard [[Serbian language|Serbian]] uses [[Serbian language#Writing system|both the Cyrillic and Latin scripts]]. Cyrillic is nominally the official script of Serbia's administration according to the Serbian constitution;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ustavni.sud.rs/page/view/en-GB/235-100028/constitution Serbian constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; however, the law does not regulate scripts in standard language, or standard language itself by any means. In practice the scripts are equal, with Latin being used more often in a less official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2008/0529/p20s01-woeu.html | title=Serbian signs of the times are not in Cyrillic| journal=Christian Science Monitor| date=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zhuang alphabet]], used between the 1950s and 1980s in portions of the People's Republic of China, used a mixture of Latin, phonetic, numeral-based, and Cyrillic letters. The non-Latin letters, including Cyrillic, were removed from the alphabet in 1982 and replaced with Latin letters that closely resembled the letters they replaced.

===Romanization===

There are various systems for [[Romanization]] of Cyrillic text, including [[transliteration]] to convey Cyrillic spelling in [[Latin]] letters, and [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] to convey [[pronunciation]].

Standard Cyrillic-to-Latin transliteration systems include:
*[[Scientific transliteration of Cyrillic|Scientific transliteration]], used in linguistics, is based on the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Bosnian and Croatian Latin alphabet]].
*The Working Group on Romanization Systems&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/ ''UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization Systems'']&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[United Nations]] recommends different systems for specific languages. These are the most commonly used around the world.
*[[ISO 9]]:1995, from the International Organization for Standardization.
*American Library Association and Library of Congress Romanization tables for Slavic alphabets ([[ALA-LC Romanization]]), used in North American libraries.
*[[BGN/PCGN Romanization]] (1947), United States Board on Geographic Names &amp; Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use).
*[[GOST 16876-71|GOST 16876]], a now defunct Soviet transliteration standard. Replaced by GOST 7.79, which is [[ISO 9]] equivalent.
*Various [[informal romanizations of Cyrillic]], which adapt the Cyrillic script to Latin and sometimes Greek glyphs for compatibility with small character sets.

===Cyrillization===
Representing other writing systems with Cyrillic letters is called [[Cyrillization]].

==Computer encoding==
===Unicode===
{{Main|Cyrillic script in Unicode}}

As of Unicode version 12.0, Cyrillic letters, including national and historical alphabets, are encoded across several [[Unicode block|blocks]]:
*[[Cyrillic (Unicode block)|Cyrillic]]: [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf U+0400–U+04FF]
*[[Cyrillic Supplement]]: [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0500.pdf U+0500–U+052F]
*[[Cyrillic Extended-A]]: [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2DE0.pdf U+2DE0–U+2DFF]
*[[Cyrillic Extended-B]]: [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA640.pdf U+A640–U+A69F]
*[[Cyrillic Extended-C]]: [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1C80.pdf U+1C80–U+1C8F]
*[[Phonetic Extensions]]: [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D00.pdf U+1D2B, U+1D78]
*[[Combining Half Marks]]: [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UFE20.pdf U+FE2E–U+FE2F]

The characters in the range U+0400 to U+045F are basically the characters from [[ISO 8859-5]] moved upward by 864 positions. The characters in the range U+0460 to U+0489 are historic letters, not used now. The characters in the range U+048A to U+052F are additional letters for various languages that are written with Cyrillic script.

Unicode as a general rule does not include accented Cyrillic letters. A few exceptions include:
*combinations that are considered as separate letters of respective alphabets, like [[Й]], [[Ў]], [[Ё]], [[Ї]], [[Ѓ]], [[Ќ]] (as well as many letters of non-Slavic alphabets);
*two most frequent combinations orthographically required to distinguish [[homonym]]s in Bulgarian and Macedonian: [[Ѐ]], [[Ѝ]];
*a few Old and New Church Slavonic combinations: [[Ѷ]], [[Ѿ]], [[Ѽ]].

To indicate stressed or long vowels, [[combining diacritical mark]]s can be used after the respective letter (for example, {{unichar|0301|combining acute accent|cwith=◌}}: ы́ э́ ю́ я́ etc.).

Some languages, including [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]], are still not fully supported.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Unicode 5.1, released on 4 April 2008, introduces major changes to the Cyrillic blocks. Revisions to the existing Cyrillic blocks, and the addition of Cyrillic Extended A (2DE0 ... 2DFF) and Cyrillic Extended B (A640 ... A69F), significantly improve support for the [[early Cyrillic alphabet]], [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], [[Aleut language|Aleut]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], and [[Moksha language|Moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3194.pdf |title = IOS Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character Set|format=PDF | accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Punctuation for Cyrillic text is similar to that used in European Latin-alphabet languages.

Other [[character encoding]] systems for Cyrillic:
*[[CP866]] – 8-bit Cyrillic character encoding established by [[Microsoft]] for use in [[MS-DOS]] also known as GOST-alternative. Cyrillic characters go in their native order, with a &quot;window&quot; for pseudographic characters.
*[[ISO/IEC 8859-5]] – 8-bit Cyrillic character encoding established by [[International Organization for Standardization]]
*[[KOI8-R]] – 8-bit native Russian character encoding. Invented in the USSR for use on Soviet clones of American IBM and DEC computers. The Cyrillic characters go in the order of their Latin counterparts, which allowed the text to remain readable after transmission via a 7-bit line that removed the [[most significant bit]] from each byte—the result became a very rough, but readable, Latin transliteration of Cyrillic. Standard encoding of early 1990s for [[Unix]] systems and the first Russian Internet encoding.
*[[KOI8-U]] – KOI8-R with addition of Ukrainian letters.
*[[MIK Code page|MIK]] – 8-bit native Bulgarian character encoding for use in [[Microsoft]] [[DOS]].
*[[Windows-1251]] – 8-bit Cyrillic character encoding established by Microsoft for use in [[Microsoft Windows]]. The simplest 8-bit Cyrillic encoding—32 capital chars in native order at 0xc0–0xdf, 32 usual chars at 0xe0–0xff, with rarely used &quot;YO&quot; characters somewhere else. No pseudographics. Former standard encoding in some [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] distributions for Belarusian and Bulgarian, but currently displaced by [[UTF-8]].
*GOST-main.
*[[GB 2312]] – Principally simplified Chinese encodings, but there are also the basic 33 Russian Cyrillic letters (in upper- and lower-case).
*[[JIS encoding|JIS]] and [[Shift JIS]] – Principally Japanese encodings, but there are also the basic 33 Russian Cyrillic letters (in upper- and lower-case).

===Keyboard layouts===
{{see also|Keyboard layout#Keyboard layouts for non-Latin alphabetic scripts|label 1=Keyboard layouts for non-Latin alphabetic scripts}}

Each language has its own standard [[keyboard layout]], adopted from [[typewriter]]s. With the flexibility of computer input methods, there are also transliterating or phonetic/homophonic keyboard layouts made for typists who are more familiar with other layouts, like the common English [[QWERTY keyboard]]. When practical Cyrillic keyboard layouts or fonts are unavailable, computer users sometimes use transliteration or look-alike [[volapuk encoding|&quot;volapuk&quot; encoding]] to type in languages that are normally written with the Cyrillic alphabet.
