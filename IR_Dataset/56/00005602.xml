In addition, the country has signed the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and the ''Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency Agreement'' (MIGA). Cyprus has been a member of the [[European Union]] since 2004 and in the second half of the 2012 it held the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cy2012.eu/en/page/home|title=Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the European Union 2012 - Cyprus Presidency of the Council of the EU (European Union)|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-alignment==

[[Cyprus]] has historically followed a [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned foreign policy]], although it increasingly identifies with the West in its cultural affinities and trade patterns, and maintains close relations with [[European Union]], [[Greece]] and [[Israel]].
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F013050-0001, München, Staatsbesuch Präsident von Zypern.jpg|thumb|left|Cyprus former President [[Makarios III]] at a state visit in [[Munich]] with the German Chancellor in 1962]]

The prime originator of Cypriot non-alignment was [[Makarios III]], the first [[Presidents of Cyprus|President]] (1960–1977) of the independent republic of Cyprus. Prior to independence, Makarios - by virtue of his post as [[List of Archbishops of Cyprus|Archbishop of Cyprus]] and head of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]] - was the [[Greek Cypriot Ethnarch]], or ''de facto'' leader of the community. A highly influential figure well before independence, he participated in the 1955 [[Bandung Conference]]. After independence, Makarios took part in the 1961 founding meeting of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Belgrade]].

[[Image:Cyprus representations.png|thumb|right|350px|Cyprus representations abroad{{legend|#008000|resident embassy}} {{legend|#00ff00|non-resident embassy}} {{legend|#0080ff|diplomatic relations only, but no mission}}&lt;br&gt;{{legend|#ff0000|states that don't recognise the [[Republic of Cyprus]]}}]]

Reasons for this neutrality may lie in the extreme pressures exerted on the infant Republic by its larger neighbours, Turkey and Greece. [[Cyprus dispute|Intercommunal rivalries]] and movements for [[enosis|union with Greece]] or partial union with Turkey may have persuaded Makarios to steer clear of close affiliation with either side. In any case Cyprus became a high-profile member of the Non-Aligned Movement and retained its membership until its entry into the [[European Union]] in 2004. At the non-governmental level, Cyprus has also been a member of the popular extension of the Non-Aligned Movement, the [[Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Organisation]] hosting several high-level meetings.

Immediately after the 1974 Greek-sponsored [[coup d'état]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]], Makarios secured international recognition of his administration as the legitimate government of the whole island. This was disputed only by [[Turkey]], which currently recognizes only the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], established in 1983.

Since the 1974 crisis, the chief aim of the foreign policy of the Republic of Cyprus has been to secure the withdrawal of Turkish forces and the reunification of the island under the most favorable constitutional and territorial settlement possible. This campaign has been pursued primarily through international forums such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and in recent years through the European Union.

Canadian bilateral political relations with Cyprus stemmed initially from Cypriot Commonwealth membership at independence in 1960 (that had followed a guerrilla struggle with Britain). These relations quickly expanded in 1964 when Canada became a major troop contributor to [[UNFICYP]]. The participation lasted for the next 29 years, during which 50,000 Canadian soldiers served and 28 were killed. In large measure Canadian relations with Cyprus continue to revolve around support for the ongoing efforts of the [[United Nations]], [[G8]] and others to resolve the Island's divided status. Contacts with Cyprus on other issues also take place in international organizations such as the UN, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

In the case of Israel, Cyprus has occasionally outwardly backed the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]s in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], to the annoyance of some in the Israeli government. Cyprus, like over 100 other countries, officially recognizes Palestine as a de facto state.
The island is also host to a number of Palestinian and Lebanese refugees.

Relations between the two countries continued to suffer when Cypriot first lady Antroulla Vasiliou, the wife of President [[George Vasiliou]], was declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' in Israel when a delegation she was leading attempted to meet with [[Yasser Arafat]], who was under house arrest.

Controversy and public outcry arose in the early 2000s, when members of the Cypriot branch of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] were accused of selling church-owned land in the [[West Bank]] to Israeli developers, putting Cypriot commitment to the Palestinian cause at question.
The expulsion of two alleged Israeli spies from the island in 1998 also caused tension between the two governments.

The two countries now appear to be on improving terms, there has been coopertation on numerous areas but mostly on agriculture, military and tourism. The Cypriot government has also been reported to be making deals with both Israel and Egypt in exploring for oil off the southern Cyprus coast.

Israeli foreign minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] visited Cyprus at the invitation of his Cypriot counterpart when Netanyahu was in Washington for the direct talks with the Palestinian leader. Lieberman and Cyprus foreign minister Kyprianou have met several times this year in an effort to strengthen relations between their countries.

Turkey does not recognize the government of the Republic of Cyprus, stating that the Republic—as established by the Constitution of 1960—ceased to exist when the intercommunal violence that commenced in December 1963 ended Turkish Cypriot participation in the Cypriot government. The attempted coup in July 1974—engineered by Greek Military Junta—was responded to by Turkey by a full military invasion, which resulted in the northern third of the island being occupied by Turkish military forces. This portion of Cyprus unilaterally declared independence in November 1983 as the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), which only Turkey recognizes. Turkey refers to the Republic of Cyprus government as &quot;The Greek Cypriot Administration of Southern Cyprus.&quot;

Cyprus takes the view that the TRNC government is a puppet administration, and thus prefers to negotiate with Turkey over the resolution of the Cyprus Problem. Turkey insists that the TRNC government is the institution that the RoC government must refer to in negotiations.

Cyprus' accession to the European Union has had a negative impact on Turkey in regards to its own accession negotiations. The refusal of Turkey to allow Cypriot-flagged ships to access Turkish ports has resulted in a partial suspension of its accession negotiations.

Cyprus' 1990 application for full [[European Union|EU]] membership caused a storm in the Turkish Cypriot community, which argued that the move required their consent. Following the December 1997 EU Summit decisions on [[EU enlargement]], accession negotiations began 31 March 1998. Cyprus joined the European Union on 1 May 2004. To fulfil its commitment as a member of the European Union, Cyprus withdrew from the Non-Aligned Movement on accession, retaining observer status.

Several Cypriot villages remain enclaved in the areas, and there have been numerous arrests of anti-British demonstrators over the past few years. These activists assert that the UK should not continue to hold territory in another EU state.

[[File:Rice speaks with troops after landing in Larnaca July 24 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Condoleezza Rice]] by US ambassadors in [[Larnaca International Airport]], Cyprus]]
The 1974 invasion of the Turkish army divided the [[island nation]] into two. The internationally recognised Republic of Cyprus currently has effective control in the south of the island (59% of the island's land area) while its area not under its effective control makes up 37% of the island. Turkey utilising the territory occupied during the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus|invasion]] recognizes a declared [[separatism|separatist]]&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hitchens, Uncorking the Genie: The Cyprus Question and Turkey's Military Rule MERIP Reports, No. 122, Turkey under Military Rule (Mar. - Apr., 1984), pp. 25-27, {{doi|10.2307/3011799}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|UDI]] of Turkish Cypriots in 1983, contrary to multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The two territories of the Republic are separated by a [[United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus|United Nations Buffer Zone]] (4% of the island); there are two [[Sovereign Base Areas|UK sovereign base areas]] mostly within the Greek Cypriot portion of the island.

==Illicit drugs==

Cyprus is a minor transit point for [[heroin]] and [[hashish]] via air routes and container traffic to [[Europe]], especially from [[Lebanon]]; some [[cocaine]] transits as well. The island has also been criticised for supposedly lax arms control legislation.

==Cyprus and the Commonwealth of Nations==

Although Cyprus became an independent republic in 1960, Cyprus has been a member state of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since 1961.
