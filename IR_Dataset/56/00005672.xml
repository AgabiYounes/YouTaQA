{{infobox cadmium}}
'''Cadmium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Cd''' and [[atomic number]] 48. This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it demonstrates [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the [[transition metal]]s in [[group 3 element|groups 3]] through [[group 11 element|11]]. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled ''d'' or ''f'' electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann|Hermann]], both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].

Cadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on [[steel]], and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow [[cadmium pigments|pigment]]s, to color [[colored glass|glass]], and to stabilize [[plastic]]. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is [[toxicity|toxic]] (it is specifically listed in the European [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book

One of its few new uses is in [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|cadmium telluride]] [[solar panel]]s.

Although cadmium has no known biological function in higher organisms, a cadmium-dependent [[carbonic anhydrase]] has been found in marine [[diatom]]s.

{{Main|Isotopes of cadmium}}
Naturally occurring cadmium is composed of 8 [[isotope]]s. Two of them are [[radionuclide|radioactive]], and three are expected to [[radioactive decay|decay]] but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is {{val|7.7|e=15|u=y}}) and &lt;sup&gt;116&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is {{val|2.9|e=19|u=y}}). The other three are &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, &lt;sup&gt;108&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and &lt;sup&gt;114&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes&amp;nbsp;– &lt;sup&gt;110&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, and &lt;sup&gt;112&lt;/sup&gt;Cd&amp;nbsp;– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are &lt;sup&gt;109&lt;/sup&gt;Cd with a half-life of 462.6&amp;nbsp;days, and &lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;Cd with a half-life of 53.46&amp;nbsp;hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5&amp;nbsp;hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5&amp;nbsp;minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;113m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 14.1&amp;nbsp;years), &lt;sup&gt;115m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 44.6&amp;nbsp;days), and &lt;sup&gt;117m&lt;/sup&gt;Cd (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1⁄2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 3.36&amp;nbsp;hours).&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;&gt;{{NUBASE 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Cd) to 131.946&amp;nbsp;u (&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112&amp;nbsp;u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element&amp;nbsp;47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element&amp;nbsp;49 ([[indium]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;/&gt;

One isotope of cadmium, &lt;sup&gt;113&lt;/sup&gt;Cd, [[neutron capture|absorbs neutrons]] with high selectivity: With very high probability, neutrons with energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' will be absorbed; those higher than the ''cut-off will be transmitted''. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5&amp;nbsp;eV, and neutrons below that level are deemed [[slow neutron]]s, distinct from intermediate and [[fast neutron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Friedrich Stromeyer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Friedrich Stromeyer]]]]
Cadmium ([[Latin]] ''cadmia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''καδμεία'' meaning &quot;[[Calamine (mineral)|calamine]]&quot;, a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals that was named after the Greek mythological character Κάδμος, [[Cadmus]], the founder of [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]]) was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] simultaneously in 1817 by [[Friedrich Stromeyer]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann]], both in [[Germany]], as an impurity in zinc carbonate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Stromeyer found the new element as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]] (calamine), and, for 100 years, Germany remained the only important producer of the metal. The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, because it was found in this zinc ore. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and reducing the [[cadmium sulfide|sulfide]]. The potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s, but the lack of cadmium limited this application.&lt;ref&gt;

After the industrial scale production of cadmium started in the 1930s and 1940s, the major application of cadmium was the coating of iron and steel to prevent corrosion; in 1944, 62% and in 1956, 59% of the cadmium in the United States was used for [[plating]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;YB1956&quot;&gt;

The stabilizing effect of cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on [[Pvc|PVC]] led to an increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The demand for cadmium in pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and alloys declined as a result of environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating, and only 10% was used for pigments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. The only cadmium [[mineral]] of importance, [[greenockite]] (Cd[[sulfur|S]]), is nearly always associated with [[sphalerite]] (ZnS). This association is caused by geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium, with no geological process likely to separate them. Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct of mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, [[lead]] and [[copper]]. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap.

Zinc metal is produced either by [[smelting]] the oxide with [[carbon]] or by [[electrolysis]] in [[sulfuric acid]]. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by [[vacuum distillation]] if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is [[precipitate]]d from the electrolysis solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifecycle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Applications==
Cadmium is a common component of electric batteries, [[cadmium pigments|pigments]],&lt;ref name=&quot;colors&quot;/&gt; coatings,&lt;ref name=&quot;fff&quot;/&gt; and electroplating.&lt;ref name=&quot;HgCdPb&quot;/&gt;

===Batteries===
[[File:NiCd various.jpg|thumb|Ni-Cd batteries]]
In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], predominantly in [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]]. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]]. The cell consists of a positive [[nickel hydroxide]] [[electrode]] and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an [[alkaline]] [[electrolyte]] ([[potassium hydroxide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Krishnamurthy |first= N. |date= July 2, 2013 |title= Engg. Chemistry, 2/e |location= New York |publisher= PHI Learning Private Limited |pages= 82–83 |isbn= 978-81-203-3666-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union put a limit on cadmium in electronics in 2004 of 0.01%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/;jsessionid=VN9WTn1VHCtTbGnQpnkrTsj2gh68QzJf581nbhhVpJSLNn2sLJsy!-561601488?uri=CELEX:32011L0065|title=EUR-Lex - 32011L0065 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some exceptions, and reduced the limit on cadmium content to 0.002%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:266:0001:0014:en:PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of battery based on cadmium is the [[silver-cadmium battery]].

===Electroplating===
[[File:CdSeqdots.jpg|thumb|A photograph and representative spectrum of [[photoluminescence]] from colloidal CdSe [[quantum dot]]s]]
Cadmium [[electroplating]], consuming 6% of the global production, is used in the aircraft industry to reduce [[corrosion]] of steel components.&lt;ref name=&quot;HgCdPb&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=9yzN-QGag_8C|title = Mercury, Cadmium, Lead: Handbook for Sustainable Heavy Metals Policy and Regulation|first = Michael J.|last = Scoullos|author2 = Vonkeman, Gerrit H.|author3 = Thornton, Iain|author4 = Makuch, Zen| publisher = Springer|date = 2001|isbn = 978-1-4020-0224-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coating is passivated by [[Chromate and dichromate|chromate]] salts.&lt;ref name=&quot;fff&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFulltext/RTO/MP/RTO-MP-025///MP-025-15.pdf |title=Advances to Protective Coatings and their Application to Ageing Aircraft |author=Smith C.J.E. |author2=Higgs M.S. |author3=Baldwin K.R. |date=20 April 1999 |publisher=RTO MP-25 |accessdate=29 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517202722/http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public/ |archivedate=17 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A limitation of cadmium plating is [[hydrogen embrittlement]] of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).

Titanium embrittlement from cadmium-plated tool residues resulted in banishment of those tools (and the implementation of routine tool testing to detect cadmium contamination) in the A-12/SR-71, U-2, and subsequent aircraft programs that use titanium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-12/breaking-through-technological-barriers.html|title = CIA&amp;nbsp;– Breaking Through Technological Barriers&amp;nbsp;– Finding The Right Metal (A-12 program)|date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear fission===
Cadmium is used in the control rods of nuclear reactors, acting as a very effective &quot;neutron poison&quot; to control [[neutron flux]] in [[nuclear fission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HgCdPb&quot;/&gt; When cadmium rods are inserted in the core of a nuclear reactor, cadmium absorbs neutrons, preventing them from creating additional fission events, thus controlling the amount of reactivity. The [[pressurized water reactor]] designed by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] uses an alloy consisting of 80% silver, 15% indium, and 5% cadmium.&lt;ref name=&quot;HgCdPb&quot;/&gt;

=== Televisions ===
[[Quantum dot display|QLED TVs]] have been starting to include cadmium in construction. Some companies have been looking to reduce the environmental impact of human exposure and pollution of the material in televisions during production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/are-quantum-dot-tvs-and-their-toxic-ingredients-actually-better-for-the-environment-35953|title=Are quantum dot TVs – and their toxic ingredients – actually better for the environment?|last=Maynard|first=Andrew|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-07-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cadmium sulfide.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Cadmium sulfide]]
Various cadmium salts are used in paint pigments, with CdS as a [[Cadmium pigments|yellow pigment]] being the most common. [[Cadmium selenide]] is a red pigment, commonly called ''cadmium red''. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — so much so that during production, these colors are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into [[watercolor]]s, [[gouache]]s, [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]], and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a [[barrier cream]] on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin&lt;ref name=&quot;colors&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Cadmium Pigments|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=_OrB0ew_HgAC&amp;pg=PA121|pages = 121–123|isbn = 978-3-527-30363-2|publisher = Wiley-VCH|date = 2005|title =Industrial inorganic pigments|first1 = Gunter|last1 = Buxbaum|first2 = Gerhard|last2 = Pfaff}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.&lt;ref name = &quot;ATSDR&quot;/&gt;

In [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], cadmium was used as heat, light, and weathering stabilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;HgCdPb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=YUkJNI9QYsUC&amp;pg=PA149|page = 149|first = Thomas C.|last = Jennings|isbn = 978-1-56990-379-7| publisher = Hanser Verlag|date = 2005|title = PVC handbook|chapter = Cadmium Environmental Concerns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, cadmium stabilizers have been completely replaced with barium-zinc, calcium-zinc and organo-tin stabilizers. Cadmium is used in many kinds of [[solder]] and bearing alloys, because it has a low [[coefficient of friction]] and fatigue resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;HgCdPb&quot;/&gt; It is also found in some of the lowest-melting [[alloy]]s, such as [[Wood's metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= George Stuart|last1= Brady|first2= George S.|last2= Brady|first3= Henry R.|last3= Clauser|first4 = John A.|last4 = Vaccari|isbn = 978-0-07-136076-0|url = https://books.google.com/?id=vIhvSQLhhMEC&amp;pg=PA425|title = Materials handbook: an encyclopedia for managers, technical professionals, purchasing and production managers, technicians, and supervisors|publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional|date = 2002| page = 425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory uses===
[[File:HeCd laser.jpg|thumb|Violet light from a [[helium]] cadmium metal vapor [[laser]]. The highly [[monochromatic]] color arises from the 441.563 nm transition [[spectral line|line]] of cadmium.]]
Helium–cadmium lasers are a common source of blue-ultraviolet laser light.

Cadmium is a component of some compound [[semiconductor]]s, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and [[cadmium telluride]], used for light detection and [[solar cell]]s. [[HgCdTe]] is sensitive to [[infrared]]&lt;ref name=&quot;HgCdPb&quot;/&gt; light and can be used as an infrared detector, motion detector, or switch in remote control devices.

In molecular biology, cadmium is used to block voltage-dependent calcium channels from fluxing calcium ions, as well as in [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] research to stimulate [[proteasome]]-dependent degradation of [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|Hif-1α]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = European Journal of Biochemistry|volume = 267|issue = 13|pages = 4198–4204|date = 2000|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01453.x|title = Cadmium blocks hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1-mediated response to hypoxia by stimulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha|first = Chun Y.

Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances]] (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=European Commission Decision of 12 October 2006 amending, for the purposes of adapting to technical progress, the Annex to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards exemptions for applications of lead and cadmium (notified under document number C(2006) 4790) |date=14 October 2006|publisher=Journal of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:283:0048:0049:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans.&lt;ref&gt;IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 58&lt;/ref&gt; Although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Cadmium exposure is a risk factor associated with a large number of illnesses including kidney disease,&lt;ref name=&quot;zn-cd.diseases&quot; /&gt; early atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medinewsdirect.com/?p=704 Cadmium Exposure can Induce Early Atherosclerotic Changes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315135304/http://www.medinewsdirect.com/?p=704 |date=15 March 2012 }}, Medinews Direct, 7 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although studies show a significant correlation between cadmium exposure and occurrence of disease in human populations, a necessary molecular mechanism has not been identified. One hypothesis holds that cadmium is an [[endocrine disruptor]] and some experimental studies have shown that it can interact with different [[Hormone|hormonal]] signaling pathways. For example, cadmium can bind to the [[estrogen receptor]] alpha,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The [[tobacco plant]] readily absorbs and accumulates [[heavy metals]] such as cadmium from the surrounding soil into its leaves. These are readily absorbed into the user's body following smoke inhalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2011.12.027|pmid=22284492|title=Preconcentration and determination of copper in tobacco leaves samples by using a minicolumn of sisal fiber (Agave sisalana) loaded with Alizarin fluorine blue by FAAS|journal=Talanta|volume=89|issue=1|pages=276–279|year=2012|last1=Dias|first1=Fábio de S.|last2=Bonsucesso|first2=Josemário S.|last3=Oliveira|first3=Lucas C.|last4=Dos Santos|first4=Walter N.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. An estimated 10% of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. Absorption of cadmium through the lungs is more effective than through the gut, and as much as 50% of the cadmium inhaled in cigarette smoke may be absorbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1146/annurev.pu.04.050183.002055|journal = Annual Review of Public Health|volume = 4|pmid = 6860444|pages = 367–73|date = 1983|title = Cadmium|first = L.|last = Friberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On average, cadmium concentrations in the blood of smokers is 4 times 5 times greater and in the kidney, 2–3 times greater than non-smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from [[passive smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health|volume = 24|pages = 11–51|date = 1998|title = Health effects of cadmium exposure—a review of the literature and a risk estimate|first = L.|last = Jarup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a non-smoking population, food is the greatest source of exposure. High quantities of cadmium can be found in [[crustacean]]s, [[Mollusca|mollusks]], [[offal]], and [[algae]] products. However, grains, vegetables, and starchy roots and tubers are consumed in much greater quantity in the US, and are the source of the greatest dietary exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;efsa.europa.eu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2551|title=Cadmium dietary exposure in the European population - European Food Safety Authority|website=www.efsa.europa.eu|date=2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most plants bio-accumulate metal toxins like Cd, and when composted to form organic fertilizers yield a product which can often contain high amounts (e.g., over 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg) of metal toxins for every kilo of fertilizer. Fertilizers made from animal dung (e.g., cow dung) or urban waste can contain similar amounts of Cd. The Cd added to the soil from fertilizers (rock phosphates or organic fertilizers) become bio-available and toxic only if the soil pH is low (i.e., acidic soils).

Zn, Cu, Ca, and Fe ions, and selenium with vitamin C are used to treat Cd intoxication, though it is not easily reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;zn-cd.diseases&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arltma.com/Articles/CadmiumToxDoc.htm|title=ARL : Cadmium Toxicity|website=www.arltma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulations===
Because of the adverse effects of cadmium on the environment and human health, the supply and use of cadmium is restricted in Europe under the [[REACH Regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/index.htm EUR-Lex]. Eur-lex.europa.eu (18 April 2011). Retrieved on 5 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain specifies that 2.5 μg/kg body weight is a tolerable weekly intake for humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;efsa.europa.eu&quot;/&gt; The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has declared 7 μg/kg bw to be the provisional tolerable weekly intake level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jeceval/jec_297.htm|title=JECFA Evaluations-CADMIUM-|website=www.inchem.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for cadmium at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.005 ppm. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has not set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) and has designated cadmium as a known human carcinogen. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) level for cadmium is 9&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0087}}&lt;/ref&gt;
