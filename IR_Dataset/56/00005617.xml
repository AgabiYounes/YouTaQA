==Signs and symptoms==
&lt;!--
[http://pathology.mc.duke.edu/neuropath/CNSlecture2/cjd.jpg] The spongiform look of the cortex cross-section is characteristic of CJD. --&gt;
The first symptom of CJD is usually rapidly progressive [[dementia]], leading to [[Amnesia|memory loss]], [[Personality psychology|personality]] changes, and [[hallucination]]s. [[Myoclonus]] (jerky movements) typically occurs in 90% of cases, but may be absent at initial onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reference.medscape.com/viewarticle/881806_3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706181402/http://reference.medscape.com/viewarticle/881806_3|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-07-06|title=A 49-Year-Old Man With Forgetfulness and Gait Impairment|website=reference.medscape.com/viewarticle/881806_3|access-date=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other frequently occurring features include [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[paranoia]], [[obsessive-compulsive]] symptoms, and [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH. (2012) Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice. In: Neurology in Clinical Practice, 6th Edition. Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J (eds.) Butterworth Heinemann. April 12, 2012. {{ISBN|1437704344|978-1437704341}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is accompanied by physical problems such as [[Speech communication|speech]] impairment, balance and coordination dysfunction ([[ataxia]]), changes in [[gait (human)|gait]], and rigid [[Human position|posture]]. In most people with CJD, these symptoms are accompanied by [[Dyskinesia|involuntary movements]]. The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown P, Cathala F, Castaigne P, Gajdusek DC | title = Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: clinical analysis of a consecutive series of 230 neuropathologically verified cases | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 597–602 | date = November 1986 | pmid = 3539001 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410200507 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most victims die six months after initial symptoms appear, often of [[pneumonia]] due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of people with CJD survive for two or more years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambetti&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Gambetti|first=Pierluigi|title=Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease (CJD)|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec06/ch090/ch090b.html|publisher=The Merck Manuals: Online Medical Library|access-date=2011-06-04|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604015739/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/sec06/ch090/ch090b.html|archive-date=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symptoms of CJD are caused by the progressive [[cell death|death]] of the brain's [[neuron|nerve cells]], which are associated with the build-up of abnormal prion proteins forming in the brain. When brain tissue from a person with CJD is examined under a [[microscope]], many tiny holes can be seen where the nerve cells have died. Parts of the brain may resemble a sponge where the prion were infecting the areas of the brain.

==Cause==
CJD, is a type of [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathy]] (TSE), which are caused by [[prion]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2019/&gt; Prions are proteins that occur normally in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). These proteins, once misfolded, are thought to affect signaling processes, damaging neurons and resulting in degeneration that causes the spongiform appearance in the affected brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Fundamentals of Pathology| last = Sattar | first = Husain A. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-xRtAEACAAJ | name-list-format = vanc |page = 189| isbn = 9780983224631 | year = 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CJD prion is dangerous because it promotes [[Protein folding|refolding]] of native prion protein into the diseased state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clarke AR, Jackson GS, Collinge J | title = The molecular biology of prion propagation | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume = 356 | issue = 1406 | pages = 185–95 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11260799 | pmc = 1088424 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2000.0764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of misfolded protein molecules will increase [[exponential growth|exponentially]] and the process leads to a large quantity of insoluble protein in affected [[cell (biology)|cells]]. This mass of misfolded proteins disrupts neuronal cell function and causes cell death. Mutations in the gene for the prion protein can cause a misfolding of the dominantly alpha helical regions into beta pleated sheets. This change in conformation disables the ability of the protein to undergo digestion. Once the prion is transmitted, the defective proteins invade the brain and induce other prion protein molecules to misfold in a self-sustaining [[feedback loop]]. These neurodegenerative diseases are commonly called ''[[prion disease]]s''.

People can also develop CJD because they carry a mutation of the gene that codes for the prion protein (''PRNP''). This occurs in only 5–10% of all CJD cases. In sporadic cases the misfolding of the prion protein is a process which is hypothesized to occur as a result of the effects of aging on cellular machinery, explaining why the disease often appears later in life.&lt;ref name=NIH2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; An EU study determined that &quot;87% of cases were sporadic, 8% genetic, 5% iatrogenic and less than 1% variant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Will RG, Alperovitch A, Poser S, Pocchiari M, Hofman A, Mitrova E, de Silva R, D'Alessandro M, Delasnerie-Laupretre N, Zerr I, van Duijn C | title = Descriptive epidemiology of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in six European countries, 1993-1995.

===Transmission===
[[File:Awv235f2p.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MRI of iCJD because of growth hormone]]
The defective protein can be transmitted by contaminated harvested human brain products, [[cornea]]l grafts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armitage WJ, Tullo AB, Ironside JW | title = Risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease transmission by ocular surgery and tissue transplantation | journal = Eye | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1926–30 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19136921 | doi = 10.1038/eye.2008.381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dura mater|dural]] grafts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esmonde T, Lueck CJ, Symon L, Duchen LW, Will RG | title = Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and lyophilised dura mater grafts: report of two cases | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 56 | issue = 9 | pages = 999–1000 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8410042 | pmc = 489736 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.56.9.999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[electrode]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernoulli C, Siegfried J, Baumgartner G, Regli F, Rabinowicz T, Gajdusek DC, Gibbs CJ | title = Danger of accidental person-to-person transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease by surgery | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8009 | pages = 478–9 | date = February 1977 | pmid = 65575 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(77)91958-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; implants and human growth hormone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown P, Brandel JP, Sato T, Nakamura Y, MacKenzie J, Will RG, Ladogana A, Pocchiari M, Leschek EW, Schonberger LB | title = Iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, final assessment | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 901–7 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22607808 | pmc = 3358170 | doi = 10.3201/eid1806.120116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be familial (fCJD); or it may appear without clear risk factors (sporadic form: sCJD). In the familial form, a [[mutation]] has occurred in the [[gene]] for PrP, ''[[PRNP]]'', in that family. All types of CJD are transmissible irrespective of how they occur in the person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown P, Gibbs CJ, Rodgers-Johnson P, Asher DM, Sulima MP, Bacote A, Goldfarb LG, Gajdusek DC | title = Human spongiform encephalopathy: the National Institutes of Health series of 300 cases of experimentally transmitted disease | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 513–29 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8179297 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410350504 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that humans can contract the variant form of the disease by eating food from animals infected with [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE), the bovine form of TSE also known as ''mad cow disease''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collinge J, Sidle KC, Meads J, Ironside J, Hill AF | title = Molecular analysis of prion strain variation and the aetiology of 'new variant' CJD | journal = Nature | volume = 383 | issue = 6602 | pages = 685–90 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8878476 | doi = 10.1038/383685a0 | bibcode = 1996Natur.383..685C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cannibalism]] has also been implicated as a transmission mechanism for abnormal prions, causing the disease known as [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], once found primarily among women and children of the [[Fore people]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collinge J, Whitfield J, McKintosh E, Beck J, Mead S, Thomas DJ, Alpers MP | title = Kuru in the 21st century--an acquired human prion disease with very long incubation periods | journal = Lancet | volume = 367 | issue = 9528 | pages = 2068–74 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16798390 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(06)68930-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the men of the tribe ate the body of the deceased, women and children consumed other parts, such as the brain, and were more likely than men to contract kuru from infected tissue.

Prions, the [[infectious agent]] of CJD, may not be inactivated by means of routine [[surgical instrument]] [[Autoclave|sterilization]] procedures. The [[World Health Organization]] and the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend that instrumentation used in such cases be immediately destroyed after use; short of destruction, it is recommended that heat and chemical decontamination be used in combination to process instruments that come in contact with high-infectivity tissues. No cases of iatrogenic transmission of CJD have been reported subsequent to the adoption of current sterilization procedures, or since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Questions and Answers: Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Infection-Control Practices|work =Infection Control Practices/CJD (Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease, Classic)|publisher =Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date =January 4, 2007|url =https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/cjd/qa_cjd_infection_control.htm#sterilization|access-date =2007-06-09|url-status =dead|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071017153845/http://cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/cjd/qa_cjd_infection_control.htm#sterilization#sterilization|archive-date =2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =WHO Infection Control Guidelines for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies|publisher =World Health Organization: Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control|date =26 March 1999|url =http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/bse/WHO_CDS_CSR_APH_2000_3/en/|access-date =2007-06-09|url-status =live|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070518054719/http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/bse/WHO_CDS_CSR_APH_2000_3/en/|archive-date =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDonnell G, Burke P | title = The challenge of prion decontamination | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 36 | issue = 9 | pages = 1152–4 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12715310 | doi = 10.1086/374668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Copper]]-[[hydrogen peroxide]] has been suggested as an alternative to the current recommendation of [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[sodium hypochlorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Solassol J, Pastore M, Crozet C, Perrier V, Lehmann S | title = A novel copper-hydrogen peroxide formulation for prion decontamination | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 194 | issue = 6 | pages = 865–9 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16941355 | doi = 10.1086/506947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thermal depolymerization]] also destroys prions in infected organic and inorganic matter, since the process chemically attacks protein at the molecular level, although more effective and practical methods involve destruction by combinations of detergents and enzymes similar to biological washing powders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jackson GS, McKintosh E, Flechsig E, Prodromidou K, Hirsch P, Linehan J, Brandner S, Clarke AR, Weissmann C, Collinge J | title = An enzyme-detergent method for effective prion decontamination of surgical steel | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 86 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 869–78 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15722550 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.80484-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood products===
As of 2018, evidence suggests that while there may be prions in the blood of individuals with vCJD, this is not the case in individuals with sporadic CJD.&lt;ref name=NIH2003/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

Testing for CJD has historically been problematic, due to nonspecific nature of early symptoms and difficulty in safely obtaining brain tissue for confirmation. The diagnosis may initially be suspected in a person with rapidly progressing dementia, particularly when they are also found with the characteristic medical [[Medical sign|signs]] and [[symptom]]s such as [[Myoclonus|involuntary muscle jerking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sattar|first=Hussain A. |title=Fundamentals of Pathology|publisher=Pathoma LLC.|location=Chicago |page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ataxia|difficulty with coordination/balance and walking]], and visual disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease-Fact-Sheet|title=Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease Fact Sheet {{!}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further testing can support the diagnosis and may include:
* [[Electroencephalography]] – may have characteristic generalized periodic sharp wave pattern.

=== Histopathology ===
[[Image:SpongiformChangeCJD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Spongiform change in CJD]]
Testing of tissue remains the most definitive way of confirming the diagnosis of CJD, although it must be recognized that even biopsy is not always conclusive.

In one-third of people with sporadic CJD, deposits of &quot;prion protein (scrapie),&quot; [[PrpSc|PrP&lt;SUP&gt;Sc&lt;/SUP&gt;]], can be found in the [[skeletal muscle]] and/or the [[spleen]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Diagnosis of vCJD can be supported by biopsy of the tonsils, which harbour significant amounts of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;; however, [[biopsy]] of brain tissue is the definitive diagnostic test for all other forms of prion disease. Due to its invasiveness, biopsy will not be done if clinical suspicion is sufficiently high or low. A negative biopsy does not rule out CJD, since it may predominate in a specific part of the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Sternberg's Diagnostic Surgical Pathology, 5th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic [[histologic]] appearance is spongiform change in the gray matter: the presence of many round vacuoles from one to 50 micrometers in the [[neuropil]], in all six cortical layers in the cerebral cortex or with diffuse involvement of the cerebellar molecular layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liberski, P.P.|date=2004|title=Spongiform change – an electron microscopic view.|url=|journal=Folia Neuropathologica|volume=42, suppl B|pages=59–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; These vacuoles appear glassy or eosinophilic and may coalesce. Neuronal loss and gliosis are also seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/CNS/CNSDG.html|title=Pathology of Degenerative CNS Diseases|website=library.med.utah.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaques of amyloid-like material can be seen in the neocortex in some cases of CJD.

However, extra-neuronal [[vacuolization]] can also be seen in other disease states. Diffuse cortical vacuolization occurs in [[Alzheimer's disease]], and superficial cortical vacuolization occurs in [[ischemia]] and [[frontotemporal dementia]]. These vacuoles appear clear and punched-out. Larger vacuoles encircling neurons, vessels, and [[glia]] are a possible processing artifact.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

{{Anchor|Outcomes}}
The condition is universally fatal.

== Epidemiology ==
Although CJD is the most common human [[prion disease]], it is still believed to be rare, estimated to occur in about one out of every one million people every year. However, an [[autopsy]] study published in 1989 and others suggest that between 3–13% of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's were actually [[misdiagnosis|misdiagnosed]] and instead had CJD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Mad-Cow-Linked-to-thousands-of-CJD-cases/47861072816318/ |title=Mad Cow: Linked to thousands of CJD cases? |access-date=2016-07-20 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808040732/http://www.upi.com/Mad-Cow-Linked-to-thousands-of-CJD-cases/47861072816318/ |archive-date=2016-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- unsound reference. data not confirmed. --&gt; Presumably, those afflicted have become infected through prion-contaminated beef from cattle with subclinical atypical BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), which has a very long incubation period. CJD usually affects people aged 45–75, most commonly appearing in people between the ages of 60–65. The exception to this is the more recently recognised 'variant' CJD (vCJD), which occurs in younger people.

[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] monitors the occurrence of CJD in the United States through periodic reviews of national mortality data. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]:
* CJD occurs worldwide at a rate of about 1 case per million population per year.
* On the basis of mortality surveillance from 1979 to 1994, the annual [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of CJD remained stable at approximately 1 case per [[million]] people in the United States.
* In the United States, CJD deaths among people younger than 30 years of age are extremely rare (fewer than five deaths per [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] per year&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VCJD1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = vCJD (Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease) |url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/vcjd/factsheet_nvcjd.htm |publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date = 2007-01-04 |access-date = 2009-06-20 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090507193309/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/vcjd/factsheet_nvcjd.htm |archive-date = 2009-05-07 }}

== History ==
The disease was first described by German [[neurologist]] [[Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt]] in 1920 and shortly afterward by [[Alfons Maria Jakob]], giving it the name Creutzfeldt–Jakob. Some of the clinical findings described in their first papers do not match current criteria for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and it has been speculated that at least two of the people in initial studies were suffering from a different ailment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Ironside JW |date=1996 |chapter=Neuropathological diagnosis of human prion disease; morphological studies|title=Prion Diseases | veditors = Baker HF, Ridley RM |volume=3|pages=35–57 |isbn=978-0-89603-342-9|doi=10.1385/0896033422}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early description of familial CJD stems from the German psychiatrist and neurologist [[Friedrich Meggendorfer]] (1880–1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meggendorfer F | year = 1930 | title = Klinische und genealogische Beobachtungen bei einem Fall von spastischer Pseudokosklerose Jakobs | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für die Gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie | volume = 128 | issue = 1–4| pages = 337–41 | doi=10.1007/bf02864269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gambetti P, Kong Q, Zou W, Parchi P, Chen SG | title = Sporadic and familial CJD: classification and characterisation | journal = British Medical Bulletin | volume = 66 | pages = 213–39 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14522861 | doi = 10.1093/bmb/66.1.213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 1997 counted more than 100 cases worldwide of transmissible CJD and new cases continued to appear at the time.&lt;ref name=ricketts&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ricketts MN, Cashman NR, Stratton EE, ElSaadany S | title = Is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease transmitted in blood? | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–63 | date = 1997 | pmid = 9204296 | pmc = 2627622 | doi = 10.3201/eid0302.970208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first report of suspected [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] CJD was published in 1974. Animal experiments showed that corneas of infected animals could transmit CJD, and the causative agent spreads along visual pathways. A second case of CJD associated with a corneal transplant was reported without details. In 1977, CJD transmission caused by silver electrodes previously used in the brain of a person with CJD was first reported. Transmission occurred despite decontamination of the electrodes with ethanol and formaldehyde. Retrospective studies identified four other cases likely of similar cause. The rate of transmission from a single contaminated instrument is unknown, although it is not 100%. In some cases, the exposure occurred weeks after the instruments were used on a person with CJD.&lt;ref name=ricketts/&gt; In the 1980s it was discovered that [[Lyodura]], a dura mater transplant product was shown to transmit Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease from the donor to the recipient. This led to the product being banned in Canada but it was used in other countries such as Japan until 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ae R, Hamaguchi T, Nakamura Y, Yamada M, Tsukamoto T, Mizusawa H, Belay ED, Schonberger LB | title = Update: Dura Mater Graft-Associated Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease - Japan, 1975-2017 | journal = MMWR.

A review article published in 1979 indicated that 25 dura mater cases had occurred by that date in Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name=ricketts/&gt;

By 1985, a series of case reports in the United States showed that when injected, cadaver-extracted pituitary [[human growth hormone]] could transmit CJD to humans.&lt;ref name=ricketts/&gt;

In 1992, it was recognized that human [[gonadotropin]] administered by injection could also transmit CJD from person to person.&lt;ref name=ricketts/&gt;

[[Stanley B. Prusiner]] of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF) was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine]] in 1997 &quot;for his discovery of Prions—a new biological principle of infection&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1997/ | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1997: Stanley B.

In January 2007, she and her colleagues reported that they had found a [[virus]]-like particle in naturally and experimentally infected animals. &quot;The high infectivity of comparable, isolated virus-like particles that show no intrinsic PrP by antibody labeling, combined with their loss of infectivity when nucleic acid–protein complexes are disrupted, make it likely that these 25-nm particles are the causal TSE virions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manuelidis2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manuelidis L, Yu ZX, Barquero N, Banquero N, Mullins B | title = Cells infected with scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease agents produce intracellular 25-nm virus-like particles | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 1965–70 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17267596 | pmc = 1794316 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0610999104 | bibcode = 2007PNAS..104.1965M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
There have been ten cases of healthcare-acquired CJD (iatrogenic or ICJD) in Australia. They consist of five deaths following treatment with pituitary extract hormone for either infertility or short stature, with no further cases since 1991. The five other deaths were caused by dura grafting during brain surgery, where the covering of the brain was repaired. There have been no other known healthcare-acquired ICJD deaths in Australia.

However, the wife of Australian Reporter [[Mike Willesee]] died of the sporadic form of the disease in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ideas.health.vic.gov.au/diseases/cjd-facts.asp Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease (CJD) – the facts.] Infectious Diseases Epidemiology &amp; Surveillance – Department of Health, Victoria, Australia {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628234351/http://ideas.health.vic.gov.au/diseases/cjd-facts.asp |date=2015-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/hospital-failed-to-diagnose-actress-20080415-gds9k0.html|title=Hospital 'failed' to diagnose actress|first=Natasha Wallace Health|last=Reporter|date=15 April 2008|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A case was reported in 1989 in a 25-year-old man from New Zealand, who also received [[dura mater]] transplant.&lt;ref name=ricketts/&gt; Five New Zealanders have been confirmed to have died of the sporadic form of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/7962582/Mad-cow-link-in-hunters-death|title=Mad cow link in hunter's death|website=Stuff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In 1988, there was a confirmed death from CJD of a person from [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]. [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] believed the person acquired the disease from a surgical instrument at a [[podiatrist]]'s office.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In September 2013, another person in Manchester was posthumously determined to have died of the disease. The person had undergone brain surgery at [[Catholic Medical Center]] three months before his death, and a surgical probe used in the procedure was subsequently reused in other operations. Public health officials identified thirteen people at three hospitals who may have been exposed to the disease through the contaminated probe, but said the risk of anyone's contracting CJD is &quot;extremely low.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autopsy confirms rare brain disease in NH patient|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/23489308/2013/09/20/autopsy-confirms-rare-brain-disease-in-nh-patient|publisher=MyFoxBoston|access-date=20 September 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055822/http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/23489308/2013/09/20/autopsy-confirms-rare-brain-disease-in-nh-patient|archive-date=21 September 2013|date=2013-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NH Patient Likely Died of Rare Brain Disease|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/surgical-gear-quarantined-over-rare-brain-disease|publisher=AP|access-date=5 September 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908120727/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/surgical-gear-quarantined-over-rare-brain-disease|archive-date=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite news|last=Kowalczyk |first=Liz |title=5 patients at Cape hospital at risk for rare brain disease |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/09/05/cape-cod-hospital-patients-possibly-exposed-brain-disease/CwGauqzFxf6Om8agTvUoAJ/story.html |work=Boston Globe |access-date=25 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909210818/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2013/09/05/cape-cod-hospital-patients-possibly-exposed-brain-disease/CwGauqzFxf6Om8agTvUoAJ/story.html |archive-date=9 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, former speaker of the [[Utah House of Representatives]] [[Rebecca D.

== Research ==
=== Diagnosis ===
* In 2010, a team from New York described detection of PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in sheep's blood, even when initially present at only one part in one hundred billion (10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;) in sheep's brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called [[surround optical fiber immunoassay]] (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Treatment ===
* [[Pentosan polysulphate]] (PPS) was thought to slow the progression of the disease, and may have contributed to the longer than expected survival of the seven people studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bone |first=Ian |title=Intraventricular Pentosan Polysulphate in Human Prion Diseases: A study of Experience in the United Kingdom |publisher=Medical Research Council |date=12 July 2006 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12667709 |access-date=2012-11-09 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103131854/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-12667709 |archive-date=3 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CJD Therapy Advisory Group to the UK Health Departments advises that data are not sufficient to support claims that pentosan polysulphate is an effective treatment and suggests that further research in animal models is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Use of Pentosan Polysulphate in the treatment of, or prevention of, vCJD |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Policyandguidance/Healthandsocialcaretopics/CJD/CJDgeneralinformation/DH_4031039 |publisher=Department of Health:CJD Therapy Advisory Group |access-date=2007-10-30 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705213245/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/PolicyAndGuidance/HealthAndSocialCareTopics/CJD/CJDGeneralInformation/DH_4031039 |archive-date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 review of the treatment of 26 people with PPS finds no proof of efficacy because of the lack of accepted objective criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rainov NG, Tsuboi Y, Krolak-Salmon P, Vighetto A, Doh-Ura K | title = Experimental treatments for human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies: is there a role for pentosan polysulfate? | journal = Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 713–26 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17477808 | doi = 10.1517/14712598.7.5.713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of [[RNA interference]] to slow the progression of [[scrapie]] has been studied in [[mice]]. The RNA blocks production of the protein that the CJD process transforms into prions.

* Both [[amphotericin B]] and [[doxorubicin]] have been investigated as treatments for CJD, but as yet there is no strong evidence that either drug is effective in stopping the disease. Further study has been taken with other medical drugs, but none are effective. However, anticonvulsants and anxiolytic agents, such as [[valproate]] or a [[benzodiazepine]], may be administered to relieve associated symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gambetti&quot; /&gt;
* [[Quinacrine]], a medicine originally created for [[malaria]], has been evaluated as a treatment for CJD. The efficacy of quinacrine was assessed in a rigorous clinical trial in the UK and the results were published in Lancet Neurology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collinge J, Gorham M, Hudson F, Kennedy A, Keogh G, Pal S, Rossor M, Rudge P, Siddique D, Spyer M, Thomas D, Walker S, Webb T, Wroe S, Darbyshire J | title = Safety and efficacy of quinacrine in human prion disease (PRION-1 study): a patient-preference trial | journal = The Lancet.
