'''Chromium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Cr''' and [[atomic number]] 24. It is the first element in [[Group 6 element|group 6]]. It is a steely-grey, [[Luster (mineralogy)|lustrous]], hard and brittle [[transition metal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Brandes|first1 = EA|last2 = Greenaway|first2 = HT|last3 = Stone|first3 = HEN|date = 1956|title = Ductility in Chromium|journal = Nature|volume = 178|issue = 4533|doi = 10.1038/178587a0|page = 587|bibcode = 1956Natur.178..587B|url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0518f60d575607e9d98bd32622b764018899682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium is the main additive in [[stainless steel]], to which it adds anti-corrosive properties. Chromium is also highly valued as a [[metal]] that is able to be highly [[polishing|polished]] while resisting [[tarnish]]ing. Polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the [[visible spectrum]], with almost 90% of [[infrared|infrared light]] being reflected.&lt;ref name = &quot;NIST specular reflection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Coblentz|first1 = WW|last2 = Stair|first2 = R|title = Reflecting power of beryllium, chromium, and several other metals|url = https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/2/jresv2n2p343_A2b.pdf|website = National Institute of Standards and Technology|publisher = NIST Publications|accessdate = 11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the element is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word χρῶμα, ''chrōma'', meaning [[color]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dxrw%3Dma χρῶμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.

[[Ferrochromium]] alloy is commercially produced from [[chromite]] by [[silicothermic]] or [[aluminothermic reaction]]s and chromium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]] processes followed by reduction with [[carbon]] and then [[aluminium]]. Chromium metal is of high value for its high [[corrosion]] resistance and [[hardness]]. A major development in steel production was the discovery that steel could be made highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form [[stainless steel]]. Stainless steel and [[chrome plating]] ([[electroplating]] with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.

In the United States, [[trivalent]] chromium (Cr(III)) [[ion]] is considered an [[essential nutrient]] in humans for [[insulin]], [[sugar]] and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ods&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Chromium-HealthProfessional/#h2 | title=Chromium | publisher=Office of Dietary Supplements, US National Institutes of Health | date=2016 | accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, the [[European Food Safety Authority]], acting for the European Union, concluded that there was not sufficient evidence for chromium to be recognized as essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/3845|title = Scientific Opinion on Dietary Reference Values for chromium|date = 18 September 2014|accessdate = 20 March 2018|publisher = [[European Food Safety Authority]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While chromium metal and Cr(III) ions are not considered toxic, [[hexavalent chromium]] (Cr(VI)) is both toxic and [[carcinogenic]]. Abandoned chromium production sites often require [[Environmental remediation|environmental cleanup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=EPA |title=Abandoned Mine Site Characterization and Cleanup Handbook |url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/2000_08_pdfs_amscch.pdf |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=8 September 2019 |date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium is the fourth [[transition metal]] found on the periodic table, and has an electron configuration of [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[argon|Ar]]] 3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is also the first element in the periodic table whose ground-state electron configuration violates the [[Aufbau principle]]. This occurs again later in the periodic table with other elements and their electron configurations, such as [[copper]], [[niobium]], and [[molybdenum]].&lt;ref name = &quot;CasaXPS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = The Nature of X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra|url=http://www.casaxps.com/help_manual/XPSInformation/IntroductiontoXPS.htm|website= CasaXPS|publisher = Casa Software Ltd.|date = 2005|accessdate = 10 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs because electrons in the same orbital repel each other due to their like charges. In the previous elements, the energetic cost of promoting an electron to the next higher energy level is too great to compensate for that released by lessening inter-electronic repulsion. However, in the 3d transition metals, the energy gap between the 3d and the next-higher 4s subshell is very small, and because the 3d subshell is more compact than the 4s subshell, inter-electron repulsion is smaller between 4s electrons than between 3d electrons. This lowers the energetic cost of promotion and increases the energy released by it, so that the promotion becomes energetically feasible and one or even two electrons are always promoted to the 4s subshell. (Similar promotions happen for every transition metal atom but one, [[palladium]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwarz |first1=W. H. Eugen |date=April 2010 |title=The Full Story of the Electron Configurations of the Transition Elements |url=http://www.quimica.ufpr.br/edulsa/cq115/artigos/The_full_story_of_the_electron_configurations_of_the_transition_elements.pdf |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=444–8 |doi=10.1021/ed8001286 |access-date=9 November 2018|bibcode=2010JChEd..87..444S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium is the first element in the 3d series where the 3d electrons start to sink into the [[atomic nucleus|inert core]]; they thus contribute less to [[metallic bonding]], and hence the melting and boiling points and the [[enthalpy of atomisation]] of chromium are lower than those of the preceding element [[vanadium]]. Chromium(VI) is a strong [[oxidising agent]] in contrast to the [[molybdenum]](VI) and [[tungsten]](VI) oxides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood1004&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 1004–5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulk ===
[[File:Chromium.jpg|thumb|left|Sample of pure chromium metal]]
Chromium is extremely [[hardness|hard]], and is the third hardest element behind [[carbon]] ([[diamond]]) and [[boron]]. Its [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] is 8.5, which means that it can scratch samples of [[quartz]] and [[topaz]], but can be scratched by [[corundum]]. Chromium is highly resistant to [[tarnish]]ing, which makes it useful as a metal that preserves its outermost layer from [[corrosion|corroding]], unlike other metals such as [[copper]], [[magnesium]], and [[aluminium]].

Chromium has a [[melting point]] of 1907&amp;nbsp;°C (3465&amp;nbsp;°F), which is relatively low compared to the majority of transition metals. However, it still has the second highest melting point out of all the [[Period 4]] elements, being topped by [[vanadium]] by 3&amp;nbsp;°C (5&amp;nbsp;°F) at 1910&amp;nbsp;°C (3470&amp;nbsp;°F). The [[boiling point]] of 2671&amp;nbsp;°C (4840&amp;nbsp;°F), however, is comparatively lower, having the third lowest boiling point out of the [[Period 4]] [[transition metal]]s alone behind [[manganese]] and [[zinc]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The melting/boiling point of transition metals are usually higher compared to the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and nonmetals, which is why the range of elements compared to chromium differed between comparisons&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical resistivity]] of chromium at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is 125 [[ohm|nanoohm]]-[[meter]]s.

Chromium has a high [[specular reflection]] in comparison to other transition metals. In [[infrared]], at 425 [[micrometer|μm]], chromium has a maximum reflectance of about 72%, reducing to a minimum of 62% at 750 [[micrometer|μm]] before rising again to 90% of 4000 [[micrometer|μm]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NIST specular reflection&quot;/&gt; When chromium is used in [[stainless steel]] alloys and [[polishing|polished]], the specular reflection decreases with the inclusion of additional metals, yet is still high in comparison with other alloys. Between 40% and 60% of the visible spectrum is reflected from polished stainless steel.&lt;ref name = &quot;NIST specular reflection&quot;/&gt; The explanation on why chromium displays such a high turnout of reflected [[photon]] waves in general, especially the 90% in infrared, can be attributed to chromium's magnetic properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU infrared&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Lind|first1 = Michael Acton|title = The infrared reflectivity of chromium and chromium-aluminium alloys|url = https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6216&amp;context=rtd|website = Iowa State University Digital Repository|publisher = Iowa State University|date = 1972|access-date = 4 November 2018|bibcode = 1972PhDT........54L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium has unique magnetic properties in the sense that chromium is the only elemental solid which shows [[antiferromagnetic]] ordering at room temperature (and below). Above 38&amp;nbsp;°C, its magnetic ordering changes to [[paramagnetic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fawcett&quot;/&gt; The antiferromagnetic properties, which cause the chromium atoms to temporarily [[ionization|ionize]] and bond with themselves, are present because the body-centric cubic's magnetic properties are disproportionate to the [[Crystal structure|lattice periodicity]]. This is due to the fact that the magnetic moments at the cube's corners and the cube centers are not equal, but are still antiparallel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU infrared&quot;/&gt; From here, the frequency-dependent [[relative permittivity]] of chromium, deriving from [[Maxwell's equations]] in conjunction with chromium's [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetivity]], leaves chromium with a high infrared and visible light reflectance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU optical&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Bos|first1 = Laurence William|title =Optical properties of chromium-manganese alloys|url = https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4816&amp;context=rtd|website = Iowa State University Digital Repository|publisher = Iowa State University|date = 1969|access-date = 4 November 2018|bibcode = 1969PhDT.......118B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Passivation ====
Chromium metal left standing in air is [[passivation (chemistry)|passivated]], i.e. forms a thin, protective, surface layer of oxide. This layer has a [[spinel]] structure, only a few atomic layers thick. It is very dense and inhibits the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. In contrast, iron forms a more porous oxide through which oxygen can migrate, causing continued [[rust]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The oxidation of alloys|last = Wallwork|first = GR|date = 1976|journal = Reports on Progress in Physics|volume = 39|pages = 401–485|doi = 10.1088/0034-4885/39/5/001|issue = 5|bibcode = 1976RPPh...39..401W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with [[oxidizing acid]]s like [[nitric acid]]. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong [[reducing agent]] that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.&lt;ref name = &quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

Chromium, unlike such metals as iron and nickel, does not suffer from [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. However, it does suffer from nitrogen [[embrittlement]], reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides at the high temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=CGMrAAAAYAAJ|title = High-temperature oxidation-resistant coatings: coatings for protection from oxidation of superalloys, refractory metals, and graphite|author = National Research Council (U.S.).

=== Isotopes ===
{{Main|Isotopes of chromium}}
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s; &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and &lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;Cr, with &lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr being the most abundant (83.789% [[natural abundance]]). 19 [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with a [[half-life]] of (more than) 1.8{{e|17}} years, and &lt;sup&gt;51&lt;/sup&gt;Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours and the majority less than 1 minute. Chromium also has two [[metastable]] [[nuclear isomer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NUBASE&quot;&gt;{{NUBASE 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr is the [[radiogenic]] decay product of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;[[manganese|Mn]] (half-life = 3.74 million years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/vcharthtml/VChartHTML.html|title=Live Chart of Nuclides |last = |first = |date = |website = International Atomic Energy Agency - Nuclear Data Section|access-date = 18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium isotopes are typically collocated (and compounded) with [[manganese]] isotopes. This circumstance is useful in [[isotope geology]]. Manganese-chromium isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;[[Aluminium|Al]] and &lt;sup&gt;107&lt;/sup&gt;[[Palladium|Pd]] concerning the early history of the [[Solar System]]. Variations in &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr/&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt;Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate an initial &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn/&lt;sup&gt;55&lt;/sup&gt;Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotopic composition must result from in-situ decay of &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr provides additional evidence for [[nucleosynthesis|nucleosynthetic]] processes immediately before coalescence of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=&quot;53Mn53Cr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume = 63|issue = 23–24|date = 1999|pages = 4111–4117|doi = 10.1016/S0016-7037(99)00312-9|title = &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn-&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Cr evolution of the early solar system|last1 = Birck|first1 = JL|last2 = Rotaru|first2 = M|last3 = Allegre|first3 = C|bibcode=1999GeCoA..63.4111B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{doi|10.1038/331579a0}} {{doi|10.1016/j.gca.2004.01.008}} {{doi|10.1016/j.epsl.2006.07.036}} ---&gt;

The isotopes of chromium range in [[atomic mass]] from 43&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;43&lt;/sup&gt;Cr) to 67&amp;nbsp;u (&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Cr).

Chromium(III) tends to form [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] complexes.

[[Sodium chromate]] is produced industrially by the oxidative roasting of [[chromite]] ore with [[calcium carbonate|calcium]] or [[sodium carbonate]]. The change in equilibrium is visible by a change from yellow (chromate) to orange (dichromate), such as when an acid is added to a neutral solution of [[potassium chromate]]. At yet lower pH values, further condensation to more complex [[oxyanion]]s of chromium is possible.

Both the [[chromate and dichromate]] anions are strong oxidizing reagents at low pH:&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

Chromium(VI) compounds in solution can be detected by adding an acidic [[hydrogen peroxide]] solution. The unstable dark blue [[chromium(VI) peroxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is formed, which can be stabilized as an ether adduct {{chem|CrO|5|·OR|2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

[[Chromic acid]] has the hypothetical formula {{chem|H|2|CrO|4}}. It is a vaguely described chemical, despite many well-defined chromates and dichromates being known. The dark red [[chromium(VI) oxide]] {{chem|CrO|3}}, the acid [[anhydride]] of chromic acid, is sold industrially as &quot;chromic acid&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt; It can be produced by mixing sulfuric acid with dichromate and is a strong oxidizing agent.

=== Other oxidation states ===
{{See also|Organochromium chemistry}}
Compounds of chromium(V) are rather rare; the oxidation state +5 is only realized in few compounds but are intermediates in many reactions involving oxidations by chromate. The only binary compound is the volatile [[chromium(V) fluoride]] (CrF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;). This red solid has a melting point of 30&amp;nbsp;°C and a boiling point of 117&amp;nbsp;°C. It can be prepared by treating chromium metal with fluorine at 400&amp;nbsp;°C and 200 bar pressure. The peroxochromate(V) is another example of the +5 oxidation state. [[Potassium tetraperoxochromate(V)|Potassium peroxochromate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[Cr(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]) is made by reacting potassium chromate with hydrogen peroxide at low temperatures. This red brown compound is stable at room temperature but decomposes spontaneously at 150–170&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://dokumentix.ub.uni-siegen.de/opus/volltexte/2006/52/|title = Preparation, Structure and Vibrational Spectroscopy of Tetraperoxo Complexes of Cr&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;, Nb&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ta&lt;sup&gt;V+&lt;/sup&gt;|date= 2003|first = Gentiana|last = Haxhillazi|publisher= PhD thesis, University of Siegen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds of chromium(IV) are slightly more common than those of chromium(V). The tetrahalides, [[chromium(IV) fluoride|CrF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[chromium(IV) chloride|CrCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], and CrBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, can be produced by treating the trihalides ({{chem|CrX|3}}) with the corresponding halogen at elevated temperatures. Such compounds are susceptible to disproportionation reactions and are not stable in water.

Many chromium(II) compounds are known, such as the water-stable [[chromium(II) chloride]] {{chem|CrCl|2}} that can be made by reducing chromium(III) chloride with zinc. The resulting bright blue solution created from dissolving chromium(II) chloride is only stable at neutral [[pH]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt; Some other notable chromium(II) compounds include [[chromium(II) oxide]] {{chem|CrO}}, and [[chromium(II) sulfate]] {{chem|CrSO|4}}. Many chromous carboxylates are known as well, the most famous of these being the red [[chromium(II) acetate]] (Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) that features a quadruple bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotton|first1=FA|authorlink1=F.

Most chromium(I) compounds are obtained solely by oxidation of electron-rich, [[octahedral molecular geometry|octahedral]] chromium(0) complexes. Other chromium(I) complexes contain [[cyclopentadienyl]] ligands. As verified by [[X-ray diffraction]], a Cr-Cr [[quintuple bond]] (length 183.51(4) &amp;nbsp;pm) has also been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Nguyen|first1 = T|last2 = Sutton|first2 = AD|last3 = Brynda|first3 = M|last4 = Fettinger|first4 = JC|last5 = Long|first5 = GJ|last6 = Power|first6 = PP|title = Synthesis of a stable compound with fivefold bonding between two chromium(I) centers |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5749 |pages=844–847 |date=2005 |pmid = 16179432|doi = 10.1126/science.1116789|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/88eb1ca84094c9e80885518bc46fe62d3f75d338|bibcode = 2005Sci...310..844N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely bulky monodentate ligands stabilize this compound by shielding the quintuple bond from further reactions.

The [[bronze]] tips of swords and [[crossbow]] bolts found in burial pits dating from the late third century B.C.

=== Early applications ===
Chromium minerals as pigments came to the attention of the west in the eighteenth century. On 26 July 1761, [[Johann Gottlob Lehmann (scientist)|Johann Gottlob Lehmann]] found an orange-red mineral in the [[Beryozovskoye deposit|Beryozovskoye mines]] in the [[Ural Mountains]] which he named ''Siberian red lead''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer 1962 p.&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Meyer|first = RJ|title = Chrom : Teil A - Lieferung 1.

During the nineteenth century, chromium was primarily used not only as a component of paints, but in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] salts as well. For quite some time, the crocoite found in Russia was the main source for such tanning materials. In 1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near [[Baltimore]], United States, which quickly met the demand for tanning salts much more adequately than the crocoite that had been used previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Ortt Jr.|first1 = Richard A|title = Soldier's Delight, Baltimore Country|url = http://www.mgs.md.gov/geology/geology_tour/soldiers_delight.html|website = Maryland Department of Natural Resources|publisher = Maryland Geological Survey|accessdate = 13 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the United States the largest producer of chromium products until the year 1848, when larger deposits of chromite were uncovered near the city of [[Bursa]], Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot;/&gt;

Chromium is also famous for its reflective, metallic luster when polished. It is used as a protective and decorative coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by [[electroplating]]. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crplating&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title = Nickel and Chromium Plating|publisher = Woodhead Publishing|date = 1993|isbn = 978-1-85573-081-6|pages = 9–12|chapter = History of Chromium Plating|last1 = Dennis|first1 = JK|last2 = Such|first2 = TE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the production of pure chromium, the iron must be separated from the chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of [[calcium carbonate]] and [[sodium carbonate]] in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the [[chromates]] and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The chromate is converted by [[sulfuric acid]] into the dichromate.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndMin&quot;/&gt;

The strengthening effect of forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The [[high speed steel|high-speed tool steels]] contain between 3 and 5% chromium. [[Stainless steel]], the primary corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is introduced to [[iron]] in sufficient concentrations, usually where the chromium concentration is above 11%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis 2000 p.&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis | first=JR |title=Alloy digest sourcebook : stainless steels |publisher=ASM International |location=Materials Park, OH |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-87170-649-2 |oclc=43083287 |language=af |pages=1–5 |url = https://www.asminternational.org/documents/10192/1849770/06940G_Chapter_1.pdf/53f29213-5dd6-4499-9959-841477b385b9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For stainless steel's formation, ferrochromium is added to the molten iron. Also, nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, [[Inconel]] 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel [[superalloy]]s, they are used in [[jet engine]]s and [[gas turbine]]s in lieu of common structural materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;superal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Nickel-Based Superalloys|first = HK|last = Bhadeshia|url = http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html|accessdate = 17 Feb 2009|publisher = University of Cambridge|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825053006/http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2003/Superalloys/superalloys.html|archivedate = 25 August 2006|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative high hardness and corrosion resistance of unalloyed chromium makes chrome a reliable metal for surface coating; it is still the most popular metal for sheet coating with its above average durability compared to other coating metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Breitsameter |first1=M |title=Thermal Spraying versus Hard Chrome Plating |url=https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1576 |website=Azo Materials |publisher=AZoNetwork |accessdate=1 October 2018|date=2002-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by [[electroplating]] techniques. There are two deposition methods: thin and thick. Thin deposition involves a layer of chromium below 1&amp;nbsp;µm thickness deposited by [[chrome plating]], and is used for decorative surfaces. Thicker chromium layers are deposited if wear-resistant surfaces are needed. Both methods use acidic chromate or [[dichromate]] solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development; for most applications of chromium, the previously established process is used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crplating&quot;/&gt;

In the [[chromate conversion coating]] process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the chromate conversion coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Edwards |first = J |title = Coating and Surface Treatment Systems for Metals |publisher = Finishing Publications Ltd. and ASMy International |date = 1997|pages = 66–71 |isbn = 978-0-904477-16-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of environmental and health regulations on chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Surface and Coatings Technology |volume=140 |issue=1 |date=2001 |doi=10.1016/S0257-8972(01)01003-9 |title=Effects of chromate and chromate conversion coatings on corrosion of aluminum alloy 2024-T3 |vauthors= Zhao J, Xia L, Sehgal A, Lu D, McCreery RL, Frankel GS |pages=51–57 |df=dmy-all |hdl=1811/36519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromic acid [[anodizing]] (or Type I anodizing) of aluminium is another electrochemical process, which does not lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses [[chromic acid]] as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.&lt;ref name=&quot;surface&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = ASM Handbook: Surface Engineering|last1 = Cotell|first1 = CM|last2=Sprague|first2 = JA|last3 = Smidt|first3 = FA|url = https://books.google.com/?id=RGtsPjqUwy0C&amp;pg=PA484|accessdate = 17 Feb 2009|publisher = ASM International|isbn = 978-0-87170-384-2|date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The high toxicity of Cr(VI) compounds, used in the established chromium electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium or at least a change to less toxic chromium(III) compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crplating&quot;/&gt;

=== Pigment ===
The mineral [[crocoite]] (which is also [[lead chromate]] PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) was used as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, [[chrome yellow]] was, together with [[cadmium yellow]], one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the [[United States]] and for the Postal Service (for example, the [[Deutsche Post]]) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow has since declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or other alternatives that are free from lead and chromium. Other pigments that are based around chromium are, for example, the deep shade of red pigment [[chrome red]], which is simply lead chromate with [[lead(II) hydroxide]] (PbCrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·Pb(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pre-treating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of [[polyvinyl butyral]]. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15&amp;nbsp;µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of [[Prussian blue]] and [[chrome yellow]], while the chrome oxide green is [[chromium(III) oxide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cryel&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=bdQVgKWl3f4C&amp;pg=PA106|title = Painting Materials: A Short Encyclopaedia|first = Rutherford John|last = Gettens|publisher = Courier Dover Publications|date = 1966|isbn = 978-0-486-21597-6|pages = 105–106|chapter =Chrome yellow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chromium deficiency]], involving a lack of Cr(III) in the body, or perhaps some complex of it, such as [[glucose tolerance factor]] is controversial.&lt;ref name=ods/&gt; Some studies suggest that the biologically active form of chromium (III) is transported in the body via an oligopeptide called [[low-molecular-weight chromium-binding substance]] (LMWCr), which might play a role in the insulin signaling pathway.&lt;ref name=&quot;pharmacological1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=JB|title=Is the Pharmacological Mode of Action of Chromium(III) as a Second Messenger?|journal=Biological Trace Element Research|volume=166|issue=1|pages=7–12|date=2015|pmid=25595680|doi=10.1007/s12011-015-0231-9|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b92d969defe40e910934958a0ea07e174a3e8ebf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium content of common foods is generally low (1-13 micrograms per serving).&lt;ref name=ods/&gt;&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Thor|first1 = MY|last2 = Harnack|first2 = L|last3 = King|first3 = D|last4= Jasthi|first4 = B|last5 = Pettit|first5 = J|title = Evaluation of the comprehensiveness and reliability of the chromium composition of foods in the literature|journal=Journal of Food Composition Analysis|date=2011|volume = 24|issue = 8|pages = 1147–1152|doi = 10.1016/j.jfca.2011.04.006|pmid = 23066174|pmc = 3467697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium content of food varies widely due to differences in soil mineral content, growing season, plant [[cultivar]], and contamination during processing.&lt;ref name=database /&gt; In addition, chromium (and [[nickel]]) leach into food cooked in stainless steel, with the effect largest when the cookware is new.

=== Dietary recommendations ===
There is disagreement on chromium's status as an essential nutrient. Governmental departments from Australia, New Zealand, India, Japan and the United States consider chromium essential&lt;ref name=AustraliaNZ /&gt;&lt;ref name=India /&gt;&lt;ref name=Japan /&gt;&lt;ref name=IOM-Chromium/&gt; while the [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA), representing the European Union, does not.&lt;ref name=EFSA /&gt;

The [[National Academy of Medicine]] (NAM) updated the [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Estimated Average Requirements]] (EARs) and the [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Recommended Dietary Allowances]] (RDAs) for chromium in 2001. For chromium, there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so its needs are described as estimates for [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Adequate Intakes]] (AIs). The current AIs of chromium for women ages 14 through 50 is 25 μg/day, and the AIs for women ages 50 and above is 20 μg/day. The AIs for women who are pregnant are 30 μg/day, and for women who are lactating, the set AIs are 45 μg/day. The AIs for men ages 14 through 50 are 35 μg/day, and the AIs for men ages 50 and above are 30 μg/day. For children ages 1 through 13, the AIs increase with age from 0.2 μg/day up to 25 μg/day. As for safety, the NAM sets [[Dietary Reference Intake#Parameters|Tolerable Upper Intake Levels]] (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when the evidence is sufficient. In the case of chromium, there is not yet enough information and hence no UL has been established. Collectively, the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are the parameters for the nutrition recommendation system known as [[Dietary Reference Intake]] (DRI).&lt;ref name=IOM-Chromium&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222329/ |title=Chromium.

For the [[United States|United States']] food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount of the substance in a serving is expressed as a percent of the [[Reference Daily Intake|Daily Value]] (%DV). For chromium labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 120 μg. As of May 27, 2016, the percentage of daily value was revised to 35 μg to bring the chromium intake into a consensus with the official [[Dietary Reference Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FedReg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf|title = Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels.

===Food sources===
Food composition databases such as those maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture do not contain information on the chromium content of foods.&lt;ref name=USDA-Database&gt;{{cite web|url = https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?home=true|title = USDA Food Composition Databases|last1= |first1= |date = April 2018|website = United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service|access-date = 4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of animal-sourced and vegetable-sourced foods contain chromium.&lt;ref name=IOM-Chromium/&gt; Content per serving is influenced by the chromium content of the soil in which the plants are grown and by feedstuffs fed to animals; also by processing methods, as chromium is leached into foods if processed or cooked in chromium-containing stainless steel equipment.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Supplementation ===
Chromium is an ingredient in [[total parenteral nutrition]] (TPN) because deficiency can occur after months of intravenous feeding with chromium-free TPN. For this reason, chromium is added to TPN solutions, along with other trace minerals.&lt;ref name=Stehle2016/&gt; It is also in nutritional products for [[preterm infant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid = 25527182|date = February 2015|last1 = Finch|first1 = Carolyn Weiglein|title = Review of trace mineral requirements for preterm infants: What are the current recommendations for clinical practice?|journal=Nutrition in Clinical Practice|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 44–58|doi = 10.1177/0884533614563353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the mechanism in biological roles for chromium is unclear, in the United States chromium-containing products are sold as non-prescription dietary supplements in amounts ranging from 50 to 1,000 μg.

==== Approved and disapproved health claims ====
In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved a Qualified Health Claim for chromium picolinate with a requirement for very specific label wording: &quot;One small study suggests that chromium picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance, and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. FDA concludes, however, that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate and either insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain.&quot; At the same time, in answer to other parts of the petition, the FDA rejected claims for chromium picolinate and cardiovascular disease, retinopathy or kidney disease caused by abnormally high blood sugar levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20171114183739/https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073017.htm FDA Qualified Health Claims: Letters of Enforcement Discretion, Letters of Denial] U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Docket #2004Q-0144 (August 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, chromium(III) picolinate was approved by Health Canada to be used in dietary supplements.

Chromium is naturally present in the environment in trace amounts, but industrial use in rubber and stainless steel manufacturing, chrome plating, dyes for textiles, tanneries and other uses contaminates aquatic systems. In [[Bangladesh]], rivers in or downstream from industrialized areas exhibit heavy metal contamination. Irrigation water standards for chromium are 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L, but some rivers are more than five times that amount. The standard for fish for human consumption is less than 1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, but many tested samples were more than five times that amount.&lt;ref name=Islam2018&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Islam MM, Karim MR, Zheng X, Li X |title=Heavy Metal and Metalloid Pollution of Soil, Water and Foods in Bangladesh: A Critical Review |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages= 2825|date=2018 |pmid=30544988 |pmc=6313774 |doi=10.3390/ijerph15122825 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromium, especially hexavalent chromium, is highly toxic to fish because it is easily absorbed across the gills, readily enters blood circulation, crosses cell membranes and bioconcentrates up the food chain. In contrast, the toxicity of trivalent chromium is very low, attributed to poor membrane permeability and little biomagnification.&lt;ref name=Bakshi2018&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bakshi A, Panigrahi AK |title=A comprehensive review on chromium induced alterations in fresh water fishes |journal=Toxicol Rep |volume=5 |issue= |pages=440–447 |date=2018 |pmid=29854615 |pmc=5977408 |doi=10.1016/j.toxrep.2018.03.007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acute and chronic exposure to chromium(VI) affects fish behavior, physiology, reproduction and survival. Hyperactivity and erratic swimming have been reported in contaminated environments. Egg hatching and fingerling survival are affected. In adult fish there are reports of histopathological damage to liver, kidney, muscle, intestines, and gills. Mechanisms include mutagenic gene damage and disruptions of enzyme functions.&lt;ref name=Bakshi2018/&gt;

There is evidence that fish may not require chromium, but benefit from a measured amount in diet. In one study, juvenile fish gained weight on a zero chromium diet, but the addition of 500 μg of chromium in the form of chromium chloride or other supplement types, per kilogram of food (dry weight), increased weight gain. At 2,000 μg/kg the weight gain was no better than with the zero chromium diet, and there were increased DNA strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahmed AR, Jha AN, Davies SJ |title=The efficacy of chromium as a growth enhancer for mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio L): an integrated study using biochemical, genetic, and histological responses |journal=Biol Trace Elem Res |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=187–197 |date=2012 |pmid=22351105 |doi=10.1007/s12011-012-9354-4 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/dede3a34758f70e098efa637689cf98ff9bf4253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Chromium toxicity}}
Water-insoluble chromium(III) compounds and chromium metal are not considered a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium(VI) have been known for a long time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barceloux&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title = Chromium|first = Donald G|last = Barceloux|journal = Clinical Toxicology|volume = 37|issue = 2|pages = 173–194|date = 1999|doi = 10.1081/CLT-100102418|last2 = Barceloux|first2 = Donald|pmid = 10382554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the specific transport mechanisms, only limited amounts of chromium(III) enter the cells. Acute oral toxicity ranges between 50 and 150&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = The toxicology of chromium with respect to its chemical speciation: A review |first = SA|last = Katz|journal = Journal of Applied Toxicology|volume = 13|issue = 3|pages = 217–224|date = 1992|doi = 10.1002/jat.2550130314|pmid = 8326093|last2 = Salem|first2 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 review suggested that moderate uptake of chromium(III) through dietary supplements poses no genetic-toxic risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eastmond&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, time-weighted average. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 250&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup href=&quot;aerospace&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromium(VI) toxicity ===
The acute [[mouth|oral]] [[toxicity]] for [[Hexavalent chromium|chromium(VI)]] ranges between 1.5 and 3.3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz&quot;/&gt; In the body, chromium(VI) is reduced by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by a transport mechanism, by which also [[sulfate]] and [[phosphate]] ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of chromium(VI) is due to its strong [[Redox|oxidant]] properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. [[Hemolysis]], [[renal]], and liver failure result. Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium toxicity, carcinogenicity and allergenicity: Review of the literature from 1985 to 2000 |first = AD|last = Dayan |journal = Human &amp; Experimental Toxicology |volume=20 |issue=9|pages = 439–451 |date=2001 |doi = 10.1191/096032701682693062 |last2 = Paine |first2 = AJ |pmid=11776406|url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/21879eb2109f6ee4da407b24fa01739972415a39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[carcinogenity]] of chromate dust has been known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A case of adeno-carcinoma of the left inferior turbinated body, and perforation of the nasal septum, in the person of a worker in chrome pigments |first = D.|last = Newman |journal = Glasgow Medical Journal |volume = 33|pages = 469–470 |date=1890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Langard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = One Hundred Years of Chromium and Cancer: A Review of Epidemiological Evidence and Selected Case Reports |first = S |last = Langard |journal = American Journal of Industrial Medicine |volume = 17 |issue = 2|pages = 189–214 |date = 1990 |doi = 10.1002/ajim.4700170205 |pmid = 2405656}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the [[genotoxicity]] of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive [[hydroxyl radical]]s and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the [[DNA]]. The last mechanism attributed the genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = Mechanisms of chromium carcinogenicity and toxicity |first = MD|last = Cohen|journal = Critical Reviews in Toxicology |volume=23 |issue = 3|pages=255–281 |date=1993 |doi = 10.3109/10408449309105012 |last2 = Kargacin |first2 = B |last3 = Klein |first3 = CB |last4 = Costa |first4 = M |pmid = 8260068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Methods to Develop Inhalation Cancer Risk Estimates for Chromium and Nickel Compounds|date=2011|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Health and Environmental Impacts Division|location=Research Triangle Park, NC|url=https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo56032|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromium salts (chromates) are also the cause of [[allergic reaction]]s in some people. Chromates are often used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and anti-corrosives. Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic [[contact dermatitis]] and irritant dermatitis, resulting in ulceration of the skin, sometimes referred to as &quot;chrome ulcers&quot;. This condition is often found in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning and chrome-producing manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = DermNet NZ|last = Ngan|first = V|date = 2002|title = Chrome Allergy|url = http://dermnetnz.org/dermatitis/chrome-allergy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Investigation of the threshold for allergic reactivity to chromium|last1 = Basketter|first1 = David|last2 = Horev|first2 = L|last3 = Slodovnik|first3 = D|last4 = Merimes|first4 = S|last5 = Trattner|first5 = A|last6 = Ingber|first6 = A|journal = Contact Dermatitis|volume = 44|issue = 2|pages = 70–74|date = 2000|doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0536.2001.440202.x|pmid = 11205406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental issues ===
Because chromium compounds were used in [[dye]]s, [[paint]]s, and [[leather]] [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] compounds, these compounds are often found in soil and [[groundwater]] at active and abandoned industrial sites, needing [[environmental cleanup]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]]. [[Primer (paint)|Primer paint]] containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used for [[aerospace]] and [[automobile]] refinishing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first = Randall C|last = Baselt|title = Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man|edition = 8th|publisher = Biomedical Publications|date=2008 |pages = 305–307|isbn = 978-0-9626523-7-0|place = Foster City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Environmental Working Group]] studied the drinking water in 35 American cities in the first nationwide study. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities sampled, with [[Norman, Oklahoma]], at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's proposed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/healthusenvironmentpollutionwater|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101223164916/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/healthusenvironmentpollutionwater|archivedate = 23 December 2010|publisher = [[Yahoo News]]|title = US water has large amounts of likely carcinogen: study|date = 19 December 2010|accessdate = 19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
