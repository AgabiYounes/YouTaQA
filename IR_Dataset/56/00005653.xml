      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Three axioms proposed by British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke}}
British science fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]] formulated three [[adage]]s that are known as '''Clarke's three laws''', of which the third law is the best known and most widely cited. They were part of his ideas in his extensive writings about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Physics of Invisibility: A Story of Light and Deception |last= Beech|first=Martin |publisher= Springer Science + Business Media|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-46140615-0 |location= New York |page =190}}&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called laws are:
#{{Anchor|Clarke's first law}}When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's second law}}The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.
#{{Anchor|Clarke's third law}}Any sufficiently advanced [[technology]] is indistinguishable from [[Magic (supernatural) |magic]].

== Origins ==
One account claimed that Clarke's &quot;laws&quot; were developed after the editor of his works in French started numbering the author's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Quote Verifier: Who Said What, Where, and When |last= Keyes |first= Ralph |publisher= St. Martin's Press |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0-31234004-9 |location= New York |page= [https://archive.org/details/quoteverifierwho00keye/page/217 217] |url= https://archive.org/details/quoteverifierwho00keye/page/217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All three laws appear in Clarke's essay &quot;Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination&quot;, first published in ''Profiles of the Future'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hazards of Prophecy: The Failure of Imagination&quot; in the collection ''Profiles of the Future: An Enquiry into the Limits of the Possible'' (1962, rev. 1973), pp. 14, 21, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were not published at the same time. Clarke's first law was proposed in the 1962 edition of the essay, as &quot;Clarke's Law&quot; in ''Profiles of the Future''.

The second law is offered as a simple observation in the same essay but its status as Clarke's second law was conferred by others. It was initially a derivative of the first law and formally became Clarke's second law where the author proposed the third law in the 1973 revision of ''Profiles of the Future,'' which included an acknowledgement''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Believing Brain: From Ghosts and Gods to Politics and Conspiracies — How We Construct Beliefs and Reinforce Them as Truths |last= Shermer |first= Michael |authorlink= Michael Shermer |publisher= Henry Holt &amp; Co. |year= 2011 |isbn= 978-0-80509125-0 |location= New York |page= [https://archive.org/details/believingbrainfr0000sher/page/358 358] |url= https://archive.org/details/believingbrainfr0000sher/page/358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also here that Clarke wrote about the third law in these words: &quot;As three laws were good enough for [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], I have modestly decided to stop there&quot;.

The third law, despite being latest stated by a decade, is the best known and most widely cited. It appears only in the 1973 revision of the &quot;Hazards of Prophecy&quot; essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Profiles of the Future: An Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible |last=Clarke |first= Arthur C.|publisher= Popular Library |year=1973 |isbn= 978-0-33023619-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It echoes a statement in a 1942 story by [[Leigh Brackett]]: &quot;Witchcraft to the ignorant, … simple science to the learned&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Sorcerer of Rhiannon&quot;, ''[[Astounding]]'' February 1942, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier examples of this sentiment may be found in ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932) by [[Charles Fort]]: &quot;…a performance that may some day be considered understandable, but that, in these primitive times, so transcends what is said to be the known that it is what I mean by magic,&quot; and in the short story ''[[The Hound of Death]]'' (1933) by [[Agatha Christie]]: &quot;The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood.&quot;

Clarke gave an example of the third law when he said that while he &quot;would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from [[Albertus (typeface) |Albertus]] Extra Bold to [[Univers |Zurich]] [[Calligraphic]]&quot;, referring to his memory of &quot;seeing and hearing [[Linotype machine]]s which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Gooden2015&quot;/&gt;

== Variants of the third law ==
The third law has inspired many [[snowclone]]s and other variations:
* {{anchor|Shermer}}Any sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial intelligence is indistinguishable from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gooden2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Shermer's Last Law|magazine= [[Scientific American]]|last= Shermer |first=Michael |authorlink= Michael Shermer |date= January 2002 |url= http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/shermers-last-law/ |url-access= subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Shermer's last law)

* The following two variants are very similar, and combine the third law with [[Hanlon's razor]]
** {{anchor|Clark}}Any sufficiently advanced cluelessness is indistinguishable from malice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | title = Clark's Law | first = J.

* Any sufficiently advanced [[Internet troll|troll]] is indistinguishable from a genuine kook ''or'' the viewpoints of even the most extreme [[Crank (person) |crank]] are indistinguishable from sufficiently advanced satire ([[Poe's law]])
* Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a rigged demo&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/3418.html Quote Details: James Klass: Any sufficiently advanced technology… - The Quotations Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

(2016). ''Ecopsychology Revisited: For Whom do the Nature Bells Toll?'' (ch. 8, p. 256)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any sufficiently crappy research is indistinguishable from fraud ([[Andrew Gelman]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Gelman|url=http://andrewgelman.com/2016/06/20/clarkes-law-of-research/|title=Clarke’s Law: Any sufficiently crappy research is indistinguishable from fraud|date=20 June 2016|website=Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science|access-date=2019-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Wiktionary:contrapositive#English |contrapositive]] of the third law is
* Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced. (Gehm's corollary)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine= The MT Void |volume= 23 |number= 19 |date=5 November 2004 |last1= Leeper |first1=Evelyn |authorlink1= Evelyn C.

The third law has been reversed for [[fictional universe]]s involving [[Magic in fiction|magic]]:
* &quot;Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from science!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20081205 Girl Genius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic Sufficiently Analyzed Magic – TV Tropes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Any sufficiently arcane magic is indistinguishable from technology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160317005624/http://www.resonant.org/games/infocom/Infocom_Homepage/Invisiclues/Old/spellbreaker.html#TheVolcano3 Spellbreaker Invisiclues] (Archived from [http://www.resonant.org/games/infocom/Infocom_Homepage/Invisiclues/Old/spellbreaker.html#TheVolcano the original] on March 17, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

A rebuttal to the ambiguous &quot;sufficiently advanced&quot; part has been offered by another [[science fiction]] author:
* &quot;Any technology, no matter how primitive, is magic to those who don't understand it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freefall.purrsia.com/ff300/fv00255.htm Freefall 00255 (November 12, 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode ''[[The Robots of Death]]'', [[Fourth Doctor|the Doctor]] phrases it as:
* &quot;To the rational mind nothing is inexplicable, only unexplained.&quot;
