The '''Cretaceous''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|k|r|ɪ|ˈ|t|eɪ|.|ʃ|ə|s}}, {{respell|krih|TAY|shəs}})&lt;ref&gt;{{dictionary.com|Cretaceous}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[geological period]] that lasted from about 145 to 66 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] (mya). It is the third and final period of the [[Mesozoic]] [[Era (geology)|Era]]. The name is derived from the [[Latin]] [[wikt:creta#Latin|''creta'']]. It is usually abbreviated '''K''', for its [[German language|German]] translation ''Kreide''.

The Cretaceous was a period with a relatively warm [[climate]], resulting in high [[Sea level#Local and eustatic|eustatic sea levels]] that created numerous shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland seas]]. These oceans and seas were populated with now-[[extinct]] [[marine reptile]]s, [[ammonites]] and [[rudists]], while [[dinosaur]]s continued to dominate on land. During this time, new groups of [[mammal]]s and [[birds]], as well as [[flowering plants]], appeared.

The Cretaceous (along with the Mesozoic) ended with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], a large mass extinction in which many groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, [[pterosaur]]s and large marine reptiles died out. The end of the Cretaceous is defined by the abrupt [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (K–Pg boundary), a geologic signature associated with the mass extinction which lies between the Mesozoic and [[Cenozoic]] [[era (geology)|eras]].

==Geology==
===Research history===
The Cretaceous as a separate period was first defined by Belgian geologist [[Jean Baptiste Julien d'Omalius d'Halloy|Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy]] in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = d’Halloy, d’O., J.-J. | year = 1822 | title = Observations sur un essai de carte géologique de la France, des Pays-Bas, et des contrées voisines |trans-title=Observations on a trial geological map of France, the Low Countries, and neighboring countries | journal = Annales des Mines | volume = 7 | pages = 353–376 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c-ocAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA353#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}  From page 373:  &quot;La troisième, qui correspond à ce qu'on a déja appelé formation de la craie, sera désigné par le nom de terrain crétacé.&quot; (The third, which corresponds to what was already called the &quot;chalk formation&quot;, will be designated by the name &quot;chalky terrain&quot;.)&lt;/ref&gt; using [[stratum|strata]] in the [[Paris Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=Great Soviet Encyclopedia |title=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya  |publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya |edition=3rd |pages=vol. 16, p. 50 |year=1974 |location=Moscow |language=Russian |nopp=true |title-link=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named for the extensive beds of [[chalk]] ([[calcium carbonate]] deposited by the shells of marine [[invertebrate]]s, principally [[coccoliths]]), found in the upper Cretaceous of [[Western Europe]].{{efn|text=The term &quot;Cretaceous&quot; first appeared in English in:  Henry Thomas De La Beche, ''A Geological Manual'' (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:  Carey &amp; Lea, 1832).  [https://archive.org/details/ageologicalmanu00bechgoog/page/n49 From page 35:]  &quot;Group 4. (''Cretaceous'') contains the rocks which in England and the North of France are characterized by chalk in the upper part, and sands and sandstones in the lower.&quot;}} The name Cretaceous was derived from [[Latin]] ''creta'', meaning ''chalk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glossary of Geology|publisher=American Geological Institute|edition=3rd|page= 165|year=1972|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stratigraphic subdivisions===
The Cretaceous is divided into [[Early Cretaceous|Early]] and [[Late Cretaceous]] [[epoch (geology)|epochs]], or Lower and Upper Cretaceous [[series (stratigraphy)|series]]. In older literature the Cretaceous is sometimes divided into three series: [[Neocomian]] (lower/early), Gallic (middle) and Senonian (upper/late). A subdivision in eleven [[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]]&lt;!-- The chart at the right here seems to show they're twelve. Aren't they? --&gt;, all originating from European stratigraphy, is now used worldwide. In many parts of the world, alternative local subdivisions are still in use.

As with other older geologic periods, the rock beds of the Cretaceous are well identified but the exact age of the system's base is uncertain by a few million years. No great [[extinction]] or burst of diversity separates the Cretaceous from the Jurassic. However, the top of the system is sharply defined, being placed at an [[iridium]]-rich layer found worldwide that is believed to be associated with the [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub impact crater]], with its boundaries circumscribing parts of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. This layer has been dated at 66.043 [[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Renne, Paul R. |year=2013 |title= Time scales of critical events around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary |journal=Science |volume=339 |pages=684–688 |doi=10.1126/science.1230492|bibcode = 2013Sci...339..684R |pmid=23393261 |issue=6120|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 140 Ma age for the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary instead of the usually accepted 145 Ma was proposed in 2014 based on a stratigraphic study of [[Vaca Muerta|Vaca Muerta Formation]] in [[Neuquén Basin]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vennari |first=Verónica V. |last2=Lescano |first2=Marina |last3=Naipauer |first3=Maximiliano |last4=Aguirre-Urreta |first4=Beatriz |last5=Concheyro |first5=Andrea|last6=Schaltegger |first6=Urs |last7=Armstrong |first7=Richard |last8=Pimentel |first8=Marcio |last9=Ramos |first9=Victor A. |author-link9=Víctor Alberto Ramos |date=2014 |title=New constraints on the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary in the High Andes using high-precision U–Pb data |journal=[[Gondwana Research]] |volume=26 |issue= 1|pages=374–385 |doi= 10.1016/j.gr.2013.07.005|bibcode=2014GondR..26..374V }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Víctor Alberto Ramos|Víctor Ramos]], one of the authors of the study proposing the 140 Ma boundary age, sees the study as a &quot;first step&quot; toward formally changing the age in the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cienciauanl.uanl.mx/?p=1384 |title=Entrevista al Dr. Víctor Alberto Ramos, Premio México Ciencia y Tecnología 2013 |last1=Jaramillo |first1=Jessica |date= |website= |access-date= |quote= Si logramos publicar esos nuevos resultados, sería el primer paso para cambiar formalmente la edad del Jurásico-Cretácico.

===Rock formations===
[[File:MosasaurusHoffmann.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of fossil jaws of ''[[Mosasaurus|Mosasaurus hoffmanni]]'', from the [[Maastrichtian]] of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]], by Dutch geologist [[Pieter Harting]] (1866).]]

The high sea level and warm climate of the Cretaceous meant large areas of the continents were covered by warm, shallow seas, providing habitat for many marine organisms. The Cretaceous was named for the extensive chalk deposits of this age in Europe, but in many parts of the world, the deposits from the Cretaceous are of [[Lake sediment|marine]] [[limestone]], a rock type that is formed under warm, shallow marine circumstances. Due to the high sea level, there was extensive space for such [[sedimentation]]. Because of the relatively young age and great thickness of the system, Cretaceous rocks are evident in many areas worldwide.

[[Chalk]] is a rock type characteristic for (but not restricted to) the Cretaceous. It consists of [[coccolith]]s, microscopically small [[calcite]] skeletons of [[coccolithophore]]s, a type of [[algae]] that prospered in the Cretaceous seas.

In northwestern Europe, chalk deposits from the Upper Cretaceous are characteristic for the [[Chalk Group]], which forms the [[white cliffs of Dover]] on the south coast of [[England]] and similar cliffs on the [[France|French]] [[Normandy|Normandian]] coast. The [[group (stratigraphy)|group]] is found in England, northern France, the [[low countries]], northern [[Germany]], [[Denmark]] and in the subsurface of the southern part of the [[North Sea]]. Chalk is not easily [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidated]] and the Chalk Group still consists of loose sediments in many places. The group also has other [[limestone]]s and [[arenite]]s. Among the fossils it contains are [[sea urchin]]s, [[belemnite]]s, [[ammonites]] and sea reptiles such as ''[[Mosasaurus]]''.

In southern Europe, the Cretaceous is usually a marine system consisting of [[Competence (geology)|competent]] limestone beds or incompetent [[marl]]s. Because the [[Alpine orogeny|Alpine mountain chains]] did not yet exist in the Cretaceous, these deposits formed on the southern edge of the European [[continental shelf]], at the margin of the [[Tethys Ocean]].

Stagnation of deep sea currents in middle Cretaceous times caused anoxic conditions in the sea water leaving the deposited organic matter undecomposed. Half of the world's petroleum reserves were laid down at this time in the anoxic conditions of what would become the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Mexico. In many places around the world, dark anoxic [[shale]]s were formed during this interval.{{sfn|Stanley|1999| pp=481–482}} These shales are an important [[source rock]] for oil and gas, for example in the subsurface of the North Sea.

==Paleogeography==
[[File:US cretaceous general.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Geography of the [[Contiguous United States]] in the late Cretaceous period]]
During the Cretaceous, the late-[[Paleozoic]]-to-early-Mesozoic [[supercontinent]] of [[Pangaea]] completed its [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] breakup into the present-day [[continent]]s, although their positions were substantially different at the time. As the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened, the convergent-margin mountain building ([[orogeny|orogenies]]) that had begun during the [[Jurassic]] continued in the [[American cordillera|North American Cordillera]], as the [[Nevadan orogeny]] was followed by the [[Sevier orogeny|Sevier]] and [[Laramide orogeny|Laramide orogenies]].

Though [[Gondwana]] was still intact in the beginning of the Cretaceous, it broke up as [[South America]], [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia]] rifted away from [[Africa]] (though [[India]] and [[Madagascar]] remained attached to each other); thus, the South Atlantic and [[Indian Ocean]]s were newly formed. Such active rifting lifted great undersea mountain chains along the welts, raising [[Sea level#Sea level and dry land|eustatic sea levels]] worldwide. To the north of Africa the [[Tethys Sea]] continued to narrow. Broad shallow seas advanced across central [[North America]] (the [[Western Interior Seaway]]) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between [[coal]] beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous [[transgression (geology)|transgression]], one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dougal |last1=Dixon |first2=M J |last2=Benton |first3=Ayala |last3=Kingsley |first4=Julian |last4=Baker|title=Atlas of Life on Earth |location=New York |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books |year=2001 |page=215 |isbn=9780760719572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cretacico-isotermas-y-mapamundi.svg|thumb|left|A computer-simulated model of surface conditions in Middle Cretaceous, 100 mya, displaying the approximate shoreline and calculated [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]]s.]]

The Cretaceous is justly famous for its [[chalk]]; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the [[Phanerozoic]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999|p=280}} [[Mid-ocean ridge]] activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for [[Coccolithophores|calcareous nanoplankton]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999|pp=279–281}} These widespread [[carbonate]]s and other [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary deposits]] make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous [[Geologic formation|formations]] from North America include the rich marine fossils of [[Kansas]]'s [[Smoky Hill Chalk]] Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in [[Europe]] (e.g., the [[Weald]]) and [[China]] (the [[Yixian Formation]]). In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the [[Deccan Traps]] were erupted in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.

==Climate==
The cooling trend of the last epoch of the Jurassic continued into the first age of the Cretaceous. There is evidence that snowfalls were common in the higher latitudes and the tropics became wetter than during the Triassic and Jurassic.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Berriasian Age&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palaeos.com/mesozoic/cretaceous/berriasian.html|title=Palaeos Mesozoic: Cretaceous: The Berriasian Age|first=M.Alan|last=Kazlev|website=Palaeos.com|access-date=18 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220223930/http://palaeos.com/Mesozoic/Cretaceous/Berriasian.html|archivedate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glaciation was however restricted to high-[[latitude]] mountains, though seasonal snow may have existed farther from the poles. Rafting by ice of stones into marine environments occurred during much of the Cretaceous but evidence of deposition directly from glaciers is limited to the Early Cretaceous of the Eromanga Basin in southern Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alley | first1 = N.

After the end of the first age, however, temperatures increased again, and these conditions were almost constant until the end of the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Berriasian Age&quot;/&gt; The warming may have been due to intense [[volcanic activity]] which produced large quantities of [[carbon dioxide]].  Between 70–69 Ma and 66–65 Ma, isotopic ratios indicate elevated atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressures with levels of 1000–1400 ppmV and mean annual temperatures in west [[Texas]] between 21 and 23&amp;nbsp;°C (70-73&amp;nbsp;°F). Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and temperature relations indicate a doubling of pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was accompanied by a ~0.6&amp;nbsp;°C increase in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Nordt |first1=Lee |first2=Stacy |last2=Atchley |first3=Steve |last3=Dworkin |title=Terrestrial Evidence for Two Greenhouse Events in the Latest Cretaceous |magazine=GSA Today |volume=13 |issue=12 |date= December 2003 |doi=10.1130/1052-5173(2003)013&lt;4:TEFTGE&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The production of large quantities of magma, variously attributed to [[mantle plume]]s or to extensional tectonics,&lt;ref name=Foulger&gt;{{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |author=Foulger, G.R. |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; further pushed sea levels up, so that large areas of the continental crust were covered with shallow seas. The [[Tethys Sea]] connecting the tropical oceans east to west also helped to warm the global climate. Warm-adapted [[plant fossil]]s are known from localities as far north as [[Alaska]] and [[Greenland]], while [[dinosaur]] fossils have been found within 15 degrees of the Cretaceous [[south pole]].{{sfn|Stanley|1999|p=480–482}}

Nonetheless, there is evidence of [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] marine glaciation in the [[Turonian]] Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bornemann | first1 = Norris RD | last2 = Friedrich | first2 = O | last3 = Beckmann | first3 = B | last4 = Schouten | first4 = S | last5 = Damsté | first5 = JS | last6 = Vogel | first6 = J | last7 = Hofmann | first7 = P | last8 = Wagner | first8 = T | date = Jan 2008 | title = Isotopic evidence for glaciation during the Cretaceous supergreenhouse | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/78e27d680d53a361e8ec5ac48a4abaffce4702dc| journal = Science | volume = 319 | issue = 5860| pages = 189–92 | doi = 10.1126/science.1148777 | pmid = 18187651 | bibcode = 2008Sci...319..189B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very gentle [[temperature gradient]] from the [[equator]] to the poles meant weaker global winds, which drive the ocean currents, resulted in less [[upwelling]] and more stagnant [[ocean]]s than today. This is evidenced by widespread black [[shale]] deposition and frequent [[anoxic event]]s.{{sfn|Stanley|1999|pp=481–482}} Sediment cores show that tropical [[sea surface temperature]]s may have briefly been as warm as {{convert|42|C|sigfig=3}}, {{convert|17|C-change|sigfig=2}} warmer than at present, and that they averaged around {{convert|37|C|sigfig=2}}.

==Life==
===Flora===
[[File:Conguillio llaima.jpg|thumb|Although the first representatives of leafy trees and true grasses emerged in the Cretaceous, the flora was still dominated by conifers like ''[[Araucaria]]'' (Here: Modern ''Araucaria araucana'' in [[Chile]]).]]
Flowering plants ([[angiosperms]]) spread during this period,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coiro|first=Mario|last2=Doyle|first2=James A.|last3=Hilton|first3=Jason|date=2019-01-25|title=How deep is the conflict between molecular and fossil evidence on the age of angiosperms?|journal=New Phytologist|volume=223|issue=1|pages=83–99|language=en|doi=10.1111/nph.15708|pmid=30681148}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they did not become predominant until the [[Campanian]] Age near the end of the period. Their evolution was aided by the appearance of [[bee]]s; in fact, the development of angiosperms and [[insect]]s is a good example of [[coevolution]]. The first representatives of many leafy trees, including [[ficus|fig]]s, [[Platanus|planes]] and [[magnolia]]s, appeared in the Cretaceous.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

At the same time, some earlier Mesozoic [[gymnosperm]]s continued to thrive, pehuéns (monkey puzzle trees, ''[[Araucaria]]'') and other [[conifer]]s being notably plentiful and widespread. Some [[fern]] orders, such as [[Gleicheniales]], appeared as early in the [[fossil record]] as the Cretaceous and achieved an early broad distribution.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2010.

Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnosperm taxa like [[Bennettitales]] and [[Hirmeriella]] died out before the end of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Bennettitales|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/seedplants/bennettitales.html|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|access-date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrestrial fauna===
On land, [[mammal]]s were generally small sized, but a very relevant component of the [[Fauna (animals)|fauna]], with [[cimolodont]] [[multituberculates]] outnumbering dinosaurs in some sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kielan-Jaworowska |first1=Zofia |first2=Richard L. |last2=Cifelli |first3=Zhe-Xi |last3=Luo|year=2005 |title=Mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs: Origins, Evolution, and Structure |p=299 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=9780231119184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither true [[marsupial]]s nor [[placental]]s existed until the very end,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eutherians experienced elevated evolutionary rates in the immediate aftermath of the Cretaceous–Palaeogene mass extinction |first1=Thomas John Dixon |last1=Halliday |first2=Paul |last2=Upchurch |first3=Anjali |last3=Goswami |date=29 June 2016 |journal=Proc.

Various &quot;archaic&quot; groups like [[eutriconodont]]s were common in the Early Cretaceous, but by the Late Cretaceous northern mammalian faunas were dominated by multituberculates and [[theria]]ns, with [[dryolestoid]]s dominating [[South America]].

The apex predators were [[archosaur]]ian [[reptile]]s, especially [[dinosaur]]s, which were at their most diverse stage. [[Pterosaur]]s were common in the early and middle Cretaceous, but as the Cretaceous proceeded they declined for poorly understood reasons (once thought to be due to competition with early [[bird]]s, but now it is understood avian [[adaptive radiation]] is not consistent with pterosaur decline&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Pterosaurs: Natural History, Evolution, Anatomy|author=Wilton, Mark P. |isbn=978-0691150611|year=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and by the end of the period only two highly specialized [[Family (biology)|families]] remained.

The [[Liaoning]] [[lagerstätte]] ([[Chaomidianzi formation]]) in China is a treasure chest of preserved remains of numerous types of small dinosaurs, birds and mammals, that provides a glimpse of life in the Early Cretaceous. The [[coelurosaur]] dinosaurs found there represent types of the group [[Maniraptora]], which includes modern birds and their closest non-avian relatives, such as [[dromaeosaurs]], [[oviraptorosaurs]], [[therizinosaurs]], [[troodontids]] along with other [[avialans]]. Fossils of these dinosaurs from the [[Liaoning]] [[lagerstätte]] are notable for the presence of hair-like [[feather]]s.

[[Insect]]s diversified during the Cretaceous, and the oldest known [[ant]]s, [[termite]]s and some [[lepidoptera]]ns, akin to [[Butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s, appeared. [[Aphid]]s, [[grasshopper]]s and [[gall wasp]]s appeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCMP&quot; /&gt;

===Marine fauna===
In the seas, [[batoidea|rays]], modern [[shark]]s and [[teleost]]s became common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/geo_timeline.html|title=EVOLUTIONARY/GEOLOGICAL TIMELINE v1.0|author=|date=|website=www.TalkOrigins.org|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marine reptiles included [[ichthyosaur]]s in the early and mid-Cretaceous (becoming extinct during the late Cretaceous [[Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event]]), [[plesiosaur]]s throughout the entire period, and [[mosasaur]]s appearing in the Late Cretaceous.

''[[Baculites]]'', an [[ammonite]] genus with a straight shell, flourished in the seas along with reef-building [[rudist]] clams. The [[Hesperornithiformes]] were flightless, marine diving birds that swam like [[grebe]]s. Globotruncanid [[Foraminifera]] and [[echinoderms]] such as sea urchins and [[Asteroidea|starfish (sea stars)]] thrived. The first radiation of the [[diatom]]s (generally [[silicon dioxide|siliceous]] shelled, rather than [[calcareous]]) in the oceans occurred during the Cretaceous; freshwater diatoms did not appear until the [[Miocene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UCMP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mesozoic/cretaceous/cretlife.html|title=Life of the Cretaceous|author=|date=|website=www.ucmp.Berkeley.edu|access-date=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cretaceous was also an important interval in the evolution of [[bioerosion]], the production of borings and scrapings in rocks, [[hardgrounds]] and shells.

===End-Cretaceous extinction event===
[[File:Impact event.jpg|thumb|The impact of a [[meteorite]] or [[comet]] is today widely accepted as the main reason for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].]]
{{main|Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event}}
The impact of a large body with the Earth may have been the punctuation mark at the end of a progressive decline in [[biodiversity]] during the Maastrichtian Age of the Cretaceous Period. The result was the extinction of three-quarters of Earth's plant and animal species. The impact created the sharp break known as [[K–Pg boundary]] (formerly known as the K–T boundary). Earth's biodiversity required substantial time to recover from this event, despite the probable existence of an abundance of vacant [[ecological niche]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/39065961 | title=The Cretaceous–Tertiary biotic transition |author1=MacLeod, N |author2=Rawson, PF |author3=Forey, PL |author4=Banner, FT |author5=Boudagher-Fadel, MK |author6=Bown, PR |author7=Burnett, JA |author8=Chambers, P |author9=Culver, S |author10=Evans, SE |author11=Jeffery, C |author12=Kaminski, MA |author13=Lord, AR |author14=Milner, AC |author15=Milner, AR |author16=Morris, N |author17=Owen, E |author18=Rosen, BR  |author19=Smith, AB |author20=Taylor, PD |author21=Urquhart, E |author22=Young, JR |display-authors=7 | journal=Journal of the Geological Society | year=1997 | volume=154 | issue=2 | pages=265–292 | doi=10.1144/gsjgs.154.2.0265| bibcode=1997JGSoc.154..265M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the severity of K-Pg extinction event, there was significant variability in the rate of extinction between and within different [[clades]]. Species which depended on [[photosynthesis]] declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked [[solar energy]]. As is the case today, photosynthesizing organisms, such as [[phytoplankton]] and land [[plant]]s, formed the primary part of the [[food chain]] in the late Cretaceous, and all else that depended on them suffered as well. [[Herbivore|Herbivorous]] animals, which depended on plants and plankton as their food, died out as their food sources became scarce; consequently, the top [[predator]]s such as ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' also perished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wilf, P  |author2=Johnson KR|title=Land plant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous: a quantitative analysis of the North Dakota megafloral record|journal=Paleobiology|year=2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=347–368|doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2004)030&lt;0347:LPEATE&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet only three major groups of [[tetrapod]]s disappeared completely; the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s, the [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]] and the [[pterosaur]]s. The other Cretaceous groups that did not survive into the Cenozoic era, the [[ichthyosaur]]s and last remaining [[Temnospondyli|temnospondyls]] and non-mammalian [[cynodont]]s were already extinct millions of years before the event occurred.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Coccolithophorids]] and [[mollusc]]s, including [[ammonite]]s, [[rudist]]s, [[freshwater snail]]s and [[mussel]]s, as well as organisms whose [[food chain]] included these shell builders, became extinct or suffered heavy losses. For example, it is thought that ammonites were the principal food of [[mosasaur]]s, a group of giant marine reptiles that became extinct at the boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kauffman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last =Kauffman| first =E| title =Mosasaur Predation on Upper Cretaceous Nautiloids and Ammonites from the United States Pacific Coast | journal =PALAIOS| volume =19| issue =1| pages =96–100| year =2004| doi = 10.1669/0883-1351(2004)019&lt;0096:MPOUCN&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Omnivores]], [[insectivores]] and [[carrion]]-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. At the end of the Cretaceous there seem to have been no purely herbivorous or [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[mammal]]s. Mammals and birds which survived the extinction fed on [[insect]]s, [[larva]]e, [[worm]]s and snails, which in turn fed on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists theorise that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they fed on [[Detritus (biology)|detritus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SheehanHansen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Shehan, P  |author2=Hansen, TA | title =Detritus feeding as a buffer to extinction at the end of the Cretaceous| journal =Geology| volume =14| issue =10| pages =868–870| year =1986| doi =10.1130/0091-7613(1986)14&lt;868:DFAABT&gt;2.0.CO;2| id =|bibcode = 1986Geo....14..868S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Faunal evidence for reduced productivity and uncoordinated recovery in Southern Hemisphere Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary sections|author1=Aberhan, M |author2=Weidemeyer, S |author3=Kieesling, W |author4=Scasso, RA |author5= Medina, FA |last-author-amp=yes |year=2007|journal=Geology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=227–230|doi=10.1130/G23197A.1|bibcode = 2007Geo....35..227A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[stream]] [[Biocoenosis|communities]], few groups of animals became extinct. Stream communities rely less on food from living plants and more on detritus that washes in from land. This particular ecological niche buffered them from extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Major extinctions of land-dwelling vertebrates at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, eastern Montana|author1=Sheehan, PM  |author2=Fastovsky, DE|year=1992|journal=Geology|volume=20|issue=6| pages=556–560|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1992)020&lt;0556:MEOLDV&gt;2.3.CO;2|bibcode = 1992Geo....20..556S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar, but more complex patterns have been found in the oceans. Extinction was more severe among animals living in the [[Pelagic zone|water column]], than among animals living on or in the seafloor. Animals in the water column are almost entirely dependent on [[primary production]] from living phytoplankton, while animals living on or in the [[ocean floor]] feed on detritus or can switch to detritus feeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacLeod&quot;/&gt;

The largest air-breathing survivors of the event, [[crocodilian]]s and [[Choristodera|champsosaurs]], were semi-aquatic and had access to detritus. Modern crocodilians can live as scavengers and can survive for months without food and go into hibernation when conditions are unfavorable, and their young are small, grow slowly, and feed largely on invertebrates and dead organisms or fragments of organisms for their first few years. These characteristics have been linked to crocodilian survival at the end of the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=&quot;SheehanHansen&quot;/&gt;
