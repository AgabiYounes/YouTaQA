[[File:Plan nine from outer space.jpg|thumb|alt=Film poster for Plan 9 from Outer Space|''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' is an example of a cult film.&lt;ref name=plan9/&gt;]]

A '''cult film''' or '''cult movie''', also commonly referred to as a '''cult classic''', is a [[film]] that has acquired a [[cult following]]. Cult films are known for their dedicated, passionate [[fanbase]], an elaborate subculture that engage in repeated viewings, quoting dialogue, and [[audience participation]].  Inclusive definitions allow for major studio productions, especially [[box office bomb]]s, while exclusive definitions focus more on obscure, [[transgressive art|transgressive]] films shunned by the [[mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]].  The difficulty in defining the term and subjectivity of what qualifies as a cult film mirror [[classificatory disputes about art]].  The term ''cult film'' itself was first used in the 1970s to describe the culture that surrounded [[underground film]]s and [[midnight movie]]s, though ''cult'' was in common use in film analysis for decades prior to that.

Cult films trace their origin back to controversial and [[film censorship|suppressed]] films kept alive by dedicated fans.  In some cases, reclaimed or rediscovered films have acquired cult followings decades after their original release, occasionally for their [[camp (style)|camp]] value.  Other cult films have since become well-respected or reassessed as classics; there is debate as to whether these popular and accepted films are still cult films.  After failing in the cinema, some cult films have become regular fixtures on cable television or profitable sellers on home video.  Others have inspired their own [[film festival]]s.  Cult films can both appeal to specific subcultures and form their own subcultures.  Other media that reference cult films can easily identify which demographics they desire to attract and offer savvy fans an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge.

Cult films frequently break cultural taboos, and many feature excessive displays of violence, gore, sexuality, profanity, or combinations thereof.  This can lead to controversy, censorship, and outright bans; less transgressive films may attract similar amounts of controversy when critics call them frivolous or incompetent.  Films that fail to attract requisite amounts of controversy may face resistance when labeled as cult films.  Mainstream films and big budget blockbusters have attracted cult followings similar to more underground and lesser known films; fans of these films often emphasize the films' niche appeal and reject the more popular aspects.  Fans who like the films for the wrong reasons, such as perceived elements that represent mainstream appeal and marketing, will often be ostracized or ridiculed.  Likewise, fans who stray from accepted subcultural scripts may experience similar rejection.

Since the late 1970s, cult films have become increasingly popular.  Films that once would have been limited to obscure cult followings are now capable of breaking into the mainstream, and showings of cult films have proved to be a profitable business venture.  Overbroad usage of the term has resulted in controversy, as purists state it has become a meaningless descriptor applied to any film that is the slightest bit weird or unconventional; others accuse Hollywood studios of trying to artificially create cult films or use the term as a marketing tactic.  Films are frequently stated to be an &quot;instant cult classic&quot; now, occasionally before they are released.  Fickle fans on the Internet have latched on to unreleased films only to abandon them later on release.  At the same time, other films have acquired massive, quick cult followings, owing to spreading [[viral marketing|virally]] through [[social media]].  Easy access to cult films via [[video on demand]] and [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] has led some critics to pronounce the death of cult films.

In 2008, ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' asked a range of academics for their definition of a cult film.  Several people defined cult films primarily in terms of their opposition to mainstream films and conformism, explicitly requiring a [[transgressive art|transgressive]] element, though others disputed the transgressive potential, given the demographic appeal to conventional moviegoers and mainstreaming of cult films.  Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock instead called them mainstream films with transgressive elements.  Most definitions also required a strong community aspect, such as obsessed fans or ritualistic behavior.  Citing misuse of the term, Mikel J. Koven took a self-described hard-line stance that rejected definitions that use any other criteria.  Matt Hills instead stressed the need for an open-ended definition rooted in [[structuration]], where the film and the audience reaction are interrelated and neither is prioritized. [[Ernest Mathijs]] focused on the accidental nature of cult followings, arguing that cult film fans consider themselves too savvy to be marketed to, while [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] rejected the continued existence of cult films and called the term a marketing buzzword.  Mathijs suggests that cult films help to understand ambiguity and incompleteness in life given the difficulty in even defining the term.  That cult films can have opposing qualities – such as good and bad, failure and success, innovative and retro – helps to illustrate that art is subjective and never self-evident.&lt;ref name=cineaste&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Church |first1=David |last2=Hills |first2=Matt |last3=Hunter |first3=I.

Writing in ''Defining Cult Movies'', Jancovich et al. quote academic Jeffrey Sconce, who defines cult films in terms of [[paracinema]], marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance: everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography.  However, they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature; instead, they state that cult films are united in their &quot;subcultural ideology&quot; and opposition to mainstream tastes, itself a vague and undefinable term.  Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt, and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity – even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist, albeit unintentionally.  At the same time, they state that bourgeois, masculine tastes are frequently reinforced, which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie, rather than a rebellion against it.  This results in an anti-academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies, such as [[defamiliarization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cult-intro&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste|last1=Jancovich|first1=Mark|last2=Reboll|first2=Antonio Làzaro|last3=Stringer|first3=Julian|last4=Willis|first4=Andy|year=2003|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3|pages=1–3|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contradiction exists in many subcultures, especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream.  This nonconformity is eventually co-opted by the dominant forces, such as Hollywood, and marketed to the mainstream.&lt;ref name=alamo&gt;{{cite journal| last=de Ville| first=Donna| title=Cultivating the Cult Experience at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema| journal=Scope| year=2011| issue=20| url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=20&amp;id=1306|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622155957/http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/article.php?issue=20&amp;id=1306|archivedate=2013-06-22|accessdate=2013-06-04| issn=1465-9166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic [[Xavier Mendik]] also defines cult films as opposing the mainstream and further proposes that films can become cult by virtue of their genre or content, especially if it is transgressive.  Due to their rejection of mainstream appeal, Mendik says cult films can be more creative and political; times of relative political instability produce more interesting films.&lt;ref name=sheep&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sélavy|first=Virginie|title=Interview with Xavier Mendik|journal=Electric Sheep|date=2008-05-01|url=http://www.electricsheepmagazine.co.uk/features/2008/05/01/interview-with-xavier-mendik/|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General overview==
Cult films have existed since the early days of cinema.  Film critic Harry Allan Potamkin traces them back to 1910s France and the reception of [[Pearl White]], [[William S. Hart]], and [[Charlie Chaplin]], which he described as &quot;a dissent from the popular ritual&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cult Film Reader|last=Potamkin|first=Harry Allen|editor1-last=Mathijs|editor1-first=Ernest|editor2-last=Mendik|editor2-first=Xavier|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0|page=26|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|chapter=Film Cults}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) was an unauthorized adaptation of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]]''.  Stoker's widow sued the production company and drove it to bankruptcy.  All known copies of the film were destroyed, and ''Nosferatu'' become an early cult film, kept alive by a cult following that circulated illegal bootlegs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Phil|title=The Bootleg Files: &quot;Nosferatu&quot;|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/2056/|work=[[Film Threat]]|accessdate=2013-04-29|authorlink=Phil Hall (US writer)|date=2007-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic Chuck Kleinhans identifies the [[Marx Brothers]] as making other early cult films.&lt;ref name=cineaste /&gt;  On their original release, some highly regarded classics from the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]] were panned by critics and audiences, relegated to cult status. ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955) was a cult film for years, quoted often and championed by fans, before it was reassessed as an important and influential classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ventura|first=Elbert|title=The Greatest One-Off in Movie History|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2010/11/the_greatest_oneoff_in_movie_history.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=2013-04-24|date=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, American [[exploitation film]]s and imported European [[art film]]s were marketed similarly. Although critics [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Arthur Knight (film critic)|Arthur Knight]] argued against arbitrary divisions into [[high culture|high]] and [[low culture]], American films settled into rigid genres; European art films continued to push the boundaries of simple definitions, and these exploitative art films and artistic exploitation films would go on to influence American cult films.&lt;ref name=betz&gt;{{cite book| last=Betz| first=Mark| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=Art, Exploitation, and Underground}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|202–205}}  Much like later cult films, these early exploitation films encouraged audience participation, influenced by live theater and vaudeville.&lt;ref name=alamo /&gt;

Modern cult films grew from 1960s [[counterculture]] and [[underground film]]s, popular among those who rejected mainstream Hollywood films.  These underground film festivals led to the creation of [[midnight movie]]s, which attracted cult followings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patterson|first=John|title=The Weirdo Element|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/02/5|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2013-04-27|date=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''cult film'' itself was an outgrowth of this movement and was first used in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-7374-2|page=234|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntg-1SAKgboC&amp;pg=PA234|chapter=Meta-cult}}&lt;/ref&gt; though ''cult'' had been in use for decades in film analysis with both positive and negative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cult Film Reader|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Mendik|first2=Xavier|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These films were more concerned with cultural significance than the social justice sought by earlier [[avant-garde film]]s.&lt;ref name=shiel /&gt;  Midnight movies became more popular and mainstream, peaking with the release of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), which finally found its audience several years after its release.

Releases from major studios – such as ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998), which was distributed by [[Universal Studios]] – can become cult films when they fail at the box office and develop a cult following through reissues, such as midnight movies, festivals, and home video.  Hollywood films, due to their nature, are more likely to attract this kind of attention, which leads to a mainstreaming effect of cult culture.  With major studios behind them, even financially unsuccessful films can be re-released multiple times, which plays into a trend to capture audiences through repetitious reissues.  The constant use of profanity and drugs in otherwise mainstream, Hollywood films, such as ''The Big Lebowski'', can alienate critics and audiences yet lead to a large cult following among more open-minded demographics not often associated with cult films, such as Wall Street bankers and professional soldiers.  Thus, even comparatively mainstream films can satisfy the traditional demands of a cult film, perceived by fans as transgressive, niche, and uncommercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klinger|first=Barbara|title=Becoming Cult: The Big Lebowski, Replay Culture and Male Fans|url=http://library.uoregon.edu/sites/default/files/data/guides/english/klinger_lebowski.pdf|work=[[University of Oregon]]|accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discussing his reputation for making cult films, [[Bollywood]] director [[Anurag Kashyap]] said, &quot;I didn't set out to make cult films.

The early cult horror films of [[Peter Jackson]] were so strongly associated with his homeland that they affected the international reputation of New Zealand and [[Cinema of New Zealand|its cinema]].  As more artistic films emerged, New Zealand was perceived as a legitimate competitor to Hollywood, which mirrored Jackson's career trajectory.  ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' (1994) acquired its own cult following, became a part of New Zealand's national identity, and paved the way for big-budget, Hollywood-style epics, such as Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wu| first=Harmony H.| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| pages=84–104| chapter=Trading in Horror, Cult, and Matricide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathijs states that cult films and fandom frequently involve nontraditional elements of time and time management.  Fans will often watch films obsessively, an activity that is viewed by the mainstream as wasting time yet can be seen as resisting the commodification of leisure time.  They may also watch films idiosyncratically: sped up, slowed down, frequently paused, or at odd hours.  Cult films themselves subvert traditional views of time – time travel, non-linear narratives, and ambiguous establishments of time are all popular.  Mathijs also identifies specific cult film viewing habits, such as viewing horror films on Halloween, sentimental melodrama on Christmas, and romantic films on Valentine's Day.  These films are often viewed as marathons where fans can gorge themselves on their favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Time Wasted|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-03-29|volume=11|issue=10|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/03/time-wasted-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathijs states that cult films broadcast on Christmas have a nostalgic factor.  These films, ritually watched every season, give a sense of community and shared nostalgia to viewers.  New films often have trouble making inroads against the institutions of ''[[It's A Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947).  These films provide mild criticism of consumerism while encouraging family values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Television and the Yuletide Cult|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-01-08|volume=11|issue=5|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/01/television-and-the-yuletide-cult-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Halloween, on the other hand, allows flaunting society's taboos and testing one's fears.  Horror films have appropriated the holiday, and many horror films debut on Halloween.  Mathijs criticizes the over-cultified, commercialized nature of Halloween and horror films, which feed into each other so much that Halloween has turned into an image or product with no real community.  Mathijs states that Halloween horror conventions can provide the missing community aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mathijs|first=Ernest|title=Threat or Treat: Film, Television, and the Ritual of Halloween|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2009-10-30|volume=11|issue=1|url=http://flowtv.org/2009/10/threat-or-treat-film-television-and-the-ritual-of-halloween-ernest-mathijs-the-university-of-british-columbia/|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their oppositional nature, cult films can produce celebrities.

[[Tim Curry]], despite his acknowledged range as an actor, found casting difficult after he achieved fame in ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show''.  Even when discussing unrelated projects, interviewers frequently bring up the role, which causes him to tire of discussing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Sandi|title=Animated Roles Help Actor Skip Stereotype|url=http://newsok.com/animated-roles-help-actor-skip-stereotype/article/2819410|accessdate=2013-06-04|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|date=2002-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Woronov]], known for her transgressive roles in cult films, eventually transitioned to mainstream films.

Caught between the transgressive elements of her cult film and the mainstream appeal of soft-core pornography, she was unable to work in anything but exploitation films and ''Emmanuelle'' sequels.  Despite her immense popularity and cult following, she would rate only a footnote in most histories of European cinema if she was even mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wimmer|first=Leila|title=Cult Film Stardom: Offbeat Attractions and Processes of Cultification|year=2012|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0-230-29369-4|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ygfq7T_r8jAC&amp;pg=RA4-PT12|editor1-last=Egan|editor1-first=Kate|editor2-last=Thomas|editor2-first=Sarah|chapter=Chapter 11: Forever Emmanuelle: Sylvia Kristel and Soft-Core Cult Stardom|location=Houndsmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[Chloë Sevigny]] has struggled with her reputation as a cult independent film star famous for her daring roles in transgressive films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sexton|first=Jamie|editor1-last=Egan|editor1-first=Kate|editor2-last=Thomas|editor2-first=Sarah|title=Cult Film Stardom: Offbeat Attractions and Processes of Cultification|year=2012|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0-230-29369-4|pages=73–74|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2hQSUYG7RQC&amp;pg=PA73|chapter=Prisoner of Cool: Chloë Sevigny, Alternative Stardom and Image Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cult films can also trap directors.

==Transgression and censorship==
Transgressive films as a distinct artistic movement began in the 1970s.  Unconcerned with genre distinctions, they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of [[European art cinema]] and [[experimental film]], the gritty subject matter of [[Italian neorealism]], and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation.  Some used hardcore pornography and horror, occasionally at the same time.  In the 1980s, filmmaker [[Nick Zedd]] identified this movement as the [[Cinema of Transgression]] and later wrote a manifesto.  Popular in midnight showings, they were mainly limited to large urban areas, which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as &quot;downtown culture&quot;.  These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies, such as ''[[The Village Voice]]''.  Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them, which gave many people their first taste of underground film.&lt;ref name=hawkins&gt;{{cite book| last=Hawkins| first=Joan| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=Midnight Sex–Horror Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224–230}}  Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations, such as giving characters transgressive motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill |first=Mary Frances |title=Darkness rules for Batman fans in Vancouver |url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=375dc063-9e4f-41c6-bd1e-b653d6cb6314 |accessdate=2016-03-29 |newspaper=[[Vancouver Sun]] |date=2008-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416172113/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=375dc063-9e4f-41c6-bd1e-b653d6cb6314 |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions, such as ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' (2000), which broke many rules of teenage [[slasher film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allsop|first=Samara L.|title=Battle Royale – Challenging Global Stereotypes Within the Constructs of a Contemporary Japanese Slasher Film|journal=The Film Journal|year=2002|issue=7|url=http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue7/battleroyale.html|accessdate=2013-06-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629195623/http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue7/battleroyale.html|archivedate=June 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadler|first=Jane|title=The Cult of Aeon Flux|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2007-09-29|volume=6|issue=7|url=http://flowtv.org/2007/09/cult-of-%C3%A6on-flux/|accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Audience participation itself can be transgressive, such as breaking long-standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen.&lt;ref name=spoons&gt;{{cite journal| last=McCulloch| first=Richard| title='Most people bring their own spoons': The Room's Participatory Audiences as Comedy Mediators| journal=Participations| year=2011| volume=8| issue=2| url=http://www.participations.org/Volume%208/Issue%202/2d%20McCulloch.pdf| accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|197}}

According to Mathijs, critical reception is important to a film's perception as cult, through topicality and controversy.  Topicality, which can be regional (such as objection to government funding of the film) or critical (such as philosophical objections to the themes), enables attention and a contextual response.  Cultural topics make the film relevant and can lead to controversy, such as a [[moral panic]], which provides opposition.  Cultural values transgressed in the film, such as sexual promiscuity, can be attacked by proxy, through attacks on the film.  These concerns can vary from culture to culture, and they need not be at all similar.  However, Mathijs says the film must invoke metacommentary for it to be more than simply culturally important.  While referencing previous arguments, critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist.  Taking stances on these varied issues, critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mathijs| first=Ernest| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| pages=109–123| chapter=The Making of a Cult Reputation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films, an example of which would be Rex Reed's [[Rex Reed#Offensive comments in reviews|comments about Korean culture]] in his review of ''[[Oldboy (2003 film)|Oldboy]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name=extreme /&gt;  Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates, such as how Joe Bob Briggs and [[Roger Ebert]] dueled over ''[[I Spit On Your Grave]]'' (1978).

Academic Peter Hutchings, noting the many definitions of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known in part for their excesses.  Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms.  Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema. [[Film censorship]] can make these films obscure and difficult to find, common criteria used to define cult films.  Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors.  Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema.&lt;ref name=hutchings&gt;{{cite book| last=Hutchings| first=Peter| title=Defining Cult Movies: the Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste| year=2003| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| location=Manchester| isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3| editor1-last=Jancovich| editor1-first=Mark| editor2-last=Reboll| editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro| editor3-last=Stringer| editor3-first=Julian| editor4-last=Willis| editor4-first=Andy| chapter=The Argento Effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131–134}}  In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted.&lt;ref name=extreme /&gt;   Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films.&lt;ref name=sick /&gt;  Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jupp|first=Emily|title=Terrible Acting, Flimsy Sets, Wanton Misogyny&amp;nbsp;...

Films that are influenced by unpopular styles or genres can become cult films.  Director [[Jean Rollin]] worked within ''[[fantastique#Cinéma Fantastique|cinéma fantastique]]'', an unpopular genre in modern France.  Influenced by American films and early French fantasists, he drifted between art, exploitation, and pornography.  His films were reviled by critics, but he retained a cult following drawn by the nudity and eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kehr| first=Dave |title=Buxom, Lustful and Thirsty for Blood|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/movies/homevideo/five-cult-horror-films-by-jean-rollin-remastered-for-dvd.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2013-05-17|date=2012-01-27| authorlink=Dave Kehr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[Jess Franco]] chafed under fascist censorship in Spain but became influential in Spain's horror boom of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitz-Gerald|first=Sean|title=Cult Filmmaker Jess Franco Dies at 82|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/jess-franco-1200332021/|accessdate=2013-05-17|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These transgressive films that straddle the line between art and horror may have overlapping cult followings, each with their own interpretation and reasons for appreciating it.&lt;ref name=sick /&gt;  The films that followed Jess Franco were unique in their rejection of mainstream art.  Popular among fans of European horror for their subversiveness and obscurity, these later Spanish films allowed political dissidents to criticize the fascist regime within the cloak of exploitation and horror.  Unlike most exploitation directors, they were not trying to establish a reputation.

The transgressive nature of cult films can lead to their censorship.  During the 1970s and early 1980s, a wave of explicit, graphic exploitation films caused controversy.

Academics have written of how transgressive themes in cult films can be regressive.

==Subcultural appeal and fandom==
Cult films can be used to help define or create groups as a form of [[subcultural capital]]; knowledge of cult films proves that one is &quot;authentic&quot; or &quot;non-mainstream&quot;.

{{anchor|cult blockbuster}}
Matt Hills' concept of the &quot;cult blockbuster&quot; involves cult followings inside larger, mainstream films.  Although these are big budget, mainstream films, they still attract cult followings. The cult fans differentiate themselves from ordinary fans in several ways: longstanding devotion to the film, distinctive interpretations, and [[fan work]]s.  Hills identifies three different cult followings for ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', each with their own fandom separate from the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hills|first=Matt|title=The Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context|year=2006|publisher=Wallflower Press|location=London New York|isbn=978-1-904764-82-3|pages=160–169|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8mxughWAOEC&amp;pg=PA160|editor-first=Ernest|editor-last=Mathijs|chapter=Realising the Cult Blockbuster: The Lord of the Rings Fandom and Residual/Emergent Cult Status in 'The Mainstream'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Emma Pett identifies ''[[Back to the Future]]'' (1985) as another example of a cult blockbuster.  Although the film topped the charts when it was released, it has developed a nostalgic cult following over the years.

Fans, in response to the popularity of these blockbusters, will claim elements for themselves while rejecting others.  For example, in the ''Star Wars'' film series, mainstream [[Jar Jar Binks#Allegations of racial caricature|criticism of Jar Jar Binks]] focused on racial stereotyping; although cult film fans will use that to bolster their arguments, he is rejected because he represents mainstream appeal and marketing.&lt;ref name=trivia&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=Nathan|chapter=The Importance of Trivia|title=Defining Cult Movies: The Cultural Politics of Oppositional Taste|editor1-last=Jancovich|editor1-first=Mark|editor2-last=Reboll|editor2-first=Antionio Lázaro|editor3-last=Stringer|editor3-first=Julian|editor4-last=Willis|editor4-first=Andy|year=2003|publisher=University of Manchester Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0-7190-6631-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|190–193}}  Also, instead of valuing textual rarity, fans of cult blockbusters will value repeat viewings.  They may also engage in behaviors more traditional for fans of cult television and other serial media, as cult blockbusters are often franchised, preconceived as a film series, or both.&lt;ref name=pearson /&gt;  To reduce mainstream accessibility, a film series can be self-reflexive and full of in-jokes that only longtime fans can understand.&lt;ref name=beach /&gt;  Mainstream critics may ridicule commercially successful directors of cult blockbusters, such as [[James Cameron]], [[Michael Bay]], and [[Luc Besson]], whose films have been called simplistic.

Cult films can create their own subculture.  ''Rocky Horror'', originally made to exploit the popularity of [[glam rock|glam subculture]], became what academic Gina Marchetti called a &quot;sub-subculture&quot;, a variant that outlived its parent subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cult Film Reader|last=Marchetti|first=Gina|page=413|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWX4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA412|chapter=Subcultural Studies and the Film Audience|editor1-last=Mathijs|editor1-first=Ernest|editor2-last=Mendik|editor2-first=Xavier|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-335-21923-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although often described as primarily composed of obsessed fans, cult film fandom can include many newer, less experienced members.&lt;ref name=spoons /&gt;{{rp|190–191}}  Familiar with the film's reputation and having watched clips on YouTube, these fans may take the next step and enter the film's fandom.  If they are the majority, they may alter or ignore long-standing traditions, such as audience participation rituals; rituals which lack perceived authenticity may be criticized, but accepted rituals bring subcultural capital to veteran fans who introduce them to the newer members.  Fans who flaunt their knowledge receive negative reactions.  Newer fans may cite the film itself as their reason for attending a showing, but longtime fans often cite the community.  Organized fandoms may spread and become popular as a way of introducing new people to the film, as well as theatrical screenings being privileged by the media and fandom itself.  Fandom can also be used as a process of legitimation.&lt;ref name=spoons /&gt;{{rp|200–211}}  Fans of cult films, as in [[media fandom]], are frequently producers instead of mere consumers.  Unconcerned with traditional views on intellectual property, these fan works are often unsanctioned, transformative, and ignore [[Canon (fiction)|fictional canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Mathijs| first1=Ernest| last2=Sexton| first2=Jamie| title=Cult Cinema| year=2011| publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]| isbn=978-1-4051-7374-2| page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntg-1SAKgboC&amp;pg=PA57| chapter=Fandom and Subculture: Fan Studies: Early Approaches| location=Chichester, West Sussex Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like cult films themselves, magazines and websites dedicated to cult films revel in their self-conscious offensiveness.  They maintain a sense of exclusivity by offending mainstream audiences with misogyny, gore, and racism.  Obsessive trivia can be used to bore mainstream audiences while building up subcultural capital.  Specialist stores on the fringes of society (or websites which prominently partner with hardcore pornographic sites) can be used to reinforce the outsider nature of cult film fandom, especially when they use erotic or gory imagery.&lt;ref name=hollows /&gt;{{rp|45–47}}  By assuming a preexisting knowledge of trivia, non-fans can be excluded.  Previous articles and controversies can also be alluded to without explanation.  Casual readers and non-fans will thus be left out of discussions and debates, as they lack enough information to meaningfully contribute.  When fans like a cult film for the wrong reasons, such as casting or characters aimed at mainstream appeal, they may be ridiculed.  Thus, fandom can keep the mainstream at bay while defining themselves in terms of the &quot;[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]&quot;, a philosophical construct divergent from [[Norm (social)|social norms]].  Commercial aspects of fandom (such as magazines or books) can also be defined in terms of &quot;otherness&quot; and thus valid to consume: consumers purchasing independent or niche publications are discerning consumers, but the mainstream is denigrated.  Irony or self-deprecating humor can also be used.&lt;ref name=trivia /&gt;{{rp|192–197}}  In online communities, different subcultures attracted to transgressive films can clash over values and criteria for subcultural capital.  Even within subcultures, fans who break subcultural scripts, such as denying the affectivity of a disturbing film, will be ridiculed for their lack of authenticity.&lt;ref name=sick /&gt;

These films include financially fruitless and critically scorned films that have become inadvertent comedies to film buffs, such as ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' (1959)&lt;ref name=plan9&gt;{{cite news|last=Palopoli|first=Steve|title=Cult Leader: &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;|url=http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.31.06/cult-0622.html|accessdate=2013-05-03|newspaper=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|date=2006-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''[[The Room (2003 film)|The Room]]'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collis|first=Clark|title=The Crazy Cult of &quot;The Room&quot;|url=https://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2019-11-08|date=2008-12-12|issue=1026}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ugandan action-comedy film ''[[Who Killed Captain Alex?]]'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brandon-judell/who-killed-captain-alex-t_b_7918892.html|title='Who Killed Captain Alex?': The Best Worst Film of 2010, Uganda-Style|last=Judell|first=Brandon|date=2015-08-04|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Paul Verhoeven]]'s ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995) bombed in theaters but developed a cult following on video.

Chuck Kleinhans states that the difference between a guilty pleasure and a cult film can be as simple as the number of fans; David Church raises the question of how many people it takes to form a cult following, especially now that home video makes fans difficult to count.&lt;ref name=cineaste /&gt;  As these cult films become more popular, they can bring varied responses from fans that depend on different interpretations, such as [[camp (style)|camp]], irony, genuine affection, or combinations thereof.

===Nostalgia===
According to academic Brigid Cherry, [[nostalgia]] &quot;is a strong element of certain kinds of cult appeal.&quot;&lt;ref name=borrowings /&gt; When [[Veoh]] added many cult films to their site, they cited nostalgia as a factor for their popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Termen|first=Amanda|title=It's the Site of the Living Dead, as Cult Films Hit Web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1025_3-6047466.html|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=2013-08-01|date=2006-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic I.&amp;nbsp;Q. Hunter describes cult films as &quot;New Hollywood ''in extremis''&quot; and a form of nostalgia for that period.  Ernest Mathijs instead states that cult films use nostalgia as a form of resistance against progress and capitalistic ideas of a time-based economy.&lt;ref name=cineaste /&gt;  By virtue of the time travel plot, ''Back to the Future'' permits nostalgia for both the 1950s and 1980s.  Many members of its nostalgic cult following are too young to have been alive during those periods, which Emma Pett interprets as fondness for retro aesthetics, nostalgia for when they saw the film rather than when it was released, and looking to the past to find a better time period.&lt;ref name=nostalgia /&gt;  Similarly, films directed by [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] have taken hold in midnight movie venues, trading off of nostalgia for the 1980s and an ironic appreciation for their optimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beale|first=Lewis|title=John Hughes Versus the Vampires: The Dilemma of the Midnight Movie|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/19/movies/19beal.html|accessdate=2013-08-01|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathijs and Sexton describe ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978) as a film nostalgic about an imagined past that has acquired a nostalgic cult following.  Other cult films, such as ''[[Streets of Fire]]'' (1984), create a new fictional world based on nostalgic views of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|title=Cult Cinema|year=2011|publisher=[[Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4443-9643-0|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&amp;pg=PT217|accessdate=2013-08-01|chapter=Cult Cinema and Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cult films may also subvert nostalgia, such as ''The Big Lebowski'', which introduces many nostalgic elements and then reveals them as fake and hollow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boudreau|first=Emily|title=The History and Meaning of The Dude's Abiding|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/big-lebowski-retrospective-notebook|accessdate=2013-08-01|newspaper=[[Michigan Daily]]|date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Lee of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' identifies the retro aesthetic and nostalgic pastiche in films such as ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' as factors in its popularity among midnight movie crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Nathan|title=How 'Donnie Darko' Refused to Die|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/how-donnie-darko-refused-to-die/134/|accessdate=2013-08-01|newspaper=[[New York Sun]]|date=2004-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midnight movies===
Author Tomas Crowder-Taraborrelli describes [[midnight movie]]s as a reaction against the political and cultural conservatism in America,&lt;ref name=midnight /&gt;{{rp|27}} and Joan Hawkins identifies the movement as running the gamut from anarchist to [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], united in their anti-establishment attitude and punk aesthetic.&lt;ref name=hawkins /&gt;{{rp|223}} These films are resistant to simple categorization and are defined by the fanaticism and ritualistic behaviors of their audiences.  Midnight movies require a night life and an audience willing to invest themselves actively.&lt;ref name=midnight&gt;{{cite book|last=Crowder-Taraborrelli|first=Tomas F.|title=Cult Pop Culture: How the Fringe Became Mainstream: How the Fringe Became Mainstream, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-313-35781-7|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqd92sX1hAoC&amp;pg=PA27|editor-first=Bob|editor-last=Batchelor|chapter=Midnight Movies and the Phenomenon of the Cult Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27–30}}  Hawkins states that these films took a rather bleak point of view due to the living conditions of the artists and the economic prospects of the 1970s.  Like the surrealists and dadaists, they not only satirically attacked society but also the very structure of film – a counter-cinema that deconstructs narrative and traditional processes.&lt;ref name=hawkins /&gt;{{rp|224–226}}  In the late 1980s and 1990s, midnight movies transitioned from underground showings to home video viewings; eventually, a desire for community brought a resurgence, and ''The Big Lebowski'' kick-started a new generation.  Demographics shifted, and more hip and mainstream audiences were drawn to them.  Although studios expressed skepticism, large audiences were drawn to box office flops, such as ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001), ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'' (1979) and ''[[Office Space]]'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palopoli|first=Steve|title=Cult Rapture|journal=[[Metro Silicon Valley]]|date=2003-09-17|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/09.17.03/cult-0338.html|accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern midnight movies retain their popularity and have been strongly diverging from mainstream films shown at midnight.  Mainstream cinemas, eager to disassociate themselves from negative associations and increase profits, have begun abandoning midnight screenings.  Although classic midnight movies have dropped off in popularity, they still bring reliable crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olsen|first1=Mark|last2=Kaufman|first2=Amy|title=Moviegoing at the Midnight Hour|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/04/entertainment/la-et-mn-ca-new-midnight-movies-20130505|accessdate=2013-07-28|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and exploitation===
Although seemingly at odds with each other, [[art film|art]] and [[exploitation film]]s are frequently treated as equal and interchangeable in cult fandom, listed alongside each other and described in similar terms: their ability to provoke a response.  The most exploitative aspects of art films are thus played up and their academic recognition ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Joan|title=Cutting Edge: Art-Horror and the Horrific Avant-garde|year=2000|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8166-3413-0|pages=3–4|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68whFPvH5VEC&amp;pg=PA3|chapter=Sleaze-Mania, Euro-trash, and High Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This flattening of culture follows the popularity of [[post-structuralism]], which rejects a hierarchy of artistic merit and equates exploitation and art.&lt;ref name=betz /&gt;{{rp|202–203}}  Mathijs and Sexton state that although cult films are not synonymous with exploitation, as is occasionally assumed, this is a key component; they write that exploitation, which exists on the fringes of the mainstream and deals with [[taboo]] subjects, is well-suited for cult followings.&lt;ref name=exploitation&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ernest|last1=Mathijs|first2=Jamie|last2=Sexton|title=Cult Cinema|year=2012|publisher=[[Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-1-4443-9643-0|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&amp;pg=PT180|chapter=Exploitation and B Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic David Andrews writes that cult softcore films are &quot;the most masculinized, youth-oriented, populist, and openly pornographic softcore area.&quot;&lt;ref name=andrews&gt;{{cite book|title=Soft in the Middle: The Contemporary Softcore Feature in Its Contexts|last=Andrews|first=David|publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8142-1022-2|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zk-F1B7RUfcC&amp;pg=PT23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sexploitation films of [[Russ Meyer]] were among the first to abandon all hypocritical pretenses of morality and were technically proficient enough to gain a cult following.  His persistent vision saw him received as an auteur worthy of academic study; director John Waters attributes this to Meyer's ability to create complicated, sexually charged films without resorting to explicit sex.&lt;ref name=meyer /&gt;{{rp|5–7,14}}  Myrna Oliver described [[Doris Wishman]]'s exploitation films as &quot;crass, coarse, and camp&amp;nbsp;... perfect fodder for a cult following.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|title=Doris Wishman; Exploitation Film Director, Cult Favorite|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/21/local/me-wishman21|accessdate=2013-07-29|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=2002-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Sick films&quot;, the most disturbing and graphically transgressive films, have their own distinct cult following; these films transcend their roots in exploitation, horror, and art films.&lt;ref name=mondo&gt;{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4443-9642-3|pages=105–107|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EmSqIo4I-QC&amp;pg=PA105|chapter=Transgression and Freakery}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960s and 1970s America, exploitation and art films shared audiences and marketing, especially in New York City's [[grindhouse]] cinemas.&lt;ref name=betz/&gt;{{rp|219–220}}

===B and genre films===
Mathijs and Sexton state that [[film genre|genre]] is an important part of cult films; cult films will often mix, mock, or exaggerate the tropes associated with traditional genres.&lt;ref name=mondo/&gt;  Science fiction, fantasy, and horror are known for their large and dedicated cult followings; as science fiction films become more popular, fans emphasize non-mainstream and less commercial aspects of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-7374-2|pages=205–207|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntg-1SAKgboC&amp;pg=PA205|chapter=Cult Science Fiction Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B film]]s, which are often conflated with exploitation, are as important to cult films as exploitation.&lt;ref name=exploitation/&gt;  Teodor Reljic of ''[[Malta Today]]'' states that cult B films are a realistic goal for Malta's burgeoning film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/arts/film/38734/are_cult_films_a_possibility_for_malta|title=Are 'cult' films a possibility for Malta?|last=Reljic|first=Teodor|work=[[Malta Today]]|date=2014-05-08|accessdate=2014-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genre films, B films that strictly adhere to genre limitations, can appeal to cult film fans: given their transgressive excesses, horror films are likely to become to cult films;&lt;ref name=midnight /&gt;{{rp|33}} films like ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'' (1999) highlight the importance of cult followings and fandom to science fiction;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geraghty|first=Lincoln|title=American science fiction film and television.|year=2009|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-84520-795-3|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agDbWF4qJCsC&amp;pg=PA102}}&lt;/ref&gt; and authentic martial arts skills in [[Hong Kong action cinema|Hong Kong action films]] can drive them to become cult favorites.&lt;ref name=hunt /&gt;{{rp|157–159}}  Cult musicals can range from the traditional, such as ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952), which appeal to cult audiences through nostalgia, camp, and spectacle, to the more non-traditional, such as ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (1990), which parodies musicals, and ''Rocky Horror'', which uses a rock soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cult Cinema|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4443-9642-3|pages=175–177|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EmSqIo4I-QC&amp;pg=PA175|chapter=Cult Cinema and Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Romantic fairy tale ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987) failed to attract audiences in its original release, as the studio did not know how to market it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2011/10/07/princess-bride-reunion/|title=The Princess Bride cast, director talk inconceivable(!) cult hit|last=Rottenberg|first=Josh|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2011-10-07|accessdate=2019-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The freedom and excitement associated with cars can be an important part of drawing cult film fans to genre films, and they can signify action and danger with more ambiguity than a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/the-auto-motive-why-cars-drive-cult-movies/article11374759/|title=The auto motive: Why cars drive cult movies|last=Pevere|first=Geoff|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Ad Week]]'' writes that cult B films, when released on home video, market themselves and need only enough advertising to raise curiosity or nostalgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/streamy-romance-americans-love-affair-b-movies-goes-digital-157724|title=Streamy Romance: Americans' Love Affair With B Movies Goes Digital|work=[[Ad Week]]|date=2014-05-21|accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animation===
[[Animation]] can provide wide open vistas for stories. The French film ''[[Fantastic Planet]]'' (1972) explored ideas beyond the limits of traditional, live-action science fiction films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yagoda|first=Ben|title='Light Years' Ahead Of The Pack Animation Brings Rene Laloux's Sci-fi Vision To Life|url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-04-04/news/26253782_1_rene-laloux-light-years-david-johansen|accessdate=2013-08-01|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=1988-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phil Hoad of ''[[The Guardian]]'' identifies ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (1988) as introducing violent, adult Japanese animation (known as [[anime]]) to the West and paving the way for later works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoad|first=Phil|title=Akira: the Future-Tokyo Story that Brought Anime West|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/10/akira-anime-japanese-cartoon-manga|accessdate=2013-07-31|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anime, according to academic Brian Ruh, is not a cult genre, but the lack of individual fandoms inside [[anime fandom]] itself lends itself to a bleeding over of cult attention and can help spread works internationally.  Anime, which is often highly turned into series, provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity.

Cult films are often approached in terms of [[auteur theory]], which states that the director's creative vision drives a film.  This has fallen out of favor in academia, creating a disconnect between cult film fans and critics.&lt;ref name=hutchings /&gt;{{rp|135}}  Matt Hills states that auteur theory can help to create cult films; fans that see a film as continuing a director's creative vision are likely to accept it as cult.&lt;ref name=cineaste /&gt;  According to academic Greg Taylor, auteur theory also helped to popularize cult films when middlebrow audiences found an accessible way to approach avant-garde film criticism.  Auteur theory provided an alternative culture for cult film fans while carrying the weight of scholarship.  By requiring repeated viewings and extensive knowledge of details, auteur theory naturally appealed to cult film fans.  Taylor further states that this was instrumental in allowing cult films to break through to the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Greg|title=Artists in the Audience: Cults, Camp, and American Film Criticism|year=2001|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-08955-3|pages=87–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fukKSOOc0dYC&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic Joe Tompkins states that this auteurism is often highlighted when mainstream success occurs.  This may take the place of – and even ignore – political readings of the director.  Cult films and directors may be celebrated for their transgressive content, daring, and independence, but Tompkins argues that mainstream recognition requires they be palatable to corporate interests who stand to gain much from the mainstreaming of cult film culture.  While critics may champion revolutionary aspects of filmmaking and political interpretation, Hollywood studios and other corporate interests will instead highlight only the aspects that they wish to legitimize in their own films, such as sensational exploitation.  Someone like [[George Romero]], whose films are both transgressive and subversive, will have the transgressive aspects highlighted while the subversive aspects are ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tompkins|first=Joe|title=&quot;They Have the Oscars&quot;: Oppositional Telebranding and the Cult of the Horror Auteur|journal=[[Flow (journal)|Flow]]|date=2010-07-16|volume=12|issue=4|url=http://flowtv.org/2010/07/oppositional-telebranding-and-the-cult-of-the-horror-auteur/|accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
