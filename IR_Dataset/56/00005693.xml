'''Claude Elwood Shannon''' (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American [[mathematician]], [[electrical engineering|electrical engineer]], and [[cryptography|cryptographer]] known as &quot;the father of [[information theory]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmfrs&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = Ioan | authorlink = Ioan James | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.2009.0015 | title = Claude Elwood Shannon 30 April 1916 – 24 February 2001 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 55 | pages = 257–265 | year = 2009 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w39w3RL8h2VAQAGOJBYA!!?LMSG_CABINET=Bell_Labs&amp;LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Features/News_Feature_Detail_000025|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722011711/http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/%21ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4w39w3RL8h2VAQAGOJBYA%21%21?LMSG_CABINET=Bell_Labs&amp;LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Features%2FNews_Feature_Detail_000025|title=Bell Labs Advances Intelligent Networks|archivedate=July 22, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon is noted for having founded information theory with a landmark paper, &quot;[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]&quot;, that he published in 1948.

He is also well known for founding [[digital circuit]] design theory in 1937, when—as a 21-year-old [[master's degree]] student at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT)—he wrote [[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits|his thesis]] demonstrating that electrical applications of [[Boolean algebra]] could construct any logical numerical relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortune&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Poundstone |first=William |title=Fortune's Formula : The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street |location= |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8090-4599-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shannon contributed to the field of [[cryptanalysis]] for national defense during [[World War II]], including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure [[telecommunication]]s.

==Biography==

===Childhood===
The Shannon family lived in [[Gaylord, Michigan]], and Claude was born in a hospital in nearby [[Petoskey, Michigan|Petoskey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bmfrs&quot;/&gt; His father, Claude Sr. (1862–1934) was a businessman and for a while, a judge of [[probate]] and his mother, [[Mabel Wolf Shannon]] (1890–1945), was a language teacher, who also served as the principal of [[Gaylord High School]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}

Most of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a barbed-wire [[telegraph]] system to a friend's house a half-mile away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-claude-shannon-b-1916-bit-player.html|title=THE LIVES THEY LIVED: CLAUDE SHANNON, B. 1916; Bit Player|first=James|last=Gleick|date=December 30, 2001|work=[[The New York Times]] |authorlink=James Gleick}}&lt;/ref&gt; While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the [[Western Union]] company.

His childhood hero was [[Thomas Edison]], whom he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of [[John Ogden (colonist)|John Ogden]] (1609–1682), a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIT obituary&quot;&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/shannon.html MIT Professor Claude Shannon dies; was founder of digital communications], MIT&amp;nbsp;— News office, Cambridge, Massachusetts, February 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sloane-wyner93&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Claude Elwood Shannon: Collected Papers | editor1-first=N.J.A | editor1-last=Sloane | editor2-first=Aaron D. | editor2-last=Wyner | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]/[[IEEE Press]] | isbn=978-0-7803-0434-5 | date=1993 | url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0780304349.html | accessdate=9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon was [[Apoliticism|apolitical]] and an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System|year=2010|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-374-70708-8|page=18|author=William Poundstone|quote=Shannon described himself as an atheist and was outwardly apolitical.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 13, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logic circuits===
In 1932, Shannon entered the [[University of Michigan]], where he was introduced to the work of [[George Boole]]. He graduated in 1936 with two [[bachelor's degree]]s: one in [[electrical engineering]] and the other in [[mathematics]].

In 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in [[electrical engineering]] at [[MIT]], where he worked on [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyzer]], an early [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Claude_E._Shannon |title=Claude E. Shannon, an oral history |author=Robert Price |work=IEEE Global History Network |year=1982 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying the complicated ''ad hoc'' circuits of this analyzer, Shannon designed [[switching circuit]]s based on [[Boole's inequality|Boole's concepts]]. In 1937, he wrote his [[master's degree]] thesis, ''[[A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SymbolicAnalysis&quot;&gt;Claude Shannon, [https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11173 &quot;A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits&quot;], unpublished MS Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, August 10, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; A paper from this thesis was published in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal
|last = Shannon

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Shannon proved that his switching circuits could be used to simplify the arrangement of the [[electromechanical]] [[relay]]s that were used then in [[public switched telephone network|telephone call routing switches]]. Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a 4-bit full adder.&lt;ref name=&quot;SymbolicAnalysis&quot; /&gt;

Using this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all [[Computer|electronic digital computers]]. Shannon's work became the foundation of [[digital circuit]] design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after [[World War II]]. The theoretical rigor of Shannon's work superseded the ''ad hoc'' methods that had prevailed previously. [[Howard Gardner]] called Shannon's thesis &quot;possibly the most important, and also the most noted, master's thesis of the century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mind's New Science: A History of the Cognitive Revolution |first=Howard |last=Gardner |authorlink=Howard Gardner |publisher=Basic Books |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-465-04635-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mindsnewscience00howa/page/144 144] |url=https://archive.org/details/mindsnewscience00howa/page/144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shannon received his PhD from MIT in 1940. Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], in order to develop a mathematical formulation for [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. This research resulted in Shannon's PhD thesis, called ''An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics''.&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Shannon, &quot;An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics&quot;, Ph.D. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1940, [https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/11174 online text at MIT] — Contains a biography on pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Shannon became a [[National Research Fellow]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and [[mathematician]]s such as [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[John von Neumann]], and he also had occasional encounters with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Kurt Gödel]]. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical [[information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Erico Marui Guizzo, “[http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/39429/54526133-MIT.pdf?sequence=2 The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory]” (M.S. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Humanities, Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies, 2003), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime research===
Shannon then joined [[Bell Labs]] to work on [[fire-control system]]s and [[cryptography]] during [[World War II]], under a contract with section D-2 (Control Systems section) of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC).

Shannon is credited with the invention of [[signal-flow graph]]s, in 1942. He discovered the topological gain formula while investigating the functional operation of an analog computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = NASAP-70 User's and Programmer's manual|last = Okrent|first = Howard|publisher = School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California at Los Angeles|year = 1970|isbn = |location = Los Angeles, California|pages = 3–9|first2 = Lawrence P.|last2 = McNamee|chapter-url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710025849.pdf|chapter = 3. 3 Flowgraph Theory|accessdate = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For two months early in 1943, Shannon came into contact with the leading British mathematician [[Alan Turing]]. Turing had been posted to Washington to share with the [[U.S. Navy]]'s cryptanalytic service the methods used by the [[Government Communications Headquarters|British Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]] to break the ciphers used by the [[Kriegsmarine]] [[U-boat]]s in the north [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=Hodges1992&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodges | first = Andrew | author-link = Andrew Hodges | year = 1992 | title = Alan Turing: The Enigma | location = London | publisher = [[Vintage Books|Vintage]] | pages = 243–252 | isbn = 978-0-09-911641-7| title-link = Alan Turing: The Enigma }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also interested in the encipherment of speech and to this end spent time at Bell Labs. Shannon and Turing met at teatime in the cafeteria.&lt;ref name=Hodges1992 /&gt; Turing showed Shannon his 1936 paper that defined what is now known as the &quot;[[Universal Turing machine]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Turing | first= A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | year = 1936 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 42 | pages = 230–65 | doi= 10.1112/plms/s2-42.1.230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Turing | first = A.M. | publication-date = 1937 | title = On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem: A correction | periodical = Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society | series = 2 | volume = 43 | pages = 544–6 | doi = 10.1112/plms/s2-43.6.544 | year = 1938 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This impressed Shannon, as many of its ideas complemented his own.

In 1945, as the war was coming to an end, the NDRC was issuing a summary of technical reports as a last step prior to its eventual closing down. Inside the volume on fire control, a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by Shannon, [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], and [[Hendrik Wade Bode]], formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with &quot;the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Mindell, ''Between Human and Machine: Feedback, Control, and Computing Before Cybernetics'', (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press), 2004, pp. 319-320. {{ISBN|0-8018-8057-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it modeled the problem in terms of [[Data processing|data]] and [[signal processing]] and thus heralded the coming of the [[Information Age]].

Shannon's work on cryptography was even more closely related to his later publications on [[communication theory]].&lt;ref&gt;David Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', rev. ed., (New York: Simon and Schuster), 1996, pp. 743–751. {{ISBN|0-684-83130-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the war, he prepared a classified memorandum for [[Bell Telephone Labs]] entitled &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography&quot;, dated September 1945. A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as &quot;[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]&quot; in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously and that &quot;they were so close together you couldn’t separate them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', p. 744.&lt;/ref&gt; In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to &quot;develop these results … in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Erico Marui Guizzo, [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf &quot;The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory&quot;], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528182200/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf |date=May 28, 2008 }} unpublished MS thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2003, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the [[cryptographic]] [[one-time pad]] is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in October 1949. He also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Claude (1949). &quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot;. Bell System Technical Journal 28 (4): 656–715.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information theory===
In 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the ''Bell System Technical Journal''. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the [[information]] a sender wants to transmit. In this fundamental work, he used tools in probability theory, developed by [[Norbert Wiener]], which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure of the information content in a message, which is a measure of uncertainty reduced by the message, while essentially inventing the field of [[information theory]]. In 1949 Claude Shannon and [[Robert Fano]] devised a systematic way to assign code words based on probabilities of blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1069 1069]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, known as [[Shannon–Fano coding]], was first proposed in the 1948 article.

The book, co-authored with [[Warren Weaver]], ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'', reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver pointed out that the word &quot;information&quot; in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in [[John Robinson Pierce]]'s ''Symbols, Signals, and Noise''.

Information theory's fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] was further established in 1951, in his article &quot;Prediction and Entropy of Printed English&quot;, showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English – giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

Another notable paper published in 1949 is &quot;[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]&quot;, a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography, in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

He returned to MIT to hold an endowed chair in 1956.

===Teaching at MIT===
In 1956 Shannon joined the MIT faculty to work in the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT|Research Laboratory of Electronics]] (RLE). He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978.

===Later life===
Shannon developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] and spent the last few years of his life in a [[nursing home]]; he died in 2001, survived by his wife, a son and daughter, and two granddaughters.&lt;ref name =SW&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Shannon.html | title=Shannon, Claude Elwood (1916–2001) | first=Eric | last=Weisstein | work=World of Scientific Biography | publisher=[[Wolfram Research]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/shannon_claude.htm | title=Claude Shannon – computer science theory | work=www.thocp.net | publisher=The History of Computing Project | accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hobbies and inventions ===

[[File:Minivac 601.jpg|thumb|The [[Minivac 601]], a digital computer trainer designed by Shannon.]]

Outside of Shannon's academic pursuits, he was interested in [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], and [[chess]]. He also invented many devices, including a [[Roman numeral]] computer called THROBAC, [[robot juggling|juggling machines]], and a flame-throwing [[trumpet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?module=people&amp;type=related&amp;kv=12372 | title=People: Shannon, Claude Elwood | publisher=[[MIT Museum]] | accessdate=9 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He built a device that could solve the [[Rubik's Cube]] puzzle.&lt;ref name=&quot;MIT obituary&quot;/&gt;

Shannon designed the [[Minivac 601]], a [[digital computer]] trainer to teach business people about how computers functioned. It was sold by the [[Scientific Development Corp]] starting in 1961.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

He is also considered the co-inventor of the first [[wearable computer]] along with [[Edward O. Thorp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wearable computer&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/graphics/courses/mobwear/resources/thorp-iswc98.pdf|title=The Invention of the First Wearable Computer Online paper by Edward O. Thorp of Edward O. Thorp &amp; Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was used to improve the odds when playing [[roulette]].

===Personal life===
Shannon married Norma Levor, a wealthy, Jewish, left-wing intellectual in January 1940. The marriage ended in divorce after about a year. Levor later married [[Ben Barzman]].&lt;ref name=SoniGoodman&gt;{{cite book

Shannon met his second wife [[Betty Shannon]] (née Mary Elizabeth Moore) when she was a numerical analyst at Bell Labs. They were married in 1949.&lt;ref name=SW /&gt; Betty assisted Claude in building some of his most famous inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/betty-shannon-unsung-mathematical-genius/|title=Betty Shannon, Unsung Mathematical Genius|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2017-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude and Betty Shannon had three children, Robert James Shannon, Andrew Moore Shannon, and Margarita Shannon, and raised their family in [[Winchester, Massachusetts]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}

===Tributes===
There are six statues of Shannon sculpted by [[Eugene Daub]]: one at the University of Michigan; one at MIT in the [[MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems|Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems]]; one in Gaylord, Michigan; one at the [[University of California, San Diego]]; one at Bell Labs; and another at [[AT&amp;T Laboratories|AT&amp;T Shannon Labs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/shannonstatue/|title=Claude Shannon Statue Dedications|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731230211/http://www.eecs.umich.edu/shannonstatue/|archivedate=July 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[breakup of the Bell System]], the part of Bell Labs that remained with [[AT&amp;T Corporation]] was named Shannon Labs in his honor.

According to [[Neil Sloane]], an [[AT&amp;T Fellow]] who co-edited Shannon's large collection of papers in 1993, the perspective introduced by Shannon's communication theory (now called [[information theory]]) is the foundation of the [[Digital Revolution|digital revolution]], and every device containing a [[microprocessor]] or [[microcontroller]] is a conceptual descendant of Shannon's publication in 1948:&lt;ref name=&quot;shannon paper&quot;&gt;C. E. Shannon: &quot;A mathematical theory of communication.&quot; Bell System Technical Journal, vol. 27, pp. 379–423 and 623–656, July and October 1948&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;He's one of the great men of the century. Without him, none of the things we know today would exist. The whole digital revolution started with him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;star ledger&quot;&gt;Bell Labs digital guru dead at 84&amp;nbsp;— Pioneer scientist led high-tech revolution (''[[Star-Ledger|The Star-Ledger]]'', obituary by Kevin Coughlin February 27, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The unit [[shannon (unit)|shannon]] is named after Claude Shannon.

==Other work==
[[File:Shannon and mouse.png|thumb|Shannon and his [[electromechanical]] mouse ''Theseus'' (named after [[Theseus]] from Greek mythology) which he tried to have solve the maze in one of the first experiments in [[artificial intelligence]].]]

===Shannon's mouse===
&quot;Theseus&quot;, created in 1950, was a mechanical mouse controlled by an electromechanical relay circuit that enabled it to move around a [[maze|labyrinth]] of 25 squares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot; /&gt; The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot; /&gt; The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot; /&gt; Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell Labs acknowledgement&quot; /&gt;

===Shannon's estimate for the complexity of chess===
{{Main|Shannon number}}
In 1949 Shannon completed a paper (published in March 1950) which estimates the [[Game complexity|game-tree complexity]] of [[chess]], which is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;120&lt;/sup&gt;. This number is now often referred to as the &quot;[[Shannon number]]&quot;, and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game's complexity. The number is often cited as one of the barriers to [[Solving chess|solving the game of chess]] using an exhaustive analysis (i.e. [[Brute-force search|brute force analysis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Claude Shannon | title = Programming a Computer for Playing Chess | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume = 41 | issue = 314 | year = 1950 | url = http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf | access-date = January 2, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100706211229/http://archive.computerhistory.org/projects/chess/related_materials/text/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon/2-0%20and%202-1.Programming_a_computer_for_playing_chess.shannon.062303002.pdf | archive-date = July 6, 2010 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. James Grime.

===Shannon's computer chess program===
On March 9, 1949, Shannon presented a paper called &quot;Programming a Computer for playing Chess&quot;. The paper was presented at the National Institute for Radio Engineers Convention in New York. He described how to program a computer to play [[chess]] based on position scoring and move selection. He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950 it was published in ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess, and using a computer to [[Solving chess|solve the game]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://billwall.phpwebhosting.com/articles/computer_early_chess.htm|title=Early Computer Chess Programs by Bill Wall|website=billwall.phpwebhosting.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a [[minimax]] procedure, based on an [[evaluation function]] of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. ''Material'' was counted according to the usual [[chess piece relative value]] (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Artificial Dreams: The Quest for Non-biological Intelligence | author = Hamid Reza Ekbia | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-87867-8 | page = 46 | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered some positional factors, subtracting ½ point for each [[doubled pawn]], [[backward pawn]], and [[isolated pawn]]; ''[[mobility (chess)|mobility]]'' was incorporated by adding 0.1 point for each legal move available.

===Shannon's maxim===
Shannon formulated a version of [[Kerckhoffs's principle|Kerckhoffs' principle]] as &quot;The enemy knows the system&quot;. In this form it is known as &quot;Shannon's maxim&quot;.
