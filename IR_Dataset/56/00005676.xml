{{infobox californium}}
'''Californium''' is a [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Cf''' and [[atomic number]] 98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding [[curium]] with [[alpha particle]]s ([[helium-4]] [[ion]]s). It is an [[actinide]] element, the sixth [[transuranium element]] to be [[synthetic element|synthesized]], and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]] (after [[einsteinium]]). The element was named after the university and the state of [[California]].

Two [[crystalline form]]s exist for californium under normal pressure: one above and one below {{convert|900|C|-1}}. A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. [[Compounds of californium]] are dominated by the +3 [[oxidation state]]. The most stable of californium's twenty known [[isotope]]s is californium-251, which has a [[half-life]] of 898&amp;nbsp;years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.{{efn|name=age of earth}} Californium-252, with a half-life of about 2.645&amp;nbsp;years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the United States and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in Russia.

Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain [[isotopes of californium]] to emit [[neutron]]s. For example, californium can be used to help start up [[nuclear reactor]]s, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using [[neutron diffraction]] and [[neutron spectroscopy]]. Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; [[oganesson]] (element&amp;nbsp;118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with [[calcium-48]] ions. Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of [[red blood cell]]s by [[bioaccumulating]] in skeletal tissue.

== Characteristics ==

=== Physical properties ===
Californium is a silvery white [[actinide]] metal{{sfn|Jakubke|1994|p=166}} with a [[melting point]] of {{convert|900|±|30|C|-1}} and an estimated [[boiling point]] of {{convert|1745|K|-1}}.{{sfn|Haire|2006|pp=1522–1523}} The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade. Californium metal starts to vaporize above {{convert|300|C|-1}} when exposed to a vacuum.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1526}} Below {{convert|51|K|C F|0|abbr=on}}&lt;!-- KEEP KELVIN --&gt; californium metal is either [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] or [[Ferrimagnetism|ferrimagnetic]] (it acts like a magnet), between 48 and 66&amp;nbsp;K it is [[antiferromagnetic]] (an intermediate state), and above {{convert|160|K|C F}}&lt;!-- KEEP IN KELVIN (−110&amp;nbsp;°C) --&gt; it is [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] (external magnetic fields can make it magnetic).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1525}} It forms [[alloy]]s with [[lanthanide]] metals but little is known about them.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1526}}

The element has two [[Crystal structure|crystalline forms]] under 1 standard atmosphere of pressure: a double-[[Close-packing of spheres|hexagonal close-packed]] form dubbed alpha (α) and a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] form designated beta (β).{{efn|A double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) [[unit cell]] consists of two hexagonal close-packed structures that share a common hexagonal plane, giving dhcp an ABACABAC sequence.{{sfn|Szwacki|2010|p=80}} }} The α form exists below 600–800&amp;nbsp;°C with a density of 15.10&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the β form exists above 600–800&amp;nbsp;°C with a density of 8.74&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} At 48&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|GPa]] of pressure the β form changes into an [[orthorhombic crystal system]] due to delocalization of the atom's [[Electron shell|5f electrons]], which frees them to bond.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}{{efn|The three lower-mass transplutonium elements—[[americium]], [[curium]], and [[berkelium]]—require much less pressure to delocalize their 5f electrons.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}} }}

The [[bulk modulus]] of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk modulus is {{val|50|5|u=GPa}}, which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70&amp;nbsp;GPa).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1522}}

Californium exhibits oxidation states of 4, 3, or 2. It typically forms eight or nine bonds to surrounding atoms or ions. Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3+ valence actinide elements{{sfn|Seaborg|2004}} and the element [[dysprosium]], which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table.{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4.8}} The element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature, with the rate increasing when moisture is added.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} Californium reacts when heated with [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], or a [[chalcogen]] (oxygen family element); reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous [[mineral acid]]s are rapid.{{sfn|O'Neil|2006|p=276}} &lt;!-- EXPLAIN Only californium-249 is suitable for chemical study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emeleus&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Emeleus|first=H.

Californium is only [[aqueous solution|water-soluble]] as the californium(III) [[cation]]. Attempts to [[redox|reduce or oxidize]] the +3 ion in solution have failed.{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4.8}} The element forms a water-soluble [[chloride]], [[nitrate]], [[perchlorate]], and [[sulfate]] and is precipitated as a [[fluoride]], [[oxalate]], or [[hydroxide]].{{sfn|Seaborg|2004}} Californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties, as is observed in the californium borate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unusual structure, bonding and properties in a californium borate|journal = Nature Chemistry|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 1755-4330|pages = 387–392|volume = 6|issue = 5|doi = 10.1038/nchem.1896|pmid = 24755589|language = en|first = Matthew J.|last = Polinski|first2 = Edward B.

=== Isotopes ===
{{main|Isotopes of californium}}
Twenty [[radioisotope]]s of californium have been characterized, the most stable being californium-251 with a [[half-life]] of 898 years, californium-249 with a half-life of 351 years, californium-250 with a half-life of 13.08 years, and californium-252 with a half-life of 2.645 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;NNDC2008&quot; /&gt; All the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than a year, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NNDC2008&quot; /&gt; The isotopes of californium range in [[mass number]] from 237 to 256.&lt;ref name=&quot;NNDC2008&quot; /&gt;

Californium-249 is formed from the [[beta decay]] of berkelium-249, and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a [[nuclear reactor]].{{sfn|CRC|2006|p=4.8}} Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high [[neutron capture]]) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high [[neutron cross-section]]).{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1504}}

Californium-252 is a very strong [[neutron]] emitter, which makes it extremely [[radioactive]] and harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Hicks, D.

To produce californium, a microgram-sized target of curium-242 ({{nuclide|curium|242}}) was bombarded with 35&amp;nbsp;MeV-[[alpha particle]]s ({{nuclide|helium|4}}) in the {{convert|60|in|m|2|adj=mid|-diameter}} [[cyclotron]] at Berkeley, which produced californium-245 ({{nuclide|californium|245}}) plus one [[free neutron]] ({{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}).{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}}
&lt;!-- Weeks &amp; Leichester 1968 p. 849 gives product as 98-244 --&gt;
:{{nuclide|curium|242}} + {{nuclide|helium|4}} → {{nuclide|californium|245}} + {{su|b=0|p=1}}{{SubatomicParticle|neutron}}
Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment,{{sfn|Seaborg|1996|p=82}} and these atoms had a half-life of 44&amp;nbsp;minutes.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=103}}

The discoverers named the new element after the university and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named.{{sfn|Weeks|Leichester|1968|p=849}}{{efn|[[Europium]], in the sixth period directly above element 95, was named for the continent it was discovered on, so element 95 was named [[americium]]. Element 96 was named [[curium]] for [[Marie Curie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] as an analog to the naming of [[gadolinium]], which was named for the scientist and engineer [[Johan Gadolin]]. [[Terbium]] was named for the village it was discovered in, so element 97 was named [[berkelium]].{{sfn|Weeks|Leichester|1968|p=848}} }} However, the element directly above element&amp;nbsp;98 in the periodic table, [[dysprosium]], has a name that simply means &quot;hard to get at&quot; so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention.{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=347}} They added that &quot;the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California.&quot;{{sfn|Weeks|Leichester|1968|p=848}}

Weighable quantities of californium were first produced by the&lt;!-- long duration -HOW LONG? --&gt; irradiation of plutonium targets at the [[Materials Testing Reactor]] at the [[Idaho National Laboratory|National Reactor Testing Station]] in [[eastern Idaho]]; and these findings were reported in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=94|issue=4|pages=1083|date=1954|author=Diamond, H|title=Identification of Californium Isotopes 249, 250, 251, and 252 from Pile-Irradiated Plutonium|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.94.1083|bibcode = 1954PhRv...94.1083D|last2=Magnusson|first2=L.|last3=Mech|first3=J.|last4=Stevens|first4=C.|last5=Friedman|first5=A.|last6=Studier|first6=M.|last7=Fields|first7=P.|last8=Huizenga|first8=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high spontaneous fission rate of californium-252 was observed in these samples.

== Production ==
{{see also|Nuclear fuel cycle}}
Californium is produced in [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[particle accelerator]]s.{{sfn|Krebs|2006|pp=327–328}} Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 ({{nuclide|Bk|249}}) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 ({{nuclide|Bk|250}}) via [[neutron capture]] (n,γ) which, in turn, quickly [[beta decay]]s (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to californium-250 ({{nuclide|Cf|250}}) in the following reaction:{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=348}}
:{{nuclide|Bk|249}}(n,γ){{nuclide|Bk|250}} → {{nuclide|Cf|250}} + β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
Bombardment of californium-250 with neutrons produces californium-251 and californium-252.{{sfn|Heiserman|1992|p=348}}

Prolonged irradiation of [[americium]], curium, and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=105}} As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.{{sfn|Haire|2006|p=1503}}

Microgram quantities of californium-252 are available for commercial use through the U.S. [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]].{{sfn|Krebs|2006|pp=327–328}} Only two sites produce californium-252: the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and the [[Research Institute of Atomic Reactors]] in [[Dimitrovgrad, Russia]]. As of 2003, the two sites produce 0.25&amp;nbsp;grams and 0.025&amp;nbsp;grams of californium-252 per year, respectively.{{sfn|NRC|2008|p=33}}

Three californium isotopes with significant half-lives are produced, requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by [[uranium-238]] without [[nuclear fission]] or alpha decay occurring during the process.{{sfn|NRC|2008|p=33}} Californium-253 is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several [[isotopes of plutonium]], [[isotopes of americium|americium]], [[isotopes of curium|curium]], [[isotopes of berkelium|berkelium]], and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).

== Precautions ==
Californium that [[bioaccumulate]]s in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body's ability to form [[red blood cell]]s.{{sfn|Cunningham|1968|p=106}} The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.{{sfn|Emsley|2001|p=90}}

Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANL2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- for the whole paragraph --&gt;

The element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through [[gamma ray]] emission. [[Ionizing radiation]] emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANL2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- for the whole paragraph --&gt;
