'''Norman Colin Dexter''' {{postnom|country=GBR|OBE}} (29 September 1930 – 21 March 2017) was an English crime writer known for his ''[[Inspector Morse]]'' series of novels, which were written between 1975 and 1999 and adapted as an [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television series, ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', from 1987 to 2000.  His characters have spawned a sequel series, ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'', and a prequel series, ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]''.

==Early life and career==
Dexter was born in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], to Alfred and Dorothy Dexter.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&amp;MC 165&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=David|title=The ''Inspector Morse'' Books of Colin Dexter|journal=The Book and Magazine Collector|date=December 1997|issue=165|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an elder brother, John,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian Obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barker|first1=Dennis|title=Colin Dexter obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/21/colin-dexter-obituary|accessdate=22 March 2017|work=The Guardian|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a fellow classicist, who taught Classics at [[The King's (The Cathedral) School|The King's School, Peterborough]], and a sister, Avril.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Alfred ran a small garage and taxi company from premises in Scotgate, Stamford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: John Boon|url=http://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/news/obituary-john-boon-1-3811082|accessdate=22 March 2017|date=4 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322015336/http://www.stamfordmercury.co.uk/news/obituary-john-boon-1-3811082|archive-date=22 March 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dexter was educated at St. John's Infants School, Bluecoat Junior School, from which he gained a scholarship to [[Stamford School]], a boys' [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], where one of his contemporaries was the England international cricket captain and England international rugby player [[M. J. K. Smith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian Obituary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B&amp;MC 187&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard|first1=David|title=The ''Inspector Morse'' Books of Colin Dexter|journal=The Book and Magazine Collector|date=October 1999|issue=187|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving school, Dexter completed his [[national service]] with the [[Royal Corps of Signals]] and then read Classics at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1953 and receiving a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|master's degree]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&amp;MC 187&quot; /&gt;

In 1954, Dexter began his teaching career in the [[East Midlands]], becoming assistant Classics master at [[Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys|Wyggeston School]], [[Leicester]]. There he helped the Christian Union school society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; 
|title=Mr. N. C. Dexter
|magazine=The Wyggestonian |volume=57 |issue=3 |page=80 |location=Leicester |publisher=Wyggeston Boys' School
|date=July 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000 he stated that he shared the same views on politics and religion as Inspector Morse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=You ask the questions |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/you-ask-the-questions-709477.html |work=[[The Independent]]
|location=London |date=18 July 2000 |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was portrayed in the final Morse novel, ''[[The Remorseful Day]]'', as an atheist.

A post at [[Loughborough Grammar School]] followed in 1957 before he took up the position of senior Classics teacher at [[Tresham College of Further and Higher Education|Corby Grammar School]], [[Northamptonshire]], in 1959.  In 1956 he married Dorothy Cooper, and they had a daughter, Sally, and a son, Jeremy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian Obituary&quot; /&gt; In 1966, he was forced by the onset of deafness to retire from teaching and took up the post of senior assistant secretary at the [[University of Oxford]] Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE) in [[Oxford]], a job he held until his retirement in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;strandmag.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strandmag.com/htm/colin_dexter.htm|title=Interview with Colin Dexter|work=strandmag.com|accessdate=21 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511135856/http://www.strandmag.com/htm/colin_dexter.htm|archive-date=11 May 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, Dexter featured prominently in the [[BBC]] programme &quot;How to Solve a Cryptic Crossword&quot; as part of the ''Time Shift'' series, in which he recounted some of the crossword clues solved by Morse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00fh2bh|title=How to Solve a Cryptic Crossword, Series 8, Timeshift - BBC Four|website=BBC|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
The initial books written by Dexter were general studies text books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandrafraser.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/character-interview-colin-dexter/|title=Character interview – Colin Dexter’s Guilty Secret - Sandra Fraser|work=Sandra Fraser|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He began writing mysteries in 1972 during a family holiday. ''[[Last Bus to Woodstock]]'' was published in 1975 and introduced the character of [[Inspector Morse]], the irascible detective whose penchants for [[cryptic crossword]]s, [[English literature]], [[cask ale]], and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] reflect Dexter's own enthusiasms. Dexter's plots used false leads and other [[red herring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordwine.co.uk/features/summer_07/dexter.html The Oxford Wine Company - Stars in their bars: Colin Dexter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611124231/http://www.oxfordwine.co.uk/features/summer_07/dexter.html |date=11 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the 33 two-hour episodes of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television series ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', produced between 1987 and 2000, brought further attention to Dexter's writings. In the manner of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], he also made a [[cameo appearance]] in almost all episodes. From 2006 to 2016, Morse's assistant [[Inspector Lewis|Robbie Lewis]] featured in a 33-episode ITV series titled ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'' (''Inspector Lewis'' in the United States).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-34709048 | title=Lewis to End after Ninth Series | work=BBC News | accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prequel series, ''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]'', featuring a young Morse and starring [[Shaun Evans]] and [[Roger Allam]], began airing on the ITV network in 2012. Dexter was a consultant. As with ''Morse'', Dexter occasionally made cameo appearances in ''Lewis'' and ''Endeavour''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/892911-itv-commissions-full-series-of-morse-drama-endeavour|title=ITV commissions full series of Morse drama Endeavour|publisher=[[Metro (London newspaper)|Metro]]|date=12 March 2012|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Dexter received several [[Crime Writers' Association]] awards: two [[Silver Dagger (award)|Silver Daggers]] for ''[[Service of All the Dead]]'' in 1979 and ''[[The Dead of Jericho]]'' in 1981; two [[Gold Dagger]]s for ''[[The Wench is Dead]]'' in 1989 and ''[[The Way Through the Woods]]'' in 1992; and a [[Cartier Diamond Dagger]] for lifetime achievement in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;strandmag.com&quot;/&gt; In 1996, Dexter received a [[Macavity Awards|Macavity Award]] for his short story &quot;Evans Tries an O-Level&quot;. In 1980, he was elected a member of the by-invitation-only [[Detection Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/colin-dexter-obituary-inspector-morse-oxford-whodunit-crime-writer-a7642411.html|title=Colin Dexter obituary: Inspector Morse creator and one of the great whodunnit men|author=Peter Guttridge|website=The Independent|date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Dexter became a Fellow by Special Election of [[St Cross College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colin Dexter OBE|url=http://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/about-st-cross/news/colin-dexter-obe|website=St Cross College|accessdate=22 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322111929/http://www.stx.ox.ac.uk/about-st-cross/news/colin-dexter-obe|archive-date=22 March 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Dexter was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to literature. In 2001 he was awarded the [[Freedom of the City]] of Oxford. In September 2011, the [[University of Lincoln]] awarded Dexter an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University of Lincoln degree honour for Morse writer Colin Dexter|url=http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/university-lincoln-degree-honour-morse-writer/story-13251139-detail/story.html|accessdate=22 March 2017|work=Lincolnshire Echo|date=2 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 21 March 2017 Dexter's publisher, [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], said in a statement &quot;With immense sadness, Macmillan announces the death of Colin Dexter who died peacefully at his home in Oxford this morning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-39342698|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=21 March 2017|title=Colin Dexter, creator of Inspector Morse, dies aged 86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
