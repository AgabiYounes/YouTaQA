{{short description|Genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humour}}
{{more citations needed|date=May 2013}}

A '''comedy film''' is a [[Film genre|genre]] of [[film]] in which the main emphasis is on [[humor]]. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/comedyfilms.html |title=Comedy Films |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=29 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending ([[black comedy]] being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film – and derived from the classical [[comedy]] in [[theatre]] –, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from [[burlesque]] situations but also dialogue.

Comedy, compared with other [[film genre]]s, puts much more focus on individual stars, with many former [[stand-up comics]] transitioning to the film industry due to their popularity. While many comic films are lighthearted stories with no intent other than to amuse, others contain political or social commentary (such as ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' and ''[[Wag the Dog]]'').

==History==
===Silent film era===
The first comedy film was ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]'' (1895), directed and produced by [[Louis Lumière]]. The most noted comedy actors of the era were [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Harold Lloyd]], and [[Buster Keaton]].

== Subgenres ==
=== Comedy of manners ===
A [[comedy of manners]] satirizes the manners and affectations of a social class, often represented by stock characters. Also, satirical comedy-drama &amp; the plot is often concerned with an illicit love affair or some other scandal. However, the plot is generally less important for its comedic effect than its witty dialogue. This form of comedy has a long ancestry, dating back at least as far as ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' created by [[William Shakespeare]].

=== Slapstick ===
[[Slapstick films]] involve exaggerated, boisterous action to create impossible and humorous situations. Because it relies predominately on visual depictions of events, it does not require sound. Accordingly, the subgenre was ideal for silent movies and was prevalent during that era. Popular silent stars of the slapstick genre include [[Buster Keaton]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Roscoe Arbuckle]], and [[Harold Lloyd]]. Some of these stars, as well as acts such as [[Laurel and Hardy]] and [[the Three Stooges]], also found success incorporating [[slapstick comedy]] into sound films.

=== Fish out of water ===
In a fish out of water comedy, the main character finds themself in an unusual environment, which drives most of the humour. Situations can be [[neo noir]] [[crime comedy]], [[satirical]] [[comedy-drama]] &amp; black comedy as sometimes as [[fantasy comedy]] which is behind swapping gender roles, as in ''[[Tootsie]]'' (1982); an age changing role, as in ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'' (1988); a freedom-loving individual fitting into a structured environment, as in ''[[Police Academy (film)|Police Academy]]'' (1984); a rural backwoodsman in the big city, as in ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'', and so forth. The Coen Brothers are known for using this technique in all of their films, though not always to comic effect. Some films including people fitting the &quot;fish-out-of-water&quot; bill include ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' (1998) and ''[[A Serious Man]]'' (2009).

=== Parody ===
A [[Parody film|parody or spoof film]] satirizes other film genres or classic films. Such films mockumentary, employ sarcasm, stereotyping, mockery of scenes from other films, and the obviousness of meaning in a character's actions. Examples of this form include ''[[Mud and Sand]]'' (1922), ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974), ''[[Airplane!]]'' (1980), ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974), and ''[[Scary Movie]] (2000).

=== Anarchic comedy ===
The anarchic comedy film, as its name suggests, is a random or stream-of-consciousness type of humour which often lampoons a form of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Absurd Comedy|url=http://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/absurd-comedy-d622|publisher=Allmovies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre dates from the silent era, and the most famous examples of this type of film would be those produced by [[Monty Python]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sexton|first=Timothy|title=Anarchic Comedy from the Silent Era to Monty Python|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/news/anarchic-comedy-silent-era-monty-python-173500945.html|publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'' (1933) and ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978).

=== Black comedy ===
The [[black comedy]] film deals with normally [[taboo]] subjects, including death, murder, crime, suicide, and war, in a satirical manner. Examples include ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' (1944), ''[[Monsieur Verdoux]]'' (1947), ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' (1949), ''[[The Ladykillers]]'' (1955), ''[[Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964), ''[[The Loved One]]'' (1965), ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983), ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'' (1983), ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), ''[[The War of the Roses (film)|The War of the Roses]]'' (1989), ''[[Heathers]]'' (1989), ''[[Your Friends &amp; Neighbors]]'' (1998), ''[[Keeping Mum]]'' (2005), ''[[Burn After Reading]]'' (2008), [[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|''The Wolf of Wall Street'']] (2013), ''[[Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri]]'' (2017) and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Hollywood]]'' (2019).

=== Gross out ===
[[Gross out#Cinema|Gross out films]] are a relatively recent development and rely heavily on vulgar, sexual or &quot;toilet&quot; humour. Examples include ''[[Porky's]]'' (1982), ''[[Dumb and Dumber]]'' (1994), ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998), and ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' (1999).

=== Screwball comedy ===
It was not uncommon for the early [[romantic comedy]] film to also be a [[screwball comedy]]. This genre was particularly popular during the 1930s and 1940s. There is no consensus definition of this film style, and it is often loosely applied to slapstick or romantic comedy films. Typically it can include a romantic element, an interplay between people of different economic strata, quick and witty [[repartee]], some form of role reversal, and a happy ending. Some examples of the screwball comedy are: ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'' (1940), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and more recently, ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972).

==Hybrid subgenres==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}

=== Action comedy ===
Films in this sub-genre blend comic antics and action where the stars combine one-liners with a thrilling plot and daring stunts. The genre became a specific draw in North America in the eighties when comedians such as [[Eddie Murphy]] started taking more action-oriented roles such as in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' and ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. These types of films are often [[buddy films]], with mismatched partners such as in ''[[Midnight Run]]'', ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', ''[[Bad Boys (1995 film)|Bad Boys]]'', ''[[Starsky and Hutch (film)|Starsky and Hutch]]'', and ''[[Hot Fuzz]]''. [[Slapstick]] [[martial arts films]] became a mainstay of [[Hong Kong action cinema]] through the work of [[Jackie Chan]] among others. It may also focus on [[superhero]]es such as ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'', ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'', and ''[[Mystery Men (film)|Mystery Men]]''. It may focus on [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] such as ''[[Kung Fu Panda (franchise)|Kung Fu Panda]]''.

=== Adventure comedy ===
Films in this subgenre blend the action, suspense and exotic locales and the heroic journey of the adventure genre with light-hearted comedic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Adventure » Adventure Comedy |url=https://www.allmovie.com/subgenre/adventure-comedy-d517 |website=[[AllMovie]] |accessdate=18 October 2019 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy horror===
[[Comedy horror]] is a type of film in which the usual dark themes and &quot;scare tactics&quot; attributed to horror films are treated with a humorous approach. These films either use goofy horror cliches, such as in ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'', ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|Haunted Mansion]]'', and ''[[Scary Movie]]'' where campy styles are favoured. Some are much more subtle and don't parody horror, such as ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]''. Another style of comedy horror can also rely on over-the-top violence and gore such as in ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981), ''[[Re-Animator]]'' (1985), ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'' (1992), and ''[[Club Dread]]'' (2004) – such films are sometimes known as ''splatstick'', a portmanteau of the words ''splatter'' and ''slapstick''. It would be reasonable to put ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' in this category.

===Comedy thriller===
[[Comedy thriller]] is a genre that combines elements of comedy and thrillers, a combination of humor and suspense. Films such as ''[[Silver Streak (film)|Silver Streak]]'', ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', ''[[In Bruges]]'', ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]'', ''[[Grosse Point Blank]]'', ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'', ''[[The Big Fix (1978 film)|The Big Fix]]'', and ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]''.

=== Fantasy comedy ===
[[Fantasy comedy]] films use [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]], [[supernatural]] or mythological figures for comic purposes. Most fantasy comedy includes an element of parody, or satire, turning fantasy conventions on their head, such as the hero becoming a cowardly fool or the princess being a klutz. Examples of these films include ''[[The Chipmunk Adventure]]'', ''[[Big (film)|Big]]'', ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', ''[[Ernest Saves Christmas]]'', ''[[Ernest Scared Stupid]]'', ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'', ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', and ''[[Shrek]]''.

=== Science fiction comedy ===
[[Science fiction comedy]] films, like most hybrid genre of comedy, exaggerate the elements of traditional [[science fiction film]]s to comic effect. Examples include ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'', ''[[Innerspace]]'', ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', ''[[Men in Black (series)|Men in Black]]'', and ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''.

===Military comedy===
Military comedy films involve comic situations in a military setting. When a film is primarily about the experience of civilians called into military service and feeling out of place, it overlaps with the fish-out-of-water subgenre. Examples include ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', the [[Francis the Talking Mule]] series, and others.

===Romantic comedy===
Examples of the [[romantic comedy]] subgenre include ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'' (1927), ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931), ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[My Favorite Wife]]'' (1940), ''[[Some Like It Hot]]'' (1959), ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'' (1963), ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), ''[[Pretty Woman]]'' (1990), ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994), and ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'' (1998).
