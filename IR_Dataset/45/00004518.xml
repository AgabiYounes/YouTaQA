'''Borneo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔːr|n|i|oʊ}}; {{lang-ms|'''Pulau Borneo'''}}, {{lang-id|'''Kalimantan'''}}) is the third-[[List of islands by area|largest island in the world]] and the largest in [[Asia]].{{#tag:ref|See [[List of islands by area]].|group=&quot;note&quot;}} At the geographic centre of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], in relation to major Indonesian islands, it is located north of [[Java Island|Java]], west of [[Sulawesi]], and east of [[Sumatra]]. The island was named after the nation of Brunei.

The [[list of divided islands|island is politically divided]] not equally among three countries: [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]] in the north, and [[Indonesia]] to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/1998/08/02/travel/borneo-s-wild-side.html|title=Borneo's Wild Side|author=Donna Marchetti|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 August 1998|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory. In the north, the [[East Malaysia]]n states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] make up about 26% of the island. Additionally, the Malaysian federal territory of [[Labuan]] is situated on a small island just off the coast of Borneo. The sovereign state of [[Brunei]], located on the north coast, comprises about 1% of Borneo's land area. A little more than half of the island is in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] including Brunei and the Malaysian portion, while the Indonesian portion spans both the Northern and [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern]] hemispheres.

Borneo is home to one of the oldest [[Tropical rainforest|rainforests]] in the world.

In August 2019, Indonesian president [[Joko Widodo]] announced a plan to move the capital from [[Jakarta]] to an unnamed city in the [[East Kalimantan]] province in Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/indonesia-to-remove-burden-from-sinking-jakarta-with-new-capital-on-borneo-11795224|title=Indonesia to remove 'burden' from sinking Jakarta with new capital on Borneo|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The island is known by many names. Internationally it is known as ''Borneo'', after [[Empire of Brunei|Brunei]], derived from European contact with the kingdom in the 16th century during the [[Age of Exploration]]. The name ''Brunei'' possibly derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''{{transl|sa|váruṇa}}'' ({{lang|sa|वरुण}}), meaning either &quot;water&quot; or [[Varuna]], the Hindu god of rain. [[Native Indonesian|Indonesian natives]] called it ''[[Kalimantan]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Britannica|work = Encyclopaedia Britannica|title=Kalimantan|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044401/Kalimantan|accessdate=15 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Kalamanthana,'' meaning &quot;burning weather island&quot; (to describe its hot and humid [[tropical]] weather).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eugene Linden|title=The Ragged Edge of the World: Encounters at the Frontier Where Modernity, Wildlands and Indigenous Peoples Meet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_x9e3LtUfYC&amp;pg=PT30|date=17 March 2011|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-47613-0|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier times, the island was known by other names. In 977, [[History of China|Chinese records]] began to use the term ''Bo-ni'' to refer to Borneo. In 1225, it was also mentioned by the Chinese official [[Zhao Rugua|Chau Ju-Kua]] (趙汝适).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apb.ubd.edu.bn/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Tradition-and-Identity-Construction.pdf|title=Traditional Woven Textiles: Tradition and Identity Construction in the 'New State' of Brunei Darussalam|author=Siti Norkhalbi Haji Wahsalfelah|publisher=Universiti Brunei Darussalam|year=2005|accessdate=24 May 2017|pages=48/29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Javanese manuscript [[Nagarakretagama]], written by [[Majapahit]] court poet [[Mpu Prapanca]] in 1365, mentioned the island as ''Nusa Tanjungnagara'', which means the island of the [[Tanjungpura Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm|title=Naskah Nagarakretagama|author=Suyatno|language=Indonesian|publisher=[[National Library of Indonesia]]|accessdate=13 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523163555/http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm|archivedate=23 May 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Regional map of SE Asia with Borneo Highlighted.svg|thumb|350x350px|left|Location map of Borneo in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], the Red River Fault is included in the map.]]
Borneo was formed through [[Mesozoic]] accretion of microcontinental fragments, [[ophiolite]] terranes and [[island arc]] crust onto a  [[Paleozoic]] continental core. At the beginning of the [[Cenozoic]] Borneo formed a [[promontory]] of [[Sundaland]] which partly separated from Asian mainland by the [[Tectonics of the South China Sea|proto-South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Geology of Borneo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gsm.org.my/products/702001-100637-PDF.pdf|title=The origin of the 'circular basins' of Sabah, Malaysia|author1=Allagu Balaguru|author2=Gary Nichols|author3=Robert Hall|journal=Bulletin of the Geological Society of Malaysia, [[Royal Holloway University of London]]|via=Geological Society of Malaysia|year=2003|accessdate=24 May 2019|p=337|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524033404/https://gsm.org.my/products/702001-100637-PDF.pdf|archivedate=24 May 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oceanic part of the proto-South China Sea was [[subduction|subducted]] during the [[Paleogene]] period and a large [[accretionary complex]] formed along the northwestern of the island of Borneo. In the [[early Miocene]] uplift of the accretionary complex occurred as a result of underthrusting of thinned continental crust in northwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geology of Borneo&quot;/&gt; The uplift may also resulted from shortening due to the counter-clockwise rotation of Borneo between 20 and 10 [[mega-annum]] (Ma) as a consequence of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]-Southeast Asia collision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geology of Borneo&quot;/&gt; Large volumes of [[sediment]] were shed into basins, which scattered offshore to the west, north and east of Borneo as well into·a [[Neogene]] basin which is currently exposed in large areas of eastern and southern [[Sabah]]. In southeast Sabah, the [[Miocene]] to recent island arc terranes of the [[Sulu Archipelago]] extend onshore into Borneo with the older [[volcanic arc]] was the result of southeast dipping subduction while the younger volcanics are likely resulted from northwest dipping subduction the [[Celebes Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Geology of Borneo&quot;/&gt;

Before sea levels rose at the end of the last [[Ice Age]], Borneo was part of the mainland of Asia, forming, with [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]], the upland regions of a peninsula that extended east from present day [[Indochina]]. The [[South China Sea]] and [[Gulf of Thailand]] now submerge the former low-lying areas of the peninsula. Deeper waters separating Borneo from neighbouring [[Sulawesi]] prevented a land connection to that island, creating the divide known as [[Wallace's Line]] between Asian and Australia-[[New Guinea]] biological regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Allan Taylor|title=Biogeography: Recent Advances and Future Directions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xz9dWjh_CAsC&amp;pg=PA178|year=1984|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-389-20507-4|pages=178–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starfish.ch/dive/Wallacea.html|title=Wallacea|author=Teresa Zubi|publisher=Starfish|date=25 October 2015|accessdate=26 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525180130/http://www.starfish.ch/dive/Wallacea.html|archivedate=25 May 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island today is surrounded by the [[South China Sea]] to the north and northwest, the [[Sulu Sea]] to the northeast, the Celebes Sea and the [[Makassar Strait]] to the east, and the [[Java Sea]] and [[Karimata Strait]] to the south.

Most of the population lives in coastal cities, although the hinterland has small towns and villages along the rivers. The population consists mainly of [[Dayak people|Dayak]] ethnic groups, [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Orang Ulu]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Kadazan-Dusun]].

In Sabah during the administration of [[Mustapha Harun]] of the [[United Sabah National Organisation]] (USNO) in the 1970s, thousands of Muslim immigrants and refugees from the southern Philippines of [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulawesi]] of Indonesia were given sanctuary and later [[identity card]]s in the bid to increase the Muslim population of the state: a policy later known as [[Project IC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Project IC&quot;/&gt; Due to the high number of crimes attributed to the new migrant populations, [[ethnic tension]] between the indigenous and migrant populations has risen up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/illegal-immigrants-causing-simmering-resentment-in-sabah/|title=Illegal immigrants causing simmering resentment in Sabah|publisher=The Malaysian Times|date=22 August 2012|accessdate=23 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629170508/http://www.themalaysiantimes.com.my/illegal-immigrants-causing-simmering-resentment-in-sabah/|archivedate=29 June 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kalimantan since the 1990s, the Indonesian government has undertaken an intense [[transmigration program]]; to that end it has financed the relocation of poor, landless families from Java, Madura, and Bali. By 2001, transmigrants made up 21% of the population in [[Central Kalimantan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=28 June 2004|accessdate=13 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3811219.stm|title=Indonesia flashpoints:, Kalimantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, the indigenous Dayak and Malays have resisted encroachment by these migrants, and violent conflict has occurred between some transmigrant and indigenous populations. In the 1999 [[Sambas riots]], [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] and [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] joined together to massacre thousands of the [[Madurese people|Madurese]] migrants. In Kalimantan, thousands were killed in 2001 fighting between [[Madurese transmigrant]]s and the Dayak people in the [[Sampit conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Beheading: A Dayak ritual|date=23 February 2001|accessdate=13 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1186401.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
