A '''ballpoint pen ''', also known as a '''biro'''&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt; or '''ball pen''', is a [[pen]] that dispenses [[ink]] (usually in paste form) over a [[Ball (bearing)|metal ball]] at its point, i.e. over a &quot;ball point&quot;. The metal commonly used is [[steel]], [[brass]], or [[tungsten carbide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How does a ballpoint pen work?|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question683.htm |work=Engineering |publisher=HowStuffWorks |year=1998–2007 |accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to [[dip pen]]s and [[fountain pen]]s, and it is now the world's most-used [[Writing implement|writing instrument]];&lt;ref name=&quot;bpp encyc&quot;/&gt; millions are manufactured and sold daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; This pen's ink usually seeps through paper more frequent than other types of pens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techstarzone.com/best-pens-for-thin-paper/|title=Best Pens for Thin Paper (and Bullet Journals!)|last=Melissa|website=TechStarZone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, it has influenced art and [[graphic design]] and spawned [[ballpoint pen artwork|an artwork genre]].

Some pen manufacturers produce designer ballpoint pens for the [[Luxury goods|high-end]] and collectors' markets.

The concept of using a &quot;ball point&quot; within a writing instrument as a method of applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century. In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not slip into the tube or fall out of the pen.

The first [[patent]] for a ballpoint pen&lt;ref&gt;Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) &quot;Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20&quot; ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&amp;nbsp;69–100, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Japes P. Mannings, &quot;Reservoir, Fountain, and Stylographic Pens&quot;], ''Journal of the Society of Arts'', 27 October 1905, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_7pJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1150 p. 1150]&lt;/ref&gt; was issued on 30 October 1888 to [[John J. Loud]],&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain Patent No. 15630, 30 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; who was attempting to make a writing instrument that would be able to write &quot;on rough surfaces — such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US392046 |title=Patent US392046 - op weym - Google Patents |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[fountain pen]]s could not. Loud's pen had a small rotating steel ball, held in place by a socket. Although it could be used to mark rough surfaces such as leather, as Loud intended, it proved to be too coarse for letter-writing. With no commercial viability, its potential went unexploited&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt; and the patent eventually lapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;1940s&quot;/&gt;

The manufacture of economical, reliable ballpoint pens as are known today arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpp encyc&quot;/&gt; Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available.&lt;ref name=&quot;web&quot;/&gt; Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, [[capillary action]], and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.&lt;ref&gt;Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) &quot;Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20&quot; ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&amp;nbsp;69–100, page 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Webshark Ltd. – www.webshark.hu |url=http://www.herend.com/herald/012/eng/eletmod.htm |title=A porcelán-arany csoda |publisher=Herend |accessdate=11 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012134119/http://herend.com/herald/012/eng/eletmod.htm |archivedate=12 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[László Bíró]], a Hungarian-Argentine [[newspaper]] editor frustrated by the amount of time that he wasted filling up fountain pens and cleaning up smudged pages, noticed that inks used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge free. He decided to create a pen using the same type of ink.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; Bíró enlisted the help of his brother György, a chemist,&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; to develop viscous ink formulae for new ballpoint designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpp encyc&quot;/&gt;

Bíró's innovation successfully coupled ink-viscosity with a ball-socket mechanism which acted compatibly to prevent ink from drying inside the reservoir while allowing controlled flow.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; Bíró filed a British patent on 15 June 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The first complete specifications appear to be UK 498997, June 1938 and UK 512218, December 1938; his rather basic Hungarian patent 120037 was dated April 1938.'' Collingridge, M. R. ''et al.'' (2007) &quot;Ink Reservoir Writing Instruments 1905–20&quot; ''Transactions of the Newcomen Society'' 77(1): pp.&amp;nbsp;69–100, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, the Bíró brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany and moved to Argentina, where they formed &quot;Bíró Pens of Argentina&quot; and filed a new patent in 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt; Their pen was sold in Argentina as the &quot;Birome&quot; ([[portmanteau]] of the names Bíró and Meyne), which is how ballpoint pens are still known in that country.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt; This new design was licensed by the British,{{clarify|post-text=(Which British people/institution?)|date=November 2019}} who produced ballpoint pens for [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] aircrew as the &quot;Biro&quot;. Ballpoint pens were found to be more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes, where fountain pens were prone to ink-leakage.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt;

Bíró's patent, and other early patents on ballpoint pens, often used the term &quot;ball-point fountain pen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vYr8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA570 |title=Patent Log: Innovative Patents that Advanced the United States Navy |first1=Douglas E. |last1=Campbell |first2=Stephen J. |last2=Chant |date=30 March 2017 |publisher=Lulu.com |accessdate=30 March 2017 |via=[[Google Books]] }}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2474300 |title=Ball point fountain pen |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |accessdate=30 March 2017 |via=[[Google Patents]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2966417 |title=Red ball point fountain pen inks and colorants therefor |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |accessdate=30 March 2017 |via=[[Google Patents]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com.ar/patents/US2592406 |title=Fountain pen of the ball point type |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |accessdate=30 March 2017 |via=[[Google Patents]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2486869 |title=Ball-point fountain pen |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |accessdate=30 March 2017 |via=[[Google Patents]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2390636 |title=Writing instrument |publisher=[[United States Patent Office]] |accessdate=30 March 2017 |via=[[Google Patents]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar proliferation===
[[File:The New Redesigned Jotter.jpg|thumb|2018 Parker Jotters are similar to the version that first came out in 1954]]

Following World War II, many companies vied to commercially produce their own ballpoint pen design. In post-war Argentina, success of the Birome ballpoint was limited, but in mid-1945, the [[Eversharp]] Co., a maker of [[mechanical pencil]]s, teamed up with [[Eberhard Faber]] Co. to license the rights from Birome for sales in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1940s&quot;/&gt;

In 1946, a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] firm, Vila Sivill Hermanos, began to make a ballpoint, Regia Continua, and from 1953 to 1957 their factory also made Bic ballpoints, on contract with the French firm   [[Société Bic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ref-publicació|publicació=El Punt Avui|data=10 juliol 2016| url=http://admin.elpunt.cat/economia/article/18-economia/985015-el-meu-avi-va-fer-la-primera-estilografica-d-espanya-i-el-primer-boligraf-d-europa.html|nom = Francesc|cognom = Muñoz|títol=“El meu avi va fer la primera estilogràfica d'Espanya i el primer bolígraf d'Europa”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, American entrepreneur [[Milton Reynolds]] came across a Birome ballpoint pen during a business trip to [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1940s&quot;/&gt; Recognizing commercial potential, he purchased several ballpoint samples, returned to the United States, and founded the [[Milton Reynolds#The Reynolds International Pen Company|Reynolds International Pen Company]]. Reynolds bypassed the Birome patent with sufficient design alterations to obtain an American patent, beating Eversharp and other competitors to introduce the pen to the US market.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1940s&quot;/&gt; Debuting at [[Gimbels]] department store in New York City on 29 October 1945,&lt;ref name=&quot;1940s&quot;/&gt; for US$12.50 each (1945 US dollar value, about ${{Inflation|US|12.50|1945}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars),&lt;ref name=&quot;1940s&quot;/&gt; &quot;Reynolds Rocket&quot; became the first commercially successful ballpoint pen.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inventing the 20th century: 100 inventions that shaped the world|year=2002|publisher=NYU Press|author=Stephen Van Dulken|author2=Andrew Phillips|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds went to great extremes to market the pen, with great success; Gimbel's sold many thousands of pens within one week. In Britain, the Miles Martin pen company was producing the first commercially successful ballpoint pens there by the end of 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;

Neither Reynolds' nor Eversharp's ballpoint lived up to consumer expectations in America. Ballpoint pen sales peaked in 1946, and consumer interest subsequently plunged due to [[market saturation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1940s&quot;/&gt; By the early 1950s the ballpoint boom had subsided and Reynolds' company folded.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;

[[Paper Mate]] pens, among the emerging ballpoint brands of the 1950s, bought the rights to distribute their own ballpoint pens in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;intrigue&quot;/&gt; Facing concerns about ink-reliability, Paper Mate pioneered new ink formulas and advertised them as &quot;banker-approved&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1940s&quot;/&gt; In 1954, [[Parker Pens]] released &quot;[[Jotter|The Jotter]]&quot; — the company's first ballpoint—boasting additional features and technological advances which also included the use of tungsten-carbide textured ball-bearings in their pens.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt; In less than a year, Parker sold several million pens at prices between three and nine dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt; In the 1960s, the failing [[Eversharp|Eversharp Co.]] sold its pen division to Parker and ultimately folded.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;

[[Marcel Bich]] also introduced a ballpoint pen to the American marketplace in the 1950s, licensed from Bíró and based on the Argentine designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpp encyc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phaidon&quot;/&gt; Bich shortened his name to Bic in 1953, becoming the ballpoint brand now recognized globally.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; Bic pens struggled until the company launched its &quot;Writes The First Time, Every Time!&quot; advertising campaign in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; Competition during this era forced unit prices to drop considerably.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt;

==Inks==
Ballpoint pen ink is normally a paste containing around 25 to 40 percent dye. The dyes are suspended in a solvent of &quot;oil&quot;. The most common of the oils are [[benzyl alcohol]] or [[phenoxyethanol]], which mix with the dyes to create a smooth paste that dries quickly. The dyes used in blue and black ballpoint pens are [[alkaline|basic]] dyes based on [[triarylmethane dye|triarylmethane]] and acid dyes derived from [[diazo]] compounds or [[phthalocyanine]]. Common dyes in blue (and black) ink are [[Prussian blue]], Victoria blue, [[methyl violet]], [[crystal violet]], and [[phthalocyanine blue]]. The dye [[eosin]] is commonly used for red ink.

The inks are resistant to water after drying but can be defaced by certain solvents which include acetone and various alcohols.

==Types of ballpoint pens==
[[File:4 Bic Cristal pens and caps.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bic Cristal]] ballpoint pens shown in four basic ink colors]]
[[File:Jinhao 182 twist action ballpoint pen disassembled.jpg|thumb|right|Twist action ballpoint pen with large capacity G2 type refill]]
[[File:Ball point pen refills en.png|thumb|right|Commonly used ballpoint refill types (diameter and length given in millimeters)]]
Ballpoint pens are produced in both disposable and refillable models. Refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip,&lt;ref name=&quot;bpp encyc&quot;/&gt; which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.

[[Rollerball pen]]s employ the same ballpoint mechanics, but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to &quot;smearing&quot; — posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing [[right-to-left]] script) — and &quot;running&quot;, should the writing surface become wet.

Some ballpoint pens use a hybrid ink formulation whose viscosity is lower than that of standard ballpoint ink, but greater than rollerball ink. The ink dries faster than a standard ballpoint to prevent smearing when writing. These pens are better suited for left handed persons. Examples are the Uni Jetstream and Pilot Acroball ranges. These pens are also labelled &quot;extra smooth&quot;, as they offer a smoother writing experience compared to normal ballpoint pens.

Because of a ballpoint pen's reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink, most cannot be used to write upside-down. However, technology developed by Fisher pens in the United States resulted in the production of what came to be known as the &quot;Fisher [[Space Pen]]&quot;. Space Pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurized ink reservoir&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; that forces the ink toward the point. Unlike standard ballpoints, the rear end of a Space Pen's pressurized reservoir is sealed, eliminating evaporation and leakage,&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; thus allowing the pen to write upside-down, in zero-gravity environments, and reportedly underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacepen.com/about-us.aspx|title=Fisher Space Pen – About Us|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt;

Ballpoint pens with erasable ink were pioneered by the [[Paper Mate]] pen company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erasable&quot;/&gt; The ink formulas of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to [[rubber cement]], allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erasable&quot;/&gt; Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurized cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning they can also write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erasable&quot;/&gt;

The inexpensive, disposable [[Bic Cristal]] (also simply &quot;Bic pen&quot; or &quot;Biro&quot;) is reportedly the most widely sold pen in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phaidon&quot;&gt;''Phaidon Design Classics- Volume 2'', 2006 Phaidon Press Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7148-4399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Humble&quot;&gt;[http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/2004/pdfs/humble_checklist.pdf ''Humble Masterpieces''] – [[The Museum of Modern Art]] New York, 8 April – 27 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Bic company's first product and is still synonymous with the company name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/BIC-Corporation-Company-History.html|title=BIC Corporation – Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com|date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bicworld.com/en/bic-group/history/ |title=History |publisher=Bicworld.com|date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bic Cristal is part of the permanent collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], acknowledged for its [[industrial design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bic Cristal in MoMA collection&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Humble&quot;/&gt; Its hexagonal barrel mimics that of a wooden [[pencil]] and is transparent, showing the ink level in the reservoir. Originally a sealed streamlined cap, the modern pen cap has a small hole at the top to meet safety standards, helping to prevent suffocation if children suck it into the throat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bicworld.com/us/pages/faq/ BICWorld.com FAQ – BIC World]&lt;/ref&gt;

Multipens are pens that feature multiple varying colored ballpoint refills. Sometimes ballpoint refills are combined with another non-ballpoint refill.

Sometimes ballpoint pens combine a ballpoint tip on one end and touchscreen stylus on the other.

Ballpoint pens are sometimes provided free by businesses, such as hotels, as a form of advertising—printed with a company's name; a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include ballpoint pens in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer's interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bpp encyc&quot;/&gt;

Ballpoint pens have proven to be a versatile [[art medium]] for professional artists as well as amateur [[doodle]]rs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; Low cost, availability, and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient, alternative art supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oddity&quot;/&gt; Some artists use them within [[mixed-media]] works, while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tricks&quot;/&gt;

Effects not generally associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weekender&quot;/&gt; Traditional [[pen|pen-and-ink]] techniques such as [[stipple|stippling]] and [[cross-hatching]] can be used to create half-tones&lt;ref name=&quot;Mylne&quot;/&gt; or the illusion of form and volume.&lt;ref name=&quot;Art of Sketching&quot;/&gt; For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Times&quot;/&gt; Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork&lt;ref name=&quot;Tokyo Journal&quot;/&gt; and photography,&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt; causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist [[Lennie Mace]] refers to as the &quot;Wow Factor&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tokyo Journal&quot;/&gt;

Famous 20th-century artists such as [[Andy Warhol]], among others, have utilized ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warhol BPP&quot;/&gt; Ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century, with [[contemporary]] artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination, and innovation. Korean-American artist [[Il Lee]] has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; Since the 1980s, [[Lennie Mace]] creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gekkan&quot;/&gt; The artist coined terms such as &quot;PENtings&quot; and &quot;Media Graffiti&quot; to describe his varied output.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Times&quot;/&gt; More recently, British artist [[James Mylne (artist)|James Mylne]] has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal mixed-media color.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot;/&gt; In the mid-2000s (decade), [[Juan Francisco Casas]] generated Internet attention for a series of large-scale, [[photorealism|photo-realistic]] ballpoint duplications of his own [[snapshot (photography)|snapshots]] of friends, utilising only blue pens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casas&quot;/&gt;

Using ballpoint pens to create artwork is not without limitations. Color availability and sensitivity of ink to light are among concerns of ballpoint pen artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Care&quot;/&gt; Mistakes pose greater risks to ballpoint artists; once a line is drawn, it generally cannot be erased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Times&quot;/&gt; Additionally, &quot;blobbing&quot; of ink on the drawing surface and &quot;skipping&quot; of ink-flow require consideration when using ballpoint pens for artistic purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tricks&quot;/&gt; Although the mechanics of ballpoint pens remain relatively unchanged, ink composition has evolved to solve certain problems over the years, resulting in unpredictable sensitivity to light and some extent of fading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Care&quot;/&gt;

==Manufacturing==
[[File:Ink holder of a ballpen.jpg|thumb|The ink holder of a disposable ballpoint pen]]
Although designs and construction vary between brands, basic components of all ballpoint pens are universal.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpp encyc&quot;/&gt; Standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating &quot;ball&quot; itself (distributing the ink on the writing surface), a &quot;socket&quot; holding the ball in place, small &quot;ink channels&quot; that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained &quot;ink reservoir&quot; supplying ink to the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points,&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt; then housed in a brass socket.&lt;ref name=&quot;Incredible Pen&quot;/&gt;

The function of these components can be compared with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The ballpoint tip delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a &quot;buffer&quot; between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt;

A ballpoint tip that can write comfortably for a long period of time is not easy to produce, as it requires high-precision machinery and thin high-grade steel alloy plates. China, which {{asof|2017|lc=y}} produces about 80 percent of the world's ballpoint pens, relied on imported ballpoint tips and metal alloys before 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/18/finally-china-manufactures-a-ballpoint-pen-all-by-itself/ |title=Finally, China manufactures a ballpoint pen all by itself |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=18 January 2017 |accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common ballpoint pen is a product of [[mass production]], with components produced separately on assembly lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Incredible Pen&quot;/&gt; Basic steps in the manufacturing process include the production of ink formulas, molding of metal and plastic components, and assembly.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpp encyc&quot;/&gt; [[Marcel Bich]] was involved in developing the production of inexpensive ballpoint pens.&lt;ref name=&quot;How ballpoints work&quot;/&gt;

==Guinness World Records==
* The world's largest functioning ballpoint pen was made by Acharya Makunuri Srinivasa in India. The pen measures 5.5 m (18&amp;nbsp;ft 0.53 in) long and weighs 37.23&amp;nbsp;kg (82.08&amp;nbsp;lb 1.24 oz).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/31621-largest-ball-point-pen|title=Largest ball point pen|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
