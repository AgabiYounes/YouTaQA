Baku is located {{convert|28|m|ft}} below [[sea level]], which makes it the [[List of capital cities by altitude|lowest lying national capital in the world]] and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. Baku lies on the southern shore of the [[Absheron Peninsula]], alongside the [[Bay of Baku]]. At the beginning of 2009, Baku's [[urban population]] was estimated at just over two million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.azstat.org/statinfo/demoqraphic/en/2_2.shtml|title=Population by economic and administrative regions, urban settlements at the beginning of the 2009|accessdate=21 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114093435/http://www.azstat.org/statinfo/demoqraphic/en/2_2.shtml|archivedate=14 November 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, about 25% of all inhabitants of the country live in Baku's [[metropolitan area]]. Baku is the sole metropolis in Azerbaijan.

Baku is divided into [[Baku#Administrative divisions|twelve administrative raions]] and 48 townships. Among these are the townships on the islands of the [[Baku Archipelago]], and the town of [[Oil Rocks]] built on stilts in the Caspian Sea, {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} away from Baku. The [[Old City (Baku)|Inner City of Baku]], along with the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Shirvanshah's Palace]] and [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]], were inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000. According to the [[Lonely Planet]]'s ranking, Baku is also among the world's top ten destinations for urban nightlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5AC0NE20091113?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=11617|title=Travel Picks: Top 10 cities to party the night away|work=Reuters|accessdate=21 November 2009|date=13 November 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123104005/https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5AC0NE20091113?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=11617|archivedate=23 November 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is the scientific, cultural, and industrial center of Azerbaijan. Many sizeable Azerbaijani institutions have their headquarters there. The [[Baku International Sea Trade Port]] is capable of handling two million tons of general and dry bulk cargoes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/AZE_Port_of_Baku_2192.php|title=Port of Baku|publisher=World Port Source|accessdate=23 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721064024/http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/AZE_Port_of_Baku_2192.php|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Baku has become an important venue for international events. It hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|57th Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2012, the [[2015 European Games]], 4th [[Islamic Solidarity Games]], the [[F1]] [[Azerbaijan Grand Prix]] since 2016, hosted the [[2019 UEFA Europa League Final|final]] of the [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League]], and will be one of the host cities for [[UEFA Euro 2020]].

The city is renowned for its harsh winds, which is reflected in its nickname, the &quot;[[City of Winds]]&quot;.

==Etymology==
Baku is long attested under the [[Perso-Arabic]] name باکو (''Bākū''). Early [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources also refer to the city as ''Bākuh'' and ''Bākuya'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunlop|first1=D.M.|last2=Bennigsen|first2=A.|last3=Bosworth|first3=C.E.|title=Historic Cities of the Islamic World|editor-last=Bosworth|editor-first=C. Edmund|authorlink3=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|editor-link=Clifford Edmund Bosworth|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden &amp; Boston|year=2007|url=http://nessia.org/files/original/7fb5287183e94fb6ea34e8c74d7f9de9.pdf|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which seem to come from a [[Persian language|Persian]] name. The further etymology is unclear.

A [[folk etymology|popular etymology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://bakucity.preslib.az/en/page/oj8veb7H6a &quot;The origin and etymology&quot;, ''Bakucity.preslib.az'']&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century considered it to be derived from Persian بادکوبه (''Bâd-kube'', meaning &quot;wind-pounded city&quot;, a compound of ''bād'', &quot;wind&quot;, and ''kube'', which is rooted in the verb کوبیدن ''kubidan'', &quot;to pound&quot;, thus referring to a place where wind would be strong and pounding,&lt;ref name=&quot;Web.archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212555/http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archivedate=13 October 2007 |title=Culture &amp; Religion on Podium: Politicizing Linguistics |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=25 July 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the case of Baku, which is known to experience fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds). This popular name (''Badkubə'' in modern Azerbaijani script) actually gained currency as a nickname for the city by the 19th century (e.g., it is used in ''[[Akinchi]]'', volume 1, issue 1, p. 1), and is also reflected in the city's modern nickname as the &quot;[[City of Winds]]&quot; ({{lang-az|Küləklər şəhəri|link=no}}). Another and even less probable folk etymology explains the name as deriving from ''Baghkuy'', meaning &quot;God's town&quot;. ''Baga'' (now ''بغ'' ''bagh'') and ''kuy'' are the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] words for &quot;god&quot; and &quot;town&quot; respectively; the name ''Baghkuy'' may be compared with ''[[Baghdad|Baghdād]]'' (&quot;God-given&quot;) in which ''dād'' is the Old Persian word for &quot;give&quot;. 

During [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule]], the city was spelled in Cyrillic as &quot;Бакы&quot; in Azerbaijani (while the [[Russian language|Russian]] spelling was and still is &quot;Баку&quot;, {{transl|ru|Bakú}}). The modern Azerbaijani spelling, which has been using the Latin alphabet since 1991, is {{lang|az|Bakı}}; the shift from the Perso-Arabic letter و (''ū'') to Cyrillic &quot;ы&quot; and, later, Latin &quot;ı&quot; may be compared to that in other Azerbaijani words (e.g. compare {{wt|az|قاپو}} ''qāpū'' in old Perso-Arabic spelling with modern Azerbaijani ''{{wt|az|qapı}}'', &quot;door&quot;) or in suffixes, as و was often used to transcribe the [[vowel harmony]] in Azerbaijani (which was also the practice in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]). (See also [[Azerbaijani alphabet]].)

===Antiquity===
[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|Roman stone inscription in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]] dating back to 84–96 A.D.]]
Around 100,000 years ago, the territory of modern Baku and [[Absheron Rayon|Absheron]] was [[savanna]] with rich flora and fauna.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Traces of human settlement go back to the [[Stone age]]. From the [[Bronze age]] there have been rock carvings discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish discovered in the territory of the Old City. These have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze Age settlement within the city's territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerisite.narod.ru/2.html Город Баку...] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319033931/http://azerisite.narod.ru/2.html |date=19 March 2014 }} Retrieved on 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Near [[Nardaran]], in a place called Umid Gaya, a prehistoric observatory was discovered, where on the rock the images of sun and various constellations are carved together with a primitive astronomic table.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Observatory of Absheron. ''Gobustan'', No 3 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Further archeological excavations revealed various prehistoric settlements, native temples, statues and other artifacts within the territory of the modern city and around it.

In the 1st century CE, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] organized two Caucasian campaigns and reached Baku. Near the city, in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]], Roman inscriptions dating from 84–96&amp;nbsp;CE were discovered. This is one of the earliest written evidences for Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20080102011734/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm |archivedate=2 January 2008 |title=Azerbaijan – Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace... |accessdate=14 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the Shirvanshahs and the Safavid era===
{{See also|Shirvanshah}}
[[File:1541-Battle in the war between Shah Isma'il and the King of Shirvan-Shahnama-i-Isma'il.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature painting]] marking the downfall of the Shirvanshahs at the hands of the Safavids.]]
Baku was the realm of the [[Shirvanshahs]] during the 8th century CE. The city frequently came under assault of the [[Khazars]] and (starting from the 10th century) the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]. [[Akhsitan I ibn Minuchihr III|Shirvanshah Akhsitan I]] built a navy in Baku and successfully repelled another Rus assault in 1170. After a devastating earthquake struck [[Shamakhi]], the capital of [[Shirvan]], Shirvanshah's court moved to Baku in 1191.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaspiy.az/rubrics.php?code=316 &quot;Ичери Шехер&quot;: быть или не быть] Retrieved on 25 June 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620120625/http://www.kaspiy.az/rubrics.php?code=316 |date=20 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sabayil relics.jpg|thumb|Relics from the sunken [[Sabayil Castle]].]]
The Shirvan era greatly influenced Baku and the remainder of what is present-day Azerbaijan. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, massive fortifications were undertaken in Baku and the surrounding towns. The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]], the [[Ramana Tower]], the [[Nardaran Fortress]], the Shagan Castle, the [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Mardakan Castle]], the [[Round Castle (Mardakan)|Round Castle]] and also the famous [[Sabayil Castle]] on the island of the [[Bay of Baku]] was built during this period. The [[Old City (Baku)|city walls of Baku]] were also rebuilt and strengthened.

By the early 16th century Baku's wealth and strategic position attracted the focus of its larger neighbors; in the previous two centuries, it was under the rule of the in Iran-centred [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]]. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian [[Safavid dynasty]], led by king (''[[shah]]'') [[Ismail I]] (r. 1501–1524). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king [[Tahmasp I]] (r. 1524–1576), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power, and made Baku a part of the [[Safavid Shirvan|Shirvan]] province. Baku remained as an integral part of his empire and the successive Iranian dynasties to come for the next centuries, until the irrevocable cession in the [[Treaty of Gulistan|first half of the 19th century]]. The House of Shirvan, who ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of the Safavid rule.

At this time the city was enclosed within the lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. The Ottomans briefly gained control over Baku as a result of the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590]]; by 1607, it was again put under Iranian control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&amp;pg=PA65|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-919-5|author1=Dumper|first1=Michael|last2=Stanley|first2=Bruce E|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1604 Baku fortress was destroyed by Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (r. 1588-1629).

Baku is noted for being a focal point for traders from all across the world during the [[Early modern period]], commerce was active and the area was prosperous. Notably, traders from the [[Indian subcontinent]] established themselves in the region. These Indian traders built the [[Ateshgah of Baku]] during 17th–18th centuries; the temple was used as a [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]], and [[Parsi]] place of worship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziyadov2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Taleh Ziyadov|title=Azerbaijan as a Regional Hub in Central Eurasia: Strategic Assessment of Euro-Asian Trade and Transportation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48CHpkjeCcEC&amp;pg=PA94|year=2012|publisher=Taleh Ziyadov|isbn=978-9952-34-801-9|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Downfall of the Safavids and the Khanate of Baku ===
In the wake of the demise of the Safavids, the Russians took advantage of the situation [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)|and invaded]]; the Safavids were forced to cede Baku to Russia for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/the-caucasus-in-the-system-of-international-relations-the-turkmanchay-treaty-was-signed-180-years-ago|title=The Caucasus in the System of International Relations: The Turkmanchay Treaty was Signed 180 Years Ago|author=Shukiurov Kerim|work=[[Cyberleninka]]|accessdate=30 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629192734/http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/the-caucasus-in-the-system-of-international-relations-the-turkmanchay-treaty-was-signed-180-years-ago|archive-date=29 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1730, the situation had deteriorated for the Russians; the successes of [[Nader Shah]] (r. 1736–1747) forced them to make an [[Treaty of Ganja|agreement]] near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] on 10 March 1735, ceding the city and all other conquered territories in the Caucasus back to [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikaberidze|first=Alexander|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia|year=2011|location=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1-59884-336-2|page=329|editor=Mikaberidze, Alexander|chapter=Treaty of Ganja (1735)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russo-Persian Wars and Iran's forced ceding ===

From the late 18th century, Imperial Russia switched to a more aggressive geopolitical stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south, namely Iran and the Ottoman Empire. In the spring of 1796, by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]]’s order, General [[Valerian Zubov]]’s troops started [[Persian Expedition of 1796|a large campaign]] against [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/9137125/Relations_between_Tehran_and_Moscow_1979-2014|title=Relations between Tehran and Moscow, 1797–2014|accessdate=9 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501122208/http://www.academia.edu/9137125/Relations_between_Tehran_and_Moscow_1979-2014|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zubov had sent 13,000 men to capture Baku, and it was overrun subsequently without any resistance. On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was placed inside the city. Later, however, [[Paul I of Russia|Pavel I]] ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following his predecessor, [[Catherine the Great]]'s death. In March 1797, the tsarist troops left Baku and the city became part of [[Qajar Iran]] again.

In 1813, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813]], Qajar Iran was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] with Russia, which provided for the irrevocable cession of Baku and most of Iran's territories in the [[North Caucasus]] and [[South Caucasus]] to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between the two, the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–28)|Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828]], Baku was briefly recaptured by the Iranians. However, militarily superior, the Russians ended this war in a victory as well, and the resulting [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] made its inclusion into the [[Russian Empire]] definite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mojtahed-Zadeh, Pirouz|year=2007|title=Boundary Politics and International Boundaries of Iran: A Study of the Origin, Evolution, and Implications of the Boundaries of Modern Iran with Its 15 Neighbors in the Middle East by a Number of Renowned Experts in the Field|publisher=Universal|isbn=1-58112-933-5|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|war of 1804–13]], nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=James B.

=== Discovery of oil ===
{{Main|Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan}}
[[File:BibiEybat.jpg|thumb|Oil workers digging an oil well by hand at Bibi-Heybat.]]

The Russians built the first [[oil refinery|oil-distilling factory]] in [[Balaxani]] in 1837.  Drilling for oil began in the mid-1800s, with the first [[oil well]] drilled in the [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque|Bibi-Heybat]] suburb of Baku in 1846.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smil&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smil |first1=Vaclav |title=Energy and Civilization: A History |date=2017 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=9780262035774 |page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was mechanically drilled, though a number of hand-dug wells predate it. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872 when Russian imperial authorities auctioned the parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. The pioneer of oil extracting from the bottom of the sea was Polish geologist Witold Zglenicki.&lt;ref&gt;[[Witold Zglenicki]]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that Swiss, British, French, Belgian, German, Swedish and American investors appeared in Baku. Among them were the firms of the [[Robert Nobel|Nobel brothers]] together with the family [[Schuch|von Börtzell-Szuch]] (Carl Knut Börtzell, who also owned the [[Livadia Palace]]) and the [[Rothschild family]]. An industrial oil belt, better known as Black City, was established near Baku.

Professor [[A. V. Williams Jackson]] of Columbia University wrote in his work ''From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam'' (1911):
{{quotation|Baku is a city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity... At present Baku produces one-fifth of the oil that is used in the world, and the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found. Verily, the words of the Scriptures find illustration here: 'the rock poured me out rivers of oil.

Oil is in the air one breathes, in one's nostrils, in one's eyes, in the water of the morning bath (though not in the drinking water, for that is brought in bottles from distant mineral springs), in one's starched linen – everywhere. This is the impression one carries away from Baku, and it is certainly true in the environs.''&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson. {{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/fromconstantino00jackgoog#page/n10/mode/2up|title=From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam|publisher=The Macmillan Company, 1911, p. 25|accessdate=1 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318114642/http://www.archive.org/stream/fromconstantino00jackgoog#page/n10/mode/2up|archive-date=18 March 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the beginning of the 20th century, half of the oil sold in international markets was being extracted in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVABAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 |title=Troubled Waters: The Geopolitics of the Caspian Region |publisher=I.B. Tauris|authors=R.Hrair Dekmejian, Hovann H. Simonian |year=2003|page=16|isbn=978-0-85771-755-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[oil boom]] contributed to the massive growth of Baku. Between 1856 and 1910 Baku's population grew at a faster rate than that of [[London]], [[Paris]] or [[New York City|New York]].

=== World War I ===

In 1917, after the [[October Revolution]] and amidst the turmoil of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian revolution|breakup of the Russian Empire]], Baku came under the control of the [[26 Baku Commissars|Baku Commune]], which was led by veteran Bolshevik [[Stepan Shahumyan]]. Seeking to capitalize on the existing inter-ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil warfare in and around Baku. During the infamous [[March Days]], Bolsheviks and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]] seeking to establish control over Baku streets, were faced with armed Azerbaijani groups. The Azerbaijanis suffered a crushing defeat by the united forces of Baku Soviet and were massacred by Dashnak teams in what was called [[March Days]]. An estimated 3,000–12,000 Azerbaijanis were killed in their own capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;smithmusavat&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Michael |last2= |first2= |date=April 2001 |title=Anatomy of Rumor: Murder Scandal, the Musavat Party and Narrative of the Russian Revolution in Baku, 1917–1920 |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |publisher= |volume=36 |issue=2 |page=228 |url= |doi= 10.1177/002200940103600202|quote=''The results of the March events were immediate and total for the Musavat.

Shortly after, Azerbaijani forces, with support of the [[Ottoman Army of Islam]] led by [[Nuri Killigil|Nuru Pasha]], started their advance onto Baku, eventually capturing the city from the loose coalition of [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]], [[Menshevik]]s and British forces under the command of General [[Lionel Dunsterville]] on 15 September 1918.

After the [[Battle of Baku]], the Azerbaijani irregular troops, with the tacit support of the Turkish command, conducted four days of pillaging and killing of 10,000 to 30,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Gen&quot;&gt;Andreopoulos, George (1997).

Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, {{ISBN|0-8122-1616-4}}, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Armenians in Baku|Armenian residents of Baku]]. This pogrom was known as the [[September Days]]. Shortly after this, Baku was proclaimed the new capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

Turkey lost the war by October 1918, then conducted the [[Armistice of Mudros]] with the British, which meant Baku was to be evacuated. Headed by General [[William Montgomery Thomson|William Thomson]], British troops of 5,000 soldiers, including parts of Dunsterforce, arrived in Baku on 17 November. Thomson declared himself military governor of Baku and implemented [[martial law]] on the capital until &quot;the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order&quot;. British forces left before the end of 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Behbudov|first1=Tahir|title=British Police in Baku|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/99/afcf2df0/|website=Visions of Azerbaijan|access-date=31 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831184344/http://www.visions.az/en/news/99/afcf2df0/|archive-date=31 August 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet period ===
The independence of the Azerbaijani republic was significant but a short-lived chapter. On 28 April 1920, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]] invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The city underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of Soviet life. Baku was the major oil city of the Soviet Union. Since about 1921, the city was headed by Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as ''Bakgorispolkom''. Together with Baku Party Committee (known as the ''Baksovet''), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930, Baku was the venue for one of the major [[Trade fair]]s of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Forestier-Peyrat, ″[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ab_imperio/summary/v2013/2013.4.forestier-peyrat.html Red Passage to Iran: Baku Trade Fair and the Unmaking of the Azerbaijani Borderland, 1922–1930] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115115/http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ab_imperio/summary/v2013/2013.4.forestier-peyrat.html |date=4 March 2016 }}″, ''Ab Imperio'', Vol 2013, Issue 4, pp. 79–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===
Baku's growing importance as a major energy hub remained in sight of the major powers. During [[World War II]] and the [[Case Blue|Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union]], Baku had become of vital strategic importance. In fact, capturing the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|oil fields of Baku]] was one of the ultimate goals of [[Operation Edelweiss]], carried out between May and November 1942. However, the German Army's closest approach to Baku was no closer than some {{convert|530|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city's capture before being driven back during the Soviet [[Operation Little Saturn]] in mid-December 1942.

=== Fall of the Soviet Union and later ===
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money from oil changes the face of Azerbaijan|url=http://news.az/articles/society/41029|publisher=news.az|accessdate=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726173757/http://www.news.az/articles/society/41029|archive-date=26 July 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of buildings from the Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the [[Baku Bay]]. Improvements were made in the general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection, and these services are now at Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at full speed on an east-west axis along the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Sustainability has become a key factor in future urban development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bakuwhitecity.com/en/page/4-sustainability|title=Baku White City – Sustainability|website=www.bakuwhitecity.com|access-date=2017-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426060345/http://www.bakuwhitecity.com/en/page/4-sustainability|archive-date=26 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Baku, Azerbaijan, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2010-09-06.jpg|thumb|Absheron Peninsular satellite image, [[Landsat 5]], 6 September 2010]]
Baku is situated on the western coast of [[Caspian Sea]]. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of [[mud volcano]]es (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, [[Lokbatan]] and others) and [[salt lake]]s ([[Lake Boyukshor|Boyukshor]], Khodasan and so on).

=== Climate ===
Baku has a [[temperate]] [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') with hot and humid summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with such climate features, Baku does not see extremely hot summers and substantial sunshine hours. This is largely because of its northerly [[latitude]] and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea. Baku and the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ([[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] here is around or less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons are particularly wet.
During Soviet times, Baku with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated [[destination spa|spa]] complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city's past as a Soviet industrial center has left it as one of the most polluted cities in the world, {{As of|2008|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesPollution&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |title=The World's Dirtiest Cities |work=Forbes |author=Tiffany M. Luck |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202072636/http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |archivedate=2 December 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, hence the city's nickname the &quot;[[City of Winds]]&quot;, and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind ''[[khazri]]'' and the warm southern wind ''[[gilavar]]'' are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web.archive.org&quot;/&gt;
The speed of the ''khazri'' sometimes reaches 144&amp;nbsp;km/h (89&amp;nbsp;mph), which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |title=Global ICT Conference: 25–28, November, 2004 : Baku, Azerbaijan |publisher=Global-ict.mincom.gov.az |accessdate=17 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719093010/http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily mean temperature in July and August averages {{convert|26.4|°C|°F}}, and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer the ''khazri'' sweeps through, bringing desired coolness. Winter is cool and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging {{convert|4.3|°C|°F}}. During winter the ''khazri'' sweeps through, driven by polar [[air mass]]es; temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and make it feel bitterly cold. Winter [[Winter storm|snow storms]] are occasional; [[snow]] usually melts within a few days after each snowfall.

== Demographics ==
Until 1988 Baku had very large Russian, Armenian, and Jewish populations which contributed to [[cultural diversity]] and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture and progressive outlook) to Baku's history. With the onset of the [[Karabakh War]] and the [[Pogrom of Armenians in Baku|pogrom against Armenians]] starting in January 1990, the city's large Armenian population was expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijan: The status of Armenians, Russians, Jews and other minorities, report, 1993, INS Resource Informacion Center, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-44300/Azerbaijan#481451.hook |title=Azerbaijan – The Soviet and post-Soviet periods |encyclopedia=Britannica |accessdate=17 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418173138/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-44300/Azerbaijan#481451.hook |archive-date=18 April 2008 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Communism, the Soviets took over the majority of Jewish property in Baku and Kuba. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[President of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani President]] [[Heydar Aliyev]] returned several synagogues and a Jewish college, nationalized by the Soviets, to the Jewish community. He encouraged the restoration of these buildings and is well liked by the Jews of Azerbaijan. Renovation has begun on seven of the original 11 synagogues, including the Gilah synagogue, built in 1896, and the large Kruei Synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Azerbaijan.html |title=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |publisher=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714014134/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Azerbaijan.html |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:Christmas in Baku on January 6, 1904 and Armenian church.jpg|thumb|The Armenian [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator's Church, Baku]]]]
Today the vast majority of the population of Baku are ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] (more than 90%). When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)|war of 1804–13]], nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;/&gt; The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with a population of about 7,000 people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-946.html |title=Country-data.com |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706060044/http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-946.html |archive-date=6 July 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Altstadt, Conflict, Cleavage and Change in Central Asia and the Caucasus, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997, p. 112, table 4.1, Ethnic composition of Baku, 1897, 1903,1913&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 [[internally displaced person]]s and 93,400 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701132551/http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm |archivedate=1 July 2007 |script-title=ru:Баку |accessdate=15 July 2007 |language=ru |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Герейханов|first1=Гаджи Пирмурадович|last2=Лукьянов|first2=Алексей Григорьевич|last3=Моренов|first3=Игорь Сергеевич|title=Угрозы национальной безопасности России на Северном Кавказе: этноконфессиональный аспект|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=360iAQAAIAAJ|year=2004|publisher=Граница}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
[[File:Bibi-Eybat mosque, Baku, 2009.jpg|thumb|The 13th-century [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]]. The mosque was built over the tomb of a descendant of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharifov|first=Azad|title=Legend of the Bibi-Heybat Mosque|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_bibiheybat.html|publisher=Azerbaijan International Magazine|accessdate=11 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605015723/http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_bibiheybat.html|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The urban landscape of Baku is shaped by many communities. The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. The majority of the Muslims are [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world after [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo,''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p.625&lt;/ref&gt; The city's notable mosques include [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]], [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]], [[Muhammad Mosque (Baku)|Muhammad Mosque]] and [[Taza Pir Mosque]].

There are some other faiths practiced among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]], Azerbaijan is a [[secular state]] and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include [[Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox Christians]], [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Catholic Levantines]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox Christians]], [[Lutherans]], [[Azerbaijani Jews|Ashkenazi]] Jews and [[Sufi]] Muslims. Baky is the seat of the Catholic [[Apostolic Prefecture of Azerbaijan]].

[[Zoroastrianism]], although extinct in the city as well as in the rest of the country by the present time, had a long [[Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan|history in Azerbaijan]] and the [[Nowruz|Zoroastrian New Year]] (Nowruz) continues to be the main holiday in the city as well as in the rest of Azerbaijan.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Baku}}
Baku's largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan's [[balance of payments]]. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |title=The History of Oil in Azerbaijan by Natig Aliyev |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=22 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424163308/http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |archivedate=24 April 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.
Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Baku oil fields]] were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century [[skilled worker]]s and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] equipment before World War II. The World War II [[Battle of Stalingrad]] was fought to determine who would have control of Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aghazade|first=Emil|title=Азербайджан: сто лет надежд|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/business/newsid_4649000/4649873.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=4 July 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406161830/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/business/newsid_4649000/4649873.stm|archive-date=6 April 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive [[Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli|Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli]] field (Shallow water Gunashli by [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic|SOCAR]], deeper areas by a consortium led by [[BP]]), development of the [[Shah Deniz gas field]], the expansion of the [[Sangachal Terminal]] and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|BTC Pipeline]].

The [[Baku Stock Exchange]] is Azerbaijan's largest [[stock exchange]], and largest in the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] region by [[market capitalization]]. A relatively large number of transnational companies are headquartered in Baku. One of the more prominent institutions headquartered in Baku is the [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]], which employs over 1,000 people. International banks with branches in Baku include [[HSBC]], [[Société Générale]] and [[Credit Suisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abdullayev |first=Rovshan |title=Which foreign banks has Azerbaijan capital been trusted in? |url=http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm |accessdate=6 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518140408/http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm |archivedate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism and shopping ===
Baku is one of the most important tourist destinations in the Caucasus, with hotels in the city earning 7 million euros in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azerbaijan24.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/224-hotels-in-baku.html |title=Hotels in Baku earned 6,8&amp;nbsp;million euros last year |publisher=Azerbaijan24.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917135847/http://azerbaijan24.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/224-hotels-in-baku.html |archivedate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sizable world [[hotel chain]]s have a presence in the city. Baku has many popular tourist and entertainment spots, such as the downtown [[Fountains Square, Baku|Fountains Square]], the One and Thousand Nights Beach, [[Shikhov Beach]] and [[Oil Rocks]]. Baku's vicinities feature [[Yanar Dag]], an ever-blazing spot of natural gas. On 2 September 2010, with the inauguration of [[National Flag Square]], Baku became home to the world's tallest [[flagpole]], according to the [[Guinness Book of Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani flag flies on world's tallest flagpole |url=http://news.az/articles/22041 |publisher=news.az |accessdate=2 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904092905/http://www.news.az/articles/22041 |archivedate=4 September 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İşte dünyanın en yüksek bayrak direği |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25128411/ |language=Turkish |publisher=ntvmsnbc.com |accessdate=2 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20100904080023/http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25128411/ |archivedate=4 September 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 24 May 2011 Baku lost this record by just {{convert|3|m|abbr=off}} to the city of Dushanbe in Tajikistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-1/tallest-unsupported-flagpole|title=Guinness World Records|work=guinnessworldrecords.com|access-date=6 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227105920/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-1/tallest-unsupported-flagpole/|archive-date=27 February 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2017, the Flag Pole is dismantled and the National Flag Square closed with fences.

Baku has several shopping malls; the most famous city center malls are Port Baku, [[Park Bulvar]], Ganjlik Mall, [[Metro Park]], [[28 MALL]], [[Aygun city]] and [[AF MALL]]. The retail areas contain shops from chain stores up to high-end boutiques.

The city is listed 48th in the 2011 [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees|list]] of the most expensive cities in the world conducted by the [[Mercer Human Resource Consulting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/24264196.html |title=Bakı dünyanın ən bahalı 48-ci şəhəridir, 13 July 2011, Azadlıq Radiosu.

== Culture ==
The city has many amenities that offer a wide range of cultural activities, drawing both from a rich local dramatic portfolio and an international repertoire. In 2007 the [[Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]] designed by famous Iraqi-British architect, Zaha Hadid, was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heydaraliyevcenter.az/#1_AboutUs|title=Heydər Əliyev Mərkəzi|website=heydaraliyevcenter.az|access-date=2018-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224031726/http://heydaraliyevcenter.az/#1_AboutUs|archive-date=24 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baku also boasts many museums such as [[Baku Museum of Modern Art]] and [[Azerbaijan State Museum of History]], most notably featuring historical artifacts and [[art museum|art]].

Baku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the early 20th century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in [[eclecticism|eclectic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html |title=Baku's Architecture:A Fusion of East and West |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116060241/http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html |archive-date=16 November 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baku has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window2baku.com/006development.htm Архитектурное развитие города] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515072252/http://www.window2baku.com/006development.htm |date=15 May 2010 }} {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baku joined [[UNESCO]]'s [[Creative Cities Network|Network of Creative Cities]] as a Design City on October 31, 2019 on the occasion of World Cities’ Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-celebrates-world-cities-day-designating-66-new-creative-cities|title=UNESCO celebrates World Cities Day designating 66 new Creative Cities|date=2019-10-30|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamams ===

The [[Turkish bath|Hamam]] tradition in Baku is interesting. There are a number of ancient hamams in Baku dating back to the 12th, 14th and 18th centuries. Hamams play a very important role in the architectural appearance of Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gadimova |first1=Nazrin |title=Traditional hamams in all its glory in Baku |url=https://www.azernews.az/travel/62986.html |website=AzerNews.az |language=en |date=8 January 2014 |access-date=19 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123131702/https://www.azernews.az/travel/62986.html |archive-date=23 January 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Teze Bey Hamam ====
Teze Bey is the most popular hamam (traditional bath) in Baku. It was built in 1886 in the center of Baku and in 2003 it was fully restored and modernized. Along with its modern amenities, Teze Bey features a swimming pool and architectural details inspired by Oriental, Russian and Finnish baths.

==== Gum Hamam ====
Gum Hamam was discovered during archaeological excavations underneath the sand; hence the name: Gum hamam (sand bath). It was built sometime during the 12th–14th centuries.

==== Bairamali hamam ====
In ancient times Bairamali Hamam was called “Bey Hamam”. The original structure was built sometime during the 12th–14th centuries and was reconstructed in 1881.

==== Agha Mikayil Hamam ====
Agha Mikayil Hamam was constructed in the 18th century by Haji Agha Mikayil on Kichik Gala Street in the Old City (Icherisheher). It is still operating in its ancient setting. The Hamam is open to women on Mondays and Fridays and to men on the other days of the week.

=== Modern architecture ===
 
Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the [[Azerbaijan Tower]], [[Heydar Aliyev Center|Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]] and [[SOCAR Tower]]. These projects also caught the attention of international media as notable programmes such as [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Extreme Engineering]] did pieces focusing in on changes to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center And Flame Towers|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/projects/azerbaijan/heydar-aliyev-cultural-center.html|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410130514/http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/projects/azerbaijan/heydar-aliyev-cultural-center.html|archive-date=10 April 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived. This section is picturesque, with its maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings: the cobbled streets past the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]], two [[Caravanserai|caravansaries]], the baths and the [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]] (which used to house the [[Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum|Azerbaijan National Carpet and Arts Museum]] but is now a mosque again). The old town core also has dozens of small mosques, often without any particular sign to distinguish them as such.

In 2003, UNESCO placed the Inner City on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]], citing damage from a [[2000 Baku earthquake|November 2000 earthquake]], poor conservation as well as &quot;dubious&quot; restoration efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |accessdate=22 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302171720/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |archive-date=2 March 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Inner City was removed from the List of World Heritage in Danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Centre |first1=UNESCO World Heritage |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en |access-date=22 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922173754/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |archive-date=22 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history the transport system of Baku used the now-defunct [[horsecar]]s, trams and [[narrow gauge railways]]. {{As of|2011}}, 1,000 [[Hackney carriage|black cabs]] are ordered by Baku Taxi Company, and as part of a programme originally announced by the Transport Ministry of Azerbaijan, there is a plan to introduce London cabs into Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Meidment|first=Neil|title=Manganese Bronze seals biggest London taxi order|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/03/us-manganese-bronze-idUSTRE7225WO20110303|work=Reuters|accessdate=4 March 2011|date=3 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619074110/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/03/us-manganese-bronze-idUSTRE7225WO20110303|archive-date=19 June 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaglom|first=Ben|title=Manganese takes black cab to Azerbaijan|url=http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/news/1607588/manganese-takes-black-cab-to-azerbaijan.thtml|accessdate=4 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307042107/http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/news/1607588/manganese-takes-black-cab-to-azerbaijan.thtml|archive-date=7 March 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was part of £16&amp;nbsp;million agreement between [[Manganese Bronze]] subsidiary [[London Taxis International|LTI Limited]] and Baku Taxi Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,000 London taxis for Azerbaijan|url=http://business.scotsman.com/business/1000-London-taxis-for-Azerbaijan.6728118.jp|accessdate=4 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629145409/http://business.scotsman.com/business/1000-London-taxis-for-Azerbaijan.6728118.jp|archive-date=29 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British firm wins £16m Azerbaijan order for its Chinese built taxis|url=http://www.worksmanagement.co.uk/article/31946/British-firm-wins-16m-Azerbaijan-order-for-its-Chinese-built-taxis.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505132109/http://www.worksmanagement.co.uk/article/31946/British-firm-wins-16m-Azerbaijan-order-for-its-Chinese-built-taxis.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 May 2013|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local rail transport includes the [[Baku Funicular]] and the [[Baku Metro]], a rapid-transit system notable for its art, murals, mosaics and ornate chandeliers. Baku Metro was opened in November 1967 and includes 3 lines and 25 stations at present; 170 million people used Baku Metro over the past five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=86101 |title=Baku Metro Chief: &quot;Baku-Sumgait metro line is not planned&quot; |publisher=En.apa.az |accessdate=17 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120005727/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=86101 |archivedate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Chief of Baku Metro, Taghi Ahmadov, announced plans to construct 41 new stations over the next 17 years. These will serve the new [[Baku International Bus Terminal|bus complex]] as well as the international airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.today.az/news/business/48132.html|title=41 new underground stations to be constructed in Azerbaijani capital in the next 17 years|date=10 October 2008|work=Today.az|accessdate=14 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909102201/http://www.today.az/news/business/48132.html|archive-date=9 September 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2019, the [[Baku suburban railway]] opened.

[[BakuCard]] is a single Smart Card for payment on all types of city transport. The intercity buses and metro use this type of card-based fare-payment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to pay your fare-Bakı Metropoliteni|url=http://www.metro.gov.az/en/howtouse|website=www.metro.gov.az|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509051621/http://www.metro.gov.az/en/howtouse|archive-date=9 May 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BakuBus.az|url=https://www.bakubus.az/en/menus/3/ticket_and_prices|website=www.bakubus.az|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403013411/https://www.bakubus.az/en/menus/3/ticket_and_prices|archive-date=3 April 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baku Railway Station]] is the terminus for national and international rail links to the city. The [[Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway]], which directly connects [[Turkey]], Georgia and [[Azerbaijan]], began to be constructed in 2007 and opened in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijani FM: Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railroad to be built in 2012|url=http://en.trend.az/capital/business/1767013.html|publisher=trend.az|accessdate=26 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018053243/http://en.trend.az/capital/business/1767013.html|archive-date=18 October 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed branch will connect Baku with [[Tbilisi]] in Georgia, and from there trains will continue to [[Akhalkalaki]], and [[Kars]] in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[[Railway Gazette International]] February 2009 p54 with map&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Копия 02252 1026.jpg|thumb|left|Baku Yacht Club]]
Sea transport is vital for Baku, as the city is practically surrounded by the [[Caspian Sea]] to the east. Shipping services operate regularly from Baku across the Caspian Sea to [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Turkmenbashi]] (formerly Krasnovodsk) in [[Turkmenistan]] and to [[Bandar-e Anzali|Bandar Anzali]] and [[Nowshahr|Bandar Nowshar]] in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.trend.az/capital/transport/1641349.html |title=Baku Sea Port expects for passenger trip Anzali-Baku |publisher=En.trend.az |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219235222/http://en.trend.az/capital/transport/1641349.html |archive-date=19 February 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commuter ferries, along with the high-speed catamaran ''Seabus'' (''Deniz Avtobusu''), also form the main connection between the city and the [[Absheron peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azerbaijan24.com/transport/38-transport-azerbaijan/60-ferryservicebaku.html |title=Ferry Service across Caspian sea |publisher=Azerbaijan24.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329212348/http://azerbaijan24.com/transport/38-transport-azerbaijan/60-ferryservicebaku.html |archivedate=29 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku Port was founded in 1902 and since then has been the largest Caspian Sea port. It has six facilities: the main cargo terminal, the container terminal, the ferry terminal, the oil terminal, the passenger terminal and the port fleet terminal. The port's throughput capacity reaches 15 million [[ton]]s of liquid bulk and up to 10 million tons of dry cargoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakuseaport.az/eng.html |title=Baku Sea Port |publisher=Bakuseaport.az |accessdate=7 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416011348/http://www.bakuseaport.az/eng.html |archivedate=16 April 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beginning in 2010, the [[Baku International Sea Trade Port]] is being reconstructed. The construction will take place in three stages and will be completed by 2016. The estimated costs are 400 Million US$.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-hesse.com/Aserbaidschan_Reisebericht.html|title=Azerbaijan, Baku|publisher=m-hesse.com|accessdate=1 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115070748/http://www.m-hesse.com/Aserbaidschan_Reisebericht.html|archive-date=15 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April to November Baku Port is accessible to ships loading cargoes for direct voyages from Western European and Mediterranean ports. The State Road M-1 and the [[European route E60]] are the two main motorway connections between Europe and Azerbaijan. The motorway network around Baku is well developed and is constantly being extended.
The [[Heydar Aliyev International Airport]] is the only commercial airport serving Baku. The new [[Baku Cargo Terminal]] was officially opened in March 2005. It was constructed to be a major cargo hub in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries and is actually now one of the biggest and most technically advanced in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/baku/ |title=Heydar Aliyev International Airport (BAK/UBBB), Baku, Azerbaijan |publisher=Airport-technology.com |accessdate=17 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312085043/http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/baku/ |archivedate=12 March 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy}}{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several smaller [[military airbase]]s near Baku, such as [[Baku Kala Air Base]], intended for private aircraft, [[helicopter]]s and charters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://az.apa.az/print.php?id=146672 Fevralın 14-ü Azərbaycan Hərbi Hava Qüvvələrinin (HHQ) yaranma günüdür] {{in lang|az}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706131439/http://az.apa.az/print.php?id=146672 |date=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{See also|List of universities in Baku}}
Baku hosts many universities, junior colleges and vocational schools. [[Baku State University]], the first established university in Azerbaijan was opened in 1919 by the government of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. In the early years of the Soviet era, Baku already had [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy]], [[Azerbaijan Medical University]] and [[Azerbaijan State Economic University]]. In the post-WWII period, a few more universities were established such as [[Azerbaijan Technical University]], [[Azerbaijan University of Languages]] and the [[Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University]]. After 1991 when Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union, the fall of communism led to the development of a number of private institutions, including [[Qafqaz University]] and [[Khazar University]] which are currently considered the most prestigious academic institutions. Apart from the private universities, the government established the [[Academy of Public Administration (Azerbaijan)|Academy of Public Administration]], the [[Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy]] and various military academies. The largest universities according to the student population are Baku State University and Azerbaijan State Economic University. In addition, there are the [[Baku Music Academy]] and the Azerbaijan National Conservatoire in Baku established in the early 1920s. Publicly run kindergartens and elementary schools (years 1 through 11) are operated by local wards or municipal offices.

The [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], the main state research organization in Azerbaijan is locating in Baku as well. Moreover, Baku has numerous libraries, many of which contain vast collections of historic documents from the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Soviet periods, as well as from other civilisations of the past. The most important libraries in terms of historic document collections include the [[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature]], the [[National Library of Azerbaijan]], the Mirza Alakbar Central Library, the Samad Vurgun Library and Baku Presidential Library.

== Health care ==
The city has many public and private hospitals, clinics and laboratories within its bounds and numerous medical research centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Energy-Rich, Healthcare-Poor|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav073008af.shtml|publisher=Eurasianet.org|accessdate=25 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131055011/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav073008af.shtml|archive-date=31 January 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these facilities have [[high tech]]nology equipment, which has contributed to the recent upsurge in &quot;[[medical tourism]]&quot; to Baku, particularly from post-Soviet countries such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Moldova]], whose governments send lower-income patients to the city for inexpensive high-tech medical treatments and operations.

Because of its intermittent periods of great prosperity as well as being the largest city in the Caucasus and one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse in the Soviet Union, Baku prides itself on having produced a disproportionate number of notable figures in the sciences, arts and other fields.
