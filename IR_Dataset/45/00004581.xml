==Signs and symptoms==
Common symptoms include increased [[vaginal discharge]] that usually smells like fish.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NIH2013S/&gt; --&gt; The discharge is often white or gray in color.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NIH2013S/&gt; --&gt; There may be [[Dysuria|burning with urination]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NIH2013S/&gt; --&gt; Occasionally, there may be no symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2013S/&gt;

The discharge coats the walls of the vagina, and is usually without significant irritation, pain, or [[erythema]] (redness), although mild [[Pruritus|itching]] can sometimes occur. By contrast, the normal vaginal discharge will vary in consistency and amount throughout the [[menstrual cycle]] and is at its clearest at [[ovulation]]—about two weeks before the [[menstruation|period]] starts. Some practitioners claim that BV can be asymptomatic in almost half of affected women,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11120507&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwebke JR | title = Asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis: response to therapy | journal = Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. | volume = 183 | issue = 6 | pages = 1434–9 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11120507 | doi = 10.1067/mob.2000.107735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though others argue that this is often a misdiagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forney LJ, Foster JA, Ledger W | title = The vaginal flora of healthy women is not always dominated by Lactobacillus species | journal = Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 194 | issue = 10 | pages = 1468–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17054080 | doi = 10.1086/508497 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complications===
Although previously considered a mere nuisance infection, untreated bacterial vaginosis may cause increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and [[pregnancy complication]]s.&lt;ref name=Amaya2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/STDFact-Bacterial-Vaginosis.htm#Complications |title=STD Facts — Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) |accessdate=4 December 2007 |work=CDC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071203214825/http://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/STDFact-Bacterial-Vaginosis.htm| archivedate= 3 December 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that HIV-infected women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) are more likely to transmit HIV to their sexual partners than those without BV.&lt;ref name=Bradshaw2015/&gt; Diagnostic criteria for BV have also been associated with a female genital tract factor that induces expression of HIV.&lt;ref name=Amaya2015/&gt;

There is evidence of an association between BV and increased rates of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name=Amaya2015/&gt; BV is associated with up to a six-fold increase in HIV shedding. BV is a risk factor for viral shedding and [[herpes simplex virus]] type 2 infection. BV may increase the risk of infection with or reactivation of [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV).&lt;ref name=Amaya2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SenokVerstraelen2009&quot;/&gt;

In addition, bacterial vaginosis as an [[intercurrent disease in pregnancy]] may increase the risk of pregnancy complications, most notably [[premature birth]] or [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bacterialvaginosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx Bacterial vaginosis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209032557/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bacterialvaginosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx |date=9 February 2014 }} from [[National Health Service]], UK.

==Causes==
{{main|List of bacterial vaginosis microbiota}}
Healthy vaginal microbiota consists of species which neither cause symptoms or infections, nor negatively affect pregnancy. It is dominated mainly by Lactobacillus species.&lt;ref name=Nardis2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PetrovaLievens2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrova|first1=Mariya I.|last2=Lievens|first2=Elke|last3=Malik|first3=Shweta|last4=Imholz|first4=Nicole|last5=Lebeer|first5=Sarah|title=Lactobacillus species as biomarkers and agents that can promote various aspects of vaginal health|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=6|pages=81|year=2015|issn=1664-042X|doi=10.3389/fphys.2015.00081|pmid=25859220|pmc=4373506}}&lt;/ref&gt; BV is defined by the disequilibrium in the [[List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women|vaginal microbiota]], with decline in the number of [[lactobacilli]]. While the infection involves a number of bacteria, it is believed that most infections start with [[Gardnerella vaginalis]] creating a [[biofilm]], which allows other [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic bacteria]] to thrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClarkTal2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=J. L.|last2=Stull-Lane|first2=A.|last3=Girerd|first3=P. H.|last4=Jefferson|first4=K.

One of the main risks for developing BV is [[douching]], which alters the vaginal microbiota and predisposes women to developing BV.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cottrell&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cottrell BH | title = An Updated Review of Evidence to Discourage Douching | journal = MCN: The American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 102–107; quiz 107–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20215951 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/NMC.0b013e3181cae9da }}&lt;/ref&gt; Douching is strongly discouraged by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] and various medical authorities, for this and other reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cottrell&quot; /&gt;

BV is a risk factor for [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and reproductive and obstetric disorders or negative outcomes.  &lt;!--Although BV can be associated with [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], there is no clear evidence of sexual transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bradshaw CS, Morton AN, Hocking J, Garland SM, Morris MB, Moss LM, Horvath LB, Kuzevska I, Fairley CK | title = High recurrence rates of bacterial vaginosis over the course of 12 months after oral metronidazole therapy and factors associated with recurrence | journal = J.

Having a [[Women who have sex with women|female partner]] increases the risk of BV by 60%. The bacteria associated with BV have been isolated from [[Male reproductive system|male genitalia]]. BV microbiota has been found in the [[penis]], [[coronal sulcus]], and [[male urethra]], in the male partners of infected females. Partners who have not been [[Circumcision|circumcised]] may act as a ‘[[Natural reservoir|reservoir]]’ increasing the likelihood of acquiring an infection after sexual intercourse. Another mode of transmission of the BV-associated microbiota is to a female sexual partner via skin-to-skin transfer. BV may be transmitted via the perineal enteric bacteria from the microbiota of the female and male genitalia.&lt;ref name=Amaya2015/&gt;

== Diagnosis==
[[File:Bacterial vaginosis workup.jpg|thumb|A [[pH indicator]] to detect vaginal alkalinization (here showing approximately pH 8), and a [[microscope slide]] to microscopically detect [[clue cells]].]]
To make a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, a swab from inside the vagina should be obtained. These swabs should be tested for:
* A characteristic &quot;fishy&quot; odor on [[Wet mount#Wet mount or temporary mount|wet mount]]. This test, called the ''whiff test'', is performed by adding a small amount of [[potassium hydroxide]] to a [[microscopic slide]] containing the vaginal discharge. A characteristic [[fishy odor]] is considered a positive whiff test and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.
* Loss of [[acidity]]. To control bacterial growth, the vagina is normally slightly acidic with a [[pH]] of 3.8–4.2. A swab of the discharge is put onto [[litmus paper]] to check its acidity. A pH greater than 4.5 is considered alkaline and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.
* The presence of ''[[clue cell]]s'' on wet mount. Similar to the whiff test, the test for clue cells is performed by placing a drop of [[sodium chloride]] solution on a slide containing vaginal discharge. If present, clue cells can be visualized under a microscope. They are so-named because they give a clue to the reason behind the discharge. These are [[epithelial]] cells that are coated with bacteria.

Two positive results in addition to the discharge itself are enough to diagnose BV. If there is no discharge, then all three criteria are needed.&lt;ref name = Amsel&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amsel R, Totten PA, Spiegel CA, Chen KC, Eschenbach D, Holmes KK | title = Nonspecific vaginitis.

*[[Aerobic vaginitis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11845812&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donders GG, Vereecken A, Bosmans E, Dekeersmaecker A, Salembier G, Spitz B | title = Definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis | journal = BJOG | volume = 109 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–43 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11845812 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2002.00432.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center For Disease Control (CDC) defines STIs as &quot;a variety of clinical syndromes and infections caused by pathogens that can be acquired and transmitted through sexual activity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26042815&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Workowski KA, Bolan GA | title = Sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2015 | journal = MMWR Recomm Rep | volume = 64 | issue = RR-03 | pages = 1–137 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26042815 | pmc = 5885289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the CDC does not specifically identify BV as sexually transmitted infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc.gov&quot;/&gt;

=== Amsel criteria ===
In clinical practice BV can be diagnosed using the Amsel criteria:&lt;ref name = Amsel/&gt;

# Thin, white, yellow, homogeneous discharge
# [[Clue cell]]s on [[microscopy]]
# [[pH]] of vaginal fluid &gt;4.5
# Release of a fishy odor on adding [[alkali]]—10% [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution.

At least three of the four criteria should be present for a confirmed diagnosis.&lt;ref name=GCH&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=11602 |title=National guideline for the management of bacterial vaginosis (2006) |work=Clinical Effectiveness Group, British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103024402/http://guideline.gov/summary/summary.aspx?doc_id=11602 |archivedate=3 November 2008 |df=dmy-all |access-date=16 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A modification of the Amsel criteria accepts the presence of two instead of three factors and is considered equally diagnostic.

===Gram stain===
An alternative is to use a Gram-stained vaginal smear, with the Hay/Ison&lt;ref name = HayIson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ison CA, Hay PE | title = Validation of a simplified grading of Gram stained vaginal smears for use in genitourinary medicine clinics | journal = Sex Transm Infect | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 413–5 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12473800 | pmc = 1758337 | doi = 10.1136/sti.78.6.413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; criteria or the Nugent&lt;ref name=&quot;Nugent1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nugent RP, Krohn MA, Hillier SL | title = Reliability of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis is improved by a standardized method of gram stain interpretation | journal = J. Clin. Microbiol. | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 297–301 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1706728 | pmc = 269757 | url = http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1706728 }}&lt;/ref&gt; criteria. The Hay/Ison criteria are defined as follows:&lt;ref name=GCH/&gt;
* Grade 1 (Normal): [[Lactobacillus]] morphotypes predominate.
* Grade 2 (Intermediate): Some lactobacilli present, but ''Gardnerella'' or ''Mobiluncus'' morphotypes also present.
* Grade 3 (Bacterial Vaginosis): Predominantly ''Gardnerella'' and/or Mobiluncus morphotypes. Few or absent lactobacilli. (Hay et al., 1994)
Gardnerella vaginalis is the main culprit in BV. ''Gardnerella vaginalis'' is a short rod (coccobacillus). Hence, the presence of clue cells and gram variable coccobacilli are indicative or diagnostic of bacterial vaginosis.

===Nugent score===
The Nugent Score is now rarely used by physicians due to the time it takes to read the slides and requires the use of a trained microscopist.&lt;ref name=Bennett2015/&gt; A score of 0-10 is generated from combining three other scores.  The scores are as follows:
* 0–3 is considered negative for BV
* 4–6 is considered intermediate
* 7+ is considered indicative of BV.
At least 10–20 high power (1000× oil immersion) fields are counted and an average determined.

[[DNA hybridization]] testing with Affirm VPIII was compared to the Gram stain using the Nugent criteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17078859&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Gazi H, Degerli K, Kurt O, Teker A, Uyar Y, Caglar H, Kurutepe S, Surucuoglu S | title = Use of DNA hybridization test for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis in women with symptoms suggestive of infection | journal = APMIS | volume = 114 | issue = 11 | pages = 784–7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17078859 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0463.2006.apm_485.x | last8 = Surucuoglu }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Affirm VPIII test may be used for the rapid diagnosis of BV in symptomatic women but uses expensive proprietary equipment to read results, and does not detect other pathogens that cause BV, including Prevotella spp, Bacteroides spp, &amp; Mobiluncus spp.

==Prevention==
Some steps suggested to lower the risk include: not [[douching]], avoiding sex, or limiting the number of sex partners.&lt;ref name=CDCbv2014&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/bv/stdfact-bacterial-vaginosis.htm |title=Bacterial Vaginosis – CDC Fact Sheet |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |accessdate=6 May 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507225218/http://www.cdc.gov/std/BV/STDFact-Bacterial-Vaginosis.htm |archivedate=7 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One review concluded that probiotics may help prevent re-occurrence.&lt;ref name=Don2014/&gt; Another review found that, while there is tentative evidence, it is not strong enough to recommend their use for this purpose.&lt;ref name=Mastro2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mastromarino|first1=Paola|last2=Vitali|first2=Beatrice|last3=Mosca|first3=Luciana|title=Bacterial vaginosis: a review on clinical trials with probiotics|url=http://www.newmicrobiologica.org/PUB/allegati_pdf/2013/3/229.pdf|journal=New Microbiologica|date=2013|volume=36|issue=3|pages=229–238|pmid=23912864|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518165920/http://www.newmicrobiologica.org/PUB/allegati_pdf/2013/3/229.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early evidence suggested that antibiotic treatment of male partners could re-establish the normal microbiota of the male urogenital tract and prevent the recurrence of infection.&lt;ref name=Amaya2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amaya-Guio J, Viveros-Carreño DA, Sierra-Barrios EM, Martinez-Velasquez MY, Grillo-Ardila CF | title = Antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = CD011701 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27696372 | pmc = 6458027 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011701.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2016 Cochrane review found high-quality evidence that treating the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis had no effect on symptoms, clinical outcomes, or recurrence in the affected women. It also found that such treatment may lead treated sexual partners to report increased adverse events.&lt;ref name=Amaya2015/&gt;

==Treatment==

===Antibiotics===
Treatment is typically with the [[antibiotic]]s [[metronidazole]] or [[clindamycin]].&lt;ref name=Od2009/&gt; They can be either given by mouth or applied inside the vagina.&lt;ref name=Od2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Oduyebo OO, Anorlu RI, Ogunsola FT  | title = The effects of antimicrobial therapy on bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant women | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | issue = 3 | pages = CD006055 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588379 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006055.pub2 | editor1-last = Oduyebo | editor1-first = Oyinlola O }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 10% to 15% of people, however, do not improve with the first course of antibiotics and recurrence rates of up to 80% have been documented.&lt;ref name=&quot;SenokVerstraelen2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senok|first1=Abiola C|last2=Verstraelen|first2=Hans|last3=Temmerman|first3=Marleen|last4=Botta|first4=Giuseppe A|last5=Senok|first5=Abiola C|title=Probiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis|year=2009|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006289.pub2|pmid=19821358|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|pages=CD006289|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurrence rates are increased with sexual activity with the same pre-/posttreatment partner and inconsistent condom use although estrogen-containing contraceptives decrease recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bradshaw CS, Vodstrcil LA, Hocking JS, Law M, Pirotta M, Garland SM, De Guingand D, Morton AN, Fairley CK | title = Recurrence of bacterial vaginosis is significantly associated with posttreatment sexual activities and hormonal contraceptive use. | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 777–86 | date = Mar 2013 | pmid = 23243173 | doi = 10.1093/cid/cis1030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When clindamycin is given to pregnant women symptomatic with BV before 22 weeks of gestation the risk of pre-term birth before 37 weeks of gestation is lower.&lt;ref name=&quot;LamontNhan-Chang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamont|first1=Ronald F.|last2=Nhan-Chang|first2=Chia-Ling|last3=Sobel|first3=Jack D.|last4=Workowski|first4=Kimberly|last5=Conde-Agudelo|first5=Agustin|last6=Romero|first6=Roberto|title=Treatment of abnormal vaginal flora in early pregnancy with clindamycin for the prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: a systematic review and metaanalysis|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=205|issue=3|year=2011|pages=177–190|issn=0002-9378|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2011.03.047|pmid=22071048|pmc=3217181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other antibiotics that may work include [[macrolide]]s, [[lincosamide]]s, [[nitroimidazole]]s, and [[penicillin]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amaya2015&quot;/&gt;

Bacterial vaginosis is not considered a [[sexually transmitted infection]], and treatment of a male sexual partner of a woman with bacterial vaginosis is not recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mehta SD | title = Systematic review of randomized trials of treatment of male sexual partners for improved bacteria vaginosis outcomes in women | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 822–30 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23007709 | doi = 10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3182631d89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10818662&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Potter J | title = Should sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis receive treatment? | journal = Br J Gen Pract | volume = 49 | issue = 448 | pages = 913–8 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10818662 | pmc = 1313567 | url = http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/nlm?genre=article&amp;issn=0960-1643&amp;volume=49&amp;issue=448&amp;spage=913&amp;aulast=Potter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probiotics===
A 2009 Cochrane review found tentative but insufficient evidence for probiotics as a treatment for BV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senok|first1=AC|last2=Verstraelen|first2=H|last3=Temmerman|first3=M|last4=Botta|first4=GA|title=Probiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=7 October 2009|issue=4|pages=CD006289|pmid=19821358|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006289.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huang|first1=H|last2=Song|first2=L|last3=Zhao|first3=W|title=Effects of probiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in adult women: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials|journal=Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics|date=June 2014|volume=289|issue=6|pages=1225–34|pmid=24318276|doi=10.1007/s00404-013-3117-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 review found some evidence supporting the use of probiotics during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=VandeVusse|first1=L|last2=Hanson|first2=L|last3=Safdar|first3=N|title=Perinatal outcomes of prenatal probiotic and prebiotic administration: an integrative review|journal=The Journal of Perinatal &amp; Neonatal Nursing|date=2013|volume=27|issue=4|pages=288–301; quiz E1–2|pmid=24164813|doi=10.1097/jpn.0b013e3182a1e15d}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred probiotics for BV are those containing high doses of lactobacilli (around 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; {{abbrlink|CFUs|Colony-forming units}}) given [[vaginal administration|in the vagina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23912864&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mastromarino P, Vitali B, Mosca L | title = Bacterial vaginosis: a review on clinical trials with probiotics | journal = New Microbiol. | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–38 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23912864 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intravaginal administration is preferred to [[oral administration|taking them by mouth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23912864&quot; /&gt; Prolonged repetitive courses of treatment appear to be more promising than short courses.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23912864&quot; /&gt;
