'''Battery Park City''' is a mainly residential {{convert|92|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[planned community]] on the west side of the southern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. It is bounded by the [[Hudson River]] on the west, the Hudson River shoreline on the north and south, and the [[West Side Highway]] on the east. The neighborhood is named for [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]], located directly to the south.

More than one-third of the development is parkland.&lt;ref name=amny&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amny.com/real-estate/city-living/manhattan/city-living-battery-park-city-1.6844548 | title=City Living: Battery Park City | work=amNY | date=January 21, 2014 | accessdate=December 2, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227164344/http://www.amny.com/real-estate/city-living/manhattan/city-living-battery-park-city-1.6844548 | archive-date=December 27, 2014 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The land upon which it is built was created by [[land reclamation]] on the Hudson River using over {{convert|3|e6cuyd|e6m3}} of soil and rock excavated during the construction of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]], the [[New York City Water Tunnel]], and certain other construction projects, as well as from sand dredged from [[New York Harbor]] off [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Arthur.

The area was expanded by 1.2 million cubic yards of earth and rock excavated for the foundations of the World Trade Center nearby.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood includes [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|Brookfield Place]] (formerly the World Financial Center), along with numerous buildings designed for housing, commercial, and retail.

Battery Park City is part of [[Manhattan Community Board 1|Manhattan Community District 1]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYCPlanning&quot;/&gt; It is patrolled by the 1st Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Battery Park City 007.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Greenery at South Cove]]

Battery Park City is bounded on the east by [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]], which separates the area from the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Lower Manhattan]]. To the west, north, and south, the area is surrounded by the [[Hudson River]].

The development consists of roughly five major sections. Traveling north to south, the first neighborhood has high-rise residential buildings, the [[Stuyvesant High School]], a [[Regal Entertainment Group]] movie theater, and the [[#Library|Battery Park City branch]] of the [[New York Public Library]]. It is also the site of the 463-suite Conrad New York luxury hotel, which contains restaurants and bars such as the Loopy Doopy Rooftop Bar, ATRIO Wine Bar Restaurant, Mexican-themed El Vez, and three [[Danny Meyer]]-branded restaurants (North End Grill, Blue Smoke, [[Shake Shack]]); the hotel has a ballroom and a conference center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-neighborhood-2010-8 There Goes The Neighborhood: Goldman Sachs Accused Of Gentrifying Block Around Its HQ]. Joe Weisenthal in Business Insider February 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Other restaurants located in that hotel, as well as a [[DSW, Inc.|DSW]] store and a [[New York Sports Club]] branch, were closed in 2009 after the takeover of the property by [[Goldman Sachs]]. Former undeveloped lots in the area have been developed into high-rise buildings; for example, [[Goldman Sachs]] built a new headquarters at [[200 West Street]].

Nearby is [[#Brookfield Place|Brookfield Place]], a complex of several commercial buildings formerly known as the World Financial Center.

Current residential neighborhoods of Battery Park City are divided into northern and southern sections, separated by Brookfield Place. The northern section consists entirely of large, 20–45-story buildings, all various shades of orange brick. The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, which is located in Brookfield Place, contains residential apartment buildings such as Gateway Plaza and the Rector Place apartment buildings. In this section lies the majority of Battery Park City's residential areas, in three sections: Gateway Plaza, a high-rise building complex; the &quot;Rector Place Residential Neighborhood&quot;; and the&quot; Battery Place Residential Neighborhood&quot;. These subsections contain most of the area's residential buildings, along with [[park]] space, [[supermarket]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[movie theater]]s. Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s, and completion of the final lots took place in early 2011. Additionally, a park restoration was completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cultivatingculture.com/2013/04/10/battery-park-city-authority-completes-field-restoration/&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century and early 20th century, the area adjoining today's Battery Park City was known as [[#Cultural heritage|Little Syria]] with Lebanese, Greeks, Armenians, and other ethnic groups. In 1929, the land was the proposed site of a $50,000,000 residential development that would have served workers in the Wall Street area.&lt;ref name=unit&gt;{{cite web | title=Housing Unit Named Battery Tower. | website=The New York Times | date=May 25, 1929 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/05/25/archives/housing-unit-named-battery-tower.html | accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battery Tower (Manhattan)|Battery Tower]] project was left unfinished after workers digging the foundation ran into forty feet of old [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkheads]], sunken docks, and ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=EXCAVATIONS BEGUN.; Steel Sheeting Is Being Used for Battery Tower Work. | website=The New York Times | date=December 8, 1929 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/12/08/archives/excavations-begun-steel-sheeting-is-being-used-for-battery-tower.html | accessdate=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted and never restarted.

By the late 1950s, the once-prosperous port area of downtown Manhattan was occupied by a number of dilapidated shipping piers, casualties of the rise of [[container shipping]] which drove sea traffic to [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal|Port Elizabeth, New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The initial proposal to reclaim this area through [[Land reclamation|landfill]] was offered in the early 1960s by private firms and supported by the mayor. That plan became complicated when Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in 1966 the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], the proposal called for a 'comprehensive community' consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry. The landscaping of the park space and later the Winter Garden was designed by [[M. Paul Friedberg]].

In 1968, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the [[Battery Park City Authority]] (BPCA) to oversee development. Rockefeller named [[Charles J. Urstadt]] as the first chairman of the authority’s board that year. He then served as the chief executive officer from 1973 to 1978. Urstadt later served as the authority’s vice chair from 1996 to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.downtownexpress.com/2012/06/06/battery-park-city-creators-reminisce-about/|title=Battery Park City creators reminisce about neighborhood’s past|last=Kreuzer|first=Terese Loeb|date=June 6, 2012|work=Downtown Express|access-date=October 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019001543/http://www.downtownexpress.com/2012/06/06/battery-park-city-creators-reminisce-about/|archive-date=October 19, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Development Corporation|New York State Urban Development Corporation]] and ten other public agencies were also involved in the development project.&lt;ref name=&quot;enr-1983&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Megajob takes foothold in fill, New York City's $1-billion river development survives snags |publisher=Engineering News-Record |date=April 14, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next several years, the BPCA made slow progress.

Urstadt said the changes were needed to make the financing for the project viable. In addition to the change in the mix of units, the city approved adding nine acres, which extended the northern boundary from Reade Street to Duane Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/13/archives/planners-cut-lowincome-units-in-battery-park-city-proposal.html|title=Planners Cut Low‐Income Units In Battery Park City Proposal|last=Seigel|first=Max H.|date=July 13, 1972|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landfill material from [[Building of the World Trade Center|construction]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and other buildings in Lower Manhattan was used to add fill for the southern portion.

The design of BPC to some degree reflects the values of vibrant city neighborhoods championed by [[Jane Jacobs]]. The [[Urban Land Institute]] (ULI) awarded the Battery Park City Master Plan its 2010 Heritage Award, for having &quot;facilitated the private development of 9.3 million square feet of commercial space, 7.2 million square feet of residential space, and nearly 36 acres of open space in lower Manhattan, becoming a model for successful large-scale planning efforts and marking a positive shift away from the urban renewal mindset of the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uli.org/News/MediaCenter/PressReleases/2010%20archives/Content/AwardsforExcellenceAmericas2010Winners.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and early development ===
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the site hosted Creative Time's landmark Art on the Beach sculpture exhibitions. On September 23, 1979, the landfill was the site of an [[List of anti-nuclear protests in the United States|anti-nuclear rally]] attended by 200,000 people.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first=Robin |last=Herman |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Nearly 200,000 Rally to Protest Nuclear Energy |url= |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=B1 |date=September 24, 1979 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During early construction, two acres of land in the southern section of the Battery Park landfill was used by artist [[Agnes Denes]] to plant wheat in an exhibition titled ''Wheatfield - A Confrontation''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agnes Denes|Denes, Agnes]] (c.2006) [http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Images/Ecology/wheatfield.php &quot;Wheatfield - A Confrontation, Battery Park Landfill, downtown Manhattan, 2 acres of wheat planted &amp; harvested, summer 1982&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131032203/http://www.greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Images/Ecology/wheatfield.php |date=January 31, 2016 }} greenmuseum.org&lt;/ref&gt; The project was a visual contradiction: a golden field of wheat set among the steel skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Krug, Don.

Denes stated that her &quot;decision to plant a wheatfield in Manhattan, instead of designing just another public sculpture, grew out of a long-standing concern and need to call attention to our misplaced priorities and deteriorating human values.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, B.

Throughout the 1980s, the BPCA oversaw a great deal of construction, including the entire [[Rector Place]] neighborhood and the river esplanade. It was during that period that [[Amanda Burden]], later City Planning Department Director in the Bloomberg administration, worked on Battery Park City. During the 1980s, a total of 13 buildings were constructed. The [[Vietnam Veterans Plaza]] was established by [[Edward I. Koch]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vietnam Veterans Plaza&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/vietnamveteransplaza/history|title=Vietnam Veterans Plaza|publisher=New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, Battery Park City became the new home of the [[Stuyvesant High School]]. During the 1990s, an additional six buildings were added to the neighborhood. By the turn of the 21st century, Battery Park City was mostly completed, with the exception of some ongoing construction on West Street.

Initially, in the 1980s, 23 buildings were built in the area. By the 1990s, 9 more buildings were built, followed by the construction of 11 buildings in the 2000s and 3 buildings in the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ne?id=100010 Emporis NYC Districts and Zones: Battery Park City&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501110221/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ne?id=100010 |date=May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Battery Park City Authority, wishing to attract more middle-class residents, started providing subsidies in 1998 to households whose annual incomes were $108,000 or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/nyregion/battery-park-city-to-give-middle-income-renters-a-break.html|title=Battery Park City to Give Middle-Income Renters a Break|last=Pristin|first=Terry|date=March 24, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, nearly the entire landfill had been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/07/realestate/filling-in-the-blanks-at-battery-park-city.html|title=Filling in the Blanks At Battery Park City|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|date=February 7, 1999|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 23, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early 21st century ===

The [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 had a major impact on Battery Park City. The residents of Lower Manhattan and particularly of Battery Park City were displaced for an extended period of time. Parts of the community were an official crime-scene and therefore residents were unable to return to live or even collect property. Many of the displaced residents were not allowed to return to the area for months and none were given government guidance of where to live temporarily on the already crowded island of Manhattan. With most hotel rooms booked, residents, including young children and the elderly were forced to fend for themselves.{{reference needed|date=January 2019}}

When they were finally allowed to return to Battery Park City, some found that their homes had been looted.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Jane.

Gateway Plaza's 600 building, Hudson View East, and Parc Place (now Rector Square) were punctured by airplane parts. The Winter Garden and other portions of the World Financial Center were severely damaged. Environmental concerns regarding dust from the Trade Center are a continuing source of concern for many residents, scientists, and elected officials. Since the attacks, the damage has been repaired. Temporarily reduced rents and government subsidies helped restore residential occupancy in the years following the attacks.

After September 11, 2001, residents of Battery Park City and [[Tribeca]] formed [[the TriBattery Pops Tom Goodkind Conductor]] in response to the events of the attacks. The “Pops” have been [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated and are the first lower Manhattan all-volunteer community band in a century.

Since then, real estate development in the area has continued robustly. Commercial development includes the {{convert|2100000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[200 West Street]], the [[Goldman Sachs]] global headquarters, which began construction in 2005 and opened for occupancy in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyork.construction.com/projects/TopPrj_05-06/TPstrt1-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 200 West Street is seeking gold-level certification under the [[United States Green Building Council]]’s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program by incorporating various water and energy conservation features.

Battery Park City is owned and managed by the '''Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority''' (BPCA), a Class A [[New York state public-benefit corporations|New York State public-benefit corporation]] created by New York State in 1968 to redevelop outmoded and deteriorated piers, a project that has involved [[land reclamation|reclaiming the land]], replanning the area and facilitating new construction of a mixed commercial and residential community.&lt;ref&gt;Battery Park City Authority Act, [[Laws of New York|L. 1968 ch. 343-44]], L. 1969 ch. 624, L. 1971 ch. 377; codified at [[Consolidated Laws of New York|Public Authorities Law]] § 1970 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It has operated under the authority of the [[Empire State Development Corporation|Urban Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=6 Builders Chosen for Housing at Battery Park City |first=Paul |last=Goldberger |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07EED7153BF93AA2575BC0A967948260 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 19, 1981 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is &quot;to plan, create, co-ordinate and maintain a balanced community of [[commerce|commercial]], [[residential]], [[retail]], and [[park]] space within its designated 92-acre site on the [[Lower West Side, Manhattan|lower west side]] of [[Manhattan]]&quot; in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120721062638/http://www.batteryparkcity.org/page/page11.html Battery Park City Authority Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt; The authority's board is composed of seven uncompensated members who are appointed by the [[governor]] and who serve six-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Consolidated Laws of New York|Public Authorities Law]] § 1973&lt;/ref&gt; B.J.

Under the 1989 agreement between the BPCA and the City of New York, $600 million was transferred by the BPCA to the city. Charles J. Urstadt, the first Chairman and CEO of the BPCA, noted in an August 19, 2007 op-ed piece in the ''[[New York Post]]'' that the aggregate figure of funds transferred to the City of New York is above $1.4 billion, with the BPCA continuing to contribute $200 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Urstadt|first=Charles J.|url=https://nypost.com/2007/08/19/battery-park-city-green-cash-cow/|title=Battery Park City: Green Cash Cow|date=2007-08-19|work=New York Post|access-date=2020-02-20|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Independent Budget Office of the City of New York also recommended the city take over Battery Park City in a report published in February 2020.

Excess revenue from the area was to be contributed to other housing efforts, typically low-income projects in [[the Bronx]] and [[Harlem]]. Much of this funding has historically been diverted to general city expenses, under section 3.d of the 1989 agreement. However, in July 2006, Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], Governor [[George Pataki]], and Comptroller [[William C. Thompson, Jr.]] announced the final approval for the New York City Housing Trust Fund derived from $130 million in Battery Park City revenues. The fund aimed to preserve or create 4,300 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Janny (August 1, 2006). &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/nyregion/01mbrfs-004.html?fta=y Manhattan: Housing Plan Approved.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; It also provided seed financing for the New York Acquisition Fund, a $230 million initiative that aims to serve as a catalyst for the construction and preservation of more than 30,000 units of affordable housing citywide by 2016. The Acquisition Fund has since established itself as a model for similar funds in cities and states across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/downloads/pdf/New-Housing-Market-Place-Plan.pdf |title=Mayor Bloomberg’s affordable housing plan |publisher=[[New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development]] |date=August 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016141440/http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/downloads/pdf/New-Housing-Market-Place-Plan.pdf |archivedate=October 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2018, thirty residential buildings had been built in Battery Park City and no new construction was planned. The Battery Park City Authority’s main focus turned to maintenance of existing infrastructure, security and conservancy of the public spaces. The authority was creating over 1,000 free activities per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/realestate/battery-park-city-a-resort-like-community-built-on-landfill.html|title=Battery Park City: A Resort-Like Community Built on Landfill|last=Jacobson|first=Aileen|date=August 15, 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=October 11, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condo owners in Battery Park City pay higher monthly charges than owners of comparable apartments elsewhere in New York City because residents pay their building's common charges in addition to PILOT (payments in lieu of taxes). The PILOT payments replace real estate taxes and the land lease. As a result, residential units have higher monthly costs compared to other neighborhoods. The cumulative effect is lower property values for homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090419/FREE/304199992/battery-park-city-condo-owners-fight-spikes-in-fees|title=Battery Park City condo owners fight spikes in fees|last=Fung|first=Amanda|date=April 29, 2009|work=Crain's New York Business|access-date=November 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Because none of the properties in Battery Park City own the land they are built on, many banks have refused to write loans when those ground leases are periodically up for renewal.  This has been a regular source of anger and frustration for owners in Battery Park City who are looking to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703864204576315584254886002|title=Battery Park City condo owners fight spikes in fees|last=De Avila|first=Joseph|date=May 11, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=February 11, 2019|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural heritage ===

A largely [[Arab-American]] neighborhood existed adjacent to what is today southeastern Battery Park City from the late 1880s&lt;ref name=wpa&gt;{{cite fednyc}}, pp. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1940s. &quot;[[Little Syria, Manhattan|Little Syria]]&quot; encompassed [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]] from Battery Park to Rector Street.&lt;ref name=wpa /&gt; It declined as a neighborhood as the inhabitants became successful and moved to other areas, especially [[Atlantic Avenue (Brooklyn)|Atlantic Avenue]] in [[Brooklyn]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Jane and Botti, David.

However, many other ethnic groups had lived in this diverse neighborhood, including Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Slovaks, Poles, Hungarians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Czechs, and Irish.

A long-standing reminder of the ethnic past was the former [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]], which was destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]]. An additional historic church, [[St. George's Syrian Catholic Church]], still stands at 103 Washington Street.

The developer received funding from the [[New York (state)|State of New York]], which was somewhat controversial as the developer was only required to agree to set aside 10% of the units as &quot;affordable housing&quot; or &quot;moderate income&quot;, rather than the usual 80:20 agreement. When the building opened, rents ranged from roughly $2,500 to $9,001 depending on the size of the unit. The building has been rated [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum. The energy conserving building design is 35% more energy-efficient than code requires, resulting in a 67% lower electricity demand during peak hours, resulting in, among other benefits,  lower electric bills for residents. Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight to electricity, supplemented by a computerized building management system and environmentally responsible operating and maintenance practices to further reduce the building's environmental impact.

Battery Park City, which is mainly residential, also has a few office buildings. The seven buildings in the Brookfield Place complex, as well as 200 West Street, are the neighborhood's only office buildings.

==== {{anchor|Brookfield Place}} Brookfield Place complex ====
{{main|Brookfield Place (New York City)}}
Located in the middle of Battery Park City and overlooking the [[Hudson River]], Brookfield Place, designed by [[César Pelli]] and owned mostly by [[Toronto]]-based [[Brookfield Office Properties]], has been home to offices of various major companies, including [[Merrill Lynch]], [[RBC Capital Markets]], [[Nomura Group]], [[American Express]] and [[Brookfield Asset Management]], among others. Brookfield Place also serves as the United States headquarters for [[Brookfield Office Properties]], which has its headquarters located in [[200 Vesey Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.com/arts__attractions/world_financial_center_and_winter_garden.1466/editorial_review.aspx |title=World Financial Center and Winter Garden New York City.com : Arts &amp; Attractions : Editorial Review |publisher=Nyc.com |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfinancialcenter.com/retail-dining/about |title=about |publisher=Worldfinancialcenter.com |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brookfield Place also has its own [[zip code]], 10281.

Brookfield Place's ground floor and portions of the second floor are occupied by a mall; its center point is a steel-and-glass atrium known as the [[Winter Garden Atrium|Winter Garden]]. Outside of the Winter Garden lies a sizeable [[yacht]] harbor on the Hudson known as North Cove.

The building's original developer was [[Olympia and York]] of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. It used to be named the World Financial Center, but in 2014, the complex was given its current name following the completion of extensive renovations. The World Financial Center complex was built by [[Olympia and York]] between 1982 and 1988; it was damaged in the September 11 attacks but later repaired. It has six constituent buildings – [[200 Liberty Street]], [[225 Liberty Street]], [[200 Vesey Street]], [[250 Vesey Street]], the Winter Garden Atrium, and One North End Avenue (a.k.a. the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] building).
