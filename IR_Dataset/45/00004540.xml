The '''Balts''' or '''Baltic people''' ({{lang-lt|baltai}}, {{lang-lv|balti}}) are a group of [[Indo-European peoples]] primarily characterized as speakers of the [[Baltic languages]].

One of the features of Baltic languages is the number of conservative or archaic features retained.&lt;ref&gt;Bojtár page 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Baltic peoples are modern [[Lithuanians]] and [[Latvians]] (including [[Latgalians (modern)|Latgalians]]) — all Eastern Balts — as well as the [[Old Prussians]], [[Yotvingians]] and [[Galindians]] — the Western Balts — whose languages and cultures are now extinct.

==Etymology==
Medieval German chronicler [[Adam of Bremen]] in the latter part of the 11th century AD was the first writer to use the term Baltic in its modern sense to mean the sea of that name.&lt;ref name=Bot_9&gt;Bojtár page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam of Bremen reports that he followed the local use of balticus from baelt (&quot;belt&quot;) because the sea stretches to the east &quot;in modum baltei&quot; (&quot;in the manner of a belt&quot;). This is the first reference to &quot;the Baltic or Barbarian Sea, a day's journey from [[Hamburg]]. Bojtár cites ''Bremensis'' I,60 and IV,10.&lt;/ref&gt; Before him were various ancient places names, such as Balcia,&lt;ref&gt;Balcia, Abalcia, Abalus, Basilia, Balisia. However, apart from poor transcription, there is known linguistic rule whereby these words, including Balcia, might become “Baltia.”&lt;/ref&gt; meaning a supposed island in the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name=Bot_9/&gt;

It should not be surprising that Adam, a speaker of German, might connect ''Balt-'' with &quot;Belt&quot;, a word he was familiar with. However, linguistics has since established that Balt means ''white''. Many Baltic words contain the stem balt-, &quot;white&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-lv|balti}}; {{lang-lt|baltai}}; [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]: ''bolti'', lit. ''&quot;white&quot;''.&lt;/ref&gt; which may also refer to shallow bodies of water including marshes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

In Germanic languages there was some form of &quot;East Sea&quot; until after about 1600, when maps in English labeled it the &quot;Baltic Sea&quot;. By 1840, the German nobles of the [[Governorate of Livonia]] adopted the term &quot;Balts&quot; to distinguish themselves from Germans of Germany. They spoke an exclusive dialect, Baltic German. For many, that was the “Baltic language” until 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Bojtár page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Eastern Europe|url=https://archive.org/details/neweasterneurop00unkngoog|first=Ralph|last=Butler|year=1919|pages=3, 21, 22, 23, 24|publisher=Longmans, Green and Co.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, [[Georg Heinrich Ferdinand Nesselmann]] proposed a distinct [[language group]] for [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Old Prussian]]—Baltic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=William R. |last=Schmalstieg |title=A.

Up until the early 20th century, either “Latvian” or “Lithuanian” could be used to mean the entire language family.&lt;ref&gt;Bojtár page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Baltic river names.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Map of the area of distribution of [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] [[hydronyms]]. This area is considered the [[urheimat]] of the Balts.]]
===Origins===
The Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the [[Baltic languages]], a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower [[Vistula]] and southeast shore of the [[Baltic Sea]] and upper [[Daugava]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers. Because the thousands of lakes and swamps in this area contributed to the Balts' geographical isolation, the Baltic languages retain a number of conservative or archaic features.

Some of the major authorities on Balts, such as [[Kazimieras Būga]], [[Max Vasmer]], [[Vladimir Toporov]] and [[Oleg Trubachyov]],{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. This information is summarized and synthesized by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in ''The Balts'' (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the [[Pomerania]]n coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], [[Kiev]], and [[Kursk]], northward through [[Moscow]] to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the [[Gulf of Riga]], north of [[Riga]].

The area of Baltic habitation shrank due to assimilation by other groups, and invasions. According to one of the theories which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, the [[Galindians]], [[Galindae]], or Goliad, migrated to the area around modern day Moscow, Russia around the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/37147068/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%85_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2._%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B_%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82_3-4_2017._%D0%A1._95-124 Tarasov I. The balts in the Migration Period. P. I. Galindians, pp. 96, 100-112.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the Balts became differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts. In the 5th century AD parts of the eastern Baltic coast began to be settled by the ancestors of the Western Balts: [[Old Prussians|Brus/Prūsa]] (&quot;Old Prussians&quot;), [[Sudovians]]/[[Jotvingians]], [[Scalvians]], [[Nadruvians]], and [[Curonians]]. The Eastern Balts, including the hypothesised [[Dniepr Balts]], were living in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.

[[Germanic peoples]] lived to the west of the Baltic homelands; by the first century AD, the [[Goths]] had stabilized their kingdom from the mouth of the Vistula, south to [[Dacia]]. As Roman domination collapsed in the first half of the first millennium CE in Northern and Eastern Europe, large migrations of the Balts occurred — first, the [[Galindae]] or [[Galindians]] towards the east, and later, Eastern Balts towards the west. In the seventh century, Slavic tribes from the Volga regions appeared. By the 13th and 14th centuries, they reached the general area that the present-day Balts and Belarusians inhabit. Many other Eastern and Southern Balts either assimilated with other Balts, or Slavs in the 4th–7th centuries and were gradually slavicized.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Middle Ages===
In the 12th and the 13th centuries, internal struggles, as well as invasions by [[Ruthenians]] and [[Poles]] and later the expansion of the [[Teutonic Order]] resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Gradually Old Prussians became [[Germanization|Germanized]] or some Lithuanized during period from the 15th to the 17th centuries, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in [[Prussia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern countries of [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].

Old Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western [[Baltic language]]s, [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Galindian language|Galindian]] and [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]]. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern [[Baltic language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. Compare the Prussian word ''seme'' (''zemē''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Lie&quot;&gt;Mikkels Klussis. ''Bāziscas prûsiskai-laîtawiskas wirdeîns per tālaisin laksikis rekreaciônin [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081218125558/http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Lie.pdf Donelaitis.vdu.lt] (Lithuanian version of [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081218125908/http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/prussian/Engl.pdf Donelaitis.vdu.lt).]&lt;/ref&gt; the Latvian ''zeme'', the Lithuanian ''žemė'' (''land'' in English).

==Culture==
{{Baltic religion}}
{{See|Baltic mythology}}
The Balts originally practiced [[Baltic religion]]. They were gradually Christianized as a result of the [[Northern Crusades]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. Baltic peoples such as the [[Latvian mythology|Latvians]], [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanians]] and [[Old Prussians|Old Prussians]] had their distinct mythologies. The Lithuanians have close historic ties to [[Poland]], and many of them are therefore [[Roman Catholic]]. The [[Latvians]] have close historic ties of [[Northern Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], and many of them are therefore [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. [[Irreligion]] is widespread. In recent times, the Baltic religion has been revived in [[Baltic neopaganism]].

==Genetics==
{{See also|Kunda culture#Genetics|Narva culture#Genetics|Pit–Comb Ware culture#Genetics|Zvejnieki burial ground#Archaeogenetics}}
Recent genetic research show that the eastern Baltic in the [[Mesolithic]] was inhabited primarily by [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WHGs).{{sfn|Saag|2017}} Their paternal haplogroups were mostly types of [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a]] and [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], while their maternal haplogroups were mostly types of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]], [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U2|U2]].{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} These people carried a high frequency of the derived [[E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2|HERC2]] allele which codes for light [[eye color]], and increased frequency of the derived alleles for [[Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 5|SLC45A2]] and [[Membrane-associated transporter protein|SLC24A5]], which codes for [[light skin]].{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}}

During the [[Neolithic]], increasing admixture from [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s (EHGs) is detected. The paternal haplogroups of EHGs was mostly types of R1b and [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]], while their maternal haplogroups appears to have been almost exclusively types of U5, U4, and U2. Baltic hunter-gatherers still displayed a slightly larger amount of WHG ancestry than [[Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (SHGs). WHG ancestry in the Baltic was particularly high among hunter-gatherers in Latvia and Lithuania.{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}} Unlike other parts of Europe, the hunter-gatherers of the eastern Baltic do not appear to have mixed much with [[Early European Farmers]] (EEFs) arriving from [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Jones|2017}} 

[[File:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|275px|right|Baltic tribes before the coming of the [[Teutonic Order]] (ca. 1200 AD). The Eastern Balts are shown in brown hues while the Western Balts are shown in green. The boundaries are approximate. Baltic territory was extensive inland.]]

The rise of the [[Corded Ware culture]] in the eastern Baltic in the [[Chalcolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] is accompanied by a significant infusion of [[steppe ancestry]] and EEF ancestry into the eastern Baltic gene pool.{{sfn|Jones|2017}}{{sfn|Saag|2017}}{{sfn|Malmström|2019}} In the aftermath of the Corded Ware expansion, local hunter-gatherer ancestry experienced a resurgence.{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}} [[Haplogroup N-M231|Haplogroup N]] did not appear in the eastern Baltic until the late Bronze Age, perhaps as part of a westward migration of [[Uralic peoples]].{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}} 

Modern Balts have a lower amount of EEF ancestry, and a higher amount of WHG ancestry, than any other population in Europe.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2014}}{{Efn|&quot;Baltic populations carry the highest proportion of WHG ancestry of all Europeans, supporting the theory that the hunter-gatherer population of this region left a lasting genetic impact on subsequent populations.&quot;{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}} }}
