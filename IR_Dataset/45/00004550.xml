A '''bikini''' is typically&lt;!-- NOTE: The term &quot;typically&quot; is used because &quot;bikini&quot; can also refer to a man's swimsuit.--&gt; a women's two-piece [[swimsuit]] featuring two triangles of fabric on top, similar to a [[brassiere|bra]] and covering the woman's [[breast]]s, and two triangles of fabric on the bottom, the front covering the [[pelvis]] but exposing the navel, and the back covering the [[buttocks]].&lt;ref name=MMOA /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bikini&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Bikini|dictionary=[[Merriam-Webster]]|date=February 13, 2014|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bikini}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the top and bottom can vary from full coverage of the breasts, pelvis, and buttocks, to more revealing designs like a [[thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[G-string]] that cover only the [[areola]]e and [[mons pubis]], but expose the buttocks.

In May 1946, Parisian fashion designer [[Jacques Heim]] released a two-piece swimsuit design that he named the Atome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Thomas G. II |last=Cole |url=http://www.genders.org/g53/g53_cole.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901063358/http://www.genders.org/g53/g53_cole.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-09-01 |title=(The) Bikini: EmBodying the Bomb |publisher=Genders Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like swimsuits of the era, it covered the wearer's navel, and it failed to attract much attention. Clothing designer [[Louis Réard]] introduced his new, smaller design in July.&lt;ref name=femmes&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Bikini souffle ses 60 bougies !|url=http://www.journaldesfemmes.com/mode/0606-bikini/anniversaire.shtml|website=www.journaldesfemmes.com|accessdate=17 May 2018|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named the swimsuit after the [[Bikini Atoll]], where the first public test of a [[nuclear bomb]] had taken place only four days before. His skimpy design was risque, exposing the wearer's navel and much of her buttocks. No runway model would wear it, so he hired a [[Striptease|nude dancer]], Micheline Bernardini, from the [[Casino de Paris]] to model it at a review of swimsuit fashions.&lt;ref name=navy&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Crossroads: Fact Sheet|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq76-1.htm|publisher=Department of the Navy—Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=13 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024121304/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq76-1.htm|archivedate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its controversial and revealing design, the bikini was accepted very slowly by the public. The swimsuit gained increased exposure and acceptance as [[film star]]s like [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Raquel Welch]], and [[Ursula Andress]] wore them and were photographed on public beaches and seen in film. In many countries the design was banned from beaches and other public places.&lt;ref name=Alac&gt;{{cite book |last=Alac |first=Patrik |title=Bikini Story |year=2012|publisher=Parkstone International |isbn=978-1-78042-951-9|edition=first |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIj_GBl5sAoC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimalist bikini design became common in most Western countries by the mid-1960s as both [[swimwear]] and [[underwear]]. By the late 20th century it was widely used as [[Sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] in [[beach volleyball]] and [[bodybuilding]]. There are a number of modern [[Bikini variant|stylistic variations]] of the design used for marketing purposes and as industry classifications, including [[monokini]], [[microkini]], [[tankini]], [[trikini]], [[pubikini]], and [[skirtini]]. A man's single-piece [[Swim briefs|brief swimsuit]] may also be called a bikini.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bikini&quot;/&gt; Similarly, a variety of men's and women's underwear types are described as bikini underwear.

The bikini has gradually gained wide acceptance in [[Western world|Western society]]. By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811&amp;nbsp;million business annually, and boosted spin-off services such as [[bikini waxing]] and [[sun tanning]].&lt;ref name=AgeL&gt;Lorna Edwards, &quot;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/02/1148956539436.html?page=fullpage You've still got it, babe], ''[[The Age]]'', June 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist [[James Mellaart]] described the earliest bikini-like costume in [[Çatalhöyük]], [[Anatolia]] in the [[Chalcolithic]] era (around 5600&amp;nbsp;BC), where a mother goddess is depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini.&lt;ref name=Agrawala /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Goodison and Christine Morris, ''Ancient Goddesses: The Myths and the Evidence'', page 46, University of Wisconsin Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-299-16320-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-piece swimsuit can be traced back to the [[Greco-Roman world]], where bikini-like garments worn by women athletes are depicted on [[urns]] and paintings dating back to 1400&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter J. |last1=James |first2=I.

Swimming or bathing outdoors was discouraged in the [[Christian West]], so there was little demand or need for swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve [[chemise]]-type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty.&lt;ref name=claud&gt;Claudia B. Kidwell, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37586/37586-h/37586-h.htm Women's Bathing and Swimming Costume in the United States]'', Smithsonian Institution Press, City of Washington, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Australian swimmer and performer [[Annette Kellerman]] was arrested on a [[Boston]] beach for wearing form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England,&lt;ref name=claud /&gt; although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Conor, ''The spectacular modern woman: feminine visibility in the 1920s'', page 152, Indiana University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-253-34391-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, designer [[Carl Jantzen]] made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired by the introduction of females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml|accessdate=November 13, 2007|publisher=American Heritage Inc.|title=60 Years of Bikinis|author=Hoover, Elizabeth D.|date=July 5, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909195749/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml |archivedate=September 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from &quot;taking in the water&quot; to &quot;taking in the sun&quot;, at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. [[Rayon]] was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits,&lt;ref name=sydelle&gt;{{cite web|last=Sydelle|first=John|title=The Swimsuit Industry|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html |work=The Houston Chronicle |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kadolph&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Textiles|edition=9|author1=Kadolph, Sara J.  |author2=Langford, Anna L. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jersey (fabric)|Jersey]] and [[silk]] were also sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;R. Turner Wilcox, ''The Mode in Costume'', page 424, Courier Corporation, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-486-46820-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, manufacturers had lowered necklines in the back, removed sleeves, and tightened the sides. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly [[latex]] and [[nylon]], swimsuits gradually began hugging the body through the 1930s, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bronwyn Labrum]], Fiona McKergow and Stephanie Gibson, ''Looking Flash'', page 166, Auckland University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-86940-397-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of [[midriff exposure]]. The 1932 Hollywood film ''Three on a Match'' featured a midriff baring two piece bathing suit. Actress [[Dolores Del Rio]] was the first major star to wear a two-piece women's bathing suit onscreen in ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms6.html History of Sex in Cinema: The Greatest and Most Influential  Sexual Films and Scenes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public.&lt;ref name=&quot;girl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Claudia Mitchell |author2=Jacqueline Reid-Walsh |title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide Volume 1 of Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-33909-7|pages=434–435|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood endorsed the new glamor in films like 1949's ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' in which [[Esther Williams]] wore provocatively named costumes such as &quot;Double Entendre&quot; and &quot;Honey Child&quot;.&lt;ref name=notting&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Sandhu |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/728059/Nottingham-Bathed-in-nostalgia.html |title=Nottingham: Bathed in nostalgia |work=The Telegraph |date=August 4, 2003 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber.

In the summer of 1946, Western Europeans enjoyed their first war-free summer in many years.

In Europe, 17-year-old [[Brigitte Bardot]] wore scanty bikinis (by contemporary standards) in the French film ''Manina, la fille sans voiles'' (&quot;Manina, the girl unveiled&quot;).

By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini]]''. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1957 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Working with her husband and agent [[Roger Vadim]] she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Bikini|url=http://www.elle.com/fashion/g2906/the-history-of-the-bikini-654900/#slide-6|publisher=ELLE|date=April 23, 2012 | accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bikini finally caught on, and by 1963, the movie ''[[Beach Party]]'', starring [[Annette Funicello]] and [[Frankie Avalon]], led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol, though Funicello was barred from wearing Réard's bikini unlike the other young females in the films. In 1965, a woman told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' that it was &quot;almost square&quot; not to wear a bikini; the magazine wrote two years later that &quot;65% of the young set had already gone over&quot;.&lt;ref name=turner&gt;{{cite web|first=Julia |last=Turner |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/fashion/2013/07/history_of_the_bikini_how_it_came_to_america.html |title=A Brief History of the Bikini |work=Slate |date=July 29, 2013|accessdate= August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to mid-1970s, men's contest formats were often supplemented with women's beauty contests or bikini shows.

== Bikini underwear ==
{{See also|Underwear as outerwear}}

Certain types of [[underwear]] are described as bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the [[midriff]] than [[lingerie]], [[panties]] or knickers,&lt;ref&gt;Alison J. Carter, ''Underwear: The Fashion History'', page 111, Batsford, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7134-6222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially suited to clothing such as [[crop top]]s. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's classic [[briefs]]. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs.&lt;ref&gt;Shaun Cole, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EEEmuePeDX4C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=bikini+underwear#v=onepage&amp;q=bikini%20underwear The Story of Men's Underwear]'', pages 90-93, Parkstone International, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-78042-882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch but not at the waistband, with no fabric on the side of the legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Underwear |url=http://www.boxerbriefs.com/history_of_underwear.htm |publisher=Boxerbriefs.com |accessdate=August 15, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818070455/http://boxerbriefs.com/history_of_underwear.htm |archivedate=August 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimwear and underwear have similar design considerations, both being [[form-fitting garment]]s. The main difference is that, unlike underwear, swimwear is open to public view.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Craik, ''The Face of Fashion: Cultural Studies in Fashion'', page 133, Routledge, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-134-94056-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The swimsuit was, and is, following underwear styles,&lt;ref&gt;Christine Schmid, ''The Swimsuit: Fashion from Poolside to Catwalk'', page 6, A&amp;C Black, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-85785-124-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at about the same time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Parker, ''The Bathing Suit: Christian Liberty Or Secular Idolatry'', page 170, Xulon Press, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-59160-753-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the swimsuit was evolving, the underwear started to change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed the changes in underwear designs.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Barbier, Shazia Boucher, ''The Story of Lingerie'', page 139, Parkstone International, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-78042-970-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the &quot;breast girdle&quot;.&lt;ref name=napol&gt;Anthony Napoleon, ''Awakening Beauty&quot;, page 130, Virtualbookworm Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-58939-378-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for both women and men were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties for the rest of the century.&lt;ref name=ddhills&gt;Daniel Delis Hill, '' As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising'', page 158, Texas Tech University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-89672-616-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner standardized the concept of [[Cup size]] in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938.&lt;ref name=napol /&gt; Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband.&lt;ref name=ddhills /&gt; [[Howard Hughes]] designed a push-up bra to be worn by [[Jane Russell]] in ''[[The Outlaw]]'' in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the 'contraption'. In 1950 [[Maidenform]] introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.&lt;ref name=napol /&gt;

By the 1960s, the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants.&lt;ref name=ddhills /&gt; In the seventies, with the emergence of skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline and the rise of the leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Cole, '' Lingerie, the Foundation of a Woman's Life'', page 45, Choice Publications, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-9711803-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure.&lt;ref name=ddhills /&gt; From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as [[Calvin Klein]], particularly by photographers [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]] and [[Herb Ritts]].&lt;ref name=schmidt&gt;Christine Schmidt, ''The Swimsuit: Fashion from Poolside to Catwalk'', page 19, Bloomsbury Academic, 2012, {{ISBN|0-85785-123-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness.&lt;ref name=schmidt /&gt; Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech [[skin-tight garment]]s, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Schmid, ''The Swimsuit: Fashion from Poolside to Catwalk'', page 102, A&amp;C Black, 2013, {{ISBN|978-0-85785-124-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Men's bikini ==
[[File:Albert Cordina 1 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|left|Men's bikini]]

The term ''men's bikini'' is sometimes used to describe [[swim briefs]]. Men's bikinis can have high or low side panels, and string sides or tie sides. Most lack a button or flap front. Unlike swim briefs, bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband. Suits less than 1.5 inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and [[sun tanning]]. The posing brief standard to [[bodybuilding]] competitions is an example of this style. Male [[punk rock]] musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs.&lt;ref&gt;A. W.

Bikini waxing is the [[hair removal|epilation]] of [[pubic hair]] beyond the bikini line by use of [[waxing]]. The bikini line delineates the part of a woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit.&lt;ref name=Embod1&gt;Heinz Tschachler, Maureen Devine, Michael Draxlbauer; ''The EmBodyment of American Culture''; pp 61–62; LIT Verlag, Berlin-Hamburg-Münster; 2003; {{ISBN|3-8258-6762-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]], and often removed.&lt;ref name=Embod1/&gt;

As popularity of bikinis grew, the acceptability of pubic hair diminished.&lt;ref name=Han&gt;David L. Hanlon, Geoffrey Miles White, ''Voyaging Through the Contemporary Pacific'', page 99, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2000, {{ISBN|0742500454}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, with certain styles of women's swimwear, pubic hair may become visible around the [[crotch]] area of a [[swimsuit]].&lt;ref name=Embod1/&gt; With the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the advent of the bikini after 1945, the practice of bikini waxing has also become popular.&lt;ref name=Embod1/&gt; The Brazilian style which became popular with the rise of thong bottoms.&lt;ref name=heinz/&gt;

The [[tan line]]s created by the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan. A 1969 innovation of tan-through swimwear uses fabric which is perforated with thousands of micro holes that are nearly invisible to the naked eye, but which let enough sunlight through to produce a line-free tan.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Tan-Through Fabric Lets Sun Shine In |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/10/17/archives/tanthrough-fabric-lets-sun-shine-in.html |last=Taylor |first=Angela |date=October 17, 1969 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082764/3/ |title=Scorecard: No nudes is good news |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=September 1, 1969 |accessdate=April 15, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012014005/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082764/3/ |archivedate=October 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
