A '''banshee''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|æ|n|ʃ|iː}} {{respell|BAN|shee}}; [[Irish language|Modern Irish]] {{lang|ga|bean sí}}, {{lang|ga|baintsí}}, from {{lang-sga|ben síde, baintsíde}}, {{IPA-sga|bʲen ˈʃiːðʲe, banˈtiːðe|pron}}, &quot;woman of the [[Tumulus#Ireland|fairy mound]]&quot; or &quot;fairy woman&quot;) is a female [[spirit]] in [[Irish mythology]] who heralds the death of a family member, usually by wailing, shrieking, or [[keening]]. Her name is connected to the mythologically important [[tumulus|tumuli]] or &quot;mounds&quot; that dot the [[Ireland|Irish]] countryside, which are known as [[síd]]e (singular ''síd'') in Old Irish.&lt;ref name=DIL&gt;[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]]: ''[http://www.dil.ie/37441 síd, síth]'' - &quot;a fairy hill or mound&quot; and ''[http://www.dil.ie/5644 ben]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Sometimes she has long streaming hair and wears a grey [[cloak]] over a green dress, and her eyes are red from continual weeping.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. pp. 14–16. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She may be dressed in white with red hair and a ghastly complexion, according to a firsthand account by [[Ann, Lady Fanshawe]] in her ''Memoirs''.&lt;ref&gt;Fanshawe, Herbert Charles (1907). ''The Memoirs of Ann, Lady Fanshawe''. London: John Lane. p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lady Wilde]] in ''Ancient Legends of Ireland'' provides another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The size of the banshee is another physical feature that differs between regional accounts. Though some accounts of her standing unnaturally tall are recorded, the majority of tales that describe her height state the banshee's stature as short, anywhere between one foot and four feet. Her exceptional shortness often goes alongside the description of her as an old woman, though it may also be intended to emphasize her state as a fairy creature.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, Kathleen. &quot;The Death Knock.&quot; ''New England Review'', vol. 34, no. 1, 2013, p. 135+. ''Literature Resource Center''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Sometimes the banshee assumes the form of some sweet singing virgin of the family who died young, and has been given the mission by the invisible powers to become the harbinger of coming doom to her mortal kindred. Or she may be seen at night as a shrouded woman, crouched beneath the trees, lamenting with veiled face, or flying past in the moonlight, crying bitterly. The cry of this spirit is mournful beyond all other sounds on earth, and betokens certain death to some member of the family whenever it is heard in the silence of the night.&lt;ref&gt;Wilde, Jane (1887). ''Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland'' (Vol. 1). Boston: Ticknor and Co. pp. 259–60.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==Keening==
In Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the [[keening]] woman (''bean chaointe''), who wails a lament - in {{lang-ga|Caoineadh}}, {{IPA-ga|'kɰiːnʲi}} (Munster dialect), {{IPA-ga|ˈkɰiːnʲə|}} (Connaught dialect) or {{IPA-ga|ˈkiːnʲuː|}} (Ulster dialect), ''caoin'' meaning &quot;to weep, to wail&quot;. This keening woman may in some cases be a professional, and the best keeners would be in high demand.

Irish legend speaks of a lament being sung by a fairy woman, or banshee. She would sing it when a family member died or was about to die, even if the person had died far away and news of their death had not yet come. In those cases, her wailing would be the first warning the household had of the death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Celtic culture : a historical encyclopedia|last=T.|first=Koch, John|date=2006-01-01|publisher=ABC CLIO|isbn=9781851094400|location=|pages=189|oclc=644410117|quote=[Its occurrence] is most strongly associated with the old family or ancestral home and land, even when a family member dies abroad. The cry, linked predominantly to impending death, is said to be experienced by family members, and especially by the local community, rather than the dying person. Death is considered inevitable once the cry is acknowledged.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of death and the human experience|last=Lysaght|first=Patricia|last2=Bryant|first2=Clifton D.|last3=Peck|first3=Dennis L.|publisher=SAGE|year=|isbn=9781412951784|location=|pages=97|oclc=755062222|quote=Most manifestations of the banshee are said to occur in Ireland, usually near the home of the dying person... but some accounts refer to the announcement in Ireland of the deaths of Irish people overseas... It is those concerned with a death, at family and community levels, who usually hear the banshee, rather than the dying person.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banshee also is a predictor of death. If someone is about to enter a situation where it is unlikely they will come out alive she will warn people by screaming or wailing, giving rise to a banshee also being known as a wailing woman.

It is often stated that the banshee laments only the descendants of the pure [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesian]] stock of Ireland,&lt;ref name=&quot;DemonologySirWalterScott&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DyISAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=sir+walter+scott+letters+on+demonology+banshee|title=Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft|last=Scott|first=Walter|date=1836-01-01|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|language=en|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes clarified as surnames prefixed with O' and Mac,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8LvkDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=banshee+names+irish|title=Packy Jim: Folklore and Worldview on the Irish Border|last=Cashman|first=Ray|date=2016-08-30|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=9780299308902|language=en|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some accounts even state that each family has its own banshee. One account, however, also included the [[FitzGerald dynasty|Geraldines]], as they had apparently become &quot;[[more Irish than the Irish themselves]],&quot; countering the lore ascribing banshees exclusively to those of Milesian stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Sullivan|first=Friar|year=1899|title=Ancient History of the Kingdom of Kerry|url=http://www.corkhist.ie/wp-content/uploads/jfiles/1899/b1899-036.pdf|journal=Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society|volume=5|issue=44|pages=224–234|via=JCHAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When several banshees appear at once, it indicates the death of someone great or holy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeats&quot;&gt;Yeats, W. B. &quot;Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry&quot; in Booss, Claire; Yeats, W.B.; Gregory, Lady (1986) ''A Treasury of Irish Myth, Legend, and Folklore''. New York: Gramercy Books. p. 108. {{ISBN|978-0-517-48904-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tales sometimes recounted that the woman, though called a fairy, was a ghost, often of a specific murdered woman, or a mother who died in childbirth.&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;

==Origin==
Most, though not all, surnames associated with banshees have the ''Ó'' or ''Mc/Mac'' prefix - that is, surnames of Goidelic origin, indicating a family native to the Insular Celtic lands rather than those of the Norse, English, or Norman. Accounts reach as far back as 1380 to the publication of the ''[[Cathreim Thoirdhealbhaigh]]'' (''Triumphs of Torlough'') by Sean mac Craith.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot; /&gt; Mentions of banshees can also be found in [[Normans|Norman]] literature of that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot; /&gt;

The Ua Briain banshee is thought to be named [[Aibell]] and the ruler of 25 other banshees who would always be at her attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westropp |first=Thos. J. |title=A Folklore Survey of County Clare |journal=Folklore |volume= 21|issue= 2|pages=180–199 |date=June 1910  |jstor=1254686|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1910.9719928 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/2311341/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that this particular story is the source of the idea that the wailing of numerous banshees signifies the death of a great person.&lt;ref name=&quot;lore&quot; /&gt;

In some parts of [[Leinster]], she is referred to as the ''bean chaointe'' (keening woman) whose wail can be so piercing that it shatters glass. In Scottish folklore, a similar creature is known as the [[bean nighe]] or ''ban nigheachain'' (little washerwoman) or ''nigheag na h-àth'' (little washer at the ford) and is seen washing the bloodstained clothes or armour of those who are about to die. In Welsh folklore, a similar creature is known as the [[cyhyraeth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Owen (Welsh cleric)|Owen, Elias]] (1887). ''Welsh folk-lore: A collection of the folk-tales and legends of North Wales''. Felinfach: Llanerch. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;
