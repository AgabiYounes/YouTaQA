'''Bison''' are large, [[even-toed ungulate]]s in the [[genus]] ''Bison'' within the subfamily [[Bovinae]].

Two [[extant taxon|extant]] and six [[extinction|extinct]] species are recognised. Of the six extinct species, five became extinct in the [[Quaternary extinction event]]. ''Bison palaeosinensis'' evolved in the [[Early Pleistocene]] in [[South Asia]], and was the evolutionary ancestor of ''B. priscus'' ([[steppe bison]]), which was the ancestor of all other ''Bison'' species. From [[Gelasian|2 million years ago]] to [[6th millennium BC|6,000 BC]], steppe bison ranged across the [[mammoth steppe]], inhabiting Europe and northern Asia with ''B. schoetensacki'' (woodland bison), and North America with ''[[Bison antiquus|B. antiquus]]'', ''[[Bison latifrons|B. latifrons]]'', and ''[[Bison occidentalis|B. occidentalis]].'' The last species to go extinct, ''B. occidentalis'', was succeeded at 3,000 BC by ''B. bison''.

Of the two surviving species, the [[American bison]], ''B. bison'', found only in [[North America]], is the more numerous. Although commonly known as a '''buffalo''' in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bison | author=Olson, Wes | work=The Canadian Encyclopedia | url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bison/ | accessdate=2013-04-23 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317035258/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/bison/ | archivedate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is only distantly related to the [[Bubalus|true buffalo]]. The North American species is composed of two subspecies, the [[Plains bison]], ''B. b. bison'', and the [[wood bison]], ''B. b. athabascae'', which is the namesake of [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] in Canada. A third subspecies, the eastern bison (''B. b. pennsylvanicus'') is no longer considered a valid [[taxon]], being a junior synonym of ''B. b. bison''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pennsylvanicus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=BIson americanus pennsylvanicus|url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=203621#null|website=ITIS|accessdate=13 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314153713/https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=203621#null|archivedate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to &quot;woods bison&quot; or &quot;wood bison&quot; from the eastern United States confusingly refer to this subspecies, not ''B. b. athabascae'', which was not found in the region. The [[European bison]], ''B. bonasus'', or wisent, is found in Europe and the [[Caucasus]], reintroduced after being extinct in the wild.

While all bison species are classified in their own [[genus]], they are sometimes bred with domestic cattle (genus ''Bos'') and produce sometimes fertile offspring called [[beefalo]] or [[zubron]].

The American bison and the European bison (wisent) are the largest surviving terrestrial animals in North America and Europe. They are typical [[artiodactyl]] (cloven hooved) ungulates, and are similar in appearance to other bovines such as cattle and true buffalo. They are broad and muscular with shaggy coats of long hair.

Bison are nomadic [[Grazing|grazers]] and travel in [[herd]]s. The bulls leave the herds of females at two or three years of age, and join a herd of males, which are generally smaller than female herds. Mature bulls rarely travel alone. Towards the end of the summer, for the reproductive season, the sexes necessarily commingle.&lt;ref name=&quot;headsmashedin&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.aupress.ca/books/120137/ebook/99Z_Brink_2008-Imagining_Head_Smashed_In.pdf |title=Imagining Head-Smashed-In: Aboriginal Buffalo Hunting on the Northern Plains |last=Brink |first=Jack W. |publisher=Athabasca University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-897425-09-1 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216103511/http://www.aupress.ca/books/120137/ebook/99Z_Brink_2008-Imagining_Head_Smashed_In.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American bison are known for living in the [[Great Plains]], but formerly had a much larger range, including much of the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. Both species were hunted close to [[extinction]] during the 19th and 20th centuries, but have since rebounded; the wisent owing its survival, in part, to the Chernobyl disaster, ironically, as the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] has become a kind of wildlife preserve for wisent and other rare megafauna such as the [[Przewalski's horse]], though poaching has become a threat in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;poachers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chernobyl's Przewalski's horses are poached for meat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14277058|website=BBC|accessdate=13 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231064534/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/14277058|archivedate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Plains bison is no longer listed as [[endangered]], but this does not mean the species is secure.

[[File:Bison skeleton taxidermy mount.jpg|thumb|left|A museum display shows the full skeleton of an adult male American bison]]

Although superficially similar, physical and behavioural differences exist between the American and European bison. The American species has 15 ribs, while the European bison has 14. The American bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the European has five.&lt;ref&gt;''The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'' by Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Great Britain), published by C. Knight, 1835&lt;/ref&gt; (The difference in this case is that what would be the first lumbar vertebra has ribs attached to it in American bison and is thus counted as the 15th thoracic vertebra, compared to 14 thoracic vertebrae in wisent.) Adult American bison are less slim in build and have shorter legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Trophy Bowhunting: Plan the Hunt of a Lifetime and Bag One for the Record Books |last=Sapp |first=Rick |edition=illustrated |publisher=Stackpole |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8117-3315-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/trophybowhunting0000sapp}}&lt;/ref&gt; American bison tend to graze more, and [[Browsing (herbivory)|browse]] less than their European relatives. Their anatomies reflect this behavioural difference; the American bison's head hangs lower than the European's. The body of the American bison is typically hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison, which favours butting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Bison: A Natural History |last=Lott |first=Dale F. |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-520-24062-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; American bison are more easily tamed than their European cousins, and breed with domestic cattle more readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Notice of the Various Species of Bovine Animals |editor=Newman, Edward |journal=The Zoologist |year=1859 |volume=17 |page=6362 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KbwtAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6362&amp;lpg=PA6362&amp;dq=Zoologist:+A+Monthly+Journal+of+Natural+History+bison#v=onepage&amp;q=Zoologist%3A%20A%20Monthly%20Journal%20of%20Natural%20History%20bison&amp;f=false |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706230812/http://books.google.com/books?id=KbwtAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA6362&amp;lpg=PA6362&amp;dq=Zoologist:+A+Monthly+Journal+of+Natural+History+bison&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0AxGurhp2N&amp;sig=mqDPuwezuRDEFzh_7bA1hL2AyYw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eYY_UsWBKYS8iwKNs4CADg&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Zoologist%3A%20A%20Monthly%20Journal%20of%20Natural%20History%20bison&amp;f=false |archivedate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution and genetic history==
The bovine tribe (Bovini) split about 5 to 10 million years ago into the buffalos (''[[Bubalus]]'' and ''[[Syncerus]]'') and a group leading to bison and taurine cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/7/1165.full |title=Maternal and Paternal Lineages in Cross-Breeding Bovine Species.

This crossbreeding was not sufficient to conflate the different species back together, but it has resulted in unexpected relationships between many members of this group, such as yak being related to American bison, when such relationships would otherwise not be apparent.

A 2003 study of mitochondrial DNA indicated four distinct maternal lineages in tribe [[Bovini]]:

At one point, some steppe bison crossbred with the ancestors of the modern yak. After that crossbreeding, a population of steppe bison crossed the [[Bering Land Bridge]] to North America. The steppe bison spread through the northern parts of North America and lived in Eurasia until around 11,000 years ago&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, R. D., 1990.

The Pleistocene woodland bison (''B. schoetensacki)'' evolved in the [[Middle Pleistocene]] from ''B. priscus'', and tended to inhabit the [[Semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|dry]] [[Pinophyta|conifer]] [[forest]]s and [[woodland]] which lined the [[mammoth steppe]], occupying a range from western Europe to the south of Siberia.

In 2016, DNA extracted from ''Bison priscus'' fossil remains beneath a 130,000-year-old volcanic [[wikt:ashfall|ashfall]] in the [[Yukon]] suggested recent arrival of the species. That genetic material indicated that all American bison had a common ancestor 135,000 to 195,000 years ago, during which period the Bering Land Bridge was exposed; this hypothesis precludes an earlier arrival. The researchers sequenced mitochondrial genomes from both that specimen and from the remains of a recently discovered, estimated 120,000-year-old giant, long-horned, ''B. latifrons'' from Snowmass, Colorado. The genetic information also indicated that a second, Pleistocene migration of bison over the land bridge occurred 21,000 to 45,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=migration&gt;[https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/science/2017/03/27/timing-of-bison-arrival-in-north-america-now-known-thanks-to-dna-and-an-alaska-volcano/ An Alaska volcano and DNA reveal the timing of bison's arrival in North America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327215729/https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/science/2017/03/27/timing-of-bison-arrival-in-north-america-now-known-thanks-to-dna-and-an-alaska-volcano/ |date=27 March 2017 }}, ''[[Alaska Dispatch News]]'', Yereth Rosen, 27 March 2017.

During the population bottleneck, after the great slaughter of American bison during the 19th century, the number of bison remaining alive in North America declined to as low as 541. During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce &quot;cattleo&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Halbert2007&quot; /&gt; (today called &quot;[[beefalo]]&quot;) Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. Wisent-American bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in Germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in Russia. A herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds ([[zubron]]) is maintained in Poland. First-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. First-generation males are infertile. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics that prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species. In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.&lt;ref name=Halbert2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Polziehn/&gt;

There are also remnant purebred American bison herds on public lands in North America. Herds of importance are found in [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Wind Cave National Park]] in [[South Dakota]], [[Blue Mounds State Park]] in [[Minnesota]], [[Elk Island National Park]] in [[Alberta]], and [[Grasslands National Park]] in [[Saskatchewan]]. In 2015 a purebred herd of 350 individuals was identified on public lands in the [[Henry Mountains]] of southern [[Utah]] via genetic testing of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic Analysis of the Henry Mountains Bison Herd |vauthors=Ranglack DH, Dobson LK, du Toit JT, Derr J|journal=PLOS ONE |date=17 December 2015 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144239 |volume=10 |issue=12 |page=e0144239 |pmid=26673758 |pmc=4682953}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study, published in 2015, also showed the [[Henry Mountains bison herd]] to be free of [[brucellosis]], a bacterial disease that was imported with non-native domestic cattle to North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On the Origin of Brucellosis in Bison of Yellowstone National Park: A Review |author=Mary Meagher, Margaret E.

[[Wallowing in animals|Wallowing]] is a common behavior of bison. A ''bison wallow'' is a shallow depression in the soil, either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with mud or dust. Possible explanations suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting, male-male interaction (typically [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] behavior), social behavior for group cohesion, play behavior, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of [[Parasitism|ectoparasite]] load ([[tick]]s and [[Louse|lice]]), and thermoregulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;JSTOR&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=McMillan |first=B.

Bison temperament is often unpredictable. They usually appear peaceful, unconcerned, even lazy, yet they may attack anything, often without warning or apparent reason. They can move at speeds up to {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}} and cover long distances at a lumbering gallop.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100303175945/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wica/bison.htm American Bison]. nps.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

Their most obvious weapons are the horns borne by both males and females, but their massive heads can be used as battering rams, effectively using the momentum produced by what is a typical weight of {{convert|2000|lb|sigfig=1}} (can be up to 2700&amp;nbsp;lbs) moving at {{convert|30|mph|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The hind legs can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect.  In the words of early naturalists, they were dangerous, savage animals that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;/&gt; (except for wolves and brown bears&lt;ref name=&quot;headsmashedin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carbyn/&gt;).

The rutting, or mating, season lasts from June through September, with peak activity in July and August. At this time, the older bulls rejoin the herd, and fights often take place between bulls. The herd exhibits much restlessness during breeding season. The animals are belligerent, unpredictable, and most dangerous.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS&quot;/&gt;

American bison live in river valleys, and on prairies and plains. Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison. They also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep. Though not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the [[Yellowstone Park bison herd]] are frequently found at elevations above 8,000 feet and the [[Henry Mountains bison herd]] is found on the plains around the Henry Mountains, Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of 10,000 feet.

European bison tend to live in lightly wooded to fully wooded areas and areas with increased shrubs and bushes, though they can also live on grasslands and plains.

===Restrictions===
Throughout most of their historical range, landowners have sought restrictions on free-ranging bison.

Owing to their size, bison have few predators. Five notable exceptions are [[humans]], the [[grey wolf|wolf]], [[cougar|cougar]], [[brown bear]], and [[coyote]].&lt;ref name=&quot;3of5pred&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Newell|first=Toni Lynn|title=ADW: ''Bison bison'': Information|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Bison_bison/|work=Animal Diversity Web at the University of Michigan|accessdate=21 June 2013|author2=Anna Bess Sorin|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624134300/http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Bison_bison/|archivedate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grey wolf generally takes down a bison while in a pack, but cases of a single wolf killing bison have been reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carbyn&quot; /&gt; [[Brown bear]] also consume bison, often by driving off the pack and consuming the wolves' kill.&lt;ref name=&quot;headsmashedin&quot; /&gt; Brown bear and coyotes also prey on bison calves. Historically and prehistorically, [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, the [[dire wolf]], ''[[Smilodon]]'', ''[[Homotherium]]'', [[cave hyena]]s and ''[[Homo|Homo sp.]]'' had posed threats to bison.

==Infections and illness==
For the American bison, the main cause of illness is [[malignant catarrhal fever]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Durham |first=Sharon |year=2010 |title=Figuring out puzzling animal diseases |journal=Agricultural Research |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=12–13 |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/apr10/animal0410.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405072452/http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/apr10/animal0410.htm |archivedate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[brucellosis]] is a serious concern in the Yellowstone Park bison herd. Bison in the [[Antelope Island bison herd]] are regularly inoculated against brucellosis, parasites, ''Clostridium'' infection, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and bovine vibriosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utah.com/schmerker/1999/bison.htm |title=Island Named for Antelope, the Bison |publisher=Utah.com |accessdate=2013-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603204741/http://www.utah.com/schmerker/1999/bison.htm |archivedate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major concerns for illness in European bison are foot-and-mouth disease and balanoposthitis, which affects the male sex organs; a number of parasitic diseases have also been cited as threats.&lt;ref name=ebcc&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bison-ebcc.eu/about-european-bison/actual-main-and-potential-threats/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904023933/http://www.bison-ebcc.eu/about-european-bison/actual-main-and-potential-threats/ | url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-04 | title=Actual, and Potential Threats | publisher=European Bison Conservation Center | accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inbreeding of the species caused by the small population plays a role in a number of genetic defects and immunity to diseases, which in turn poses greater risks to the population.&lt;ref name=ebcc /&gt;

==Name==
The term &quot;buffalo&quot; is sometimes considered to be a [[misnomer]] for this animal, as it is only distantly related to either of the two &quot;true buffalo&quot;, the Asian [[water buffalo]] and the [[African buffalo]]. [[Samuel de Champlain]] applied the term buffalo (''buffles'' in French) to the bison in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the [[Nipissing First Nation]], who said they travelled 40 days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals.&lt;ref&gt;Champlain, Samuel, Henry P. Biggar. 1929. The Works of Samuel de Champlain, vol 3. Toronto: Champlain Society. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Though &quot;bison&quot; might be considered more scientifically correct, as a result of standard usage, &quot;buffalo&quot; is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison. Buffalo has a much longer history than bison, which was first recorded in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human impact==

Humans were almost exclusively accountable for the near-extinction of the American bison in the 1800s. At the beginning of the century, tens of millions of bison roamed North America. European colonizers slaughtered an estimated 50 million bison during the 19th century, although the causes of decline and the numbers killed are disputed and debated.&lt;ref name=&quot;natgeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/american-bison/ | title=American Bison, ''Bison bison'' | website=National Geographic | accessdate=2013-06-16 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620091201/http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/american-bison/ | archivedate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/science/historians-revisit-slaughter-on-the-plains.html|title=Historians Revisit Slaughter on the Plains|last=Robbins|first=Jim|date=1999-11-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-26|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Railroads were advertising &quot;hunting by rail&quot;, where trains encountered large herds alongside or crossing the tracks.

==Nutrition==
&lt;!-- {{expand section|date=April 2018}}
 --&gt;Bison is an excellent source of complete protein and a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of multiple vitamins, including riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, and is also a rich source of minerals, including iron, phosphorus, and zinc. Additionally, bison is a good source (10% or more of the DV) of thiamine.

The earliest plausible accounts of captive bison are those of the zoo at [[Tenochtitlan]], the [[Aztec Empire|Aztec]] capital, which held an animal the Spaniards called &quot;the Mexican bull&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nicholson |first1=Henry B. |title=Montezuma's Zoo |journal=Pacific Discovery |date=1955 |volume=8/4 |pages=3–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1552, [[Francisco Lopez de Gomara]] described [[Plains Indians]] herding and leading bison like cattle in his controversial book, ''[[Historia general de las Indias]]''. Gomara, having never visited the Americas himself, likely misinterpreted early ethnographic accounts as the more familiar pastoralist relationship of the [[Old World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Latcham |first1=Ricardo E. |title=Los animales domesticos de la America pre-Columbiana |date=1922 |publisher=Museo de Etnologia y Antropologia Publication 3; Cervantes |location=Santiago, Chile |pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, bison are increasingly raised for [[meat]], [[Hide (skin)|hide]]s, [[wool]], and [[dairy]] products. The majority of bison in the world are raised for human consumption or fur clothing. Bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef, but is lower in fat and [[cholesterol]], yet higher in protein than beef, which has led to the development of [[beefalo]], a fertile hybrid of bison and domestic cattle. A market even exists for [[kashrut|kosher]] bison meat; these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouses in the U.S. and Canada, and the meat is then distributed worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|URL=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/meat-preparation/focus-on-bison/CT_Index|title=Bison from Farm to Table|publisher=USDA|accessdate=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisoncentral.com/index.php?s=&amp;c=67&amp;d=99&amp;a=1056&amp;w=2&amp;r=Y |title=&amp;#124; National Bison Association |publisher=Bisoncentral.com |accessdate=February 19, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110120234037/http://bisoncentral.com/index.php?s=&amp;c=67&amp;d=99&amp;a=1056&amp;w=2&amp;r=Y| archivedate= January 20, 2011 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ca&gt;Terry Kremeniuk. &quot;Bison Farming&quot;.

In America, the commercial industry for bison has been slow to develop despite individuals, such as [[Ted Turner]], who have long marketed bison meat. In the 1990s, Turner found limited success with restaurants for high-quality cuts of meat, which include bison steaks and tenderloin.&lt;ref name=farming&gt;Haddad, Charles. &quot;Bison Meat Slow to Catch On, But Turner Sees Promise&quot;.

In Canada, commercial bison farming began in the mid-1980s, concerning an unknown number of animals then.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt; The first census of the bison occurred in 1996, which recorded 45,235 bison on 745 farms, and grew to 195,728 bison on 1,898 farms for the 2006 census.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt;

Several pet food companies use bison as a red meat alternative in dog foods. The companies producing these formulas include [[Natural Balance Pet Foods]], [[Freshpet]], the Blue Buffalo Company, [[Solid Gold (pet food)|Solid Gold]], Canidae, and Taste of the Wild.
