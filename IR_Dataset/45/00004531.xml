Both [[mania]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] are characterized by disruptions in normal [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], psychomotor activity-the level of physical activity that is influenced by mood-(e.g., constant fidgeting with mania or slowed movements with depression), [[circadian rhythm]], and cognition. Mania can present with varying levels of mood disturbance, ranging from [[euphoria]] that is associated with &quot;classic mania&quot; to [[dysphoria]] and [[irritability]]. The core symptom of mania involves an [[Psychomotor agitation|increase in energy of psychomotor activity]]. Mania can also present with increased self-esteem or [[grandiosity]], rapid speech, the subjective feeling of rapid thoughts, disinhibited social behavior, or [[impulsivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akiskal|first1=Hagop|editor1-last=Sadock|editor1-first=Benjamin|editor2-last=Sadock|editor2-first=Virginia|editor3-last=Ruiz|editor3-first=Pedro |name-list-format = vanc |title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|date=2017|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|location=New York|edition=10th|chapter=13.4 Mood Disorders: Clinical Features}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[DSM-5]] criteria, mania is distinguished from [[hypomania]] by length, as hypomania requires four consecutive days, and mania requires more than a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grande2016&quot;/&gt; Unlike mania, hypomania is not always associated with impaired functioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grande2016&quot;/&gt; The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode, or vice versa, remain poorly understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salvadore2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salvadore G, Quiroz JA, Machado-Vieira R, Henter ID, Manji HK, Zarate CA | title = The neurobiology of the switch process in bipolar disorder: a review | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 71 | issue = 11 | pages = 1488–501 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20492846 | pmc = 3000635 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.09r05259gre }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manic episodes ===
[[File:A woman diagnosed as suffering from hilarious mania. Colour Wellcome L0026687.jpg|thumb|left|An 1892 color lithograph depicting a woman diagnosed with ''hilarious mania'']]

Mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable mood, which can range from euphoria to [[delirium]]. Those experiencing hypomania or mania generally exhibit several of the following behaviors: [[Pressure of speech|speaking in a rapid, uninterruptible manner]], decreased need for sleep, short [[attention span]], [[racing thoughts]], increased [[goal-oriented]] activities, agitation, or exhibition of behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk, such as [[hypersexuality]] or excessive spending.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnett2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarr2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tarr GP, Glue P, Herbison P|date=November 2011|title=Comparative efficacy and acceptability of mood stabilizer and second generation antipsychotic monotherapy for acute mania—a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=J Affect Disord|volume=134|issue=1–3|pages=14–9|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2010.11.009|pmid=21145595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beentjes2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Beentjes TA, Goossens PJ, Poslawsky IE|date=October 2012|title=Caregiver burden in bipolar hypomania and mania: a systematic review|journal=Perspect Psychiatr Care|volume=48|issue=4|pages=187–97|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6163.2012.00328.x|pmid=23005586}}&lt;/ref&gt; To meet the definition for a manic episode, these behaviors must impair the individual's ability to socialize or work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnett2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beentjes2012&quot; /&gt; If untreated, a manic episode usually lasts three to six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Titmarsh S | title = Characteristics and duration of mania: implications for continuation treatment | journal = Progress in Neurology and Psychiatry | date = May–June 2013 | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 26–7 | doi = 10.1002/pnp.283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manic individuals often have a history of [[substance abuse]] developed over years as a form of &quot;self-medication&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post2013&quot; /&gt; At the most extreme, a person in a full-blown manic state can experience [[psychosis]]: a break with reality, a state in which thinking is affected along with mood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beentjes2012&quot; /&gt; They may feel unstoppable, or as if they have been &quot;chosen&quot; and are on a &quot;special mission&quot;, or have other grandiose or delusional ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knowles2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Knowles R, McCarthy-Jones S, Rowse G | title = Grandiose delusions: a review and theoretical integration of cognitive and affective perspectives | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 684–96 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21482326 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.02.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may lead to violent behavior and, sometimes, hospitalization in an inpatient [[psychiatric hospital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarr2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beentjes2012&quot; /&gt; The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the [[Young Mania Rating Scale]], though questions remain about the reliability of these scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Furukawa TA | title = Assessment of mood: Guides for clinicians | journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–589 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20488276 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2009.05.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hypomanic episodes ===
[[File:'Melancholy passing into mania' Wellcome L0022595 (cropped).jpg|thumb|An 1858 lithograph captioned 'Melancholy passing into mania']]

[[Hypomania]] is the milder form of mania, defined as at least four days of the same criteria as mania,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beentjes2012&quot; /&gt; but which does not cause a significant decrease in the individual's ability to socialize or work, lacks psychotic features such as [[delusions]] or [[hallucinations]], and does not require psychiatric hospitalization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnett2009&quot; /&gt; Overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression by some.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowins2013&quot; /&gt; Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to full-blown manic episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowins2013&quot; /&gt; Some people who experience hypomania show increased creativity&lt;ref name=&quot;Beentjes2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20936438&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Srivastava S, Ketter TA|date=December 2010|title=The link between bipolar disorders and creativity: evidence from personality and temperament studies.|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|volume=12|issue=6|pages=522–30|doi=10.1007/s11920-010-0159-x|pmid=20936438}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bobo2017&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bobo |first1=WV |title=The Diagnosis and Management of Bipolar I and II Disorders: Clinical Practice Update |journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings |date=October 2017 |volume=92 |issue=10 |pages=1532-51 |doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.06.022 |pmid=28888714|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypomania may feel good to some persons who experience it, though most people who experience hypomania state that the stress of the experience is very painful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beentjes2012&quot; /&gt; Bipolar people who experience hypomania tend to forget the effects of their actions on those around them.

Symptoms of the [[Major depressive episode|depressive phase]] of bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of [[sadness]], irritability or anger, [[Anhedonia|loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities]], excessive or inappropriate [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Depression (mood)|hopelessness]], [[Hypersomnia|sleeping too much]] or [[Insomnia|not enough]], changes in appetite and/or weight, [[fatigue]], problems concentrating, self-loathing or feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Muneer2013&quot; /&gt; In severe cases, the individual may develop symptoms of psychosis, a condition also known as ''severe bipolar disorder with psychotic features''.

The precise mechanisms that cause bipolar disorder are not yet fully understood. Bipolar disorder is associated with abnormalities in the structure and function of certain brain areas. [[Meta-analysis|Meta-analyses]] of structural [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies have shown that certain brain regions (e.g., the left rostral [[anterior cingulate cortex]], [[insular cortex|fronto-insular cortex]], [[prefrontal cortex|ventral prefrontal cortex]], and [[claustrum]]) are smaller in people with bipolar disorder, whereas other are larger ([[lateral ventricles]], [[globus pallidus]], [[Brodmann area 25|subgenual anterior cingulate]], and the [[amygdala]]).

When relevant, specifiers for ''peripartum onset'' and ''with rapid cycling'' should be used with any subtype. Individuals who have subthreshold symptoms that cause clinically significant distress or impairment, but do not meet full criteria for one of the three subtypes may be diagnosed with other specified or unspecified bipolar disorder. Other specified bipolar disorder is used when a clinician chooses to provide an explanation for why the full criteria were not met (e.g., hypomania without a prior major depressive episode).&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

==== Rapid cycling ====
Most people who meet criteria for bipolar disorder experience a number of episodes, on average 0.4 to 0.7 per year, lasting three to six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Angst J, Sellaro R | title = Historical perspectives and natural history of bipolar disorder | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 445–457 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11018218 | doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(00)00909-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rapid cycling'', however, is a course specifier that may be applied to any of the above subtypes.

== Prevention ==
Attempts at [[Prevention of mental disorders|prevention of bipolar disorder]] have focused on stress (such as [[Childhood trauma|childhood adversity]] or highly conflictual families) which, although not a diagnostically specific causal agent for bipolar, does place genetically and biologically vulnerable individuals at risk for a more severe course of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miklowitz DJ, Chang KD | title = Prevention of bipolar disorder in at-risk children: theoretical assumptions and empirical foundations. | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 881–97 | date = Summer 2008 | pmid = 18606036 | doi=10.1017/s0954579408000424 | pmc=2504732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
{{Main|Treatment of bipolar disorder}}

There are a number of [[pharmacological]] and [[psychotherapeutic]] techniques used to treat bipolar disorder. Individuals may use [[self-help groups for mental health|self-help]] and pursue [[recovery model|recovery]].

Hospitalization may be required especially with the manic episodes present in bipolar I. This can be voluntary or (local legislation permitting) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]). Long-term inpatient stays are now less common due to [[deinstitutionalization]], although these can still occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeckerKilian2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Becker T, Kilian R | title = Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: What can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 113 | issue = 429 | pages = 9–16 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16445476 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following (or in lieu of) a hospital admission, support services available can include [[drop-in center]]s, visits from members of a [[community mental health team]] or an [[Assertive Community Treatment]] team, [[supported employment]], [[Self-help groups for mental health|patient-led support groups]], and [[intensive outpatient programs]]. These are sometimes referred to as partial-inpatient programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McGurk SR, Mueser KT, Feldman K, Wolfe R, Pascaris A | title = Cognitive Training for Supported Employment: 2–3 Year Outcomes of a Randomized Controlled Trial | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 3 | pages = 437–441 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17329468 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.164.3.437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychosocial ===
[[Psychotherapy]] aims to provide a person with bipolar disorder with more support, assist them with accepting and understanding their diagnosis, cope with various types of stress, improve their interpersonal relationships, and recognizing [[prodromal]] symptoms before full-blown recurrence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bobo2017&quot;/&gt; [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]], [[family therapy|family-focused therapy]], and [[psychoeducation]] have the most evidence for efficacy in regard to relapse prevention, while [[interpersonal and social rhythm therapy]] and cognitive-behavioral therapy appear the most effective in regard to residual depressive symptoms. Most studies have been based only on bipolar I, however, and treatment during the acute phase can be a particular challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zaretsky AE, Rizvi S, Parikh SV | title = How well do psychosocial interventions work in bipolar disorder? | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry| volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–21 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17444074 | doi = 10.1177/070674370705200104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some clinicians emphasize the need to talk with individuals experiencing mania, to develop a [[therapeutic alliance]] in support of [[recovery model|recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Havens LL, Ghaemi SN | title = Existential despair and bipolar disorder: The therapeutic alliance as a mood stabilizer | journal = American Journal of Psychotherapy | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–147 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16170918 | doi = 10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.2005.59.2.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medication ===
[[File:Lithium2017a.jpg|thumb|Lithium is often used to treat bipolar disorder and has the best evidence for reducing suicide.]]

A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geddestreatment&quot; /&gt; The medication with the best evidence is [[lithium (medication)|lithium]], which is an effective treatment for acute manic episodes, preventing relapses, and bipolar depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown KM, Tracy DK | title = Lithium: the pharmacodynamic actions of the amazing ion | journal = Therapeutic Advances in Psychopharmacology | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 163–76 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24167688 | pmc = 3805456 | doi = 10.1177/2045125312471963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithium reduces the risk of suicide, self-harm, and death in people with bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23814104&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cipriani A, Hawton K, Stockton S, Geddes JR | title = Lithium in the prevention of suicide in mood disorders: updated systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMJ | volume = 346 | issue =  | pages = f3646 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23814104 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.f3646 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if [[ketamine]] (a common general dissociative anesthetic used in surgery) is useful in bipolar {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCloud TL, Caddy C, Jochim J, Rendell JM, Diamond PR, Shuttleworth C, Brett D, Amit BH, McShane R, Hamadi L, Hawton K, Cipriani A | title = Ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators for depression in bipolar disorder in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = CD011611 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26415966 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011611.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mood stabilizers====
Lithium and the [[anticonvulsant]]s [[carbamazepine]], [[lamotrigine]], and [[valproic acid]] are used as mood stabilizers to treat bipolar disorder. These mood stabilizers are used for long-term mood stabilization but have not demonstrated the ability to quickly treat acute bipolar depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post2016&quot;/&gt; Lithium is preferred for long-term mood stabilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geddestreatment&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Geddes JR, Miklowitz DJ | title = Treatment of bipolar disorder | journal = Lancet | volume = 381 | issue = 9878 | pages = 1672–82 | date = May 11, 2013 | pmid = 23663953 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60857-0 | pmc=3876031}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbamazepine effectively treats manic episodes, with some evidence it has greater benefit in rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, or those with more psychotic symptoms or a more schizoaffective clinical picture.

====Antipsychotics====
[[Antipsychotic]] medications are effective for short-term treatment of bipolar manic episodes and appear to be superior to lithium and anticonvulsants for this purpose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geddestreatment&quot; /&gt; Atypical antipsychotics are also indicated for bipolar depression refractory to treatment with mood stabilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post2016&quot;/&gt; [[Olanzapine]] is effective in preventing relapses, although the supporting evidence is weaker than the evidence for lithium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cipriani A, Rendell JM, Geddes J | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 1 | pages = CD004367 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19160237 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004367.pub2 | title = Olanzapine in long-term treatment for bipolar disorder | editor1-last = Cipriani | editor1-first = Andrea }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to widely held views, stimulants are relatively safe in bipolar disorder, and considerable evidence suggests they may even produce an antimanic effect. In cases of comorbid ADHD and bipolar, stimulants may help improve both conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegerl|first1=Ulrich|last2=Sander|first2=Christian|last3=Hensch|first3=Tilman|editor1-last=Frodl|editor1-first=Thomas | name-list-format = vanc |title=Systems Neuroscience in Depression|publisher=Elsevier Science.|page=353|chapter=Arousal Regulation in Affective Disorders|quote=In conclusion, stimulants in bipolar disorder seem to be relatively safe, and there are even several case reports suggesting rapid antimanic effects of psychostimulants (Beckmann &amp; Heinemann, 1976; Garvey, Hwang, Teubner-Rhodes, Zander, &amp; Rhem, 1987; Max, Richards, &amp; Hamdanallen, 1995).

=== Alternative medicine ===
Several studies have suggested that [[omega-3 fatty acids]] may have beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, but not manic symptoms.

A lifelong condition with periods of partial or full recovery in between recurrent episodes of relapse,&lt;ref name=&quot;Muneer2013&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18425912&quot;/&gt; bipolar disorder is considered to be a major health problem worldwide because of the increased rates of disability and premature mortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18425912&quot;/&gt; It is also associated with co-occurring psychiatric and medical problems, higher rates of death from natural causes (e.g., [[Coronary artery disease|cardiovascular disease]]), and high rates of initial under- or misdiagnosis, causing a delay in appropriate treatment interventions and contributing to poorer prognoses.&lt;ref name=BMJ2012 /&gt;&lt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowden&quot; /&gt; After a diagnosis is made, it remains difficult to achieve complete remission of all symptoms with the currently available psychiatric medications and symptoms often become progressively more severe over time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carvalho2015&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Muneer2016&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Staging Models in Bipolar Disorder: A Systematic Review of the Literature|last=Muneer|first=Ather|date=2016|journal= Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=117–30|doi=10.9758/cpn.2016.14.2.117|pmc=4857867|pmid=27121423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliance with medications is one of the most significant factors that can decrease the rate and severity of relapse and have a positive impact on overall prognosis.&lt;ref name=Jann/&gt; However, the types of medications used in treating BD commonly cause side effects&lt;ref name=Tsitsipa/&gt; and more than 75% of individuals with BD inconsistently take their medications for various reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jann&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Diagnosis and Treatment of Bipolar Disorders in Adults: A Review of the Evidence on Pharmacologic Treatments|last=Jann|first=Michael W.|year=2014|journal=American Health &amp; Drug Benefits|volume=7|issue=9|pages=489–499|pmc=4296286|pmid=25610528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the various types of the disorder, rapid cycling (four or more episodes in one year) is associated with the worst prognosis due to higher rates of [[self-harm]] and suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muneer2013&quot;/&gt; Individuals diagnosed with bipolar who have a family history of bipolar disorder are at a greater risk for more frequent manic/hypomanic episodes.&lt;ref name=Maciukiewicz/&gt; Early onset and psychotic features are also associated with worse outcomes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kennedy KP, Cullen KR, DeYoung CG, Klimes-Dougan B | title = The genetics of early-onset bipolar disorder: A systematic review | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 184 | issue =  | pages = 1–12 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26057335 | pmc = 5552237 | doi = 10.1016/j.jad.2015.05.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serafini G, Pompili M, Borgwardt S, Houenou J, Geoffroy PA, Jardri R, Girardi P, Amore M | title = Brain changes in early-onset bipolar and unipolar depressive disorders: a systematic review in children and adolescents | journal = European Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 23 | issue = 11 | pages = 1023–41 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25212880 | doi = 10.1007/s00787-014-0614-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as subtypes that are nonresponsive to lithium.&lt;ref name=Muneer2016/&gt;

=== Functioning ===
People with bipolar disorder often experience a decline in cognitive functioning during (or possibly before) their first episode, after which a certain degree of cognitive dysfunction typically becomes permanent, with more severe impairment during [[acute medicine|acute phases]] and moderate impairment during periods of remission. As a result, two-thirds of people with BD continue to experience impaired [[psychosocial|psychosocial functioning]] in between episodes even when their mood symptoms are in full remission. A similar pattern is seen in both BD-I and BD-II, but people with BD-II experience a lesser degree of impairment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tsitsipa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsitsipa E, Fountoulakis KN | title = The neurocognitive functioning in bipolar disorder: a systematic review of data | journal = Annals of General Psychiatry | volume = 14 | pages = 42 | date = December 1, 2015 | pmid = 26628905 | pmc = 4666163 | doi = 10.1186/s12991-015-0081-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive deficits typically increase over the course of the illness.

=== Recovery and recurrence ===
A naturalistic study from first admission for mania or mixed episode (representing the hospitalized and therefore most severe cases) found that 50% achieved syndromal recovery (no longer meeting criteria for the diagnosis) within six weeks and 98% within two years. Within two years, 72% achieved symptomatic recovery (no symptoms at all) and 43% achieved functional recovery (regaining of prior occupational and residential status). However, 40% went on to experience a new episode of mania or depression within 2 years of syndromal recovery, and 19% switched phases without recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tohen M, Zarate CA, Hennen J, Khalsa HM, Strakowski SM, Gebre-Medhin P, Salvatore P, Baldessarini RJ | title = The McLean-Harvard First-Episode Mania Study: Prediction of recovery and first recurrence | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 160 | issue = 12 | pages = 2099–2107 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14638578 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.12.2099 | hdl = 11381/1461461 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7cfecaa43e33672c373dec5d6741aeaa74c5544b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conceptual and methodological limitations and variations in the findings. Prevalence studies of bipolar disorder are typically carried out by lay interviewers who follow fully structured/fixed interview schemes; responses to single items from such interviews may suffer limited validity. In addition, diagnoses (and therefore estimates of prevalence) vary depending on whether a categorical or [[spectrum approach]] is used. This consideration has led to concerns about the potential for both underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phelps J |title=Bipolar Disorder: Particle or Wave?

[[File:Emil Kraepelin 1926.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] first distinguished between manic–depressive illness and &quot;dementia praecox&quot; (now known as [[schizophrenia]]) in the late 19th century]]

Variations in moods and energy levels have been observed as part of the human experience throughout history. The words &quot;[[melancholia]]&quot;, an old word for depression, and &quot;mania&quot; originated in Ancient Greece. The word melancholia is derived from ''melas'' ({{lang|grc|μέλας}}), meaning &quot;black&quot;, and ''chole'' ({{lang|grc|χολή}}), meaning &quot;bile&quot; or &quot;gall&quot;,{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980}} indicative of the term's origins in pre-Hippocratic [[humoral theory]]. Within the humoral theories, mania was viewed as arising from an excess of yellow bile, or a mixture of black and yellow bile. The linguistic origins of mania, however, are not so clear-cut. Several etymologies were proposed by the Ancient Roman physician [[Caelius Aurelianus]], including the Greek word ''ania'', meaning &quot;to produce great mental anguish&quot;, and ''manos'', meaning &quot;relaxed&quot; or &quot;loose&quot;, which would contextually approximate to an excessive relaxing of the mind or soul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angst-2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Angst J, Marneros A | title = Bipolarity from ancient to modern times: conception, birth and rebirth | journal = Journal of Affective Disorders | volume = 67 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 3–19 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11869749 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(01)00429-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least five other candidates, and part of the confusion surrounding the exact etymology of the word mania is its varied usage in the pre-Hippocratic poetry and mythology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angst-2001&quot; /&gt;

In the early 1800s, French psychiatrist [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol]]'s lypemania, one of his affective [[monomania]]s, was the first elaboration on what was to become modern depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borch-Jacobsen M | title = Which came first, the condition or the drug? | journal = London Review of Books | volume = 32 | issue = 19 | pages = 31–33 | date = October 2010 | url = http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug | quote = at the beginning of the 19th century with Esquirol's 'affective monomanias' (notably 'lypemania', the first elaboration of what was to become our modern depression) | url-status=live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150313201452/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n19/mikkel-borch-jacobsen/which-came-first-the-condition-or-the-drug | archivedate = March 13, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the current conceptualisation of bipolar illness can be traced back to the 1850s; In 1850, [[Jean-Pierre Falret]] presented a description to the Academy the Paris Psychiatric Society{{Verify source | date = December 2019}}&lt;!-- 'the Academy the Paris Psychiatric Society' is likely to be wrong. --&gt; in the course of which he mentioned &quot;circular insanity&quot; (la folie circulaire, {{IPA-fr|la fɔli siʁ.ky.lɛʁ}}); the lecture was summarized in 1851 in the &quot;Gazette des hôpitaux&quot; (&quot;Hospital Gazette&quot;).&lt;ref name=Shorter2005&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Shorter|title=A Historical Dictionary of Psychiatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M49pEDoEpl0C&amp;pg=PA165|year=2005|place=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517668-1|pages=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, in 1854, [[Jules Baillarger|Jules-Gabriel-François Baillarger]] (1809–1890) described to the French Imperial [[Académie Nationale de Médecine]] a biphasic mental illness causing recurrent oscillations between mania and melancholia, which he termed ''folie à double forme'' ({{IPA-fr|fɔli a dubl fɔʀm}}, &quot;madness in double form&quot;).&lt;ref name=Shorter2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pichot P. |title=150e anniversaire de la Folie Circulaire |trans-title=Circular insanity, 150 years on |journal = Bulletin de l'Académie Nationale de Médecine |volume=188 |issue=2 |pages=275–284 |year=2004 |pmid = 15506718 |language=fr|doi=10.1016/S0001-4079(19)33801-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baillarger's original paper, &quot;De la folie à double forme,&quot; appeared in the medical journal ''[[Annales médico-psychologiques]]'' (''Medico-psychological annals'') in 1854.&lt;ref name=Shorter2005/&gt;

These concepts were developed by the German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] (1856–1926), who, using [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum|Kahlbaum]]'s concept of cyclothymia,{{sfn|Millon|1996|p=290}} categorized and studied the natural course of untreated bipolar patients. He coined the term ''manic depressive psychosis'', after noting that periods of acute illness, manic or depressive, were generally punctuated by relatively symptom-free intervals where the patient was able to function normally.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kraepelin|first=Emil|year=1921|title=Manic–depressive Insanity and Paranoia|journal=The Indian Medical Gazette|volume=56|issue=4|pages=156–157|isbn= 978-0-405-07441-7|pmc=5166213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TV special]]s, for example the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/health/tv_and_radio/secretlife_index.shtml |title=The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive |publisher=BBC |year=2006 |accessdate=February 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118045848/http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/tv_and_radio/secretlife_index.shtml |archive-date=November 18, 2006 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV]]'s ''[[True Life]]: I'm Bipolar'', talk shows, and public radio shows, and the greater willingness of public figures to discuss their own bipolar disorder, have focused on psychiatric conditions, thereby, raising public awareness.

On April 7, 2009, the nighttime drama ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' on the [[The CW|CW]] network, aired a [[very special episode|special episode]] where the character Silver was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpkids.org/90210 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120803024403/http://www.bpkids.org/90210 |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 3, 2012 |title=Child and Adolescent Bipolar Foundation special 90210 website |publisher=CABF |year=2009 |accessdate=April 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stacey Slater]], a character from the BBC soap [[EastEnders]], has been diagnosed with the disorder.

In an effort to ease the social stigma associated with bipolar disorder, the orchestra conductor [[Ronald Braunstein]] cofounded the ME/2 Orchestra with his wife Caroline Whiddon in 2011. Braunstein was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1985 and his concerts with the ME/2 Orchestra were conceived in order to create a welcoming performance environment for his musical colleagues, while also raising public awareness about mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Gram | date=December 27, 2013 | title=For this orchestra, playing music is therapeutic | work=The Boston Globe | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2013/12/27/mentally-ill-and-their-supporters-fill-vermont-orchestra/WIeh9mIp9GzPampyIXwtLM/story.html | access-date=March 7, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190414112300/https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2013/12/27/mentally-ill-and-their-supporters-fill-vermont-orchestra/WIeh9mIp9GzPampyIXwtLM/story.html | archive-date=April 14, 2019 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Franz | last=Strasser |first2=David | last2=Botti | name-list-format = vanc | date= January 7, 2013|title=Conductor with bipolar disorder on music and mental illness | work= BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20732070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creativity===
{{Main|Creativity and mental illness#Bipolar disorder}}
A link between mental illness and professional success or creativity has been suggested, including in accounts by [[Socrates]], [[Seneca the Younger]], and [[Cesare Lombroso]]. Despite prominence in popular culture, the link between creativity and bipolar has not been rigorously studied. This area of study also is likely affected by [[confirmation bias]]. Some evidence suggests that some heritable component of bipolar disorder overlaps with heritable components of creativity. Probands of people with bipolar disorder are more likely to be professionally successful, as well as to demonstrate temperamental traits similar to bipolar disorder. Furthermore, while studies of the frequency of bipolar disorder in creative population samples have been conflicting, full-blown bipolar disorder in creative samples is rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Akiskal |first1=Hagop |last2=Akiskal |first2=Kareen |editor1-last=Lakshmi |editor1-first=Yatham | name-list-format = vanc |title=Bipolar Disorder: Clinical and Neurobiological Foundations |pages=83–89 |publisher=Wiley |chapter=The Genius-Insanity Debate: Focus on Bipolarity, Temperament, Creativity and Leadership|doi=10.1002/9780470661277.ch9 |isbn = 9780470661277|year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children ===
{{Main|Bipolar disorder in children}}
[[File:Lithium carbonate.jpg|thumb|[[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] is the only medication approved by the FDA for treating mania in children]]
In the 1920s, [[Emil Kraepelin]] noted that manic episodes are rare before puberty.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot; /&gt; In general, bipolar disorder in children was not recognized in the first half of the twentieth century. This issue diminished with an increased following of the DSM criteria in the last part of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anthony J, Scott P | title = Manic–depressive Psychosis in Childhood | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 1 | pages = 53–72 | year = 1960 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1960.tb01979.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DSM5]] does not specifically have bipolar disorder in children and instead refers to it as [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pediatric Bipolar Affective Disorder |url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/913464-overview |accessdate=June 28, 2018 |date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in adults the course of bipolar disorder is characterized by discrete episodes of depression and mania, with [[Euthymia (medicine)|euthymia]] or symptoms not reaching diagnostic criteria between them, in children and adolescents, very fast mood changes or even chronic symptoms are the norm.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; Pediatric bipolar disorder is commonly characterized by outbursts of anger, irritability and [[psychosis]], rather than [[euphoria|euphoric]] [[mania]], which is more likely to be seen in adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; Early onset bipolar disorder is more likely to manifest as depression rather than mania or hypomania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cosgrove2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cosgrove VE, Roybal D, Chang KD | title = Bipolar depression in pediatric populations: epidemiology and management | journal = Paediatr Drugs | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–91 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23529869 | doi = 10.1007/s40272-013-0022-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagnosis of childhood bipolar disorder is controversial,&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; although it is not under discussion that the typical symptoms of bipolar disorder have negative consequences for minors suffering them.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot; /&gt; The debate is mainly centered on whether what is called bipolar disorder in children refers to the same disorder as when diagnosing adults,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot; /&gt; and the related question of whether the criteria for diagnosis for adults are useful and accurate when applied to children.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; Regarding diagnosis of children, some experts recommend following the DSM criteria.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; Others believe that these criteria do not correctly separate children with bipolar disorder from other problems such as ADHD, and emphasize fast mood cycles.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; Still others argue that what accurately differentiates children with bipolar disorder is irritability.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; The practice parameters of the [[American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|AACAP]] encourage the first strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; American children and adolescents diagnosed with bipolar disorder in [[community hospital]]s increased 4-fold reaching rates of up to 40% in 10 years around the beginning of the 21st century, while in [[outpatient clinic]]s it doubled reaching 6%.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; Studies using DSM criteria show that up to 1% of youth may have bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot; /&gt;

Treatment involves medication and psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=Lei2008&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leibenluft E, Rich BA | title = Pediatric Bipolar Disorder | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 4 | pages = 163–187 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17716034 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.4.022007.141216 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1234949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug prescription usually consists in [[mood stabilizer]]s and [[atypical antipsychotic]]s.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; Among the former, [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] is the only compound approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for children.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17195735&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McClellan J, Kowatch R, Findling RL | title = Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Bipolar Disorder | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 107–125 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17195735 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/01.chi.0000242240.69678.c4 | others = Work Group on Quality Issues }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological treatment combines normally [[Psychoeducation|education on the disease]], [[Group psychotherapy|group therapy]] and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic]] medication is often needed.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt;

Current research directions for bipolar disorder in children include optimizing treatments, increasing the knowledge of the genetic and neurobiological basis of the pediatric disorder and improving diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref name=Lei2008 /&gt; Some treatment research suggests that [[psychosocial]] interventions that involve the family, psychoeducation, and skills building (through therapies such as [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|CBT]], [[Dialectical behavior therapy|DBT]], and [[Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy|IPSRT]]) can benefit in a pharmocotherapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fristad&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fristad MA, MacPherson HA | title = Evidence-based psychosocial treatments for child and adolescent bipolar spectrum disorders | journal = Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 339–55 | date = 2014 | pmid = 23927375 | pmc = 3844106 | doi = 10.1080/15374416.2013.822309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the literature and research on the effects of psychosocial therapy on bipolar spectrum disorders is scarce, making it difficult to determine the efficacy of various therapies.&lt;ref name=Fristad /&gt; The DSM-5 has proposed a new diagnosis which is considered to cover some presentations currently thought of as childhood-onset bipolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roy AK, Lopes V, Klein RG | title = Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder: a new diagnostic approach to chronic irritability in youth | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 171 | issue = 9 | pages = 918–24 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25178749 | pmc = 4390118 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.13101301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elderly ===
There is a relative lack of knowledge about bipolar disorder in late life. There is evidence that it becomes less prevalent with age but nevertheless accounts for a similar percentage of psychiatric admissions; that older bipolar patients had first experienced symptoms at a later age; that later onset of mania is associated with more neurologic impairment; that substance abuse is considerably less common in older groups; and that there is probably a greater degree of variation in presentation and course, for instance, individuals may develop new-onset mania associated with vascular changes, or become manic only after recurrent depressive episodes, or may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at an early age and still meet criteria. There is also some weak and not conclusive evidence that mania is less intense and there is a higher prevalence of mixed episodes, although there may be a reduced response to treatment. Overall, there are likely more similarities than differences from younger adults.&lt;ref name=Vasudev2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vasudev A, Thomas A | title = 'Bipolar disorder' in the elderly: what's in a name? | journal = Maturitas | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–5 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20307944 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2010.02.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15383127&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Depp CA, Jeste DV | title = Bipolar disorder in older adults: A critical review | journal = Bipolar Disorders | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 343–367 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15383127 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-5618.2004.00139.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the elderly, recognition and treatment of bipolar disorder may be complicated by the presence of [[dementia]] or the side effects of medications being taken for other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trinh NH, Forester B |title=Bipolar Disorder in the Elderly: Differential Diagnosis and Treatment |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=24 |issue=14 |year=2007 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/bipolar-disorder/article/10168/54481 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621000437/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/bipolar-disorder/article/10168/54481 |archivedate=June 21, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
