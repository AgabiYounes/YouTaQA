'''Bishkek''' ({{lang-ky|Бишке́к}}, بىشکەک; {{IPA-ky|biʃˈkek|IPA}}; {{lang-rus|Бишке́к|Biškék|bʲɪˈʂkʲek}}), formerly '''Pishpek''' and '''Frunze''', is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[Kyrgyzstan]] (Kyrgyz Republic). Bishkek is also the most commonly  administrative centre of the [[Chuy Region]]. The province surrounds the city, although the city itself is not part of the province, but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.

In 1825 [[Kokand|Khokand]] authorities established the fortress of &quot;Pishpek&quot; to control local caravan routes and to collect tribute from [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz tribes]]. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Apollon Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. In 1868 a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name, &quot;Pishpek&quot;. It lay within the General Governorship of [[Russian Turkestan]] and its [[Semirechye Oblast]].

In 1925 the [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast]] was established in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926 the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] renamed the city as ''Frunze'', after the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] military leader [[Mikhail Frunze]] (1885–1925), who was born there. In 1936, the city of Frunze became the capital of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]], during the final stages of the [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]]. In 1991 the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to &quot;Bishkek&quot;.

Bishkek is situated at an altitude of about {{convert|800|meters}}, just off the northern fringe of the [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range|Kyrgyz Ala-Too range]], an extension of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of {{convert|4855|meters}}. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chu River|Chui River]] drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway|Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] by a [[Branch line|spur line]].

Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous [[Khrushchyovka|Soviet-style apartment blocks]] surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller privately built houses, mostly outside the city centre. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels, watering innumerable trees to provide shade in the hot summers.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bishkek}}

===Kokhand rule===

Originally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the [[Sogdia]]ns) on one of the branches of the [[Silk Road]] through the [[Tian Shan]] range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] khan of [[Kokand|Kokhand]] with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule, the Pishpek fortress was led by [[Atabeg|Atabek]], [[Kurmanjan Datka|the Datka]].

===Tsarist era===

In 1860, the fort was conquered and razed by the military forces of Colonel Zimmermann when [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] annexed the area. Colonel Zimmermann rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and put field Poruchik Titov as head of a new Russian garrison. The site was redeveloped from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.

===Soviet era===
[[File:Michael Frunze Statue vor dem Bahnhof von Bischkek.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Frunze statue near the railway station]]
In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed &quot;Frunze&quot; after [[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|revolutions of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution|1917]] and during the [[Russian Civil War|Russian civil war]] of the early 1920s.

===Independence era===

The early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan that threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|breakup of the Soviet Union]]. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population were ethnic [[Russians]]. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about {{nowrap|7–8%}} in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: Current Conditions and Prospects]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321113715/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 |date=21 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Bishkek is a modern city with many restaurants and cafes, and with many second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. However, streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the 1990s. At the same time, Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.

Bishkek is also the country's financial center, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks headquartered there. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or now operate on a much-reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centers today is the [[Dordoy Bazaar|Dordoy Bazaar open market]], where many of the Chinese goods imported to [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries are sold.

==Geography==

===Orientation===
Though the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating to prehistorical times.  There are also sites from the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] period, the period of [[Church of the East|Nestorian]] influence, the era of the Central Asian ''[[khanate]]s'', and the Soviet period.

The central part of the city is laid out on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east–west Chui Avenue ([[Chuy Prospekti]]), named after the region's [[Chu River|main river]]. In the Soviet era, it was called [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] Avenue. Along or near it are many of the most important government buildings and  universities.  These include the [[Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] compound. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as [[Deng Xiaoping]] Avenue.

The main north–south street is [[Yusup Abdrakhmanov]] Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centers are located along it, and in the north it provides access to [[Dordoy Bazaar]].

Erkindik (&quot;Freedom&quot;) Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard,  named after a Communist revolutionary, [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.

An important east–west street is Jibek Jolu ('[[Silk Road]]'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about {{convert|1|mi|km|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} north of it, and is part of the main east–west road of [[Chuy Region|Chui Province]]. Both the eastern and western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.

There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). It is the only Catholic cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-kyrgyzstan.org/ Catholic Church in Kyrgyzstan]. Catholic-kyrgyzstan.org. Retrieved 11 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a Stadium after Dolon Omurzakov located near centre of Bishkek. This is a largest stadium in Kyrgyz Republic.

===City centre===
[[File:Bishkek square.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ala-Too Square]], {{nowrap|Bishkek's main square}}]]
* State Historical Museum, located in [[Ala-Too Square]], the main city square
* State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of traditional Kyrgyz [[handicraft]]s
* Frunze House Museum
* Statue of [[Ivan Panfilov]] in the park near the [[White House, Bishkek|White House]].
* An [[equestrian statue]] of [[Mikhail Frunze]] stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station.
* The train station was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station.
* The main government building, the White House, is a huge, seven story marble block and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]
* At Ala-Too Square there is an independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched.
*[[Osh Bazaar|Osh bazaar]], west of the city centre, is a large, picturesque produce market
*[[Kyrgyz National Philharmonic]], concert hall

===Outer neighbourhoods===
The [[Dordoy Bazaar]], just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market.

===Outside the city===
The [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too Range|Kyrgyz Ala-Too mountain range]], some {{convert|40|km}} away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the [[Ala Archa National Park]] is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away.

===Distances===
Bishkek is about 300&amp;nbsp;km away directly from the country's second city [[Osh]]. However its nearest large city is [[Almaty]] of Kazakhstan, which is 190&amp;nbsp;km to the east. Furthermore, it is 470&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tashkent]] (Uzbekistan), 680&amp;nbsp;km from [[Dushanbe]] (Tajikistan), and about 1000&amp;nbsp;km each from [[Nur-Sultan]] (Kazakhstan), [[Ürümqi]] (China), [[Islamabad]] (Pakistan), and [[Kabul]] (Afghanistan).

===Climate===
Bishkek has a Mediterranean-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dsa''.), as the average mean temperature in the winter is below 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Asia_Koppen_Map.png |title=Koppen Map |publisher=Upload.wikimedia.org |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is around {{convert|440|mm}} per year. Average daily high temperatures range from {{convert|3|°C|1}} in January to about {{convert|31|°C|1}} during July.&lt;ref name = Pogoda /&gt; The summer months are dominated by dry periods, punctuated by the occasional [[thunderstorm]], which produces strong gusty winds and rare [[dust storm]]s. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary and protection from much of the damaging weather, as does the smaller mountain chain which runs north-west to south-east. In the winter months, sparse [[Winter storm|snow storms]] and frequent heavy [[fog]] are the dominating features. There are sometimes temperature inversions, during which the fog can last for days at a time.

==Demographics==
Bishkek is the most populated city in Kyrgyzstan. Its population, estimated in 2019, was 1,012,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/Kyrgyzstan.html|title=Kyrgyzstan: Regions, Major Cities, Towns &amp; Urban Settlements - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information|website=citypopulation.de|access-date=2019-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the foundation of the city to the mid-1990s, ethnic Russians and other peoples of European descent (Ukrainians, Germans) comprised the majority of the city's population. According to the 1970 census, the ethnic Kyrgyz were only 12.3%, while Europeans comprised more than 80% of Frunze population. Now Bishkek is a predominantly Kyrgyz city, with around 66% of its residents Kyrgyz, while European peoples make up less than 20% of the population. Despite this fact, Russian is the main language while Kyrgyz continues losing ground especially among the younger generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferdinand and Komlósi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/27246121 |title=Ferdinand, S. &amp; Komlósi, F. 2016.

==Ecology and environment==

===Air quality===
Emissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;meteo.ktnet.kg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=11&amp;lang=ru |title=Анализ загрязнения атмосферы |publisher=Nature.kg |date= |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among all cities in Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest, occasionally exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.kg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=11&amp;lang=ru Web-site of the State Agency on Environment Protection and Forestry: Assessment of Air Pollution]. Meteo.ktnet.kg. Retrieved on 11 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, concentrations of [[formaldehyde]] occasionally exceed maximum allowable limits by a factor of four.

Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies with the Kyrgyz State Agency of Hydrometeorology. There are seven air quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde and [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meteo.ktnet.kg&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:E7919-Dordoy-Bazaar-clothing.jpg|thumb|[[Dordoy Bazaar]]]]
Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the [[Kyrgyzstani som|som]]. The som's value fluctuates regularly, but averaged around 61 som per U.S. dollar as of February 2015. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural, and agricultural products are sometimes bartered in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In most of the downtown area there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. Sought after goods include hand-crafted artisan pieces, such as statues, carvings, paintings and many nature-based sculptures.

=== Housing ===
As with many cities in Post-Soviet states, housing in Bishkek has undergone extensive changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While housing was formerly distributed to citizens in the Soviet-era, housing in Bishkek has since become privatized.

Though single family houses are slowly becoming more popular, the majority of the residents live in Soviet-era apartments. Despite the Kyrgyz economy experiencing growth, increases in available housing has been slow with very little new construction. As a result of this growing prosperity and the lack of new formal housing, prices have been rising significantly – doubling from 2001 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roseman|first=Gary|title=The Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan|journal=Real Estate Issues|volume=Summer 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those unable to afford the high price of housing within Bishkek, notably internal migrants from rural villages and small provincial towns often have to resort to informal [[squatter]] settlements on the outskirts of the city. These settlements are estimated to house 400,000 people or about 30 percent of Bishkek's population. While many of the settlements have lacked basic necessities such as electricity and running water, recently there has been a push by the local government to provide these services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Isabaeva|first=Eliza|title=Migration into the &quot;Illegality&quot; and Coping with Difficulties in a Squatter Settlement in Bishkek|journal=Zeitschrift für Ethnologie|volume=138 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
Local government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office.  [[Askarbek Salymbekov]] was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, after which his deputy, [[Arstanbek Nogoev]], took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister [[Daniar Usenov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182916&amp;Itemid=7|publisher=The Times of Central Asia|title=New mayor of Bishkek promises to solve capital's problems|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080619111339/http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=182916&amp;Itemid=7 |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503|journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|volume=4|issue=190|last=Marat|first=Erica|title=Upcoming referendum sinks Kyrgyzstan deeper into crisis|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022122621/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503 |archivedate = 22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kyrgyz capital gets new mayor |url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20 |publisher=Radio Free Europe |date=22 August 2005 |accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605073147/http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways [[Nariman Tuleyev]] was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010.

===Administrative divisions===
Bishkek city covers {{convert|169.6|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}&lt;ref name=&quot;stat09&quot;/&gt; and is administered separately and not part of any region. Besides the city proper, one [[urban-type settlement]] and one village are administered by the city: [[Chong-Aryk, Bishkek|Chong-Aryk]] and [[Orto-Say]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stat09&quot;/&gt; The city is divided into 4 districts: [[Birinchi May District, Bishkek|Birinchi May]], [[Lenin District, Bishkek|Lenin]], [[Oktyabr District, Bishkek|Oktyabr]] and [[Sverdlov District, Bishkek|Sverdlov]]. Chong-Aryk and Orto-Say are part of Lenin District.

==Sports==
Bishkek is home to [[Spartak Stadium (Kyrgyzstan)|Spartak]], the largest [[association football|football]] stadium in Kyrgyzstan and the only one eligible to host international matches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120919015326/http://www.the-afc.com/en/member-association-news/central-a-south-asia-news/1924 Corporate Japanese companies to renovate Kyrgyzstan football stadium].

[[File:Bishkek Railway Station.jpg|thumb|[[Bishkek-2 railway station]]]]

===Mass public transport===
Public transportation includes buses, electric [[trolley bus]]es, and public vans (known in Russian as ''[[marshrutka]]''). The first bus and trolley bus services in Bishkek were introduced in 1934 and 1951, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Frunze. City Encyclopedia. | publisher = | date = | url = http://yiv1999.narod.ru/ABC_0040.htm#6300| accessdate = 26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.

The city is considering designing and building a light rail system ({{lang-ru|{{interlanguage link|скоростной трамвай|ru|vertical-align=sup}}}}).

===Commuter and long-distance buses===
There are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibuses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]], [[Tokmok]], [[Kemin]], [[Issyk Ata]], or the [[Korday]] border crossing.

Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to [[Almaty]] (the largest city in neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]) and [[Kashgar]], China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller number run from the Eastern Station.

The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibuses to suburban towns in all directions (from [[Sokuluk]] in the west to [[Tokmok|Tokmak]] in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia.

===Rail===
{{As of|2007}}, the [[Bishkek-2 railway station]] sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.

There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia ([[Novosibirsk]] and [[Novokuznetsk]]), via [[Almaty]], over the [[Turksib]] route, and to [[Yekaterinburg]] (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via [[Nur-Sultan]]. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a {{convert|100|km}} before they enter the main [[Turksib]] line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the [[Shu, Jambyl|Shu]] junction—a distance of some {{convert|269|km}} by rail, and less than half of that by road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poezda.net/ru/train_timetable?st_code=2708000&amp;order=&amp;forDate=3 |title=Маршрут поезда ????? – ????? на сайте |publisher=Poezda.net |date= |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
The city is served by [[Manas International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] code FRU), located approximately {{convert|25|km}} northwest of the city centre, and readily reachable by taxi.

In 2002, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an [[Manas Air Base|air base]] for its military operations in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own ([[Kant (air base)|Kant Air Base]]) near [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]], some {{convert|20|km}} east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, [[Hosni Mubarak]], later became president of [[Egypt]].
