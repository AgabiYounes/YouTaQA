'''Boone''' is a town in and the [[county seat]] of [[Watauga County, North Carolina|Watauga County]], [[North Carolina]], [[United States]].  Located in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] of western North Carolina, Boone is the home of [[Appalachian State University]].  The population was 17,122 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

The town is named for famous [[American pioneer]] and explorer [[Daniel Boone]], and every summer since 1952 has hosted an outdoor [[amphitheatre]] drama, ''[[Horn in the West]]'', portraying the British settlement of the area during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and featuring the contributions of its namesake.  It is the largest community and the economic hub of the seven-county region of Western North Carolina known as the [[Western North Carolina#High Country|High Country]].

==About==
[[File:Boone NC - aerial.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Boone as seen from [[Howard Knob]]]] Boone took its name from the famous pioneer and explorer [[Daniel Boone]], who on several occasions camped at a site generally agreed to be within the present city limits. Daniel's nephews, Jesse and Jonathan (sons of brother Israel Boone), were members of the town's first church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy of Ministry|url=http://3forksbaptist.org/about-us-pd-6.php|website=Three Forks Baptist Church|accessdate=January 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530060605/http://3forksbaptist.org/about-us-pd-6.php|archive-date=May 30, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three Forks Baptist, still in existence today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arthur|first1=John Preston|title=A History of Watauga County, North Carolina|date=1915|publisher=Everett Waddey Co.|location=Richmond|page=30|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofwataug00arth#page/30/mode/2up|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Boone was served by the [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad]] (nicknamed &quot;[[Tweetsie Railroad|Tweetsie]]&quot;) until the flood of 1940.  The flood washed away much of the tracks and it was decided not to replace them.

Boone is the home of [[Appalachian State University]], a constituent member of the [[University of North Carolina]].
Appalachian State is the sixth largest university in the seventeen-campus system.
[[Caldwell Community College &amp; Technical Institute]] also operates a satellite campus in Boone.

&quot;''[[Horn in the West]]''&quot; is a dramatization of the life and times of the early settlers of the mountain area. It features Daniel Boone as one of its characters, and has been performed in an outdoor [[amphitheater]] near the town every summer since 1952.
The original actor in the role of &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; was [[Ned Austin]]. His &quot;Hollywood Star&quot; stands on a pedestal on King Street in downtown Boone.  He was followed in the role by Glenn Causey, who portrayed the rugged frontiersman for 41 years, and whose image is still seen in many of the depictions of Boone featured in the area today.

Boone is notable for being home to the Junaluska community. Located in the hills just north of Downtown Boone, a free black community has existed in the area since before the Civil War. Although integration in the mid-20th century led to many of the businesses in the neighborhood closing in favor of their downtown counterparts, descendants of the original inhabitants still live in the neighborhood. Junaluska is also home to one of the few majority-African American [[Mennonite Brethren]] congregations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ourstate.com/junaluska/&lt;/ref&gt;

Boone is a center for [[bluegrass music]]ians and [[Appalachia]]n [[storytelling|storytellers]]. Notable artists associated with Boone include the late, [[Grammy|Grammy Award-winning]] bluegrass guitar player [[Doc Watson]] and the late guitarist [[Michael Houser]], founding member of and lead guitarist for the band [[Widespread Panic]], both Boone natives, as well as [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], [[The Blue Rags]], and [[Eric Church]].

The [[Blair Farm]], [[Daniel Boone Hotel (Boone, North Carolina)|Daniel Boone Hotel]], [[Jones House (Boone, North Carolina)|Jones House]], [[John Smith Miller House]], and [[United States Post Office (Boone, North Carolina)|US Post Office-Boone]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and climate==
Boone is located at {{Coord|36|12|41|N|81|40|7|W|type:city}} (36.211364, −81.668657)&lt;ref name=&quot;GR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an elevation of 3,333 feet (1015.9 m) above sea level. An earlier survey gave the elevation as 3,332&amp;nbsp;ft and since then it has been published as having an elevation of 3,333&amp;nbsp;ft (1,016 m). Boone has the highest elevation of any town of its size (over 10,000 population) east of the [[Mississippi River]]. As such, Boone features, depending on the [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] used, a [[humid continental climate]] (Köppen ''Dfb''), a rarity for the Southeastern United States, bordering on a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cfb'') and straddles the boundary between [[Hardiness zone|USDA Plant Hardiness Zone]]s 6B and 7A;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arborday.org/treeinfo/ZoneInfo.cfm?ZipCode=28607&amp;submit=Look+it+up%21 |title=What is my arborday.org Hardiness Zone? |website=Arborday.org |date= |accessdate=July 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the elevation also results in enhanced precipitation, with {{convert|52.7|in|sigfig=3}} of average annual precipitation. Compared to the lower elevations of the Carolinas, winters are long and cold, with frequent [[Ice pellets|sleet]] and snowfall. The daily average temperature in January is {{convert|31.2|°F|1}},&lt;ref name = NOAA /&gt; which gives Boone a winter climate more similar to coastal southern [[New England]] rather than the Southeast, where a [[humid subtropical]] climate predominates. Blizzard-like conditions are not unusual during many winters. Summers are warm, but far cooler and less humid than lower regions to the south and east, with a July daily average temperature of {{convert|68.5|°F|1}}.&lt;ref name = NOAA /&gt; Boone typically receives on average nearly {{convert|35|in|cm|0}} of snowfall annually, far higher than the lowland areas in the rest of [[North Carolina]].
On January 18, 1966, the temperature fell to {{convert|−18|°F}}.&lt;ref name = wrcc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?nc0977|title=BOONE, NORTH CAROLINA – Climate Summary|website=wrcc.dri.edu|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Industrial, commercial, and residential development in the town of Boone is a controversial issue due to its location in the mountains of Appalachia.  On October 16, 2009, the town council accepted the &quot;Boone 2030 Land Use Plan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boone2030.blogspot.com/ |title=Boone2030Blogspot |publisher=TownOfBoone |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the document itself is not in any way actual law, it is used by the town council, board of adjustment, and other committees to guide decision making as to what types of development are appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelawrencegroup.com/boone2030/finalDocs/BooneReportFinalBook110609.pdf |title=Boone 2030 Land Use Plan PDF |publisher=Lawrence Group |accessdate=October 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717005559/http://www.thelawrencegroup.com/boone2030/finalDocs/BooneReportFinalBook110609.pdf |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[North Carolina Department of Transportation]] began widening 1.1 miles of U.S. 421 (King Street) to a 4-to-6-lane divided highway with a raised concrete median from U.S. 321 (Hardin Street) to east of N.C. 194 (Jefferson Road), including a new entrance and exit to the new Watauga High School, at a cost of $16.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/us421widening/ |title=NC DOT US421 Widening Project |publisher=NCDOT |accessdate=October 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731134149/http://www.ncdot.gov/projects/US421Widening/ |archive-date=July 31, 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The widening has displaced 25 businesses and 63 residences east of historic downtown King Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wataugademocrat.com/2007/0312web/statedotpaves.php |title=statedotpaves |publisher=Wataugademocrat.com |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120918112026/http://www.wataugademocrat.com/2007/0312web/statedotpaves.php |archivedate=September 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was slated to be completed by December 31, 2011, but construction continued into the spring of 2012.
