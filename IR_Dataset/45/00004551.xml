'''Babur''' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|بابر}}|lit= tiger|translit= Bābur}};{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Dale2004&quot; /&gt; 14 February 1483{{spaced ndash}}26 December 1530), born '''Zahīr ud-Dīn Muhammad''', was the founder and first Emperor ({{reign | 1526 | 1530}}) of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He was a direct descendant of Amir [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) from what is now [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor&quot;&gt;F. Lehmann: [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/babor-zahir-al-din Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor]. In Encyclopædia Iranica. Online Ed. December 1988 (updated August 2011). &quot;Bābor, Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad (6 Moḥarram 886-6 Jomādā I 937/14 February 1483&amp;nbsp;– 26 December 1530), [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] prince, military genius, and literary craftsman who escaped the bloody political arena of his Central Asian birthplace to found the Mughal Empire in India. His origin, milieu, training, and education were steeped in [[Muslim]] culture and so Bābor played significant role for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Islam in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and [[historiographical]] results.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert L. Canfield 1991 p.20&quot;&gt;Robert L. Canfield, Robert L. (1991). ''Turko-Persia in historical perspective'', Cambridge University Press, p. 20. &quot;The Mughals-Persianized Turks who invaded from Central Asia and claimed descent from both Timur and Genghis&amp;nbsp;– strengthened the Persianate culture of Muslim India&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babur was born in [[Andijan]] in the [[Fergana Valley]] (in present-day Uzbekistan): the eldest son of [[Umar Sheikh Mirza]] (1456–1494, governor of [[Fergana]] from 1469 to 1494) and a great-great grandson of Timur (1336-1405). Babur ascended the throne of Fergana in its capital [[Akhsikent]] in 1494 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion. He conquered [[Samarkand]] two years later, only to lose Fergana soon after. In his attempt to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501 his attempt to recapture both the regions failed when [[Muhammad Shaybani Khan]] defeated him. In 1504 he conquered [[Kabul]], which was under the putative rule of Abdur Razaq Mirza, the infant heir of [[Ulugh Beg II]]. Babur formed a partnership with the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] ruler [[Ismail I]] and reconquered parts of [[Turkistan]], including Samarkand, only to again lose it and the other newly-conquered lands to the [[Shaybanids|Sheybanids]].

After losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur turned his attention to India. At that time, the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the Afghan [[Lodi dynasty]], whereas [[Rajputana]] was ruled by a Hindu [[Rajput| Rajput Confederacy]], led by [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]]. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526 CE and founded the Mughal empire. He faced opposition from [[Rana Sanga]], who at first promised to help Babur defeat Ibrahim Lodi; however he later backed out upon realising that Babur had plans to stay in India. The Rana prepared an army of [[Rajputs]] and [[Afghan]]s to force Babur out of India, however the Rana was defeated in the [[Battle of Khanwa]] (1527) after which he was poisoned to death (1528) by his own men.&lt;ref&gt;Satish Chandra, 2006, pp=32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Babur married several times. Notable among his sons are [[Humayun]], [[Kamran Mirza]] and [[Hindal Mirza]]. Babur died in 1530 in [[Agra]] and Humayun succeeded him. Babur was first buried in Agra but, as per his wishes, his remains were moved to Kabul and reburied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Necipoğlu&quot; /&gt;  As a patrilineal descendant of Timur, Babur considered himself a Timurid and [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards1995&quot;&gt;

He ranks as a national hero in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. Many of his poems have become popular folk songs. He wrote the ''[[Baburnama]]'' in [[Chaghatai Turkic]]; it was translated into Persian during the reign (1556-1605) of his grandson, the Emperor [[Akbar]].

== Name ==
''Ẓahīr-ud-Dīn'' is [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; (of [[Islam]]), and ''[[Muhammad]]'' honours the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]].

The difficulty of pronouncing the name for his Central Asian Turco-Mongol army may have been responsible for the greater popularity of his nickname Babur,{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=18–20}} also variously spelled '''Baber''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} '''Babar''',{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} and '''Bābor'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ẓahīr-al-Dīn Moḥammad Bābor&quot;/&gt; The name is generally taken in reference to the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''babr'', meaning &quot;tiger&quot;.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Dale2004&quot; /&gt; The word repeatedly appears in [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]'' and was borrowed into the [[Turkic languages]] of Central Asia.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Thumb, Albert, ''Handbuch des Sanskrit, mit Texten und Glossar'', German original, ed.

Babur bore the royal titles ''[[Padshah|Badshah]]'' and ''al-ṣultānu 'l-ʿazam wa 'l-ḫāqān al-mukkarram pādshāh-e [[ghazi (warrior)|ġāzī]]''. He and later [[Mughal emperors]] used the title of ''[[Mirza]]'' and ''[[Mughal Empire#Name|Gurkani]]'' as regalia.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Babur's memoirs form the main source for details of his life. They are known as the ''[[Baburnama]]'' and were written in [[Chaghatai language|Chaghatai Turkic]], his mother-tongue,&lt;ref name=&quot;Babur Nama&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Babur Nama: Journal of Emperor Babur|year=2006|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] India|location=Mumbai|isbn=978-0-14-400149-1|page=xviii|author=Dilip Hiro|authorlink=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VW2HJL689wgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ISBN9780144001491#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; though, according to Dale, &quot;his Turkic prose is highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology or word formation and vocabulary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dale2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen Frederic |last=Dale |title=The garden of the eight paradises: Bābur and the culture of Empire in Central Asia, Afghanistan and India (1483–1530) |publisher=Brill |year=2004 |pages=15, 150 |isbn=90-04-13707-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Baburnama'' was translated into Persian during the rule of Babur's grandson Akbar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babur Nama&quot; /&gt;

Babur was born on 14 February 1483 in the city of [[Andijan]], [[Andijan Province]], [[Fergana Valley]], contemporary Uzbekistan. He was the eldest son of [[Umar Sheikh Mirza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=On the occasion of the birth of Babar Padishah (the son of Omar Shaikh) |url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/rash1.html |title=Mirza Muhammad Haidar |publisher=University of Washington |work=Silk Road Seattle |access-date=7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ruler of the Fergana Valley, the son of [[Abu Sa'id (Timurid dynasty)|Abū Saʿīd Mirza]] (and grandson of [[Miran Shah]], who was himself son of [[Timur]]) and his wife [[Qutlugh Nigar Khanum]], daughter of [[Yunus Khan]], the ruler of [[Moghulistan]] (and great-great grandson of [[Tughlugh Timur]], the son of [[Esen Buqa I]], who was the great-great-great grandson of [[Chaghatai Khan]], the second-born son of [[Genghis Khan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Babur|title=Babur Nama|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-400149-1|page=vii|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babur hailed from the Barlas tribe, which was of [[Mongol]] origin and had embraced [[Turkic people|Turkic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Babur |title=Bābur (Mughal emperor) |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Persian culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot; /&gt; They had also converted to Islam centuries earlier and resided in [[Turkestan]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. Aside from the Chaghatai language, Babur was equally fluent in Persian, the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Timurid elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Iran/The-Timurids-and-Turkmen |title=Iran: The Timurids and Turkmen |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Babur, though nominally a Mongol (or ''Moghul'' in Persian language), drew much of his support from the local Turkic and Iranian people of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup. It included [[Persian people|Persians]] (known to Babur as &quot;[[Sart]]s&quot; and &quot;[[Tājik people|Tajiks]]&quot;), [[Pashtun people|ethnic Afghans]], [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Arabs]], as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turko-Mongols from Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Central Asia in Historical Perspective |last=Manz |first=Beatrice Forbes |chapter=The Symbiosis of Turk and Tajik |publisher=Boulder, Colorado &amp; Oxford |year=1994 |page=58 |isbn=0-8133-3638-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ruler of Central Asia ==

=== As ruler of Fergana ===
In 1494, eleven-year-old Babur became the ruler of Fergana, in present-day Uzbekistan, after Umar Sheikh Mirza died &quot;while tending pigeons in an ill-constructed dovecote that toppled into the ravine below the palace&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Babur, the first Moghul emperor: Wine and tulips in Kabul |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17723207 |magazine=The Economist |date=16 December 2010 |pages=80–82 |accessdate = 12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, two of his uncles from the neighbouring kingdoms, who were hostile to his father, and a group of nobles who wanted his younger brother Jahangir to be the ruler, threatened his succession to the throne.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=18–20}} His uncles were relentless in their attempts to dislodge him from this position as well as from many of his other territorial possessions to come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Domesticity and Power in the Early Mughal World |last=Lal |first=Ruby |isbn=0-521-85022-3 |date=25 September 2005 |page=69 |quote=It was over these possessions, provinces controlled by uncles, or cousins of varying degrees, that Babur fought with close and distant relatives for much of his life.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babur was able to secure his throne mainly because of help from his maternal grandmother, [[Aisan Daulat Begum]], although there was also some luck involved.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=18–20}}

Most territories around his kingdom were ruled by his relatives, who were descendants of either Timur or Genghis Khan, and were constantly in conflict.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=18–20}} At that time, rival princes were fighting over the city of Samarkand to the west, which was ruled by his paternal cousin.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Babur had a great ambition to capture the city.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In 1497, he [[Siege of Samarkand (1497)|besieged Samarkand]] for seven months before eventually gaining control over it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Ewans |first=Martin |date=September 2002 |title=Afghanistan: A Short History of Its People and Politics |url=https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00mart |url-access=registration |publisher=HarperCollins |pages=[https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00mart/page/26 26]–27 |isbn=0-06-050508-7 |quote=Babur, while still in his teens, conceived the ambition of conquering Samarkand. In 1497, after a seven months' siege, he took the city, but his supporters gradually deserted him and Ferghana was taken from him in his absence. Within a few months he was compelled to retire from Samarkand&amp;nbsp;... Eventually he retook Samarkand, but was again forced out, this time by an Usbek leader, Shaibani Khan&amp;nbsp;... Babur decided in 1504 to trek over the Hindu Kush to Kabul, where the current ruler promptly retreated to Kandahar and left him in undisputed control of the city.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fifteen years old and for him the campaign was a huge achievement.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=18–20}} Babur was able to hold the city despite desertions in his army, but he later fell seriously ill.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Meanwhile, a rebellion back home, approximately {{convert|350|km|mi}} away, amongst nobles who favoured his brother, robbed him of Fergana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan&quot; /&gt; As he was marching to recover it, he lost Samarkand to a rival prince, leaving him with neither.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=18–20}} He had held Samarkand for 100 days, and he considered this defeat as his biggest loss, obsessing over it even later in his life after his conquests in India.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=18–20}}

For three years, Babur concentrated on building a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of [[Badakhshan]] in particular. In 1500-1501, he again laid [[Siege of Samarkand (1501)|siege to Samarkand]], and indeed he took the city briefly, but he was in turn besieged by his most formidable rival, [[Muhammad Shaybani]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/babur/babur1.html |quote=After being driven out of Samarkand in 1501 by the Uzbek Shaibanids&amp;nbsp;... |title=The Memoirs of Babur |access-date=8 November 2006 |publisher=University of Washington |work=Silk Road Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation became such that Babar was compelled to give his sister, Khanzada, to Shaybani in marriage as part of the peace settlement. Only after this were Babur and his troops allowed to depart the city in safety. Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was thus lost again. He then tried to reclaim Fergana, but lost the battle there also and, escaping with a small band of followers, he wandered the mountains of central Asia and took refuge with hill tribes. By 1502, he had resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana; he was left with nothing and was forced to try his luck elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;VDM0&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mahajan|first=V.D.|title=History of medieval India|year=2007|publisher=S Chand|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-219-0364-6|edition=10th|pages=428–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=21–23}} He finally went to [[Tashkent]], which was ruled by his maternal uncle, but he found himself less than welcome there. Babur wrote, &quot;During my stay in Tashkent, I endured much poverty and humiliation. No country, or hope of one!&quot;{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=21–23}} Thus, during the ten years since becoming the ruler of Fergana, Babur suffered many short-lived victories and was without shelter and in exile, aided by friends and peasants.

=== At Kabul ===
[[File:Coin of Babur, as ruler of Kabul.jpg|thumb|right|Coin minted by Babur during his time as ruler of [[Kabul]]. Dated 1507/8]]
Kabul was ruled by Babur's paternal uncle [[Ulugh Beg II]], who died leaving only an infant as heir.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=21–23}} The city was then claimed by Mukin Begh, who was considered to be a usurper and was opposed by the local populace. In 1504, Babur was able to cross the snowy [[Hindu Kush]] mountains and [[Siege of Kabul (1504)|capture Kabul]] from the remaining Arghunids, who were forced to retreat to [[Kandahar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan&quot; /&gt;  With this move, he gained a new kingdom, re-established his fortunes and would remain its ruler until 1526.&lt;ref name=&quot;VDM0&quot; /&gt; In 1505, because of the low revenue generated by his new mountain kingdom, Babur began his first expedition to India; in his memoirs, he wrote, &quot;My desire for Hindustan had been constant. It was in the month of Shaban, the Sun being in Aquarius, that we rode out of Kabul for Hindustan&quot;. It was a brief raid across the [[Khyber Pass]].{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=21–23}}

In the same year, Babur united with [[Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah]] of [[Herat]], a fellow Timurid and distant relative, against their common enemy, the Uzbek Shaybani.&lt;ref name=&quot;perspect&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Perspectives on Persian Painting: Illustrations to Amir Khusrau's Khamsah |last=Brend |first=Barbara |date=20 December 2002 |isbn=0-7007-1467-7 |publisher=Routledge (UK) |page=188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this venture did not take place because Husayn Mirza died in 1506 and his two sons were reluctant to go to war.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=21–23}} Babur instead stayed at Herat after being invited by the two Mirza brothers. It was then the cultural capital of the eastern Muslim world. Though he was disgusted by the vices and luxuries of the city,{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=24–26}} he marvelled at the intellectual abundance there, which he stated was &quot;filled with learned and matched men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sewing Circles of Herat: A Personal Voyage Through Afghanistan |last=Lamb |first=Christina |page=[https://archive.org/details/sewingcirclesofh00chri/page/153 153] |isbn=0-06-050527-3 |publisher=HarperCollins |date=February 2004 |url=https://archive.org/details/sewingcirclesofh00chri/page/153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became acquainted with the work of the Chagatai poet [[Mir Ali Shir Nava'i]], who encouraged the use of Chagatai as a [[literary language]]. Nava'i's proficiency with the language, which he is credited with founding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time |last=Hickmann |first=William C. |date=19 October 1992 |isbn=0-691-01078-1 |page=473 |quote=Eastern Turk Mir Ali Shir Neva'i (1441–1501), founder of the Chagatai literary language}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have influenced Babur in his decision to use it for his memoirs. He spent two months there before being forced to leave because of diminishing resources;&lt;ref name=&quot;perspect&quot; /&gt; it later was overrun by Shaybani and the Mirzas fled.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=24–26}}

Babur became the only reigning ruler of the Timurid dynasty after the loss of Herat, and many princes sought refuge with him at Kabul because of Shaybani's invasion in the west.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=24–26}} He thus assumed the title of ''[[Padshah]]'' (emperor) among the Timurids—though this title was insignificant since most of his ancestral lands were taken, Kabul itself was in danger and Shaybani continued to be a threat.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=24–26}} Babur prevailed during a potential rebellion in Kabul, but two years later a revolt among some of his leading generals drove him out of Kabul. Escaping with very few companions, Babur soon returned to the city, capturing Kabul again and regaining the allegiance of the rebels. Meanwhile, Shaybani was defeated and killed by [[Ismail I]], Shah of [[Shia]] Safavid Persia, in 1510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |last=Doniger |first=Wendy |isbn=0-87779-044-2 |date=September 1999 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440/page/539 539] |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780877790440/page/539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babur and the remaining Timurids used this opportunity to reconquer their ancestral territories. Over the following few years, Babur and Shah Ismail formed a partnership in an attempt to take over parts of Central Asia.

The [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] army led by [[Najm-e Sani]] massacred civilians in Central Asia and then sought the assistance of Babur, who advised the Safavids to withdraw. The Safavids, however, refused and were defeated during the [[Battle of Ghazdewan]] by the warlord Ubaydullah Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stuart Cary Welch|title=The Emperors' Album: Images of Mughal India|publisher=Metroplitian Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-87099-499-9|page=33|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Babur's early relations with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] were poor because the Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Selim I]] provided his rival Ubaydullah Khan with powerful [[matchlock]]s and [[cannon]]s. In 1507, when ordered to accept Selim I as his rightful [[suzerainty|suzerain]], Babur refused and gathered [[Qizilbash]] servicemen in order to counter the forces of Ubaydullah Khan during the Battle of Ghazdewan. In 1513, Selim I reconciled with Babur (fearing that he would join the Safavids), dispatched [[Ustad Ali Quli]] the artilleryman and [[Mustafa Rumi]] the matchlock marksman, and many other Ottoman Turks, in order to assist Babur in his conquests; this particular assistance proved to be the basis of future Mughal-Ottoman relations.&lt;ref name=Farooqi2008&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uB1uAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ubaydullah+Khan#search_anchor |title=Mughal-Ottoman relations: a study of political &amp; diplomatic relations&amp;nbsp;... |first=Naimur Rahman |last=Farooqi |publisher= |year=2008 |access-date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From them, he also adopted the tactic of using matchlocks and cannons in field (rather than only in [[siege]]s), which would give him an important advantage in India.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27–29}}

Babur still wanted to escape from the Uzbeks, and he chose India as a refuge instead of [[Badakhshan]], which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, &quot;In the presence of such power and potency, we had to think of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space between us and the strong foeman.&quot;{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27–29}} After his third loss of Samarkand, Babur gave full attention to the conquest of North India, launching a campaign; he reached the [[Chenab River]], now in [[Pakistan]], in 1519.&lt;ref name=&quot;VDM0&quot; /&gt; Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to [[Punjab region|Punjab]], mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27–29}} At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors.

Babur started for Lahore, Punjab, in 1524 but found that Daulat Khan Lodi had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim Lodi.&lt;ref&gt;Satish Chandra, ''Medieval India:From Sultanat to the Mughals'', Vol. 2, (Har-Anand, 2009), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; When Babur arrived at Lahore, the Lodi army marched out and his army was routed.

In response, Babur supplied Alam Khan with troops who later joined up with Daulat Khan Lodi, and together with about 30,000 troops, they besieged Ibrahim Lodi at Delhi.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Chandra|2009|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He easily defeated and drove off Alam's army and Babur realised Lodi would not allow him to occupy the Punjab.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

In November 1525 Babur got news at [[Peshawar]] that Daulat Khan Lodi had switched sides, and he drove out Ala-ud-Din.{{clarify|reason=who drove out Ala-ud-Din? Babur or Lodi?|date=June 2015}} Babur then marched onto Lahore to confront Daulat Khan Lodi, only to see Daulat's army melt away at their approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;VDM0&quot; /&gt; Daulat surrendered and was pardoned. Thus within three weeks of crossing the [[Indus River]] Babur had become the master of Punjab.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Babur marched on to Delhi via Sirhind. He reached [[Panipat]] on 20 April 1526 and there met Ibrahim Lodi's numerically superior army of about 100,000 soldiers and 100 elephants.&lt;ref name=&quot;VDM0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RSCHMI&quot; /&gt; In the battle that began on the following day, Babur used the tactic of ''Tulugma'', encircling Ibrahim Lodi's army and forcing it to face artillery fire directly, as well as frightening its war elephants.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSCHMI&quot; /&gt; Ibrahim Lodi died during the battle, thus ending the Lodi dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;VDM0&quot; /&gt;

Babur wrote in his memoirs about his victory:

{{Quote|By the grace of the Almighty God, this difficult task was made easy to me and that mighty army, in the space of a half a day was laid in dust.&lt;ref name=&quot;VDM0&quot; /&gt;}}

After the battle, Babur occupied Delhi and Agra, took the throne of Lodi, and laid the foundation for the eventual rise of Mughal rule in India. However, before he became North India's ruler, he had to fend off challengers, such as Rana Sanga.&lt;ref name=&quot;VDM1&quot;&gt;{{harvtxt|Mahajan|2007|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Khanwa ===
{{Main|Battle of Khanwa}}
[[File:Babur visiting the Urvah valley in Gwalior 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Babur encounters the Jain statues at the [[Siddhachal Caves|Urvah valley]] in [[Gwalior]] in 1527. He ordered them to be destroyed&lt;ref&gt;Gwalior Fort: Rock Sculptures, A Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, pages 364-370&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Battle of Khanwa was fought between Babur and the Rajput ruler Rana Sanga on 17 March 1527. [[Rana Sanga]] wanted to overthrow Babur, whom he considered to be a foreigner ruling in India, and also to extend the Rajput territories by annexing [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]]. He was supported by Afghan chiefs who felt Babur had been deceptive by refusing to fulfil promises made to them. Upon receiving news of Rana Sangha's advance towards Agra, Babur took a defensive position at [[Khanwa]] (currently in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]), from where he hoped to launch a counterattack later. According to K.V. Krishna Rao, Babur won the battle because of his &quot;superior generalship&quot; and modern tactics: the battle was one of the first in India that featured cannons. Rao also notes that Rana Sanga faced &quot;treachery&quot; when the Hindu chief [[Silhadi]] joined Babur's army with a garrison of 6,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rao&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=K.

=== Battle of Chanderi ===
This battle took place in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. On receiving news that Rana Sanga had made preparations to renew the conflict with him, Babur decided to isolate the Rana by inflicting a military defeat on one of his staunchest allies, [[Medini Rai]], who was the ruler of Malwa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lane-Poole&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Lane-pool |first=Stanley |url=https://archive.org/details/babar035008mbp |title=Babar |pages=182–183 |year=1899|accessdate=12 June 2015|publisher=The Clarendon Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Satish |last=Chandra |title=Medieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206–1526) |volume=2 |publisher=Har-Anand Publications |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2019}}

Upon reaching Chanderi, on 20 January 1528, Babur offered Shamsabad to Medini Rao in exchange for Chanderi as a peace overture, but the offer was rejected.&lt;ref name = &quot;Chandra&quot;/&gt; The outer fortress of Chanderi was taken by Babur's army at night, and the next morning the upper fort was captured. Babur himself expressed surprise that the upper fort had fallen within an hour of the final assault.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lane-Poole&quot;/&gt; Medini Rai organized a [[Jauhar]] ceremony during which women and children within the fortress [[immolated]] themselves.&lt;ref name =&quot;Lane-Poole&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Chandra&quot;/&gt; A small number of soldiers also collected in Medini Rao's house and proceeded to kill each other in collective suicide. This sacrifice does not seem to have impressed Babur who does not express a word of admiration for the enemy in his autobiography.&lt;ref name = &quot;Lane-Poole&quot;/&gt;
==Religious persecution==
[[Babur]] defeated and killed [[Ibrahim Lodi]], the last Sultan of the [[Lodi dynasty]], in 1526. Babur ruled for 4 years and was succeeded by his son [[Humayun]] whose reign was temporarily usurped by [[Suri dynasty]]. During their 30-year rule, religious violence continued in India. Records of the violence and trauma, from Sikh-Muslim perspective, include those recorded in [[Sikh]] literature of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=johnhinnells&gt;John Hinnells and Richard King (2006), Religion and Violence in South Asia: Theory and Practice, {{ISBN|978-0415372916}}, pp. 101–114&lt;/ref&gt; The violence of Babur, the father of Humayun, in the 1520s, was witnessed by Guru Nanak, who commented upon them in four hymns. Historians suggest the early Mughal era period of religious violence contributed to introspection and then transformation from pacifism to militancy for self-defense in Sikhism.&lt;ref name=johnhinnells/&gt; According to autobiographical historical record of Emperor Babur, ''Tuzak-i Babari'', Babur's campaign in northwest India targeted Hindu and Sikh pagans as well as apostates (non-Sunni sects of Islam), and immense number of infidels were killed, with Muslim camps building &quot;towers of skulls of the infidels&quot; on hillocks.&lt;ref&gt;Tuzak-i Babari: The Autobiography of Babur, Republished in 2006 as: {{ISBN|978-9693518733}}, Translators: Elliot and Dowson&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baburnama]], similarly records massacre of Hindu villages and towns by Babur's Muslim army, in addition to numerous deaths of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers in the battlefields.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Susannah Beveridge, [https://archive.org/stream/baburnamainengli02babuuoft#page/478/mode/2up Babur-nama] Volume 2, page 478-479; and [https://archive.org/stream/baburnamainengli02babuuoft#page/562/mode/2up Religious war and the massacres of 1526–1527] at pp. 562–578&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and relationships ==
There are no descriptions about Babur's physical appearance, except from the paintings in the translation of the ''Baburnama'' prepared during the reign of [[Akbar]].{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=21–23}} In his autobiography, Babur claimed to be strong and physically fit, and that he had swum across every major river he encountered, including twice across the [[Ganges River]] in [[North India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elliot |first=Henry Miers |others=John Dowson (ed.) |title=The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians |chapter=The Muhammadan Period |chapterurl=http://persian.packhum.org/persian//pf?file=80201014&amp;ct=56 |access-date=2 April 2008 |date=1867–1877 |publisher=Trubner |location=London |quote=...&amp;nbsp;and on the same journey, he swam twice across the Ganges, as he said he had done with every other river he had met with. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his father, he had [[:wikt:ascetic|ascetic]] tendencies and did not have any great interest in women. In his first marriage, he was &quot;bashful&quot; towards [[Aisha Sultan Begum]], later losing his affection for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D03501050%26ct%3D0 |title=Memoirs of Zehīr-ed-Dīn Muhammed Bābur Emperor of Hindustan, Written by himself, in the Chaghatāi Tūrki |others=Translated by John Leyden and William Erskine, Annotated and Revised by Lucas King |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1921 |chapter=The Memoirs of Babur, Volume 1, chpt. 71 |chapterurl=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D03501051%26ct%3D70%26rqs%3D187%26rqs%3D196 |quote=Āisha Sultan Begum, the daughter of Sultan Ahmed Mirza, to whom I had been betrothed in the lifetime of my father and uncle, having arrived in [[Khujand]], I now married her, in the month of Shābān.

My affection afterwards declined, and my shyness increased; in so much, that my mother the Khanum, used to fall upon me and scold me with great fury, sending me off like a criminal to visit her once in a month or forty days. |access-date=2 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205161213/http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D03501050%26ct%3D0 |archive-date=5 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Babur showed similar shyness in his interactions with Baburi, a boy in his camp with whom he had an infatuation around this time, reccounting that: &quot;Occasionally Baburi came to me, but I was so bashful that I could not look him in the face, much less converse freely with him. In my excitement and agitation I could not thank him for coming, much less complain of his leaving. Who could bear to demand the ceremonies of fealty?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Babur, Emperor of Hindustan|2002|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Babur acquired several more wives and concubines over the years, and as required for a prince, he was able to ensure the continuity of his line.

[[File:Babur crossing the Indus in the heat of battle.jpg|thumb|upright|Babur crossing the [[Indus River]]]]
Babur's first wife, Aisha Sultan Begum, was his paternal cousin, the daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza, his father's brother. She was an infant when betrothed to Babur, who was himself five years old. They married eleven years later, {{circa|1498–99}}. The couple had one daughter, [[Fakhr-un-Nissa]], who died within a year in 1500. Three years later, after Babur's first defeat at Fergana, Aisha left him and returned to her father's household.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babur's wives and children&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Babur Nama:Journal of Emperor Babur|publisher=Penguin|page=362|isbn=978-0-14-400149-1|author=Babur|edition=2006|authorlink=Babur|author2=Dilip Hiro|editor=Dilip Hiro|chapter=Babur's wives and children|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27–29}} In 1504, Babur married Zaynab Sultan Begum, who died childless within two years. In the period 1506–08, Babur married four women, [[Maham Begum]] (in 1506), [[Masuma Sultan Begum]], Gulrukh Begum and Dildar Begum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Babur's wives and children&quot; /&gt; Babur had four children by Maham Begum, of whom only one survived infancy. This was his eldest son and heir, [[Humayun]]. Masuma Sultan Begum died during childbirth; the year of her death is disputed (either 1508 or 1519). Gulrukh bore Babur two sons, [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] and [[Askari Mirza|Askari]], and Dildar Begum was the mother of Babur's youngest son, [[Hindal Mirza|Hindal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Babur's wives and children&quot; /&gt; Babur later married [[Mubaraka Yusufzai]], a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] woman of the [[Yusufzai]] tribe. Gulnar Aghacha and Nargul Aghacha were two [[Circassian beauties|Circassian slaves]] given to Babur as gifts by Tahmasp Shah Safavi, the Shah of Persia. They became &quot;recognized ladies of the royal household.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Babur's wives and children&quot; /&gt;

During his rule in Kabul, when there was a time of relative peace, Babur pursued his interests in literature, art, music and gardening.{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=27–29}} Previously, he never drank alcohol and avoided it when he was in Herat. In Kabul, he first tasted it at the age of thirty. He then began to drink regularly, host wine parties and consume preparations made from [[opium]].{{sfn|Eraly|2007|pp=24–26}} Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: &quot;I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober&quot;. He quit drinking for health reasons before the Battle of Khanwa, just two years before his death, and demanded that his court do the same. But he did not stop chewing narcotic preparations, and did not lose his sense of irony. He wrote, &quot;Everyone regrets drinking and swears an oath (of [[abstinence]]); I swore the oath and regret that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Hugh (2005).

The identity of the mother of one of Babur's daughters, [[Gulrukh Begum]] is disputed. Gulrukh's mother may have been the daughter of [[Sultan Mahmud Mirza]] by his wife Pasha Begum who is referred to as Saliha Sultan Begum in certain secondary sources, however this name is not mentioned in the [[Baburnama]] or the works of [[Gulbadan Begum]], which casts doubt on her existence.

{{Quote|His origin, milieu, training, and culture were steeped in Persian culture and so Babur was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iranica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lehmann |first=F. |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/babor-zahir-al-din |title= Memoirs of Zehīr-ed-Dīn Muhammed Bābur |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |accessdate=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Although all applications of modern Central Asian ethnicities to people of Babur's time are anachronistic, Soviet and Uzbek sources regard Babur as an ethnic Uzbek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

=== Babri Masjid ===
[[Babri Masjid]] (&quot;Babur's Mosque&quot;) in [[Ayodhya]], is said to have been constructed on the orders of [[Mir Baqi]], one of the commanders of his army. In 2003, by the order of an Indian Court, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) was asked to conduct a more in-depth study and an excavation to ascertain the type of structure that was beneath the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ratnagar |first=Shereen |date=April 2004 |title=Archaeology at the Heart of a Political Confrontation: The Case of Ayodhya |url=https://www.asia-europe.uni-heidelberg.de/fileadmin/Documents/Professorships/Visual_and_Media_Anthropology/ForUS/381044.pdf |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=239–59 |doi=10.1086/381044}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was conducted from 12 March 2003 to 7 August 2003, resulting in 1360 discoveries. The ASI submitted its report to the Allahabad high court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/aug/22ayo.htm |title=ASI submits report on Ayodhya excavation |newspaper=Rediff.com |agency=PTI |date=22 August 2003 |access-date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summary of the ASI report indicated the presence of a 10th-century temple under the mosque.&lt;ref name=&quot;trib&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030826/main6.htm | last=Suryamurthy | first=R | title=ASI findings may not resolve title dispute | newspaper=The Tribune | date=26 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050323101829/http://www.the-week.com/23sep07/events1.htm Prasannan, R. (7 September 2003) &quot;Ayodhya: Layers of truth&quot;] ''The Week'' (India), from [[Web Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ASI team said that, human activity at the site dates back to the 13th century BCE. The next few layers date back to the [[Shunga dynasty|Shunga]] period (second-first century BCE) and the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] period. During the early medieval period (11–12th century CE), a huge but short-lived structure of nearly 50 metres north-south orientation was constructed. On the remains of this structure, another massive structure was constructed: this structure had at least three structural phases and three successive floors attached with it. The report concluded that it was over the top of this construction that the disputed structure was constructed during the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/aug/25ayo1.htm |title=Proof of temple found at Ayodhya: ASI report |newspaper=Rediff.com |agency=PTI |date=25 August 2003 |access-date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[K.
