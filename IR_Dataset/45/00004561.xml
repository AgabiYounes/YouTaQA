'''Brian Wilson Aldiss''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|d|ɪ|s}}; 18 August 1925 – 19 August 2017), was an [[English people|English]] writer and [[anthologies|anthology]]-editor, best known for [[science fiction]] novels and short stories. His byline reads either '''Brian W. Aldiss''' or simply '''Brian Aldiss''', except for occasional pseudonyms during the mid-1960s.

Greatly influenced by science fiction pioneer [[H. G. Wells]], Aldiss was a vice-president of the international [[H. G. Wells Society]]. He was (with [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]) co-president of the [[Birmingham Science Fiction Group]]. Aldiss was named a Grand Master by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] in 2000 and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004. He received two [[Hugo Awards]], one [[Nebula Award]], and one [[John W. Campbell Memorial Award]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SFAwards&quot;/&gt; He wrote the short story &quot;[[Supertoys Last All Summer Long]]&quot; (1969), the basis for the [[Stanley Kubrick]]-developed [[Steven Spielberg]] film ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' (2001). Aldiss was associated with the [[New Wave science fiction|British New Wave]] of science fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;scholes-rabkin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1=Robert | last1=Scholes| authorlink1= Robert Scholes| first2 = Eric S.| last2 = Rabkin|title=Science Fiction: History, Science, Vision| url=https://archive.org/details/sciencefictionhi00scho | url-access=registration | publisher=Oxford University Press| location=London|date=1977|chapter=Bibliography I: History and Criticism of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
===Early life, education, and military service===
Aldiss was born on 18 August 1925,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=August 22, 2017|work=The New York Times|location=EU: Britain|title=Obit: Brian Aldiss|author=AP|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/08/22/world/europe/ap-eu-britain-obit-brian-aldiss.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; above his paternal grandfather's draper's shop in [[Dereham]], [[Norfolk]]. When Aldiss's grandfather died, his father, Bill (the younger of two sons), sold his share in the shop and the family left Dereham. Aldiss's mother, Dot, was the daughter of a builder.&lt;ref name=andrewbrown&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/16/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.artsandhumanities | work=The Guardian | first=Andrew | last=Brown | title=Profile: Brian Aldiss | date=16 June 2001 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an older sister who was stillborn, and a younger sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times: Brian Aldiss, Author of Science Fiction and Much More, Dies at 92&quot; /&gt; As a 3-year-old, Aldiss started to write stories which his mother would bind and put on a shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-brian-aldiss-87-author-8567603.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Charlie | last=Cooper | title=My Secret Life: Brian Aldiss, 87, author | date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 6, he went to [[Framlingham College]] but moved to Devon and was sent to board at [[West Buckland School]] in [[Devon]] in 1939 after the outbreak of the war.&lt;ref name=andrewbrown/&gt; As a child he discovered the pulp magazine ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', and read all the novels by [[H. G. Wells]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert Heinlein]], and later [[Philip K. Dick]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/books/brian-aldiss-author-of-science-fiction-and-much-more-dies-at-92.html Brian Aldiss, Author of Science Fiction and Much More, Dies at 92]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, during the [[World War II|Second World War]], he joined the [[Royal Signals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/The-World-Of-Brian-Aldiss/|title=Brian Aldiss at 90: 'British readers had a prejudice against science fiction'|author=|date=|website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw action in [[Myanmar|Burma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/13/brian-aldiss-science-fiction-author-review|title=Brian Aldiss: 'These days I don't read any science fiction. I only read Tolstoy'|first=Stuart|last=Kelly|date=13 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing and publishing===
His Army experience inspired the Horatio Stubbs second and third books, ''A Soldier Erect'' and ''A Rude Awakening'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Aldiss, Brian W |url=http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/aldiss_brian_w |encyclopedia=SFE: The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |author1-last=Clute |author1-first=John |author2-last=Pringle |author2-first=David |date=22 August 2017 |access-date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he worked as a bookseller in [[Oxford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jun/16/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.artsandhumanities|title=Master of the universes: Brian Aldiss|first=Andrew|last=Brown|date=15 June 2001|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a number of short pieces for a booksellers' trade journal about life in a fictitious bookshop, which attracted the attention of Charles Monteith, an editor at the publisher [[Faber and Faber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Brian Aldiss | date=May 15, 2003 | title=Brian Aldiss - Creating 'The Brightfount Diaries' (37/79) |medium=Motion picture | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ_YRljmhgA | publisher=[[Web of Stories]]|quote=So finally, I wrote to the Editor and said, you know you don't have a comic column. Don't you think that '[[The Bookseller]]' would do better if it had a comic column every week? I would like to write such a column for you. He wrote back and said, come and see me. Bring some of your comic columns. I wrote six of them, and since I was working, in fact, for Blackwells, Blackwell became Brightfount and my bookshop was Brightfounts... The Brightfount Diaries, and my pseudonym was not Aldiss, but Pica, a small type. OK. ... I received a very nice letter from Faber &amp; Faber, saying, 'Dear Mr Aldiss, We all enjoy 'The Brightfount Diaries'. We wondered if you'd care to make them into a book'. Make them into a book! You know, I didn't have to submit anything – they asked me! Well, I mean, there's the root of arrogance for you.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Faber and Faber published Aldiss' first book, ''The Brightfount Diaries'' (1955), a 200-page novel in diary form about the life of a sales assistant in a bookshop.

About this time he also began to write science fiction for various magazines. According to [[ISFDB]], his first [[speculative fiction]] in print was the [[short story]] ''Criminal Record'', published by [[John Carnell]] in the July 1954 issue of ''[[Science Fantasy (magazine)|Science Fantasy]]''.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; Several of his stories appeared in 1955, including three in monthly issues of ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;isfdb&quot;/&gt; also edited by Carnell.&lt;!-- supported by our magazine articles --&gt;

In 1954, ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper ran a competition for a short story set in the year 2500. Aldiss' story ''Not For An Age'' was ranked third following a reader vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Short Story, Ballot|work=The Observer|date=16 January 1955 |page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Brightfount Diaries'' had been a minor success, and Faber asked Aldiss if he had any more writing they could look at with a view to publishing. Aldiss confessed to being a science fiction author, to the delight of the publishers, who had a number of [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]] in high places, and so his first science fiction book was published,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} a collection of short stories entitled ''Space, Time and Nathaniel'' (Faber, 1957). By this time, his earnings from writing matched his wages in the bookshop, and he made the decision to become a full-time writer.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Brian Aldiss (3).jpg|left|thumb|upright|In 2012]]
Aldiss led the voting for Most Promising New Author of 1958 at the next year's [[Worldcon]], but finished behind &quot;no award&quot;.&lt;ref name=SFAwards/&gt; He was elected president of the [[British Science Fiction Association]] in 1960. He was the literary editor of the ''Oxford Mail'' newspaper from 1958 to 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Around 1964, he and long-time collaborator [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]] started the first ever journal of science fiction criticism, ''Science Fiction Horizons'', which during its brief span of two issues published articles and reviews by such authors as [[James Blish]], and featured a discussion among Aldiss, [[C. S. Lewis]], and [[Kingsley Amis]] in the first issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SF Horizons, No. 1|url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?302524 |website=isfdb.org|publisher=Al von Ruff|access-date=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interview with [[William S.

G. Ballard]], [[Roger Zelazny]], and [[Samuel R. Delany]] as &quot;an earthshaking new kind of&quot; writers, and leaders of the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]].&lt;ref name=&quot;budrys196710&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine

Besides his own writings, he had great success as an anthologist. For Faber he edited ''Introducing SF'', a collection of stories typifying various themes of science fiction, and ''Best Fantasy Stories''. In 1961, he edited an anthology of reprinted short science fiction for the British paperback publisher [[Penguin Books]] under the title ''Penguin Science Fiction''. This was remarkably successful, went into numerous reprints, and was followed up by two further anthologies: ''More Penguin Science Fiction'' (1963) and ''Yet More Penguin Science Fiction'' (1964). The later anthologies enjoyed the same success as the first, and all three were eventually published together as ''The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus'' (1973), which also went into a number of reprints. In the 1970s, he produced several large collections of classic grand-scale science fiction, under the titles ''Space Opera'' (1974), ''Space Odysseys'' (1975), ''Galactic Empires'' (1976), ''Evil Earths'' (1976), and ''Perilous Planets'' (1978) which were quite successful.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Around this time, he edited a large-format volume ''Science Fiction Art'' (1975), with selections of artwork from the magazines and [[pulp magazines|pulps]].

In response to the results from the [[space probe|planetary probes]] of the 1960s and 1970s, which showed that [[Venus]] was completely unlike the hot, tropical jungle usually depicted in science fiction, Aldiss and Harrison edited an anthology ''[[Farewell, Fantastic Venus]]!'', reprinting stories based on the pre-probe ideas of Venus. He also edited, with Harrison, a series of anthologies ''The Year's Best Science Fiction'' (Nos. 1–9, 1968–1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2000/Issues/08/Aldiss.html|title=Locus Online: Brian Aldiss interview (excerpts)|author=|date=|website=www.locusmag.com|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aldiss invented a form of extremely short story called the ''[[minisaga|mini-saga]]''. ''The Daily Telegraph'' hosted a competition for the best mini-saga for several years, and Aldiss was the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4717359/Your-chance-to-enter-the-Daily-Telegraph-Mini-saga-Competition-1999.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Your chance to enter the Daily Telegraph Mini-saga Competition 1999 | date=27 April 1999 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has edited several anthologies of the best mini-sagas.

[[Image:BRIAN ALDISS Metropolis.jpg|thumb|250px|'Metropolis' limited edition print by Brian Aldiss]]
Aldiss travelled to Yugoslavia, where he met fans in [[Ljubljana, Slovenia]] and published a travel book about Yugoslavia entitled ''Cities and Stones'' (1966), his only work in the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brianaldiss.co.uk/writing/non-fiction/non-fiction-a-p/cities-stones/|title=Brian Aldiss - Cities &amp; Stones|author=|date=|website=brianaldiss.co.uk|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published an alternative-history fantasy story, &quot;The Day of the Doomed King&quot; (1968), about Serbian kings in the Middle Ages, and wrote a novel called ''[[The Malacia Tapestry]]'', about an alternative Dalmatia.

===Art===
In addition to a highly successful career as a writer, Aldiss was an accomplished artist. His first solo exhibition, ''The Other Hemisphere'', was held in [[Oxford]], August–September 2010, and the exhibition's centrepiece ''Metropolis'' (see figure) has since been released as a limited edition fine art print.&lt;ref name=metroart&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wire-frame.net/fineart.html#Metropolis |title=wire-frame • giclée prints |publisher=Wire-frame fine art publishing (wire-frame.net) |accessdate=18 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227124835/http://www.wire-frame.net/fineart.html#Metropolis |archivedate=27 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The exhibition title denotes the writer/artist's notion, &quot;words streaming from one side of his brain inspiring images in what he calls 'the other hemisphere'&quot;.)&lt;ref name=metroart/&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1948, Aldiss married Olive Fortescue, secretary to the owner of Sanders' bookseller's in Oxford, where he had worked since 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; He had two children from his first marriage: Clive in 1955 and Caroline Wendy in 1959, but the marriage &quot;finally collapsed&quot; in 1959 and dissolved in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-we-met-brian-aldiss-and-anthony-storr-1578953.html|title=HOW WE MET: BRIAN ALDISS AND ANTHONY STORR|author=|date=22 October 1995|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, he married his second wife, Margaret Christie Manson (daughter of John Alexander Christie Manson, an aeronautical engineer),&lt;ref&gt;Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, vol. 2, R. Reginald, 1979, pg 793&lt;/ref&gt; a Scottish woman and secretary to the editor of the ''[[Oxford Mail]]''; Aldiss was 40, and she 31.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; They lived in Oxford and had two children together, Tim and Charlotte.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt; She died in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Word for World Is Forest]]'', &quot;one of the major SF denunciations of the [[Vietnam War|American genocide in Vietnam]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Fredric|authorlink=Fredric Jameson|chapter=World-reduction in Le Guin: The Emergence of Utopian Narrative|orig-year=1975|title=The Jameson Reader|editor-first1=Michael|editor-last1=Hardt|editor-link1=Michael Hardt|editor-first2=Kathi|editor-last2=Weeks|publisher=Blackwell|year=2000|page=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*: Perhaps Aldiss's most experimental work, this first appeared in several parts as the ''Acid Head War'' series in ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]''. Set in a Europe some years after a flare-up in the Middle East led to Europe being attacked with bombs releasing huge quantities of long-lived hallucinogenic drugs. Into an England with a population barely maintaining a grip on reality comes a young [[Serbs|Serb]], who himself starts coming under the influence of the ambient aerosols, and finds himself leading a messianic [[crusade]]. The narration and dialogue reflects the shattering of language under the influence of the drugs, in mutating phrases and puns and allusions, in a deliberate echo of ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''.
