'''''Braveheart''''' is a 1995 American [[epic film|epic]] [[war film]] directed and co-produced by [[Mel Gibson]], who portrays [[William Wallace]], a late-13th-century Scottish warrior. The film is [[historical fiction|fictionally based]] on the life of Wallace leading the Scots in the [[First War of Scottish Independence]] against King [[Edward I of England]]. The film also stars [[Sophie Marceau]], [[Patrick McGoohan]] and [[Catherine McCormack]]. The story is inspired by [[Blind Harry]]'s [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[The Wallace (poem)|The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace]]'' and was adapted for the screen by [[Randall Wallace]].

Development on the film initially started at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] when producer [[Alan Ladd Jr.]] picked up the project from Wallace, but when MGM was going through new management, Ladd left the studio and took the project with him. Despite initially declining, Gibson eventually decided to direct the film, as well as star as Wallace. The film was filmed in Scotland and Ireland from June to October 1994 with a budget around $65–70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69593/Braveheart/misc-notes.html|title=Braveheart (1995) - Misc Notes - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Braveheart'', which was produced by Gibson's [[Icon Productions]] and [[The Ladd Company]], was distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]] in North America and by [[20th Century Fox]] internationally.

Released on May 24, 1995, ''Braveheart'' received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances, directing, production values, battle sequences, and musical score, but criticized its inaccuracies regarding Wallace's title, love interests, and attire.&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece|title=The 10 most historically inaccurate movies|last=White|first=Caroline|newspaper=The Sunday Times|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615070116/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6738785.ece|archivedate=June 15, 2011|accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed $75.6 million in the US and grossed $210.4 million worldwide. At the [[68th Academy Awards]], the film was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards]] and won five: [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]], and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]]. A [[sequel]], [[Robert the Bruce (film)|''Robert the Bruce'']], was released in 2019, with [[Angus Macfadyen]] reprising his role.

==Plot==
In 1280, [[Edward I of England|King Edward &quot;Longshanks&quot;]] invades and conquers [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] following the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland]], who left no heir to the throne. Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father and brother, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal uncle Argyle, where he is educated. Years later, in 1297, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including [[Droit du seigneur|''Prima Nocte'']]. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to [[Action at Lanark|slaughter the English garrison]] in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.

Longshanks orders his son [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]] to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Alongside his friend Hamish, Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge|Battle of Stirling]] and then destroys the city of [[York, England|York]], killing Longshanks' nephew and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of [[Robert the Bruce]], the son of nobleman [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Elder]] and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife [[Isabella of France]] to try to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.

After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. She warns him of the coming invasion, and Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country, asking Robert the Bruce to lead. In 1298, leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at [[Battle of Falkirk|Falkirk]]. There, noblemen Mornay and Lochlan turn their backs on Wallace after being bribed by the king, resulting in the death of Hamish's father, Campbell. Wallace is then further betrayed when he discovers Robert the Bruce was fighting alongside Longshanks; after the battle, after seeing the damage he helped do to his countrymen, the Bruce reprimands his father and vows not to be on the wrong side again.

Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. In 1305, Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns and banishes his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him that his bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is now pregnant with Wallace's child.

In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], Wallace refuses to submit to the king. The watching crowd, deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, begin crying for mercy. The magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, &quot;Mercy&quot;, and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, &quot;Freedom!&quot;, and the judge orders his death. As Wallace's cry rings through the square, Longshanks hears it just before dying. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.

In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]], where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory. Hamish throws Wallace's sword, Braveheart, point-down in front of the English army, imploring his men to fight with Robert as they did with Wallace. With the Scots chanting Wallace's name, Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom. The final shot of the film is the sun setting behind Braveheart as it sways in the wind.

== Production ==
{{expand section|date=February 2020}}
Producer [[Alan Ladd Jr.]] initially had the project at [[MGM-Pathé Communications]] when he picked up the script from Wallace.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaspare88&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=gaspare88|title=Making Of Braveheart Behind The Scenes Documentary|date=February 7, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X20ii_zg_N4|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] was going through new management in 1993, Ladd left the studio and took some of its top properties, including ''Braveheart''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HtZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ladd+takes+Braveheart&amp;dq=Ladd+takes+Braveheart|title=Robin Hood: A Cinematic History of the English Outlaw and His Scottish Counterparts|last=Nollen|first=Scott Allen|date=January 1, 1999|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786406432|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson came across the script and even though he liked it, he initially passed on it. However, the thought of it kept coming back to him and he ultimately decided to take on the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaspare88&quot;/&gt; Gibson was initially interested in directing only and considered [[Brad Pitt]] in the role of [[William Wallace]], but Gibson reluctantly agreed to play Wallace as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB&quot;/&gt; [[File:Scott Neeson on the set of Braveheart, 1995.jpg|thumb|Gibson (right) on set with 20th Century Fox executive [[Scott Neeson]]]]

Gibson and his production company, [[Icon Productions]], had difficulty raising enough money for the film. [[Warner Bros.]] was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for another ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' sequel, which he refused. Gibson eventually gained enough financing for the film, with [[Paramount Pictures]] financing a third of the budget in exchange for North American distribution rights to the film, and [[20th Century Fox]] putting up two thirds of the budget in exchange for international distribution rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117926430.html|title=Mel tongue-ties studios|author=Michael Fleming|date=July 25, 2005|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GB&quot;/&gt;

Principal photography on the film began on June 6, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69593/Braveheart/misc-notes.html|title=Braveheart (1995) - Misc Notes - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the crew spent three weeks shooting on location in Scotland, the major battle scenes were shot in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] using members of the [[Reserve Defence Forces|Irish Army Reserve]] as extras. To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras, up to 1,600 in some scenes, portray both armies. The reservists had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their military uniforms for medieval garb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unison.ie/meath_chronicle/stories.php3?ca=41&amp;si=1031035&amp;issue_id=9666|title= ''Braveheart'' 10th Chance To Boost Tourism In Trim|work= Meath Chronicle|date= August 28, 2003|accessdate= April 30, 2007|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150903212040/http://www.unison.ie/meath_chronicle/stories.php3?ca=41&amp;si=1031035&amp;issue_id=9666|archive-date= September 3, 2015|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal photography ended on October 28, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/69593/Braveheart/misc-notes.html|title=Braveheart (1995) - Misc Notes - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot in the [[anamorphic format]] with [[Panavision]] C- and E-Series lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chris Probst | title=Cinematic Transcendence| journal=[[American Cinematographer]] | publisher=[[American Society of Cinematographers]] | volume=77 | issue=6 | page=76 | location=[[Los Angeles, California]], United States | date=June 1, 1996 | issn=0002-7928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson had to tone down the film's battle scenes to avoid an [[NC-17]] rating from the [[MPAA]]; the final version was rated R for &quot;brutal [[medieval warfare]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.filmratings.com/ | title = Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA) | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101211104428/http://www.filmratings.com/| archivedate = December 11, 2010| author1 = Classification and Rating Administration | author2 = Motion Picture Association of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson and editor [[Steven Rosenblum]] initially had a film at 195 minutes, but [[Sherry Lansing|Sheryl Lansing]], who was the head of Paramount at the time, requested Gibson and Rosenblum to cut the film down to 177 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/mel-gibson-reveals-secrets-from-behind-the-scenes-of-braveheart/news-story/cb19dbd81d2373b506884b3bc4099ecb|title=Mel Gibson reveals secrets from behind the scenes of Braveheart|website=www.news.com.au|access-date=January 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gibson in a 2016 interview with [[Collider (website)|''Collider'']], there is a four-hour version of the film and would be interested in reassembling it if both Paramount and Fox are interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/1780785-1780785|title=Mel Gibson has a whole hour of unseen 'Braveheart' footage for an extended cut|last=Levine|first=Nick|date=October 26, 2016|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=January 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
{{main|Braveheart (soundtrack)}}
The score was composed and conducted by [[James Horner]] and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. It is Horner's second of three collaborations with [[Mel Gibson]] as director. The score has gone on to be one of the most commercially successful soundtracks of all time. It received considerable acclaim from film critics and audiences and was nominated for a number of awards, including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]], [[Saturn Award]], [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]], and [[Golden Globe Award]].

== Release and reception ==
=== Box office ===
On its opening weekend, ''Braveheart'' grossed $9,938,276 in the United States and $75.6 million in its box office run in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxofficemojo&quot;/&gt; Worldwide, the film grossed $210,409,945 and was the thirteenth-highest-grossing film of 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boxofficemojo&quot;/&gt;

=== Critical response ===
''Braveheart'' earned positive reviews; critics praised Gibson's direction and performance as Wallace, the performances of its cast, and its screenplay, production values, Horner's score, and the battle sequences. The depiction of the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] was listed by [[CNN]] as one of the best battles in cinema history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/29/movie.battles/index.html|title=The best – and worst – movie battle scenes|date=March 30, 2007|accessdate=April 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408081844/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/29/movie.battles/index.html|archivedate=April 8, 2007|url-status=dead|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was also criticized for its depiction of history. The film holds a 77% approval rating at review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average score of 7.25/10, based on 75 reviews. The site's consensus states &quot;Distractingly violent and historically dodgy, Mel Gibson's ''Braveheart'' justifies its epic length by delivering enough sweeping action, drama, and romance to match its ambition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1065684_braveheart?|title=Braveheart|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=June 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also has a score of 68 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 20 critic reviews indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Braveheart|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/braveheart|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mel Gibson 1990 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Mel Gibson (shown here in 1990), won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for his work on ''Braveheart''. ]]
[[Caryn James]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised the film, calling it &quot;one of the most spectacular entertainments in years.&quot; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3.5 stars out of four, calling it &quot;An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity of ''The Road Warrior''.&quot; In a positive review, [[Gene Siskel]] wrote that &quot;in addition to staging battle scenes well, Gibson also manages to recreate the filth and mood of 700 years ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-05-26-9505260018-story.html|title=`CRUMB' DIGS DEEP AS THE OSCARS COME UP EMPTY|last=Siskel|first=Gene|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=October 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' felt that &quot;though the film dawdles a bit with the shimmery, dappled love stuff involving Wallace with a Scottish peasant and a French princess, the action will pin you to your seat.&quot;

Not all reviews were positive, however. [[Richard Schickel]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine argued that &quot;everybody knows that a non-blubbering clause is standard in all movie stars' contracts. Too bad there isn't one banning self-indulgence when they direct.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982369,00.html|title=CINEMA: ANOTHER HIGHLAND FLING|last=Schickel|first=Richard|date=May 29, 1995|work=Time|access-date=October 26, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Stack of ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' felt &quot;at times the film seems an obsessive ode to Mel Gibson machismo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/FILM-REVIEW-Macho-Mel-Beats-His-Chest-in-3032546.php|title=FILM REVIEW -- Macho Mel Beats His Chest in Bloody `Braveheart'|date=May 24, 1995|work=SFGate|access-date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 poll by British film magazine ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', ''Braveheart'' was No. 1 on their list of &quot;The Top 10 Worst Pictures to Win Best Picture Oscar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mel Gibson's &quot;Braveheart&quot; Voted Worst Oscar Winner | url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Mel_Gibsons_Braveheart_Voted_Worst_Oscar_Winner/2435436 | publisher=hollywood.com | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203230603/http://www.hollywood.com/news/Mel_Gibsons_Braveheart_Voted_Worst_Oscar_Winner/2435436 | archivedate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Empire'' readers had previously voted ''Braveheart'' the best film of 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Empire Award Past Winners - 1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Empire Award Past Winners - 1996 | url=https://www.empireonline.com/awards2003/pastwinners/1996.asp |work=Empireonline.com | publisher=[[Bauer Consumer Media]] | year=2003 | accessdate=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on tourism ===
The European premiere was on September 3, 1995, in Stirling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12089373.Scotland_a_nation_again_for_a_night/ |title=Scotland a nation again for a night |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=September 4, 1995 |accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the year after the film was released, the annual three-day &quot;Braveheart Conference&quot; at [[Stirling Castle]] attracted fans of ''Braveheart'', increasing the conference's attendance to 167,000 from 66,000 in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Zumkhawala-Cook | first=Richard | year=2008 | title=Scotland as We Know It: Representations of National Identity in Literature, Film and Popular Culture | publisher=McFarland | isbn=978-0-7864-4031-3 | page=147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, research on visitors to the [[Stirling]] area indicated that 55% of the visitors had seen ''Braveheart''. Of visitors from outside Scotland, 15% of those who saw ''Braveheart'' said it influenced their decision to visit the country. Of all visitors who saw ''Braveheart'', 39% said the film influenced in part their decision to visit Stirling, and 19% said the film was one of the main reasons for their visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=MacLellan | first1=Rory | last2=Smith | first2=Ronnie | year=1998 | title=Tourism in Scotland | publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA | isbn=978-1-86152-089-0 | page=230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, a tourism report said that the &quot;''Braveheart'' effect&quot; earned [[Scotland]] £7 million to £15 million in tourist revenue, and the report led to various national organizations encouraging international film productions to take place in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Martin-Jones | first=David | year=2009 | title=Scotland: Global Cinema – Genres, Modes, and Identities | publisher=Edinburgh University Press | isbn=978-0-7486-3391-3 | page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film generated huge interest in Scotland and in [[Scottish history]], not only around the world, but also in Scotland itself. Fans came from all over the world to see the places in Scotland where William Wallace fought, also to the places in Scotland and Ireland used as locations in the film.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} At a ''Braveheart'' Convention in 1997, held in [[Stirling]] the day after the [[Scottish Parliament#History|Scottish Devolution]] vote and attended by 200 delegates from around the world, ''Braveheart'' author Randall Wallace, Seoras Wallace of the Wallace Clan, Scottish historian David Ross and Bláithín FitzGerald from Ireland gave lectures on various aspects of the film.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Several of the actors also attended including James Robinson (Young William), Andrew Weir (Young Hamish), Julie Austin (the young bride) and Mhairi Calvey (Young Murron).{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Awards and honors ===
''Braveheart'' was nominated for many awards during the 1995 Oscar season, though it was not viewed by many as a major contender such as ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', ''[[Il Postino: The Postman]]'', ''[[Leaving Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'', and ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. It wasn't until after the film won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director]] at the [[53rd Golden Globe Awards]] that it was viewed as a serious Oscar contender. When the nominations were announced for the [[68th Academy Awards]], ''Braveheart'' received ten Academy Award nominations, and a month later, won five including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Gibson, [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Effects Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscars1996&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1996 |title=The 68th Academy Awards (1996) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=October 23, 2011 |work=oscars.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929190404/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/68th-winners.html |archivedate=September 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Braveheart'' became the ninth film to win Best Picture with no acting nominations and is one of only three films to win Best Picture without being nominated for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]], the other being ''[[The Shape of Water]]'' in 2017 and followed by [[Green Book (film)|''Green Book'']] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27BRAVEHEART%27+CONQUERS%5CGibson%27s+epic+wins+Best+Picture%5CSarandon,+Cage...-a083931988|title='BRAVEHEART' CONQUERS\Gibson's epic wins Best Picture\Sarandon, Cage take acting honors. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=January 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/shape-water-best-picture-win-mirrors-a-braveheart-first-oscars-2018-1090971|title=Oscars Avoids &quot;Envelopegate&quot; Repeat as 'The Shape of Water' Takes Home Best Picture Prize|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=January 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/oscars-2019-green-book-wins-best-picture-61289300|title=Oscars 2019: 'Green Book' wins best picture|last=America|first=Good Morning|website=Good Morning America|language=en|access-date=2019-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also won the [[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay|Writer's Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-19/entertainment/ca-48578_1_writers-guild-award|title=WGA Members Prize 'Sensibility' and 'Braveheart'|last=WELKOS|first=ROBERT W.|date=1996-03-19|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2019-03-19|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[Independent Film &amp; Television Alliance]] selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UPDATE: How &quot;Toxic&quot; Is IFTA's Best Indies?| url = https://deadline.com/2010/09/iftas-toxic-best-indie-film-list-65871/| work= Deadline| accessdate=January 23, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural effects ===
[[Lin Anderson]], author of ''Braveheart: From Hollywood To Holyrood'', credits the film with playing a significant role in affecting the [[Scottish political landscape]] in the mid-to-late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boztas |first=Senay |url=http://www.braveheart.info/news/2005/sunday_herald/2007-07-31/51063.html |title=Wallace movie 'helped Scots get devolution' – [Sunday Herald&amp;#93; |publisher=Braveheart.info |date=July 31, 2005 |accessdate=February 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702163829/http://www.braveheart.info/news/2005/sunday_herald/2007-07-31/51063.html |archivedate=July 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wallace Monument ===
[[File:Braveheart Statue Sep 2007.jpg|thumb|Tom Church's statue]]
In 1997, a {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}}, {{convert|13|t|adj=on}} [[sandstone]] statue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace in ''Braveheart'' was placed in the car park of the [[Wallace Monument]] near [[Stirling]], Scotland. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, a [[Stonemasonry|monumental mason]] from [[Brechin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;courer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2009/10/16/newsstory13954661t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020180051/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2009/10/16/newsstory13954661t0.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 20, 2009 |work=[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]] |title=Wallace statue back at home of sculptor |accessdate=October 17, 2009 |date=October 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included the word 'Braveheart' on Wallace's shield. The installation became the cause of much controversy; one local resident stated that it was wrong to &quot;desecrate the main memorial to Wallace with a lump of crap&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hal G. P. Colebatch |url=http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=10191 |title=The American Spectator |publisher=Spectator.org |date=August 8, 2006 |accessdate=February 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012014011/http://spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=10191 |archivedate=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, someone wielding a hammer vandalized the statue's face. After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed, as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as &quot;among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/williamwallace/They-may-take-our-lives.2565370.jp |title=They may take our lives but they won't take Freedom |author=Kevin Hurley |work=[[Scotland on Sunday]] |date=September 19, 2004 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built at the foot of the Wallace Monument.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_statue_removed&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Wallace statue back with sculptor |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/8310614.stm |work=BBC News |date=October 16, 2009 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical inaccuracy ==
Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledged [[Blind Harry]]'s 15th-century [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[The Wallace (poem)|The Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslie]]'' as a major inspiration for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;anderson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Anderson, Lin| title=Braveheart: From Hollywood to Holyrood| publisher=Luath Press Ltd.|date=2005|page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, &quot;Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.&quot;&lt;ref name = anderson/&gt; Blind Harry's poem is not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. the [[Barns of Ayr|hanging of Scottish nobles]] at the start),&lt;ref name=Riddy&gt;''Unmapping the Territory: Blind Hary's Wallace'', Felicity Riddy's chapter in Edward Cowan's ''The Wallace Book'' (2007, {{ISBN|978-0-85976-652-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella).&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Elizabeth Ewan describes ''Braveheart'' as a film that &quot;almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;ewan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ewan, Elizabeth|title=Braveheart|journal= American Historical Review |volume=100|number= 4 |date=October 1995|pages= 1219–21|doi=10.2307/2168219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;brave heart&quot; refers in Scottish history to that of [[Robert the Bruce]], and an attribution by [[William Edmondstoune Aytoun]], in his poem ''Heart of Bruce'', to [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James the Good Douglas]]: &quot;Pass thee first, thou dauntless heart, As thou wert wont of yore!&quot;, prior to Douglas' demise at the [[Battle of Teba]] in [[Andalusia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/0/9/4/10945/10945.htm |title=Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers and Other Poems / Aytoun, W.

(William Edmondstoune), 1813–1865 |publisher=Infomotions.com |date=February 4, 2004 |accessdate=June 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329042729/http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/1/0/9/4/10945/10945.htm |archivedate=March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

Sharon Krossa noted that the film contains numerous historical errors, beginning with the wearing of [[belted plaid]] by Wallace and his men. In that period &quot;no Scots [...] wore belted plaids (let alone [[kilt]]s of any kind).&quot; Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not &quot;in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film&quot;. She compares the inaccuracy to &quot;a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Sharon L.| last = Krossa| title = Braveheart Errors: An Illustration of Scale| url=http://medievalscotland.org/scotbiblio/bravehearterrors.shtml| date=October 2, 2008|accessdate = June 15, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131009105036/http://medievalscotland.org/scotbiblio/bravehearterrors.shtml
| archivedate = October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a previous essay about the film, she wrote, &quot;The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate—in short, just about nothing is accurate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krossa&quot;&gt;{{cite web| first=Sharon L.|last = Krossa

Irish historian Seán Duffy remarked &quot;the [[battle of Stirling Bridge]] could have done with a bridge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyireland.com/medieval-history-pre-1500/braveheart-brave-attempt/|title=History Ireland|work=History Ireland|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the film was second on a list of &quot;most historically inaccurate movies&quot; in ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; In the humorous non-fictional historiography ''An Utterly Impartial History of Britain'' (2007), author [[John O'Farrell (author)|John O'Farrell]] claims that ''Braveheart'' could not have been more historically inaccurate, even if a [[Plasticine]] dog had been inserted in the film and the title changed to &quot;''William [[Wallace and Gromit]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John| last = O'Farrell| title = An Utterly Impartial History of Britain| year = 2007| publisher = Doubleday| location = New York City| page = 126|ISBN=978-0-385-61198-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[DVD-Video|DVD]] [[audio commentary]] of ''Braveheart'', Mel Gibson acknowledges many of the historical inaccuracies but defends his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film was much more &quot;cinematically compelling&quot; than the historical fact or conventional mythos.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

=== ''Jus primae noctis'' ===
[[Edward I of England|Edward Longshanks]], King of England, is shown invoking ''[[Droit du seigneur|Jus primae noctis]]'', allowing the lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serfs' maiden daughters on their wedding nights. Critical medieval scholarship regards this supposed right as a myth: &quot;the simple reason why we are dealing with a myth here rests in the surprising fact that practically all writers who make any such claims have never been able or willing to cite any trustworthy source, if they have any.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Albrecht|last=Classen|title=The medieval chastity belt: a myth-making process|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_hncxYRQIoC&amp;pg=PA147|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|page=151|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609130238/https://books.google.com/books?id=r_hncxYRQIoC&amp;pg=PA147 |archivedate=June 9, 2013|isbn=9781403975584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/weddings/customs/droit.asp |title=Urban legends website |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occupation and independence ===
The film suggests Scotland had been under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace's childhood, and in the run-up to the [[Battle of Falkirk]] Wallace says to the younger Bruce, &quot;[W]e'll have what none of us have ever had before, a country of our own.&quot; In fact, Scotland had been [[Wars of Scottish Independence#Background|invaded by England]] only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|King Alexander III]] it had been a fully separate kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Traquair p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; After Alexander III death in 1286 his granddaughter  [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]], succeeded to the throne of Scotland until her death in 1290 in Orkney. 

At one point, Wallace's uncle refers to a piper as “playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.&quot;  Not only were [[bagpipes]] not outlawed at the time, they likely had not yet been introduced to Scotland. Further, the widely-held belief that bagpipes were banned by the [[Act of Proscription 1746]] (400 years later), is erroneous. Bagpipes were never specifically outlawed in Scotland.

=== Portrayal of William Wallace ===
As [[John Shelton Lawrence]] and [[Robert Jewett]] writes, &quot;Because [William] Wallace is one of Scotland's most important national heroes and because he lived in the very distant past, much that is believed about him is probably the stuff of legend. But there is a factual strand that historians agree to&quot;, summarized from Scots scholar [[Matt Ewart]]:

{{quote|Wallace was born into the gentry of Scotland; his father lived until he was 18, his mother until his 24th year; he killed the sheriff of [[Lanark]] when he was 27, apparently after the murder of his wife; he led a group of commoners against the English in a very successful battle at Stirling in 1297, temporarily receiving appointment as [[Guardian of Scotland|guardian]]; Wallace's reputation as a military leader was ruined in the same year of 1297, leading to his resignation as guardian; he spent several years of exile in France before being captured by the English at [[Glasgow]], this resulting in his trial for treason and his cruel execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=John|last1=Shelton Lawrence|first2=Robert|last2=Jewett |title=The Myth of the American Superhero | url=https://archive.org/details/mythofamericansu00lawr_0| url-access=registration|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|year=2002 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mythofamericansu00lawr_0/page/163 163]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A. E. Christa Canitz writes about the historical William Wallace further: &quot;[He] was a younger son of the Scottish gentry, usually accompanied by his own chaplain, well-educated, and eventually, having been appointed [[Guardian of Scotland|Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland]], engaged in diplomatic correspondence with the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic cities]] of [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]] and [[History of Hamburg|Hamburg]]&quot;. She finds that in ''Braveheart'', &quot;any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and 'a farmer'—as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canitz&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=2005 | first=A.E.

[[Colin McArthur]] writes that ''Braveheart'' &quot;constructs Wallace as a kind of modern, [[Nationalism|nationalist]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state.&quot; Writing about ''Braveheart''{{'}}s &quot;omissions of verified historical facts&quot;, McArthur notes that Wallace made &quot;overtures to Edward I seeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk&quot;, as well as &quot;the well-documented fact of Wallace's having resorted to [[conscription]] and his willingness to hang those who refused to serve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colin|last=McArthur |year=1998 |chapter=''Braveheart'' and the Scottish Aesthetic Dementia |editor-first=Tony |editor-last=Barta |title=Screening the Past: Film and the Representation of History |publisher=Praeger |pages=167–187 |isbn=978-0-275-95402-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canitz posits that depicting &quot;such lack of class solidarity&quot; as the conscriptions and related hangings &quot;would contaminate the movie's image of Wallace as the morally irreproachable ''[[primus inter pares]]'' among his peasant fighters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Canitz&quot;/&gt;

=== Portrayal of Isabella of France ===
[[Isabella of France]] is shown having an affair with Wallace after the [[Battle of Falkirk]]. She later tells Edward I she is pregnant, implying that her son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], was a product of the affair. In reality, Isabella was around three years old and living in France at the time of the Battle of Falkirk, was not married to Edward II until he was already king, and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ewan | first=Elizabeth | date=October 1995 | title=Braveheart |journal=The American Historical Review | publisher=Indiana University Press | location=Bloomington | volume=100 |issue=4 | pages=1219–21 | issn=0002-8762 | oclc=01830326 | doi=10.2307/2168219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

=== Portrayal of Robert the Bruce ===
[[Robert the Bruce]] did change sides between the Scots loyalists and the [[England|English]] more than once in the earlier stages of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], but he never betrayed Wallace directly, and he probably did not fight on the English side at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] (although this claim does appear in a few medieval sources).&lt;ref&gt;Penman, Michael ''Robert the Bruce: King of the Scots'' pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] was not a spontaneous battle; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years. &lt;ref&gt;Traquair pp. 128-176&lt;/ref&gt;  His title before becoming king was [[Earl of Carrick]], not Earl of Bruce.&lt;ref&gt;Traquair p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portrayal of Longshanks and Prince Edward ===
The actual Edward I was ruthless and temperamental, but the film exaggerates his negative aspects for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], and as a religious man, he gave generously to charity. The film's scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Also, Edward died on campaign two years after Wallace's execution, not in bed at his home.&lt;ref&gt;Traquair p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of the future [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] as an [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] homosexual drew accusations of [[homophobia]] against Gibson.

{{quote|We cut a scene out, unfortunately ... where you really got to know that character [Edward II] and to understand his plight and his pain ... But it just stopped the film in the first act so much that you thought, 'When's this story going to start?'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=USA Today|date= May 24, 1995|title=Gibson has faith in family and freedom|author=Della Cava, Marco R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2012}}}}
Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying:

{{quote|I'm just trying to respond to history. You can cite other examples—[[Alexander the Great]], for example, who conquered the entire world, was also a homosexual. But this story isn't about Alexander the Great. It's about Edward II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=May 21, 1995| title=Mel Gibson Dons Kilt and Directs|author= Stein, Ruth}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to Longshanks' murder of the Prince's male lover Phillip, Gibson replied: &quot;The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=Daily News |title=Gay Alliance has Gibson's 'Braveheart' in its sights |date=May 11, 1995 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/1995/05/11/1995-05-11_gay_alliance_has_gibson_s__b.html |accessdate=February 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604232204/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/1995/05/11/1995-05-11_gay_alliance_has_gibson_s__b.html |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gibson asserted that the reason Longshanks kills his son's lover is because the king is a &quot;[[Psychopathy|psychopath]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1995-05-25/film/icon/ | title=Icon: Mel Gibson talks about Braveheart, movie stardom, and media treachery | author=Matt Zoller Seitz | publisher= |work=Dallas Observer |date=May 25, 1995 | accessdate=August 19, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222002830/http://www.dallasobserver.com/1995-05-25/film/icon/ |archivedate=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson expressed bewilderment that some filmgoers would laugh at this murder. The real Sir Philip Mowbray was never murdered by Edward I. Edward I died in 1307, with Mowbray living past his death, until 1318.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=The Battle of Bannockburn|title=Philip Mowbray|url=https://learning.battleofbannockburn.com/battlepedia/characters/philip-mowbray/#.XkSrR_SnydM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=Braveheart: The 10 historical inaccuracies you need to know before watching the movie|url=https://thehande.wordpress.com/2011/12/05/braveheart-the-10-historical-inaccuracies-you-need-to-know-before-watching-the-movie/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wallace's military campaign ===
&quot;MacGregors from the next glen&quot; joining Wallace shortly after the [[action at Lanark]] is dubious, since it is questionable whether [[Clan Gregor]] existed at that stage, and when they did emerge their traditional home was [[Glen Orchy]], some distance from Lanark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Way, George|author2=Squire, Romily|last-author-amp=yes|title= Collins Scottish Clan &amp; Family Encyclopedia|date= 1994|pages= 220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace did win an important victory at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]], but the version in ''Braveheart'' is highly inaccurate, as it was filmed without a bridge (and without [[Andrew Moray]], joint commander of the Scots army, who was fatally injured in the battle). Later, Wallace did carry out a large-scale raid into the north of England, but he did not get as far south as York, nor did he kill Longshanks' nephew&lt;ref&gt;Traquair pp. 77-79&lt;/ref&gt; (however, this was not as wide of the mark as Blind Harry, who has Wallace making it as far south as [[St. Albans]], and only refraining from attacking London after the English queen came out to meet him).&lt;ref name=Riddy/&gt; Edward's nephew [[John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond|John of Brittany]] did take part in the Wars of Scottish Independence, but he was not killed, dying of natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Jones|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Jones (historian)|title=Brittany, John of, earl of Richmond (1266?–1334)|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/53083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Irish conscripts&quot; at the [[Battle of Falkirk]] are also unhistorical; there were no Irish troops at Falkirk (although many of the English army were actually [[Welsh people|Welsh]]) &lt;ref&gt;Traquair pp. 81-84&lt;/ref&gt; and it is anachronistic to refer to [[Conscription|conscripts]] in the Middle Ages (although there were [[Feudalism|feudal]] levies).

The two-handed long swords used by Gibson in the film were not in wide use in the period. A one-handed sword and shield would have been more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matt|first1=Easton|title=Two-handed swords in Ironclad, Braveheart, Robin Hood &amp; Kingdom of Heaven|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA4TxBZEOR8|website=YouTube|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accusations of Anglophobia ==
Sections of the English media accused the film of harboring [[Anglophobia]]. ''[[The Economist]]'' called it &quot;[[Xenophobia|xenophobic]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=6941798 |title=Economist.com |publisher=Economist.com |date=May 18, 2006 |accessdate=February 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629214649/http://www.economist.com/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=6941798 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Sutherland (author)|John Sutherland]] writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that: &quot;''Braveheart'' gave full rein to a toxic Anglophobia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/11/religion.world |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=John Sutherland |date=August 11, 2003 |accessdate=April 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820010057/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2003/aug/11/religion.world |archivedate=August 20, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesonline1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article546776.ece |title=''Braveheart'' battle cry is now but a whisper |newspaper=Times Online |date= July 24, 2005|accessdate=February 27, 2009 | location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629142251/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article546776.ece |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In ''[[The Times]]'', Colin McArthur said &quot;the political effects are truly pernicious.
