The '''Andes''', '''Andes Mountains''' or '''Andean Mountains''' ({{lang-es|Cordillera de los Andes}}) are the [[List of mountain ranges#By length|longest]] [[continental crust|continental]] [[mountain range]] in the world, forming a continuous highland along the western edge of South America. The range is {{convert|7000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|200|to|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide (widest between [[18th parallel south|18° south]] and [[20th parallel south|20° south]] [[latitude]]), and has an average height of about {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]].

Along their length, the Andes are split into several ranges, separated by intermediate [[depression (geology)|depressions]]. The Andes are the location of several high [[plateau]]s – some of which host major cities such as [[Quito]], [[Bogotá]], [[Cali]], [[Arequipa]], [[Medellín]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Sucre]], [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]] and [[La Paz]]. The [[Altiplano|Altiplano plateau]] is the world's second-highest after the [[Tibetan plateau]]. These ranges are in turn grouped into three major divisions based on climate: the [[Tropical Andes]], the [[Dry Andes]], and the [[Wet Andes]].

The Andes Mountains are the highest mountain range outside Asia. The highest mountain outside Asia, Argentina's Mount [[Aconcagua]], rises to an elevation of about {{convert|6961|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The [[Summit (topography)|peak]] of [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in the Ecuadorian Andes is farther from the Earth's center than any other location on the Earth's surface, due to the [[equatorial bulge]] resulting from the [[Earth's rotation]]. The world's highest [[volcano]]es are in the Andes, including [[Ojos del Salado]] on the Chile-Argentina border, which rises to {{convert|6893|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The Andes are also part of the [[American Cordillera]], a chain of mountain ranges ([[cordillera]]) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of mountain ranges that form the western &quot;backbone&quot; of North America, Central America, South America and Antarctica.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word ''Andes'' has been debated. The majority consensus is that it derives from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word {{lang|qu|anti}}, which means &quot;east&quot;&lt;ref name=laime&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua–Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; as in ''[[Antisuyu]]'' (Quechua for &quot;east region&quot;),&lt;ref name=laime/&gt; one of the four regions of the [[Inca Empire]].

The term ''[[cordillera]]'' comes from the Spanish word ''cordel'', meaning &quot;rope&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cordillera |url=http://etimologias.dechile.net/?cordillera |website=etimologias.dechile.net |accessdate=2015-12-27 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used as a descriptive names for several contiguous sections of the Andes, as well as the entire Andean range, and the combined mountain chain along the western part of the North and South American continents.

==Geography==
[[File:ARG-2016-Aerial-Tierra del Fuego (Ushuaia)–Valle Carbajal 01.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Carbajal Valley|Valle Carbajal]] in the [[Tierra del Fuego|Fuegian]]
The Andes range is about {{convert|200|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide throughout its length, except in the [[Orocline|Bolivian flexure]] where it is about {{convert|640|km|mi|0}} wide.]]
The Andes can be divided into three sections:
; The Southern Andes: in Argentina and Chile, south of [[Llullaillaco]].
; The Central Andes: in Peru and Bolivia.
; The Northern Andes: in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. In the northern part of the Andes, the separate [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] range is often treated as part of the Northern Andes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w9300e/w9300e09.htm |title=Mountains, biodiversity and conservation |website=www.fao.org |access-date=2019-01-28 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Leeward Antilles]] islands [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]], which lie in the [[Caribbean Sea]] off the coast of Venezuela, were formerly thought to represent the submerged peaks of the extreme northern edge of the Andes range, but ongoing geological studies indicate that such a simplification does not do justice to the complex tectonic boundary between the South American and Caribbean plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Meghan S. |first2=Alan |last2=Levander |first3=Fenglin |last3=Niu |first4=Aibing |last4=Li |title=Upper mantle structure beneath the Caribbean-South American plate boundary from surface wave tomography |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=114 |issue=B1 |page=B01312 |doi=10.1029/2007JB005507 |date=2008-06-23 &lt;!--Revision date--&gt; |url=http://www.gseis.rice.edu/Reprints/047_MillerEL09JGR.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605003245/http://www.gseis.rice.edu/Reprints/047_MillerEL09JGR.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-05 |accessdate=2010-11-21 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2009JGRB..114.1312M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
&lt;div id=&quot;Container&quot; style=&quot;float:right;clear:right;&quot;&gt;{{Geology of the Andes}}&lt;/div&gt;
The Andes are a [[Mesozoic]]–[[Tertiary]] [[orogenic]] belt of mountains along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], a zone of [[volcanic activity]] that encompasses the Pacific rim of the Americas as well as the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The Andes are the result of [[tectonic plate]] processes, caused by the [[subduction]] of [[oceanic crust]] beneath the [[South American Plate]]. It is the result of a convergent plate boundary between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate. The main cause of the rise of the Andes is the compression of the western rim of the [[South American Plate]] due to the subduction of the [[Nazca Plate]] and the [[Antarctic Plate]]. To the east, the Andes range is bounded by several [[sedimentary basin]]s, such as [[Orinoco]], [[Amazon Basin]], [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]] and [[Gran Chaco]], that separate the Andes from the ancient [[craton]]s in eastern South America. In the south, the Andes share a long boundary with the former [[Patagonia#Geology|Patagonia Terrane]]. To the west, the Andes end at the [[Pacific Ocean]], although the [[Peru-Chile trench]] can be considered their ultimate western limit. From a geographical approach, the Andes are considered to have their western boundaries marked by the appearance of coastal lowlands and a less rugged topography. The Andes Mountains also contain large quantities of iron ore located in many mountains within the range.

The Andean orogen has a series of bends or [[orocline]]s. The Bolivian Orocline is a seaward concave bending in the coast of South America and the Andes Mountains at about 18° S.&lt;ref name=Isacks1988/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kley1999&gt;{{Citation

===Orogeny===
{{main|Andean orogeny}}
The western rim of the [[South American Plate]] has been the place of several pre-Andean [[orogeny|orogenies]] since at least the late [[Proterozoic]] and early [[Paleozoic]], when several [[terrane]]s and [[microcontinent]]s collided and amalgamated with the ancient [[craton]]s of eastern South America, by then the [[South American Plate|South American part]] of [[Gondwana]].

The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the [[Triassic]] when [[Pangaea]] began the break up that resulted in developing several [[rift]]s. The development continued through the [[Jurassic]] Period. It was during the [[Cretaceous]] Period that the Andes began to take their present form, by the [[Tectonic uplift|uplifting]], [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rocks of the ancient cratons to the east. The rise of the Andes has not been constant, as different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress, uplift, and [[erosion]].

Tectonic forces above the [[subduction zone]] along the entire west coast of South America where the [[Nazca Plate]] and a part of the [[Antarctic Plate]] are sliding beneath the [[South American Plate]] continue to produce an ongoing [[Orogeny|orogenic event]] resulting in minor to major [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s to this day. In the extreme south, a major [[transform fault]] separates [[Tierra del Fuego]] from the small [[Scotia Plate]]. Across the {{convert|1000|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} wide [[Drake Passage]] lie the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] south of the Scotia Plate which appear to be a continuation of the Andes chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NhHvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2528&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Bang to Eternity and Betwixt: Cosmos|last=Hussey|first=John|date=2018|website=Cosmos by John Hussey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regions immediately east of the Andes experience a series of changes resulting from the Andean orogeny. Parts of the [[Sunsás orogeny|Sunsás Orogen]] in [[Amazonian craton]] disappeared from the surface of earth being [[thrust fault|overridden]] by the Andes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Santos |first=J.O.S. |last2=Rizzotto |first2=G.J. |last4=McNaughton |first4=N.J.|last3=Potter |first3=P.E.|last5=Matos |first5=R.S.|last6=Hartmann |first6=L.A.|last7=Chemale Jr. |first7=F.|last8=Quadros |first8=M.E.S.|date=2008 |title=Age and autochthonous evolution of the Sunsás Orogen in West Amazon Craton based on mapping and U–Pb geochronology |journal=[[Precambrian Research]] |volume=165 |issue=3–4 |pages=120–152 |doi= 10.1016/j.precamres.2008.06.009|bibcode=2008PreR..165..120S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volcanism===
{{Main|Andean Volcanic Belt}}
[[File:Browncanyonquilotoa.jpg|thumb|[[Rift valley]] near [[Quilotoa]], [[Ecuador]]]]
[[File:Central Andes Mountains, Salar de Arizaro, Argentina.jpg|thumb|This photo from the [[ISS]] shows the high plains of the Andes Mountains in the foreground, with a line of young volcanoes facing the much lower Atacama Desert]]

The Andes range has many active volcanoes distributed in four volcanic zones separated by areas of inactivity. The Andean volcanism is a result of [[subduction]] of the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate underneath the South American Plate. The belt is subdivided into four main volcanic zones that are separated from each other by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt are diverse in terms of activity style, products and morphology. While some differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to, there are significant differences inside volcanic zones and even between neighbouring volcanoes. Despite being a type location for [[calc-alkalic]] and subduction volcanism, the Andean Volcanic Belt has a large range of volcano-tectonic settings, such as rift systems and extensional zones, transpressional faults, subduction of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[seamount]] chains apart from a large range of crustal thicknesses and [[magma]] ascent paths, and different amount of crustal assimilations.

===Ore deposits and evaporates===
The Andes Mountains host large [[ore]] and [[salt]] deposits and some of their eastern [[fold and thrust belt]] acts as traps for commercially exploitable amounts of [[hydrocarbon]]s. In the forelands of the [[Atacama Desert]] some of the largest [[porphyry copper]] mineralizations occurs making Chile and Peru the first and second largest exporters of [[copper]] in the world. Porphyry copper in the western slopes of the Andes has been generated by [[hydrothermal fluid]]s (mostly water) during the cooling of [[pluton (geology)|plutons]] or volcanic systems. The porphyry mineralization further benefited from the dry climate that let them largely out of the disturbing actions of [[meteoric water]]. The dry climate in the central western Andes has also led to the creation of extensive [[Chile saltpeter|saltpeter deposits]] which were extensively mined until the invention of synthetic nitrates. Yet another result of the dry climate are the [[Dry lake|salars]] of [[Salar de Atacama|Atacama]] and [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]], the first one being the largest source of [[lithium]] today and the second the world's largest reserve of the element. Early Mesozoic and [[Neogene]] plutonism in Bolivia's Cordillera Central created the Bolivian [[tin]] belt as well as the famous, now depleted, deposits of [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]].

==Climate and hydrology==
{{See also|Tropical Andes|Dry Andes|Wet Andes}}
[[File:Andes1a.JPG|thumb|Central Andes]]
[[File:Andes bolivianos.jpg|thumb|Bolivian Andes]]

The climate in the Andes varies greatly depending on latitude, altitude, and proximity to the sea. Temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity decrease in higher elevations. The southern section is rainy and cool, the central section is dry. The northern Andes are typically rainy and warm, with an average temperature of {{convert|18|C|F|0}} in Colombia. The climate is known to change drastically in rather short distances. [[Rainforest]]s exist just kilometres away from the snow-covered peak Cotopaxi. The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas. The [[snow line]] depends on the location. It is at between {{convert|4500|and|4,800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the tropical Ecuadorian, Colombian, Venezuelan, and northern Peruvian Andes, rising to {{convert|4800|-|5,200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30°S before descending to {{convert|4500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} on Aconcagua at 32°S, {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} at 40°S, {{convert|500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} at 50°S, and only {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in [[Tierra del Fuego]] at 55°S; from 50°S, several of the larger glaciers descend to sea level.&lt;ref&gt;

The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be divided in two climatic and glaciological zones: the [[Dry Andes]] and the [[Wet Andes]]. Since the Dry Andes extend from the latitudes of [[Atacama Desert]] to the area of [[Maule River]], precipitation is more sporadic and there are strong temperature oscillations. The line of equilibrium may shift drastically over short periods of time, leaving a whole glacier in the [[ablation]] area or in the [[Glacier ice accumulation|accumulation area]].

In the high Andes of central Chile and [[Mendoza Province]], [[rock glacier]]s are larger and more common than glaciers; this is due to the high exposure to [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Christoph Otto, Joachim Götz, Markus Keuschnig, Ingo Hartmeyer, Dario Trombotto, and Lothar Schrott (2010). Geomorphological and geophysical investigation of a complex rock glacier system – Morenas Coloradas valley (Cordon del Plata, Mendoza, Argentina)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though precipitation increases with the height, there are semiarid conditions in the nearly {{convert|7000|m|adj=on||}} highest mountains of the Andes. This dry steppe climate is considered to be typical of the subtropical position at 32–34° S. The valley bottoms have no woods, just dwarf scrub. The largest glaciers, as e.g. the Plomo glacier and the Horcones glaciers, do not even reach {{cvt|10|km|||}} in length and have an only insignificant ice thickness. At glacial times, however, c. 20,000 years ago, the glaciers were over ten times longer. On the east side of this section of the Mendozina Andes, they flowed down to {{cvt|2060|m|||}} and on the west side to about {{cvt|1220|m|||}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhle, M. 2011&quot;&gt;Kuhle, M.

The Andean region cuts across several [[natural region|natural]] and floristic regions due to its extension from [[Caribbean]] Venezuela to cold, windy and wet [[Cape Horn]] passing through the hyperarid Atacama Desert.

Opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the relatively dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru, Chile and Argentina. Along with several [[Interandean Valles]], they are typically dominated by [[deciduous]] woodland, shrub and [[xeric]] vegetation, reaching the extreme in the slopes near the virtually lifeless Atacama Desert.

About 30,000 species of [[vascular plants]] live in the Andes, with roughly half being [[endemism|endemic]] to the region, surpassing the diversity of any other [[Biodiversity hotspot|hotspot]].&lt;ref name = &quot;biodiv&quot;/&gt; The small tree ''[[Cinchona pubescens]]'', a source of [[quinine]] which is used to treat [[malaria]], is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia. Other important crops that originated from the Andes are [[tobacco]] and [[potato]]es. The high-altitude ''[[Polylepis]]'' forests and woodlands are found in the Andean areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile. These trees, by locals referred to as Queñua, Yagual and other names, can be found at altitudes of {{convert|4500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} above sea level. It remains unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural, or the result of clearing which began during the [[Inca]]n period. Regardless, in [[modern history|modern times]] the clearance has accelerated, and the trees are now considered to be highly [[endangered]], with some believing that as little as 10% of the original woodland remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|Fauna of the Andes}}
The Andes are rich in fauna: With almost 1,000 species, of which roughly 2/3 are [[endemism|endemic]] to the region, the Andes are the most important region in the world for [[amphibian]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;biodiv&quot;&gt;[http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/andes/Pages/biodiversity.aspx Tropical Andes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821222457/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/andes/Pages/biodiversity.aspx |date=2010-08-21 }} – biodiversityhotspots.org&lt;/ref&gt;
The diversity of animals in the Andes is high, with almost 600 species of [[mammal]]s (13% endemic), more than 1,700 species of birds (about 1/3 endemic), more than 600 species of [[reptile]] (about 45% endemic), and almost 400 species of fish (about 1/3 endemic).&lt;ref name=&quot;biodiv&quot;/&gt;

The [[vicuña]] and [[guanaco]] can be found living in the [[Altiplano]], while the closely related [[Domestication|domesticated]] [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] are widely kept by locals as [[pack animal]]s and for their [[meat]] and [[wool]]. The crepuscular (active during dawn and dusk) [[chinchilla]]s, two threatened members of the [[rodent]] order, inhabit the Andes' alpine regions.&lt;ref name=NeoMammals3&gt;Eisenberg, J.F.; &amp; Redford, K.H.

The Andes Mountains form a north-south axis of cultural influences. A long series of cultural development culminated in the expansion of the [[Inca civilization]] and [[Inca Empire]] in the central Andes during the 15th century. The Incas formed this civilization through [[imperialism|imperialistic]] [[militarism]] as well as careful and meticulous governmental management.&lt;ref&gt;D'Altroy, Terence N. The Incas. Blackwell Publishing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The government sponsored the construction of [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] and [[roads]] in addition to preexisting installations. Some of these constructions are still in existence today.

Devastated by European diseases to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] and [[Inca Civil War|civil wars]], in 1532 the Incas were defeated by an alliance composed of tens of thousands of allies from nations they had subjugated (e.g. [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], [[Cañari]]s) and a small army of 180 Spaniards led by [[Francisco Pizarro]]. One of the few Inca sites the Spanish never found in their conquest was [[Machu Picchu]], which lay hidden on a peak on the eastern edge of the Andes where they descend to the Amazon. The main surviving languages of the Andean peoples are those of the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language]] families. [[Woodbine Parish]] and [[Joseph Barclay Pentland]] surveyed a large part of the Bolivian Andes from 1826 to 1827.

===Cities===
[[File:La Paz Skyline.jpg|thumb|La Paz, Bolivia is the highest capital city in the world]]
[[File:Santiago depois da chuva (11).JPG|thumb|[[Santiago de Chile]]]]
[[File:Cerros orientales Bogota.jpg|thumb|[[Bogotá]]]]
In modern times, the largest cities in the Andes are [[Bogotá]], with a population of about eight million, [[Santiago]], [[Medellín]], and [[Cali]]. [[Lima]] is a coastal city adjacent to the Andes and is the largest city of all Andean countries. It is the seat of the [[Andean Community of Nations]].

[[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]]'s seat of government, is the highest capital city in the world, at an elevation of approximately {{convert|3650|m|0|abbr=on}}. Parts of the La Paz conurbation, including the city of [[El Alto]], extend up to {{convert|4200|m|0|abbr=on}}.

Other cities in or near the Andes include [[Arequipa]], [[Cusco]], [[Huancayo]], [[Cajamarca]], [[Juliaca]], [[Huánuco]], [[Huaraz]], and [[Puno]] in Peru; [[Quito]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]], [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]], [[Loja, Ecuador|Loja]], [[Riobamba]], and [[Ibarra, Ecuador|Ibarra]] in Ecuador; [[Cochabamba]], [[Oruro, Bolivia|Oruro]], [[Sucre]], and [[Tarija]] in Bolivia; [[Calama, Chile|Calama]] and [[Rancagua]] in Chile; [[Armenia, Colombia|Armenia]], [[Cúcuta]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Ibagué]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Palmira, Valle del Cauca|Palmira]], [[Popayán]], [[Tunja]], [[Villavicencio]], and [[Manizales]] in Colombia; [[Barquisimeto]], [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristóbal]], [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], and [[Valera]] in Venezuela; and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[San Miguel de Tucumán|Tucumán]], [[Salta, Argentina|Salta]], and [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]] in Argentina. The cities of [[Caracas]], [[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], and [[Maracay]] are in the [[Venezuelan Coastal Range]], which is a debatable extension of the Andes at the northern extreme of South America.

===Transportation===

Cities and large towns are connected with [[asphalt]]-paved roads, while smaller towns are often connected by dirt roads, which may require a [[four-wheel-drive]] vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;andesmap&quot;&gt;[http://andes.zoom-maps.com/ Andes travel map]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pico Humboldt y su glaciar.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Venezuelan Andes in [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]]]]

The rough terrain has historically put the costs of building [[highway]]s and [[railroad]]s that cross the Andes out of reach of most neighboring countries, even with modern [[civil engineering]] practices. For example, the main crossover of the Andes between Argentina and Chile is still accomplished through the [[Paso Internacional Los Libertadores]]. Only recently the ends of some highways that came rather close to one another from the east and the west have been connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1159492-jujuy-apuesta-a-captar-las-cargas-de-brasil-en-transito-hacia-chile|title=''Jujuy apuesta a captar las cargas de Brasil en tránsito hacia Chile'' by Emiliano Galli  |publisher=La Nación newspaper|accessdate=2011-07-22|date=2009-08-07  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the transportation of passengers is done via aircraft.

However, there is one railroad that connects Chile with Peru via the Andes, and there are others that make the same connection via southern Bolivia. See railroad maps of that region.

There are multiple highways in Bolivia that cross the Andes. Some of these were built during a [[Chaco War|period of war]] between Bolivia and [[Paraguay]], in order to transport Bolivian troops and their supplies to the war front in the lowlands of southeastern Bolivia and western Paraguay.

For decades, Chile claimed ownership of land on the eastern side of the Andes. However, these claims were given up in about 1870 during the [[War of the Pacific]] between Chile, the allied Bolivia and Peru, in a diplomatic deal to keep Peru out of the war. The [[Chilean Army]] and [[Chilean Navy]] defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru, and Chile took over Bolivia's only province on the Pacific Coast, some land from Peru that was returned to Peru decades later. Bolivia has been a completely [[landlocked]] country ever since. It mostly uses [[seaport]]s in eastern Argentina and [[Uruguay]] for international trade because its diplomatic relations with Chile have been suspended since 1978.

Because of the tortuous terrain in places, villages and towns in the mountains—to which travel via [[motorized vehicle]]s is of little use—are still located in the high Andes of Chile, Bolivia, Peru, and [[Ecuador]]. Locally, the relatives of the [[camel]], the [[llama]], and the [[alpaca]] continue to carry out important uses as pack animals, but this use has generally diminished in modern times. [[Donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, and horses are also useful.

===Agriculture===
[[File:Peruvianterracefarmers.jpg|thumb|Peruvian farmers sowing maize and beans]]
{{See also|Andean Agriculture|Incan agriculture|Vertical archipelago}}

The ancient peoples of the Andes such as the Incas have practiced [[irrigation]] techniques for over 6,000 years. Because of the mountain slopes, [[Andén|terracing]] has been a common practice. Terracing, however, was only extensively employed after Incan imperial expansions to fuel their expanding realm. The [[potato]] holds a very important role as an internally consumed staple crop. [[Maize]] was also an important crop for these people, and was used for the production of [[chicha]], important to Andean native people. Currently, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]] and [[coffee]] are the main export crops. [[Coca]], despite eradication programmes in some countries, remains an important crop for legal local use in a mildly stimulating [[herbal tea]], and, both controversially and illegally, for the production of [[cocaine]].

===Irrigation===
[[File:Women irrigators in the Andes.jpg|thumb|left|Irrigating land in the Peruvian Andes]]

In unirrigated land, [[pasture]] is the most common type of land use. In the rainy season (summer), part of the rangeland is used for cropping (mainly potatoes, barley, broad beans and wheat).

Irrigation is helpful in advancing the sowing data of the summer crops which guarantees an early yield in the period of food shortage. Also, by early sowing, maize can be cultivated higher up in the mountains (up to {{cvt|3800|m|||}}). In addition it makes cropping in the dry season (winter) possible and allows the cultivation of frost resistant vegetable crops like [[onion]] and [[carrot]].&lt;ref&gt;W. van Immerzeel, 1989. ''Irrigation and erosion/flood control at high altitudes in the Andes.'' Published in Annual Report 1989, pp. 8–24, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement, Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line: [https://www.waterlog.info/pdf/andes.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
[[File:Huasos Maulinos - Rugendas.jpg|thumb|right|Chilean [[huaso]]s, 19th century]]
The Andes rose to fame for their mineral wealth during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest of South America]]. Although Andean Amerindian peoples crafted ceremonial jewelry of gold and other metals, the [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralizations]] of the Andes were first mined in large scale after the Spanish arrival. [[Potosí]] in present-day [[Bolivia]] and [[Cerro de Pasco]] in Peru were one of the principal mines of the Spanish Empire in the New World. [[Río de la Plata]] and [[Argentina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.argentine-embassy-uk.org/docs_eng/links/links_information_argentina.shtml|title=Information on Argentina|last=|first=|date=|website=Argentine Embassy London|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; derive their names from the silver of Potosí.

Currently, mining in the Andes of [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] places these countries as the first and third major producers of [[copper]] in the world. [[Peru]] also contains the 4th largest goldmine in the world: the [[Yanacocha]]. The Bolivian Andes produce principally [[tin]] although historically silver mining had a huge impact on the [[Price revolution|economy]] of 17th century Europe.

There is a long history of mining in the Andes, from the Spanish [[silver]] [[Mining|mines]] in [[Potosí]] in the 16th century to the vast current [[porphyry copper deposit]]s of [[Chuquicamata]] and [[Escondida]] in Chile and [[Toquepala mine|Toquepala]] in Peru. Other metals including iron, gold and tin in addition to non-metallic resources are important.
