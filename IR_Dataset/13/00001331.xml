==Early life==
Nazel was born in Compton, California to the son of Joseph &quot;Skippy&quot; Nazel Jr., a prominent African-American author and radio talk show host.&lt;ref name=ArabianPrinceSixSeven&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=Innovative Life: The Anthology, 1984-1989 |title-link=Innovative Life: The Anthology, 1984-1989 |others=Arabian Prince |year=2008 |chapter= |url= |access-date= |editor-last = Egon | editor-first= |first=Amin |last=Eshaiker |author-link= |first2= |last2= |author-link2= |page= |pages=6-7 |type=Liner notes |publisher=[[Stones Throw Records]] |id= |location=Los Angeles |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His musical background came from his mother, a piano teacher and classical musician.&lt;ref name=ArabianPrinceSixSeven/&gt; His family tried their best to shelter him, sending him to a Catholic school and keeping him busy with football to keep him away from the gangs. The younger Nazel got his first experience with making music at the radio station his father was hosting his talk show by using the station's equipment to put together [[mixtape]]s that he would sell at school.&lt;ref name=ArabianPrinceSixSeven/&gt;  Nazel went on to graduate from [[Junípero Serra High School (Gardena, California)|Junípero Serra High School]] in nearby Gardena.&lt;ref name=justfine&gt;{{cite web|url=https://melmagazine.com/arabian-prince-left-n-w-a-and-he-s-doing-just-fine-b776410bec32|title=Arabian Prince Left N.W.A and He’s Doing Just Fine|author=Mike Sager|date=16 January 2016|work=MEL Magazine|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
Nazel took the stage name of DJ Prince at first, out of respect for Prince, and started selling mixtapes at school. While working at a luggage store at the Del Amo Mall, its owner Sam Nassif would ask DJ Prince to dj a party at a community center, and because of his huge following from high school DJ Prince packed the place. He kept performing there for several weekends and the success persuaded Nassif to invest even more in the place, renaming it &quot;The Cave&quot;, where Nazel would continue to host for over three years and even after his N.W.A. days. Nassif was also the one to fund DJ Prince first record, &quot;Strange Life&quot;
He changed his stage name when he was 15 years old at the Skateland USA, the same skating venue credited for launching the NWA a few years later, due to a fan's suggestion. He said about his name:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thekindland.com/culture/how-arabian-prince-was-written-straight-outta-compton-1368|title=How Arabian Prince was written &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;|author=Jasmin St.Claire|date=3 May 2016|work=Kindland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|text=''I called myself DJ Prince at first; back in the day, I always used to dress like Prince. That was the thing in the early ’80s — either you dressed like Prince or you dressed like Michael Jackson. I used to wear the tight parachute pants, and I had the trim moustache, the whole thing. One day I was DJing at a skating rink. I was with Egyptian Lover, that was my boy, still is. This girl comes up to us and asks us our names. And he’s like, &quot;I’m Egyptian Lover.&quot; And I’m like, &quot;I’m DJ Prince.&quot; She looks at me and goes, &quot;I always see you two together. You should call yourself Arabian Prince.&quot; And I guess that just stuck.''&lt;ref name=justfine/&gt;
}}

Arabian Prince started working with [[Russ Parr|Bobby Jimmy &amp; the Critters]] in 1984. He also produced the hit single and album for [[J.J. Fad]], &quot;[[Supersonic (J.J. Fad song)|Supersonic]]&quot;.

In 1986, he was a founding member of [[N.W.A]] but when fellow member [[Ice Cube]] came back from the Phoenix Institute of Technology in 1988, Arabian Prince soon after left over royalty and contract disagreements. &quot;I started off as a solo artist&quot;, he said, &quot; so I was aware of what a royalty statement was. I knew that when these many records were sold, there is a quarterly statement. When you look at it, you can see how much money was paid and then share it. This was not the case. We were also never paid for touring.&quot; [[Eazy-E]], Ice Cube and [[MC Ren]] remained as the main performers, [[DJ Yella]] was the [[turntablist]] and [[Dr. Dre]] was the main producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/whatever-happened-to-nwas-posse-2164896|title=Whatever Happened to N.W.A's Posse?|author=Martin Cizmar|work=L.A. Weekly|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving N.W.A, Arabian Prince began a solo career. His first album, ''[[Brother Arab]]'', was released in 1989 with the hit single &quot;She's Got A Big Posse&quot;; ''[[Where's My Bytches]]'' followed in 1993.

In the mid-2000s, he started releasing music again, with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone Records. &quot;I could not release the record under Arabian Prince&quot;, he said, &quot;because I already had a single out, so I called myself Professor X on that record.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/music/allshookdown/hey-dj/hey-dj-og-arabian-prince/|title=Hey, DJ: OG Arabian Prince|author=Christina Li}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007 he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the [[Stones Throw]] label. In 2008, Stones Throw released a compilation of his electro-rap material from the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stonesthrow.com/arabianprince/ |title=Arabian Prince &amp;#124; Stones Throw Records |publisher=Stonesthrow.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his songs was included on the 2007 video game, ''[[College Hoops 2K8]]''.

In 2018, Arabian Prince appeared on the [[AmeriKKKant|fourteenth studio album]] of industrial-metal band [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/ministry-bring-in-ex-nwa-man-arabian-prince|title=Ministry Bring In Ex-NWA Man Arabian Prince|author=Scott Munro|work=Metal Hammer|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ventures==
Aside from his music career, he worked in [[special effects]], 3D animation and [[video game]]s.&lt;ref name=justfine /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/arabian-prince-a-jheri-blossoms-2155689|title=Arabian Prince: A Jheri Blossoms|first=Chris|last=Martins|date=10 September 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/22/entertainment/et-prince22|title=His 'Innovative Life'|first=Jeff|last=Weiss|date=22 August 2008|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Straight Outta Compton'' movie controversy==
After the release of the NWA film, ''Straight Outta Compton'', in 2015, Arabian Prince said to VladTV: &quot;A lot of the scenes in real life, I was there -I'm just not there in the film, which I'm like, if you're gonna write me out of a movie, shoot some other scenes. Don't write scenes where I was there.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1mIDSgEoVg|title=Arabian Prince reveals discrepancies in &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the pivotal scenes would be choosing the name for the band, the tour and the infamous Detroit concert. He also remembers himself as the main opposer to Jerry Heller about the royalties and the money, a role that in the movie was instead given to Ice Cube.
