'''Ammonia''' is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. A [[Binary compounds of hydrogen|stable binary hydride]], and the simplest [[pnictogen hydride]], ammonia is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell. It is a common [[Metabolic waste#Nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous waste]], particularly among aquatic organisms, and it contributes significantly to the [[nutrition]]al needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to [[food]] and [[fertilizer]]s. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many [[pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical products]] and is used in many commercial cleaning products. It is mainly collected by downward displacement of both air and water.

Although common in nature—both terrestrially and in the [[Solar System#Outer Solar System|outer planets]] of the Solar System—and in wide use, ammonia is both [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] and [[hazard]]ous in its concentrated form. It is classified as an [[List of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance]] in the United States, and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov-right-know&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] | title = 40 C.F.R.: Appendix A to Part 355—The List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | edition = 1 July 2008 | accessdate = 29 October 2011 | journal =  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120225051612/http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | archive-date = 25 February 2012 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; boils at {{convert|−33.34|°C|°F|3}} at a pressure of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature. Household ammonia or [[ammonium hydroxide]] is a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water. The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the [[Baumé scale]] ([[density]]), with 26 degrees Baumé (about 30% (by weight) ammonia at {{convert|15.5|°C|°F|disp=or}}) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.&lt;ref name=LaRoche&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airgasspecialtyproducts.com/UserFiles/laroche/PDF/AAPhysical.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127011850/http://www.airgasspecialtyproducts.com/UserFiles/laroche/PDF/AAPhysical.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2007 |title=Ammonium hydroxide physical properties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Pliny, in Book XXXI of his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]], refers to a salt produced in the Roman province of [[Crete and Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] named ''hammoniacum'', so called because of its proximity to the nearby Temple of [[Amun|Jupiter Amun]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] Ἄμμων ''Ammon'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:31.39|title=Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, Book XXXI, Chapter 39. (7.) - The various kinds of salt; the methods of preparing it, and the remedies derived from it.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the description Pliny gives of the salt does not conform to the properties of ammonium chloride. According to [[Herbert Hoover|Herbert Hoover's]] commentary in his English translation of [[Georgius Agricola|Georgius Agricola's]] ''[[De re metallica]]'', it is likely to have been common sea salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Georgius Agricola De Re Metallica - Translated from the first Latin edition of 1556|last=Hoover|first=Herbert|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1950|isbn=978-0486600062|location=New York|pages=560}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, that salt ultimately gave '''ammonia''' and [[ammonium]] compounds their name.

==Natural occurrence==
Ammonia is a chemical found in trace quantities in nature, being produced from nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, whereas [[ammonium chloride]] ([[sal ammoniac]]), and [[ammonium sulfate]] are found in volcanic districts; crystals of [[ammonium bicarbonate]] have been found in [[Patagonia]] [[guano]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}} The [[kidney]]s secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10360635|year=1999|author1=Kirschbaum, B |author2=Sica, D |author3=Anderson, F. P. |title=Urine electrolytes and the urine anion and osmolar gaps.|volume=133|issue=6|pages=597–604|issn=0022-2143|journal=The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine|doi=10.1016/S0022-2143(99)90190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater.

Ammonia is also found throughout the [[Solar System]] on [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]], among other places: on smaller, icy [[Minor planet|bodies]] such as Pluto, ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze, as a mixture of water and ammonia can have a melting point as low as {{convert|173|K|C F}} if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such bodies to retain internal oceans and active geology at a far lower temperature than would be possible with water alone.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Francis Patrick (1938) [http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/eb/supp/3646/index.pdf Tables of the properties of aqua-ammonia solutions. Part 1 of The Thermodynamics of Absorption Refrigeration]. Lehigh University studies. Science and technology series&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q4/an-ammonia-water-slurry-may-swirl-below-plutos-icy-surface.html An ammonia-water slurry may swirl below Pluto's icy surface]. Purdue University (9 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called ''ammoniacal''.

==Properties==
Ammonia is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell. It is [[lighter than air]], its density being 0.589 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. It is easily liquefied due to the strong [[hydrogen bond]]ing between molecules; the [[liquid]] boils at {{convert|-33.3|°C|°F|2}}, and freezes  to white crystals{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}} at {{convert|-77.7|°C|°F|2}}.

Ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either [[sodium bicarbonate]] or [[acetic acid]]. Both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt.

W.|last2=Riekel|first2=C.|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=35|issue=4|page=569|bibcode = 1979AcCrA..35..569H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Liquid: [[Liquid]] ammonia possesses strong [[ion]]ising powers reflecting its high [[Dielectric constant|ε]] of 22. Liquid ammonia has a very high [[Enthalpy of vaporization|standard enthalpy change of vaporization]] (23.35&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|kJ]]/mol, ''cf.'' [[Properties of water|water]] 40.65&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, methane 8.19&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, [[phosphine]] 14.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in uninsulated vessels without additional refrigeration. See [[#Liquid ammonia as a solvent|liquid ammonia as a solvent]].
;Solvent properties: Ammonia is [[Miscibility|miscible]] with water. In an aqueous solution, it can be expelled by boiling. The [[water|aqueous]] solution of ammonia is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a [[saturated solution]]) has a [[density]] of 0.880 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is often known as '.880 ammonia'. 
;Combustion: Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain [[combustion]], except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15–25% air. When mixed with [[oxygen]], it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame. At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements. Ignition occurs when [[chlorine]] is passed into ammonia, forming nitrogen and [[hydrogen chloride]]; if chlorine is present in excess, then the highly explosive [[nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also formed.

===Structure===
The ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramidal]] shape as predicted by the [[valence shell electron pair repulsion theory]] (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC 94th&quot;&gt;{{cite book | editor= Haynes, William M. | year = 2013 | title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics | edition = 94th | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | isbn = 9781466571143|pages=9–26| title-link = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one [[lone pair]] of electrons. The lone pair repels more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRC 94th&quot;/&gt; This shape gives the molecule a [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]]. The molecule's polarity, and especially, its ability to form [[hydrogen bond]]s, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. The lone pair makes ammonia a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], a proton acceptor. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are [[Protonation|protonated]]. Temperature and [[salinity]] also affect the proportion of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The latter has the shape of a regular [[tetrahedron]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with [[methane]].

The ammonia molecule readily undergoes [[nitrogen inversion]] at room temperature; a useful analogy is an [[umbrella]] turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the [[resonance frequency]] is 23.79 [[Hertz|GHz]], corresponding to [[microwave]] radiation of a [[wavelength]] of 1.260&amp;nbsp;cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first [[Microwave spectroscopy|microwave spectrum]] to be observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cleeton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.45.234|title=Electromagnetic Waves of {{convert|1.1|cm|0|abbr=on}}. Wave-Length and the Absorption Spectrum of Ammonia|year=1934|author=Cleeton, C. E.|journal=Physical Review|volume=45|issue=4|pages=234|first2=N. H.|last2=Williams|bibcode = 1934PhRv...45..234C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphotericity===
One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its [[basicity]]. Ammonia is considered to be a weak base. It combines with [[acid]]s to form [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s; thus with [[hydrochloric acid]] it forms [[ammonium chloride]] (sal ammoniac); with [[nitric acid]], [[ammonium nitrate]], etc. Perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry [[hydrogen chloride]]; moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Influence of moisture on chemical change|author=Baker, H. B. |year=1894|journal=J. Chem. Soc.|volume=65|pages= 611–624|doi=10.1039/CT8946500611|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1863586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a demonstration experiment, opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride, which seem to appear &quot;out of nothing&quot; as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet, somewhere between the two bottles.
{{block indent|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl}}

The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the [[:Category:Ammonium compounds|ammonium salts]] and all contain the [[ammonium|ammonium ion]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}

Although ammonia is well known as a weak base, it can also act as an extremely weak acid. It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of amides (which contain the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion). For example, [[lithium]] dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of [[lithium amide]]:

{{block indent|2Li + 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

===Self-dissociation===
Like water, ammonia undergoes [[molecular autoionisation]] to form its [[conjugate acid|acid and base conjugates]]:
{{block indent|2 {{chem|NH|3}} {{eqm}} {{chem|NH|4|+}} + {{chem|NH|2|-}}}}

Ammonia often functions as a [[weak base]], so it has some [[buffer solution|buffering]] ability. Shifts in pH will cause more or fewer [[ammonium]] cations ({{chem|NH|4|+}}) and [[Azanide|amide anions]] ({{chem|NH|2|-}}) to be present in [[solution]]. At standard pressure and temperature, K=[{{chem|NH|4|+}}][{{chem|NH|2|-}}] = 10{{su|p=−30}}

===Combustion===
The combustion of ammonia to nitrogen and water is [[exothermic]]:
{{block indent|1=4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''g'') [[Standard enthalpy of reaction|Δ''H''°&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −1267.20 kJ/mol (or −316.8 kJ/mol if expressed per mol of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}

The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ''H''°&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, expressed per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed, is −382.81&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion: all [[nitrogen oxide]]s are unstable with respect to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the principle behind the [[catalytic converter]]. Nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts, a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of [[nitric acid]]:
{{block indent|4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 NO + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}

A subsequent reaction leads to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

{{block indent|2 NO +O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}

The combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst (such as [[platinum]] gauze or warm [[chromium(III) oxide]]), due to the relatively low heat of combustion, a lower laminar burning velocity, high auto-ignition temperature, high heat of vaporization, and a narrow flammability range. However, recent studies have shown that efficient and stable combustion of ammonia can be achieved using swirl combustors, thereby rekindling research interest in ammonia as a fuel for thermal power production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kobayashi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kobayashi |first1=Hideaki |last2=Hayakawa |first2=Akihiro |last3=Somarathne |first3=K.D.

===Formation of other compounds===
In [[organic chemistry]], ammonia can act as a [[nucleophile]] in [[Nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] reactions. [[Amine]]s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with [[alkyl halide]]s, although the resulting -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution and neutralises the [[hydrogen halide]] formed. [[Methylamine]] is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with [[chloromethane]], and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare [[racemic]] [[alanine]] in 70% yield. [[Ethanolamine]] is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with [[ethylene oxide]]: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce [[diethanolamine]] and [[triethanolamine]].

[[Amide]]s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives. [[Acyl chloride]]s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the [[hydrogen chloride]] formed. [[Ester]]s and [[anhydride]]s also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrated]] to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150–200&amp;nbsp;°C are required.

The hydrogen in ammonia is susceptible to replacement by myriad substituents.  When heated with [[sodium]] it converts to sodamide, NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}  With chlorine, [[monochloramine]] is formed.

Pentavalent ammonia is known as λ&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-amine, or more commonly, ammonium hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions. This substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0373800|title=High pressure chemistry of hydrogenous fuels|author1=Sterrett, K.

=== Ammonia as a ligand ===
{{main|Metal ammine complex}}
[[File:Tetraamminediaquacopper(II)-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of the tetraamminediaquacopper(II) cation, [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
Ammonia can act as a [[ligand]] in [[transition metal]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]]. It is a pure σ-donor, in the middle of the [[spectrochemical series]], and shows intermediate [[HSAB concept|hard-soft]] behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named '''ammine''' in the nomenclature of [[coordination compound]]s. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ([Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as [[Schweizer's reagent]], and has the remarkable ability to dissolve [[cellulose]]. Diamminesilver(I) ([Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is the active species in [[Tollens' reagent]]. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: [[silver chloride]] (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, [[silver bromide]] (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas [[silver iodide]] (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.

Ammine complexes of [[chromium]](III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of [[Alfred Werner]]'s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds. Werner noted only two isomers (''fac''- and ''mer''-) of the complex [CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] could be formed, and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the [[wikt:vertex|vertices]] of an [[octahedron]]. This proposal has since been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]].

An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the [[Mercury(I) chloride|Calomel reaction]], where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.
{{block indent|HgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; →HgCl(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl}}

===Ammonia in solution===
{{main|Ammonia solution}}
Ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected, in very minute traces, by the addition of [[Nessler's solution]], which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the slightest trace of ammonia or ammonium salts. The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard [[sulfuric acid]] and the excess of acid then determined [[volumetric analysis|volumetrically]]; or the ammonia may be absorbed in [[hydrochloric acid]] and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]], (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=863}}

===Gaseous ammonia===
[[Sulfur sticks]] are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=863}} Ammonia is an irritant and irritation increases with concentration; the [[permissible exposure limit]] is 25&amp;nbsp;ppm, and lethal above 500&amp;nbsp;ppm.&lt;ref&gt;(OSHA) Source: Sax,  N.

===Ammoniacal nitrogen (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N)===
[[Ammoniacal nitrogen]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N) is a measure commonly used for testing the quantity of [[ammonium]] ions, derived naturally from ammonia, and returned to ammonia via organic processes, in water or waste liquids. It is a measure used mainly for quantifying values in waste treatment and water purification systems, as well as a measure of the health of natural and man-made water reserves. It is measured in units of mg/L ([[milligram]] per [[litre]]).

In the form of sal ammoniac ''(نشادر, nushadir)'' ammonia was important to the [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Muslim alchemists]] as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by the Persian-Arab chemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Haq1995&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haq|first=Syed Nomanul|title=Names, Natures and Things: The Alchemist Jabir Ibn Hayyan and His Kitab Al-Ahjar (Book of Stones)|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P-70YjP0nj8C|accessdate=22 June 2010|date=28 February 1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-3254-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the European [[Alchemy|alchemists]] since the 13th century, being mentioned by [[Albertus Magnus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}} It was also used by [[dye]]rs in the [[Middle Ages]] in the form of fermented [[urine]] to alter the colour of vegetable dyes.

The [[Haber–Bosch process]] to produce ammonia from the nitrogen in the air was developed by [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] in 1909 and patented in 1910. It was first used on an industrial scale in Germany during [[World War I]],&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Appl |title=Ammonia, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year= 2006|publisher= Wiley-VCH|location= Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a02_143.pub2|chapter=Ammonia|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the allied blockade that cut off the supply of nitrates from [[Chile]].

Before the availability of natural gas, hydrogen as a precursor to [[ammonia production]] was produced via the [[electrolysis]] of water or using the [[chloralkali process]].

With the advent of the steel industry in the 20th century, ammonia became a byproduct of the production of coking coal.

==Uses==

===Fertilizer===
In the US as of 2019, approximately 88% of ammonia was used as fertilizers either as its salts, solutions or anhydrously.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS2020&quot;/&gt; When applied to soil, it helps provide increased yields of crops such as maize and wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lassaletta|first1=Luis|last2=Billen|first2=Gilles|last3=Grizzetti|first3=Bruna|last4=Anglade|first4=Juliette|last5=Garnier|first5=Josette|title=50 year trends in nitrogen use efficiency of world cropping systems: the relationship between yield and nitrogen input to cropland|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=2014|volume=9|issue=10|pages=105011|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/9/10/105011|language=en|issn=1748-9326|bibcode=2014ERL.....9j5011L}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30% of agricultural nitrogen applied in the US is in the form of anhydrous ammonia and worldwide 110 million tonnes are applied each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/anhydrous-ammonia-fertilizer-abundant-important-hazardous/2013/04/18/c2d4c69c-a85a-11e2-a8e2-5b98cb59187f_story.html|title=Anhydrous ammonia fertilizer: abundant, important, hazardous|newspaper=Washington Post|author=David Brown|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor to nitrogenous compounds===
Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. An important derivative is [[nitric acid]]. This key material is generated via the [[Ostwald process]] by [[oxidation]] of ammonia with air over a [[platinum]] catalyst at {{convert|700|–|850|°C}}, ≈9 atm. [[Nitric oxide]] is an intermediate in this conversion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Holleman, A. F. |author2=Wiberg, E. |title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Academic Press|location= San Diego|year=2001|isbn=978-0-12-352651-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{block indent|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}
Nitric acid is used for the production of [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s, and many organonitrogen compounds.

Ammonia is also used to make the following compounds:
* [[Hydrazine]], in the [[Olin Raschig process]] and the [[peroxide process]]
* [[Hydrogen cyanide]], in the [[BMA process]] and the [[Andrussow process]]
* [[Hydroxylamine]] and [[ammonium carbonate]], in the [[Raschig hydroxylamine process|Raschig process]]
* [[Phenol]], in the [[Raschig–Hooker process]]
* [[Urea]], in the [[Bosch–Meiser urea process]] and in [[Wöhler synthesis]]
* [[Amino acid]]s, using [[Strecker amino-acid synthesis]]
* [[Acrylonitrile]], in the [[Sohio process]]

Ammonia can also be used to make compounds in reactions which are not specifically named. Examples of such compounds include: [[ammonium perchlorate]], [[ammonium nitrate]], [[formamide]], [[dinitrogen tetroxide]], [[alprazolam]], [[ethanolamine]], [[ethyl carbamate]], [[hexamethylenetetramine]], and [[ammonium bicarbonate]].

===As a cleaner===
Household ammonia is a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water, and is used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces. Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, one of its most common uses is to clean glass, porcelain and stainless steel. It is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime. Household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from 5 to 10% ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/emergency/chemical_terrorism/ammonia_tech.htm|title=The Facts About Ammonia|website=www.health.ny.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States manufacturers of cleaning products are required to provide the product's [[material safety data sheet]] which lists the concentration used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.pdf|title=OSHA Hazard Communication Standard: Safety Data Sheets|last=|first=|date=|website=OSHA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fermentation===
Solutions of ammonia ranging from 16% to 25% are used in the [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] industry as a source of nitrogen for microorganisms and to adjust pH during fermentation.

===Antimicrobial agent for food products===
As early as in 1895, it was known that ammonia was &quot;strongly [[antiseptic]] ... it requires 1.4 grams per litre to preserve [[beef tea]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/disinfectiondisi00rideuoft|title=Disinfection and Disinfectants: An Introduction to the Study of|author=Samuel Rideal|publisher=Charles Griffin and Company|place=London|year=1895|page=[https://archive.org/details/disinfectiondisi00rideuoft/page/109 109]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, anhydrous ammonia destroyed 99.999% of [[zoonotic bacteria]] in 3 types of [[compound feed|animal feed]], but not [[silage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.11.040|title=Ammonia disinfection of animal feeds — Laboratory study|author=Tajkarimi, Mehrdad|journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology|volume=122|issue= 1–2|year=2008|pages=23–28|pmid=18155794|last2=Riemann|first2=H.

Lean finely textured beef (popularly known as &quot;[[pink slime]]&quot;) in the beef industry is made from fatty [[beef trimmings]] (c. 50–70% fat) by removing the fat using heat and [[centrifugation]], then treating it with ammonia to kill ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''. The process was deemed effective and safe by the [[US Department of Agriculture]] based on a study that found that the treatment reduces ''E. coli'' to undetectable levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/health/04meat.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Burger That Shattered Her Life | first=Michael | last=Moss | date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been safety concerns about the process as well as consumer complaints about the taste and smell of beef treated at optimal levels of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/us/31meat.html | work=The New York Times | title=Safety of Beef Processing Method Is Questioned | first=Michael | last=Moss | date=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of ammonia in any final product has not come close to toxic levels to humans.

===Minor and emerging uses===

====Refrigeration – R717====
Because of ammonia's vaporization properties, it is a useful [[refrigerant]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; It was commonly used before the popularisation of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] and low cost. It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity, and requiring corrosion resistant components, which restricts its domestic and small-scale use. Along with its use in modern [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in [[absorption refrigerator]]s. The [[Kalina cycle]], which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia–water mixture. Ammonia coolant is also used in the S1 radiator aboard the [[International Space Station]] in two loops which are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/cooling-system-keeps-space-station-safe-productive|title=Cooling System Keeps Space Station Safe, Productive|last=Wright|first=Jerry|date=2015-04-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-07-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/21059-space-station-cooling-system-explained-infographic.html|title=International Space Station's Cooling System: How It Works (Infographic)|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential importance of ammonia as a refrigerant has increased with the discovery that vented CFCs and HFCs are extremely potent and stable greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Reducing Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Use and Emissions in the Federal Sector through SNAP|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-12/documents/epa_hfc_federal_sector.pdf|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution to the [[greenhouse effect]] of CFCs and HFCs in current use, if vented, would match that of all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

====For remediation of gaseous emissions====
Ammonia is used to scrub SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the burning of fossil fuels, and the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. Ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) pollutants emitted by diesel engines. This technology, called SCR ([[selective catalytic reduction]]), relies on a [[vanadia]]-based catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2008/db20080321_748642_page_3.htm |title=Diesel: Greener Than You Think}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia may be used to mitigate gaseous spills of [[phosgene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | title = Phosgene: Health and Safety Guide | year = 1998 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/hsg/hsg/hsg106.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a [[working fluid]], have been proposed and occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is similar to that used in a [[fireless locomotive]], but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] in the UK and the [[St. Charles Avenue Streetcar]] line in New Orleans in the 1870s and 1880s,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Streetcars of New Orleans&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Streetcars of New Orleans |author=Louis C.

Ammonia is sometimes proposed as a practical alternative to [[fossil fuel]] for [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/2007/Olson2_NH3.pdf |title=Ammonia as a Transportation Fuel IV |date=15–16 October 2007 |publisher=Norm Olson – Iowa Energy Center |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207092554/http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/2007/Olson2_NH3.pdf |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite web |title=Development of new combustion strategy for internal combustion engine fueled by pure ammonia |last1=Lee |first1=Dongeun |last2=Min |first2=Hyungeun |last3=Park |first3=Hyunho |last4=Song |first4=Han Ho |url=https://nh3fuelassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NH3-Energy-2017-Donggeun-Lee.pdf |publisher=Seoul National University, Department of Mechanical Engineering |date=2017-11-01 |access-date=2019-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brohi&gt;{{cite web |title=Ammonia as fuel for internal combustion engines? |author=Brohi, Emtiaz Ali |url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/207145/207145.pdf |publisher=Chalmers University of Technology |year=2014 |access-date=2019-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its high [[octane rating]] of 120&lt;ref name=&quot;Chemistry department, University of Bristol&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/ammonia/Ammonia%20MOTM.htm|title=Ammonia|publisher=chm.bris.ac.uk|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low flame temperature&lt;ref name=Zacharakis&gt;{{cite web |title=Characteristics of an SI Engine Using Direct Ammonia Injection |last1=Zacharakis-Jutz |first1=George |last2=Kong |first2=Song-Charng |url=https://nh3fuelassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/nh3fcx-song-charng-kong.pdf |publisher=Department of Mechanical Engineering, Iowa State University |year=2013 |access-date=2019-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production. Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrocarbons]], or [[soot]].

Even though ammonia production currently creates 1.8% of global CO2 emissions, the Royal Society report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ammonia: zero-carbon fertiliser, fuel and energy store |url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/low-carbon-energy-programme/green-ammonia/}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that &quot;green&quot; ammonia can be produced by using low-carbon hydrogen (blue hydrogen and green hydrogen). Total decarbonization of ammonia production and the accomplishment of net-zero targets are possible by 2050. 

However ammonia cannot be easily used in existing [[Otto cycle]] engines because of its very narrow [[Ammonia#Combustion|flammability range]], and there are also other barriers to widespread automobile usage. In terms of raw ammonia supplies, plants would have to be built to increase production levels, requiring significant capital and energy sources.  Although it is the second most produced chemical (after sulfuric acid), the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage.  It could be manufactured from renewable energy sources, as well as coal or nuclear power. The 60 MW [[Norsk Hydro Rjukan|Rjukan dam]] in [[Telemark]], Norway produced ammonia for many years from 1913, providing fertilizer for much of Europe.

Despite this, several tests have been done. In 1981, a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|L0hBAz6MxC4|Ammonia Powered Car}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregvezina.ca |title=Watch 'Ammonia Fuel'|accessdate=7 July 2009|publisher=Greg Vezina}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a University of Michigan pickup powered by ammonia drove from Detroit to San Francisco as part of a demonstration, requiring only one fill-up in Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh3car.com/|title=Welcome to NH3 Car|work=NH3Car.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to [[hydrogen as a fuel]], ammonia is much more energy efficient, and could be produced, stored, and delivered at a much lower cost than hydrogen which must be kept compressed as a cryogenic liquid.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ozy.com/rising-stars/hes-creating-a-new-fuel-out-of-thin-air-for-85-cents-per-gallon/92686|title=He's Creating a New Fuel Out of Thin Air — for 85 Cents per Gallon|first=Jared|last=Lindzon|website=OZY|accessdate=26 April 2019|date=27 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia. The [[Reaction Motors XLR99]] rocket engine that powered the {{nowrap|[[X-15]]}} hypersonic research aircraft used liquid ammonia. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine, and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design.

====As a stimulant====
[[File:Meth ammonia tank Otley iowa.JPG|thumb|Anti-[[methamphetamine|meth]] sign on tank of anhydrous ammonia, [[Otley, Iowa]]. Anhydrous ammonia is a common farm fertilizer that is also a critical ingredient in making methamphetamine. In 2005, Iowa used grant money to give out thousands of locks to prevent criminals from getting into the tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thegazette.com/2009/10/06/anhydrous-ammonia-tank-locks-have-flaws |title=Anhydrous ammonia tank locks have flaws|author=The Gazette Staff|newspaper=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ammonia, as the vapor released by [[smelling salts]], has found significant use as a respiratory stimulant. Ammonia is commonly used in the illegal manufacture of [[methamphetamine]] through a [[Birch reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |title=Illinois Attorney General &amp;#124; Basic Understanding Of Meth |publisher=Illinoisattorneygeneral.gov |accessdate=21 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910041147/http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |archive-date=10 September 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Birch method of making methamphetamine is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid ammonia are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NnZ23IqU4SoC&amp;pg=PA759&amp;lpg=PA759&amp;dq=ammonia+birch+method+danger#v=onepage&amp;q=ammonia%20birch%20method%20danger&amp;f=false|title=Occupational, Industrial, and Environmental Toxicology|last=Greenberg|first=Michael I.|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0323013406|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Textile====
Liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials, giving properties like [[mercerisation]], using alkalis. In particular, it is used for prewashing of wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Włochowicz|first1=A.|last2=Stelmasiak|first2=E.|title=Change in thermal properties of wool after treatment with liquid ammonia|journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry|volume=26|issue=1|year=1983|page=17|doi=10.1007/BF01914084|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/823ed71cafae2592ea4634a5d02a32d7f88e8da6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lifting gas====
At standard temperature and pressure, ammonia is less dense than atmosphere and has approximately 45-48% of the lifting power of hydrogen or [[helium]]. Ammonia has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons as a [[lifting gas]]. Because of its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an [[airship]] to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).

====Woodworking====
{{see also|Ammonia fuming}}
Ammonia has been used to darken quartersawn white oak in Arts &amp; Crafts and Mission-style furniture. Ammonia fumes react with the natural tannins in the wood and cause it to change colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Fuming_white_oak.html Fuming white oak]. woodweb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy carrier====
In early August 2018, scientists from [[Australia]]'s [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) announced the success of developing a process to release hydrogen from ammonia and harvest that at ultra-high purity as a fuel for cars. This uses a special membrane. Two demonstration [[fuel cell vehicle]]s have the technology, a [[Hyundai Nexo]] and [[Toyota Mirai]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2018-08-08_ABC&quot;&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-08/hydrogen-fuel-breakthrough-csiro-game-changer-export-potential/10082514  'Carbon-free fuel': Australian hydrogen car breakthrough could go global], Lexy Hamilton-Smith, [[ABC News Online]], 2018-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm by volume.&lt;ref name=ToxFaqSheet&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts126.pdf |title=Toxic FAQ Sheet for Ammonia| publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR)|date= September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) recently reduced the IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health, the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes without suffering irreversible health effects) from 500 to 300 based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in 1943. Other organizations have varying exposure levels. U.S. Navy Standards [U.S. Bureau of Ships 1962] maximum allowable concentrations (MACs): continuous exposure (60 days): 25 ppm / 1 hour: 400 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/7664417.html Ammonia], IDLH Documentation&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia vapour has a sharp, irritating, pungent odour that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure. The average odour threshold is 5 ppm, well below any danger or damage. Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death.&lt;ref name=ToxFaqSheet/&gt; Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/faq/anhydrous-ammonia-covered-under-hazardous-materials-safety-permit-program Is Anhydrous Ammonia covered under the Hazardous Materials Safety Permit Program?] from the website of the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT)&lt;/ref&gt; Household products containing ammonia (e.g. [[Windex]]) should never be used in conjunction with products containing bleach, as the resulting chemical reaction produces highly toxic fumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/toxicchemicals/a/Mixing-Bleach-And-Ammonia.htm|title=Why You Shouldn't Mix Bleach and Ammonia|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid ammonia is dangerous because it is [[hygroscopic]] and because it can freeze flesh. See {{section link|Gas carrier|Health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers}} for more information.

===Toxicity===
The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to [[carbamoyl phosphate]] by the enzyme [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase]], and then enters the [[urea cycle]] to be either incorporated into [[amino acid]]s or excreted in the urine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ammonium Ion Is Converted Into Urea in Most Terrestrial Vertebrates&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=JM|last2=Tymoczko|first2=JL|last3=Stryer|first3=L|title=Biochemistry|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22450/|edition=5th|year=2002|section=23.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fish]] and [[amphibian]]s lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is [[Directive 67/548/EEC|classified]] as ''dangerous for the environment''.

Ammonia is a constituent of [[tobacco smoke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TalhoutSchulz2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talhout|first1=Reinskje|last2=Schulz|first2=Thomas|last3=Florek|first3=Ewa|last4=Van Benthem|first4=Jan|last5=Wester|first5=Piet|last6=Opperhuizen|first6=Antoon|title=Hazardous Compounds in Tobacco Smoke|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=8|issue=12|year=2011|pages=613–628|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph8020613|pmid=21556207|pmc=3084482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coking wastewater ====
Ammonia is present in coking wastewater streams, as a liquid by-product of the production of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cutting-Edge Solutions For Coking Wastewater Reuse To Meet The Standard Of Circulation Cooling Systems|url = http://www.wateronline.com/doc/cutting-edge-solutions-for-coking-wastewater-reuse-to-meet-the-standard-of-circulation-cooling-systems-0001|website = www.wateronline.com|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the ammonia is discharged to the [[marine environment]] where it acts as a pollutant. The [[Whyalla steelworks]] in [[South Australia]] is one example of a coke-producing facility which discharges ammonia into marine waters.&lt;ref name=&quot;RajaramDutta2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vasudevan Rajaram|author2=Subijoy Dutta|author3=Krishna Parameswaran|title=Sustainable Mining Practices: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uTM2jFMzH4C&amp;pg=PA113|date=30 June 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-3423-7|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aquaculture ====
Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Water Research&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.water-research.net/index.php/ammonia-in-groundwater-runoff-and-streams|title = Ammonia in Groundwater, Runoff, and Streams|date = |accessdate = 3 December 2014|website = The Water Centre|last = Oram|first = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At lower concentrations, around 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Managing ammonia in fish ponds|last = Hargreaves|first = J.A.|publisher = Southern Regional Aquaculture Center|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Tucker|first2 = C.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Water Research&quot; /&gt; At concentrations exceeding 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Water Research&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sergeant&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pollutionsolutions-online.com/articles/water-wastewater/17/chris_sergeant/the_management_of_ammonia_levels_in_an_aquaculture_environment/1557/|title = The Management of Ammonia Levels in an Aquaculture Environment|last = Sergeant|first = Chris|date = 5 February 2014|journal = Water/Wastewater|access-date = 3 December 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sergeant&quot; /&gt;

During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish&lt;ref name=&quot;Sergeant&quot; /&gt; and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.

===Storage information===
Similar to [[propane]], [[anhydrous]] ammonia boils below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure. A storage vessel capable of {{convert|250|psi|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on}} is suitable to contain the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3a1341f81fbe762466a07d33da2361fb;rgn=div8;view=text;node=29%3A5.1.1.1.8.8.33.11;idno=29;cc=ecfr Electronic Code of Federal Regulations:]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104165051/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr%3Bsid%3D3a1341f81fbe762466a07d33da2361fb%3Brgn%3Ddiv8%3Bview%3Dtext%3Bnode%3D29%3A5.1.1.1.8.8.33.11%3Bidno%3D29%3Bcc%3Decfr |date=4 November 2011 }}.

Retrieved on 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with [[base (chemistry)|bases]] (unless in an intended and contained reaction), as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released.

===Household use===
Solutions of ammonia (5–10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and [[mucous membrane]]s (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. Caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach, as a toxic gas may result. Mixing with [[chlorine]]-containing products or strong oxidants, such as household [[bleach]], can lead to hazardous compounds such as [[chloramines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Rizk-Ouaini|first =Rosette |author2=Ferriol, Michel |author3=Gazet, Josette |author4=Saugier-Cohen Adad |author5=Marie Therese |title = Oxidation reaction of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite.

===Laboratory use of ammonia solutions===
[[File:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|Hydrochloric acid sample releasing HCl fumes, which are reacting with ammonia fumes to produce a white smoke of ammonium chloride.]]
The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: &quot;dilute&quot; ammonia solutions are usually 5–10% by weight (&lt;5.62&amp;nbsp;mol/L); &quot;concentrated&quot; solutions are usually prepared at &gt;25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a solution that has a lower density will be more concentrated. The [[Directive 67/548/EEC|European Union classification]] of ammonia solutions is given in the table.

The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated (&quot;0.880&quot; – see [[#Properties]]) solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care; this is not usually a problem for 25% (&quot;0.900&quot;) solutions.

Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with [[halogen]]s, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with [[silver]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[iodide]] salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in [[qualitative inorganic analysis]], and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated (&lt;6% w/v) before disposal once the test is completed.

===Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia (gas or liquid)===
&lt;!-- EU index no. 007-001-00-5 --&gt;
&lt;!-- R10, 23, 34, 50; S1/2, 9, 16, 26, 36/37/39, 45, 61 --&gt;
Anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic ('''T''') and dangerous for the environment ('''N'''). The gas is flammable ([[autoignition temperature]]: 651&amp;nbsp;°C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the United States is 50&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] (35&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), while the [[IDLH]] concentration is estimated at 300&amp;nbsp;ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50&amp;nbsp;ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100&amp;nbsp;ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes [[copper]]- and [[zinc]]-containing [[alloy]]s, and so [[brass]] fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack [[rubber]] and certain plastics.

Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens. [[Nitrogen triiodide]], a [[primary explosive|primary]] [[high explosive]], is formed when ammonia comes in contact with [[iodine]]. Ammonia causes the explosive [[polymerisation]] of [[ethylene oxide]]. It also forms explosive [[fulminating]] compounds with compounds of [[gold]], [[silver]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[germanium]] or [[tellurium]], and with [[stibine]]. Violent reactions have also been reported with [[acetaldehyde]], [[hypochlorite]] solutions, [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[peroxide]]s.

==Synthesis and production==
{{about|section=true|industrial synthesis|synthesis in certain organisms|#Biosynthesis}}
{{See also|Ammonia production}}
[[File:Production of ammonia.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Production trend of ammonia between 1947 and 2007]]
Ammonia is one of the most produced inorganic chemicals, with global production reported at 175 million tonnes in 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS2020&quot;/&gt; China accounted for 28.5% of that, followed by Russia at 10.3%, the United States at 9.1%, and India at 6.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS2020&quot;/&gt;

Before the start of [[World War I]], most ammonia was obtained by the [[dry distillation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1918/press.html |title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1918) – Haber-Bosch process}}&lt;/ref&gt; of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including [[camel]] [[manure|dung]], where it was [[distillation|distilled]] by the reduction of [[nitrous acid]] and [[nitrite]]s with hydrogen; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of [[coal]], and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by [[alkaline]] hydroxides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=7 July 2009|title=Chemistry of the Group 2 Elements – Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1002934|publisher= BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[calcium oxide|quicklime]]:&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Chisholm|1911}}, page 861.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haber-Bosch process===
{{main|Haber-Bosch process}}
Mass production of ammonia mostly uses the [[Haber process|Haber–Bosch process]], a [[gas phase]] reaction between hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at a moderately-elevated temperature (450&amp;nbsp;°C) and high pressure ({{convert|100|atm}}):&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, P.W.; Overton, T.L.; Rourke, J.P.; Weller, M.T. and Armstrong, F.A.

This reaction is both exothermic and results in decreased entropy, meaning that the [[Gibbs free energy|reaction is favoured]] at lower temperatures&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Clark|2013}}: &quot;The forward reaction (the production of ammonia) is exothermic. According to Le Chatelier's Principle, this will be favoured if you lower the temperature. The system will respond by moving the position of equilibrium to counteract this – in other words by producing more heat. In order to get as much ammonia as possible in the equilibrium mixture, you need as low a temperature as possible&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and higher pressures.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Clark|2013}}: &quot;Notice that there are 4 molecules on the left-hand side of the equation, but only 2 on the right. According to Le Chatelier's Principle, if you increase the pressure the system will respond by favouring the reaction which produces fewer molecules. That will cause the pressure to fall again. In order to get as much ammonia as possible in the equilibrium mixture, you need as high a pressure as possible. 200 atmospheres is a high pressure, but not amazingly high&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it difficult and expensive to achieve, as lower temperatures result in slower [[reaction kinetics]] (hence a slower [[reaction rate]])&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Clark|2013}}: &quot;However, 400–450°C isn't a low temperature! Rate considerations: The lower the temperature you use, the slower the reaction becomes. A manufacturer is trying to produce as much ammonia as possible per day. It makes no sense to try to achieve an equilibrium mixture which contains a very high proportion of ammonia if it takes several years for the reaction to reach that equilibrium&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and high pressure requires high-strength pressure vessels&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Clark|2013}}: &quot;Rate considerations: Increasing the pressure brings the molecules closer together. In this particular instance, it will increase their chances of hitting and sticking to the surface of the catalyst where they can react. The higher the pressure the better in terms of the rate of a gas reaction. Economic considerations: Very high pressures are very expensive to produce on two counts. You have to build extremely strong pipes and containment vessels to withstand the very high pressure. That increases your capital costs when the plant is built&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; that aren't weakened by [[hydrogen embrittlement]]. In addition, [[diatomic]] nitrogen is bound together by an exceptionally strong [[triple bond]], which makes it rather inert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemistry of Nitrogen|date=2019-06-05|website=Chem.LibreTexts.org|department=Compounds|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Elements_Organized_by_Block/2_p-Block_Elements/Group_15%3A_The_Nitrogen_Family/Z%3D007_Chemistry_of_Nitrogen_(Z%3D7)|accessdate=2019-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the yield and efficiency of the Haber-Bosch Process are low, meaning that ammonia produced must be continuously separated and extracted for the reaction to proceed at an appreciable pace.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Clark|2013}}: &quot;At each pass of the gases through the reactor, only about 15% of the nitrogen and hydrogen converts to ammonia.

==Liquid ammonia as a solvent==
{{See also|Inorganic nonaqueous solvent}}
Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent. Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conductive solutions containing [[solvated electron]]s. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with those of water shows NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, [[viscosity]], [[dielectric constant]] and [[electrical conductivity]]; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule. The ionic self-[[dissociation constant]] of liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at −50&amp;nbsp;°C is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·l&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.[[File:Ammonia Train.jpg|thumb|A train carrying Anhydrous Ammonia.]]

Liquid ammonia is an ionising solvent, although less so than water, and dissolves a range of ionic compounds, including many [[nitrate]]s, [[nitrite]]s, [[cyanide]]s, [[thiocyanate]]s, [[Cyclopentadienyl complex|metal cyclopentadienyl complexes]] and [[metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Neufeld, R.|author2=Michel, R. |author3=Herbst-Irmer, R. |author4=Schöne, R. |author5=Stalke, D. |journal=[[Chem.

A saturated solution of [[ammonium nitrate]] ('''Divers' solution''', named after [[Edward Divers]]) contains 0.83&amp;nbsp;mol solute per mole of ammonia and has a [[vapour pressure]] of less than 1&amp;nbsp;bar even at {{convert|25|C|0|abbr=on}}.

===Solutions of metals===
{{See also|Solvated electron}}
Liquid ammonia will dissolve the [[alkali metal]]s and other [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] metals such as [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]. At low concentrations (&lt;0.06&amp;nbsp;mol/L), deep blue solutions are formed: these contain metal cations and [[solvated electron]]s, free electrons that are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules.

These solutions are very useful as strong reducing agents. At higher concentrations, the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity. At low temperatures, the two types of solution can coexist as [[Wiktionary:immiscible|immiscible]] phases.

The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen, [[Standard electrode potential|''E''°]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ 8NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is only +0.04&amp;nbsp;V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the [[Amide|metal amide]] and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions; although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, there is still a risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.

==Ammonia's role in biological systems and human disease==
[[File:Symptoms of hyperammonemia.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Main symptoms of hyperammonemia (ammonia reaching toxic concentrations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/944996-overview |title=eMedicine Specialties &gt; Metabolic Diseases &gt; Hyperammonemia|author= Roth, Karl S. |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ammonia is both a [[metabolic waste]] and a metabolic input throughout the [[biosphere]]. It is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. Therefore, [[nitrogen fixation]] is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing [[legume]]s, benefit from [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with [[rhizobia]] that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Adjei, M. B. |author2=Quesenberry, K. H. |author3=Chamblis, C. G. |title=Nitrogen Fixation and Inoculation of Forage Legumes|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AG152 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520075000/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AG152 |archivedate=20 May 2007 |publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|date=June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by [[enzyme]]s called [[nitrogenase]]s. The overall process is called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation; the scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Igarashi|first1=Robert Y.|last2=Laryukhin|first2=Mikhail|last3=Dos Santos|first3=Patricia C.|last4=Lee|first4=Hong-In|last5=Dean|first5=Dennis R.|last6=Seefeldt|first6=Lance C.|last7=Hoffman|first7=Brian M.|title=Trapping H- Bound to the Nitrogenase FeMo-Cofactor Active Site during H2 Evolution: Characterization by ENDOR Spectroscopy|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=May 2005|volume=127|issue=17|pages=6231–6241|doi=10.1021/ja043596p|pmid=15853328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is also a metabolic product of [[amino acid]] [[deamination]] catalyzed by enzymes such as [[Glutamate dehydrogenase 1#Function|glutamate dehydrogenase 1]]. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to [[urea]], which is much less toxic, particularly less [[#Basicity|basic]]. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of [[urine]]. Most reptiles, birds, insects, and snails excrete [[uric acid]] solely as nitrogenous waste.

===In physiology===
Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The [[liver]] converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]], as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zschocke, Johannes |author2=Hoffman, Georg |title=Vademecum Metabolism|publisher= Schattauer Verlag|year= 2004|isbn=978-3794523856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[α-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two molecules of [[bicarbonate]], which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rose, Burton|author2=Helmut Rennke|title=Renal Pathophysiology|location=Baltimore|publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=1994|isbn=978-0-683-07354-6|url=https://archive.org/details/renalpathophysio0000rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excretion===
{{Main|Excretion}}
Ammonium ions are a [[Toxicity|toxic]] waste product of [[metabolism]] in [[animal]]s. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the [[urea cycle]] to [[urea]], because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into [[uric acid]], which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |author2=Jane B.

===Interstellar space===
Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968, based on [[microwave]] emissions from the direction of the [[Milky Way|galactic core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cheung, A.

The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref name=ho&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ho, P.

The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected:
{{block indent|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Deuterium|D]], NHD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}
The detection of triply [[deuterium|deuterated]] ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce. It is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Millar, T. J.|title=Deuterium Fractionation in Interstellar Clouds|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume= 106|issue=1|pages=73–86|doi=10.1023/A:1024677318645|year=2003|bibcode = 2003SSRv..106...73M |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/660d303243d5bcd4dfe15dca5625d2daaae418af}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its interstellar discovery, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium. With a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been widely astronomically detected – its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles. Listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia.

The study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades. Some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer.

The interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments. The [NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] ratio has been estimated to range from 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; in small dark clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ungerechts, H. |author2=Walmsley, C.

====Single antenna detections====
Radio observations of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope]] reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components – a background ridge and an unresolved core. The background corresponds well with the locations previously detected CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T.

Microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including W3(OH), [[Orion (constellation)|Orion A]], W43, W51, and five sources in the galactic centre.

[[Very Large Array|VLA]] observations of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in seven regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] in L1551, S140, and [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus A]]. Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a highly elongated shape. They may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Torrelles, J. M., Ho, P. T. P., Rodriguez, L. F., Canto, J. |year=1985|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 288|page= 595 |bibcode=1985ApJ...288..595T|doi=10.1086/162825|title=VLA observations of ammonia and continuum in regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the VLA in [[IC 342]]. The hot gas has temperatures above 70 K, which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ho, P. T. P., Martin, R. N., Turner, J. L., Jackson, J. M. |year=1990|journal= Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume= 355|page= L19 |bibcode=1990ApJ...355L..19H|doi=10.1086/185728|title=VLA imaging of extragalactic ammonia – Hot gas in the nucleus of IC 342}}&lt;/ref&gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was also monitored by VLA toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact HII regions: G9.62+0.19, G10.47+0.03, G29.96-0.02, and G31.41+0.31. Based upon temperature and density diagnostics, it is concluded that in general such clumps are probably the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cesaroni, R., Churchwell, E., Hofner, P., Walmsley, C. M., Kurtz, S. |year=1994|journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume= 288|page= 903 |bibcode=1994A&amp;A...288..903C|title=Hot ammonia toward compact HII regions }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Infrared detections====
Absorption at 2.97 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the [[Becklin-Neugebauer Object]] and probably in NGC 2264-IR as well. This detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Knacke, R. F., McCorkle, S., Puetter, R. C., Erickson, E. F., Kraetschmer, W. |year=1982|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 260|page= 141|bibcode=1982ApJ...260..141K|doi=10.1086/160241|title=Observation of interstellar ammonia ice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spectrum of the disk of Jupiter was obtained from the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]], covering the 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; spectral range. Analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Orton, G. S., Aumann, H. H., Martonchik, J. V., Appleby, J. F. |year=1982|journal= Icarus|volume= 52|issue=1|page= 81 |bibcode=1982Icar...52...81O|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(82)90170-1|title=Airborne spectroscopy of Jupiter in the 100- to 300-cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; region: Global properties of ammonia gas and ice haze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of 'dense cores' by using the (J,K) = (1,1) rotating inversion line of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, the cores are not spherically shaped, with aspect ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.4. It is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benson, P. J. |author2=Myers, P. |year=1989|journal= Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume= 71|page= 89 |bibcode=1989ApJS...71...89B|doi=10.1086/191365|title=A survey for dense cores in dark clouds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia has been detected in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco Nebula]] and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which are associated with the high-latitude galactic [[infrared cirrus]]. The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Mebold, U., Heithausen, A., Reif, K.|year= 1987|journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume= 180|page= 213|bibcode=1987A&amp;A...180..213M|title=Ammonia in the galactic halo and the infrared cirrus }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observations of nearby dark clouds====
By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission, it is possible to construct a relation between [[excitation temperature]] and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines—indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ≈10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in dark clouds. Mapping of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.

====UC HII regions====
Ultra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions. Doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars.

====Extragalactic detection====
Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1979A&amp;A....74L...7M|title = Detection of extragalactic ammonia|journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume = 74|issue = 1|pages = L7|last1 = Martin|first1 = R. N.|last2 = Ho|first2 = P. T. P.|year = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Observations of Ammonia in External Galaxies I. NGC 253 and M 82|first1=S.|last1=Takano|first2=N.|last2=Nakai|first3=K.|last3=Kawaguchi|date=1 April 2002|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan|volume=54|issue=2|pages=195–207|doi=10.1093/pasj/54.2.195|bibcode=2002PASJ...54..195T}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by simultaneously measuring several lines, it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies. Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm (≈50 K), originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc. This picture is consistent with the picture within our [[Milky Way]] galaxy—hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc (giant molecular clouds; GMCs).
