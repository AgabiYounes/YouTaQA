'''Ahab''' ({{Hebrew Name|◊ê÷∑◊ó÷∞◊ê÷∏◊ë|A·∫ñ'av| ºA·∏• ºƒÅ·∏á|}}; {{lang-akk|íÄÄíÑ©íÄäíÅç |A·∏´abbu}}; {{lang-grc|·ºàœáŒ±Œ¨Œ≤}} ''Acha√°b''; {{lang-la|Achab}}) was the seventh [[king]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] since [[Jeroboam I]], the son and successor of [[Omri (King of Israel)|Omri]], and the husband of [[Jezebel]] of [[Sidon]], according to the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:29-34|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Hebrew Bible]] presents Ahab as a wicked king, particularly for condoning Jezebel's influence on religious policies and his principal role behind [[Naboth]]'s arbitrary execution.   

The existence of Ahab is historically supported outside the Bible. [[Shalmaneser III]] of [[Assyria]] documented in 853 BC that he defeated an alliance of a dozen kings in the [[Battle of Qarqar]]; one of these was Ahab. He is also mentioned on the inscriptions of the [[Mesha Stele]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkelstein&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Israel|last2=Silberman|first2=Neil Asher|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2001|isbn=978-0-684-86912-4|pages=169‚Äì195|authorlink1=Israel Finkelstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahab became king of Israel in the thirty-eighth year of [[Asa of Judah|Asa, king of Judah]], and reigned for twenty-two years, according to 1 Kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|16:29|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William F. Albright]] dated his reign to 869‚Äì850 BC, while [[E. R. Thiele]] offered the dates 874‚Äì853 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257.&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, [[Michael D. Coogan]] has dated Ahab's reign to 871‚Äì852 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
[[Omri (King of Israel)|Omri]] (Ahab's father and founder of the short-lived [[Omrides|Omri Dynasty]]) seems to have been a successful military leader; he is reported in the text of the Moabite [[Mesha Stele]] to have &quot;oppressed Moab for many days.&quot; During Ahab's reign, [[Moab]], which had been conquered by his father, remained tributary. Ahab was allied by marriage with [[Jehoshaphat]], who was king of [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. Only with [[Aram Damascus]] is he believed to have had strained relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Ahab|volume=1|pages=428‚Äì429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahab married [[Jezebel]], the daughter of the King of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]]. 1 Kings 16‚Äì22 tells the story of Ahab and Jezebel, and indicates that Jezebel was a dominant influence on Ahab, persuading him to abandon Yahweh and establish the religion of [[Baal]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Kings]] 16:31, 18:4‚Äì19, 19:1‚Äì2, 21:5‚Äì25.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahab lived in [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], the royal capital established by Omri, and built a temple and altar to [[Baal]] there.&lt;ref&gt;1 Kings 16:32&lt;/ref&gt; These actions were said to have led to severe consequences for Israel, including a [[drought]] that lasted for several years and Jezebel's fanatical [[religious persecution]] of the [[prophet]]s of [[Yahweh]], which Ahab condoned. His reputation was so negative that in 1 Kings 16:34, the author attributed to his reign the deaths of [[Abiram]] and [[Segub]], the sons of Hiel of [[Bethel]], caused by their father's invocation of [[Battle of Jericho|Joshua's curse several centuries ago]]. Ahab was succeeded by [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] and [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], who reigned over Israel until Jehu's revolt of 842 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Qarqar===
The [[Battle of Qarqar]] is mentioned in extra-biblical records, and was perhaps at [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]], where [[Shalmaneser III]] of [[Assyria]] fought a great confederation of princes from [[Cilicia]], Northern [[Syria]], Israel, [[Ammon]], and the tribes of the Syrian desert (853 BC), including Ahab the Israelite (''A-ha-ab-bu &lt;sup&gt;mat&lt;/sup&gt;Sir-'a-la-a-a'')&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;Craig, James A. &quot;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/527096.pdf The Monolith Inscription of Salmaneser II]&quot;. ''Hebraica'', 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hadadezer]] (''Adad-'idri'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Ahab's contribution was estimated at 2,000 [[chariot]]s and 10,000 men. In reality, however, the number of chariots in Ahab's forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds (based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found).&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael D. Coogan 2009&quot;&gt;Michael D. Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament'', (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 243.&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, the numbers are referring to allies it could possibly include forces from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], Judah, [[Edom]], and Moab. The Assyrian king claimed a victory, but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in 849 BC and 846 BC against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success. According to the [[Tanakh]], however, Ahab with 7,000 troops had previously overthrown [[Ben-Hadad I|Ben-hadad]] and his thirty-two kings, who had come to lay siege to [[Samaria]], and in the following year obtained a decisive victory over him at [[Aphek (biblical)|Aphek]], probably in the [[plain of Sharon]] at [[Antipatris]] (1 Kings 20). A treaty was made whereby Ben-hadad restored the cities which his father had taken from Ahab's father, and trading facilities between Damascus and Samaria were granted.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

[[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]] has been identified as Ahab's fortified chariot and cavalry base.&lt;ref name=Ussishkin&gt;David Ussishkin, &quot;Jezreel‚ÄîWhere Jezebel Was Thrown to the Dogs&quot;, ''Biblical Archaeology Review'' July / August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahab and the Prophets===
In the Biblical text, Ahab has five important encounters with prophets:
#The first encounter is with [[Elijah]], who predicts a drought because of Ahab's sins (1 Kings 17:1). Because of this, Ahab refers to him as &quot;the troubler of Israel&quot; (1 Kings 18:17). This encounter ends with Elijah's victory over the prophets of [[Baal]] in a contest held for the sake of Ahab and the Israelites, to bring them into [[repentance]]. (1 Kings 18:17‚Äì40).
#The second encounter is between Ahab and an unnamed prophet in 1 Kings 20:22.
#The third is again between Ahab and an unnamed prophet who condemns Ahab for his actions in a battle that had just taken place (1 Kings 20:34-43).
#The fourth is when Elijah confronts Ahab over his role in the unjust execution of [[Naboth]] and usurpation of the latter's ancestral vineyard (1 Kings 21:1-16). Upon the prophet's remonstration (&quot;Hast thou killed and also taken possession?&quot; (1 Kings, 21:19)), Ahab sincerely repented, which God relays to Elijah (1 Kings 21:27).
#The fifth encounter is with [[Micaiah]], the prophet who, when asked for advice to recapturing [[Ramoth-Gilead]], sarcastically assures Ahab that he will be successful. Micaiah ultimately tells him the truth of God's plan to kill Ahab in battle, due to his reliance on the false prophets, [[Demonic possession|who were empowered by a deceiving spirit]] (1 Kings 22).&lt;ref&gt;Achtemeier, Paul (Editor), ''The HarperCollins Bible Dictionary'', (New York: HarperCollins, 1996), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Ahab===
[[File:093.The Death of Ahab.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Death of Ahab, by Gustave Dor√©]]
Three years later, war broke out east of the [[Jordan River]], and Ahab with Jehoshaphat of Judah went to recover Ramoth-Gilead from the Arameans.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; During this battle, Ahab disguised himself, but he was mortally wounded by an unaimed arrow (1 Kings 22). The Hebrew Bible says that dogs licked his blood, according to the prophecy of Elijah. But the [[Septuagint]] (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) adds that pigs also licked his blood, symbolically making him unclean to the Israelites, who abstained from pork. Ahab was succeeded by his sons, [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]] and [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]].

Jezebel's death, however, was more dramatic than Ahab's. As recorded in 2 Kings 9:30-34, Jezebel was confronted by [[Jehu]] who had her servants [[Defenestration|throw her out the window]], causing her death.

==Legacy==
1 Kings 16:29 through 22:40 contains the narrative of Ahab's reign. His reign was slightly more emphasised upon than the previous kings, due to his blatant trivialization of the &quot;sins of [[Jeroboam]]&quot;, which the previous kings of Israel were plagued by, and his subsequent marriage with a pagan princess, the nationwide institution of Baal worship, the persecution of Yahweh's prophets and Naboth's shocking murder. These offenses and atrocities stirred up [[Populism|populist]] resentment from figures such as Elijah and Micaiah. Indeed, he is referred to by the author of Kings as being &quot;more evil than all the kings before him&quot; (1 Kings 16:30).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Nonetheless, there were achievements that the author took note of, including his ability to fortify numerous Israelite cities and build an ivory palace (1 Kings 22:39). Adherents of the Yahwist religion found their principal champion in Elijah. His denunciation of the royal dynasty of Israel and his emphatic insistence on the worship of Yahweh and Yahweh alone, illustrated by the contest between Yahweh and Baal on [[Mount Carmel]] (1 Kings 18), form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of [[Jehu]], an event in which Elijah's chosen disciple [[Elisha]] was the leading figure and the Omride Dynasty was brutally defeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

==In Rabbinic Literature==
One of the three or four wicked kings of Israel singled out by tradition as being excluded from the future world of bliss (Sanh. x. 2; Tosef., Sanh. xii. 11). Midrash Konen places him in the fifth department of Gehenna, as having the heathen under his charge. Though held up as a warning to sinners, Ahab is also described as displaying noble traits of character (Sanh. 102b; Yer. Sanh. xi. 29b). Talmudic literature represents him as an enthusiastic idolater who left no hilltop in Palestine without an idol before which he bowed, and to which he or his wife, Jezebel, brought his weight in gold as a daily offering. So defiant in his apostasy was he that he had inscribed on all the doors of the city of Samaria the words, &quot;Ahab hath abjured the living God of Israel.&quot; Nevertheless, he paid great respect to the representatives of learning, &quot;to the Torah given in twenty-two letters,&quot; for which reason he was permitted to reign for twenty-two successive years. He generously supported the students of the Law out of his royal treasury, in consequence of which half his sins were forgiven him. A type of worldliness (Ber. 61b), the Cr≈ìsus of his time, he was, according to ancient tradition (Meg. 11a), ruler over the whole world. Two hundred and thirty subject kings had initiated a rebellion; but he brought their sons as hostages to Samaria and Jerusalem. All the latter turned from idolaters into worshipers of the God of Israel (Tanna debe Eliyahu, i. 9). Each of his seventy sons had an ivory palace built for him. Since, however, it was Ahab's idolatrous wife who was the chief instigator of his crimes (B. M. 59a), some of the ancient teachers gave him the same position in the world to come as a sinner who had repented (Sanh. 104b, Num. R. xiv). Like Manasseh, he was made a type of repentance (I Kings, xxi. 29). Accordingly, he is described as undergoing fasts and penances for a long time; praying thrice a day to God for forgiveness, until his prayer was heard (Pir·∏≤e R. El. xliii). Hence, the name of Ahab in the list of wicked kings was changed to Ahaz (Yer. Sanh. x. 28b; Tanna debe Eliyahu Rabba ix, Zu·π≠·π≠a xxiv.).&lt;ref&gt;McCurdy, J. Frederic, and Kaufmann Kohler (1906). &quot;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/955-ahab Ahab]&quot;. ''Jewish Encyclopedia.''&lt;/ref&gt;
Pseudo-Epiphanius (&quot;Opera,&quot; ii. 245) makes Micah an Ephraimite. Confounding him with Micaiah, son of Imlah (I Kings xxii. 8 et seq.), he states that Micah, for his inauspicious prophecy, was killed by order of Ahab through being thrown from a precipice, and was buried at Morathi (Maroth?; Mic. i. 12), near the cemetery of Enakim (ŒàŒΩŒ±Œ∫Œµ·Ω∂Œº Septuagint rendering of ; ib. i. 10). According to &quot;Gelilot Ere·∫ì Yisrael&quot; (quoted in &quot;Seder ha-Dorot,&quot; i. 118, Warsaw, 1889), Micah was buried in Chesil, a town in southern Judah (Josh. xv. 30).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10776-micah Micah Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Naboth's soul was the lying spirit that was permitted to deceive Ahab to his death&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aish.com/atr/The-Lying-Spirit-Which-Deceived-Ahab.html Aish.com The Lying spirit which deceived Ahab]&lt;/ref&gt;
