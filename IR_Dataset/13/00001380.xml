The [[family (biology)|family]] '''Alligatoridae''' of [[crocodylia]]ns includes [[alligator]]s and [[caiman]]s.

==Phylogeny==
[[File:Alligator prenasalis.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Alligator prenasalis]]'' fossil]]
The superfamily [[Alligatoroidea]] includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) that are more closely related to the American alligator than to either the [[Nile crocodile]] or the [[gharial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brochu |first=Christopher A. |title=Phylogenetic approaches toward crocodylian history |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=31 |year=2003 |pages=357–97 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141308 |url=http://www.divms.uiowa.edu/~cremer/courses/fys07/homeworks/CrocodylianPhylogeny.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=2003AREPS..31..357B }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of this superfamily first arose in the [[late Cretaceous]]. ''[[Leidyosuchus]]'' of [[Alberta]] is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and the [[Bering Strait]] have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, [[Paleogene]], and [[Neogene]] periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before the closure of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed [[Beringia|the Bering land bridge]] during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3889340|title=Phylogenetics, Taxonomy, and Historical Biogeography of Alligatoroidea|last=Brochu|first=Christopher A.|journal=Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Memoir|volume=6|year=1999|pages=9–100|jstor=3889340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alligator's full [[mitochondrial genome]] was sequenced in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold-blooded vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Janke, A. |author2=Arnason, U. |year=1997|title=The complete mitochondrial genome of Alligator mississippiensis and the separation between recent archosauria (birds and crocodiles)|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=14|issue=12|pages=1266–72|pmid=9402737|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025736}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full [[genome]], published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Green RE, Braun EL, Armstrong J, Earl D, Nguyen N, Hickey G, Vandewege MW, St John JA, Capella-Gutiérrez S, Castoe TA, Kern C, Fujita MK, Opazo JC, Jurka J, Kojima KK, Caballero J, Hubley RM, Smit AF, Platt RN, Lavoie CA, Ramakodi MP, Finger JW, Suh A, Isberg SR, Miles L, Chong AY, Jaratlerdsiri W, Gongora J, Moran C, Iriarte A, McCormack J, Burgess SC, Edwards SV, Lyons E, Williams C, Breen M, Howard JT, Gresham CR, Peterson DG, Schmitz J, Pollock DD, Haussler D, Triplett EW, Zhang G, Irie N, Jarvis ED, Brochu CA, Schmidt CJ, McCarthy FM, Faircloth BC, Hoffmann FG, Glenn TC, Gabaldón T, Paten B, Ray DA |title=Three crocodilian genomes reveal ancestral patterns of evolution among archosaurs |journal=Science |volume=346 |issue=6215 |page=1254449 |year=2014 |pmid=25504731 |pmc=4386873 |doi=10.1126/science.1254449 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== True alligators ==
The lineage including alligators proper ([[Alligatorinae]]) occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the [[Cretaceous|Upper Chalk]] in Europe, where they did not die out until the [[Pliocene]] age. The true alligators are today represented by two species, ''[[American alligator|A. mississippiensis]]'' in the [[southeastern United States]], which can grow to 15&amp;nbsp;ft (4.6&amp;nbsp;m) and weigh 1000&amp;nbsp;lbs (453&amp;nbsp;kg)&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/american-alligator/?source=A-to-Z &quot;American alligator&quot;]. ''animals.nationalgeographic.com''. National Geographic Society.&lt;/ref&gt; and the small ''[[Chinese Alligator|A. sinensis]]'' in the [[Yangtze River]], [[China]], which grows to an average of 5&amp;nbsp;ft (1.5&amp;nbsp;m). Their name derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el lagarto'', which means &quot;the lizard&quot;.

== Caimans ==
In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily [[Caimaninae]], which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony [[scute]]s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Besides the three species in ''[[Caiman (genus)|Caiman]]'', the smooth-fronted caimans in genus ''[[Paleosuchus]]'' and the black caiman in ''[[Melanosuchus]]'' are described. Caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guggisberg&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Guggisberg, C.A.W. |url =  | title = Crocodiles: Their Natural History, Folklore, and Conservation| year = 1972 | page = 195 | isbn = 978-0-7153-5272-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''C. crocodilus'', the [[spectacled caiman]], has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about {{convert|2.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The largest is the [[red list|near-threatened]] ''Melanosuchus niger'', the ''jacare-assu'' or large or [[black caiman]] of the [[Amazon River]] basin. Black caimans grow to {{convert|16.5|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}}, with the largest recorded size {{convert|5.79|m|abbr=on}}. The black caiman and [[American alligator]] are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the [[crocodile]] family.

Although caimans have not been studied in depth, scientists have learned their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring.

== Differences from crocodiles ==

[[Alligator]]s differ from crocodiles principally in having wider and shorter heads, with more obtuse snouts; in having the fourth, enlarged tooth of the under jaw received, not into an external notch, but into a pit formed for it within the upper one; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the [[crocodile]]; in having the toes of the hind feet webbed not more than half way to the tips; and a difference in habitat, alligators generally being found in fresh water (though they have been found in salt marshes as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Isabelle Groc |title=Why alligators, wolves and mountain lions are turning up in odd places |journal=New Scientist |date=Oct 27, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24032010-300-why-alligators-wolves-and-mountain-lions-are-turning-up-in-odd-places/}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while crocodiles can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt. In general, crocodiles tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligators. Another recently discovered trait is that of both caimans and American alligators partaking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/10/alligators_eat_fruit.php |author=Naish, Darren |date=3 October 2008 |title=Tetrapod Zoology: Alligators eat fruit |website=scienceblogs.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210205941/http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2008/10/alligators_eat_fruit.php |archivedate=10 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
