'''Anazarbus ''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀναζαρβός}}, medieval '''Ain Zarba'''; modern '''Anavarza'''; {{lang-ar|عَيْنُ زَرْبَة}}) was an ancient [[Cilicia]]n city. Under the late Roman Empire, it was the capital of [[Cilicia Secunda]]. It was destroyed in 1374.

== Location ==
It was situated in [[Anatolia]] in modern Turkey, in the present [[Çukurova]] (or classical [[Aleian plain]]) about 15&amp;nbsp;km west of the main stream of the present [[Ceyhan River]] (or classical [[Pyramus river]]) and near its tributary the [[Sempas Su]].

A lofty isolated ridge formed its [[acropolis]]. Though some of the masonry in the ruins is certainly pre-Roman, the [[Suda]]'s identification of it with [[Cyinda]], famous as a treasure city in the wars of [[Eumenes of Cardia]], cannot be accepted in the face of [[Strabo]]'s express location of Cyinda in western Cilicia.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Anazarbus|volume=1|page=944|first=David George|last=Hogarth|authorlink=David George Hogarth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was founded by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. It was situated on the [[Pyramus]]. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', the original name of the place was '''Cyinda''' or '''Kyinda''' or '''Quinda''' ({{lang-gr|Κύϊνδα}}); that it was next called '''Diocaesarea'''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Suda]]'', ''s.v.'' Κύϊνδα.&lt;/ref&gt; How the city obtained the name Anazarbus (Ἀνάζαρβος) or '''Anazarba''' (Ἀνάζαρβα), as it was also known, is a matter of conjecture. According to [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], after the city was destroyed by an earthquake, the emperor [[Nerva]] sent thither one Anazarbus, a man of senatorial rank, who rebuilt the city, and gave to it his own name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Stephanus|''s.v.'' Ἀνάζαρβος}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account cannot be accurate, as [[Henri Valois|Valesius]] remarks,&lt;ref&gt;Amm. Marc. 14.8.&lt;/ref&gt; for it was called Anazarbus in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Pliny|5.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dioscorides]] is called a native of Anazarbus; but the period of Dioscorides is not certain. It was also the home of the poet [[Oppian]]. Its later name was '''Caesarea ad Anazarbum''', and there are many medals of the place in which it is both named Anazarbus and Caesarea at or under Anazarbus. On the division of Cilicia it became the chief place of the [[Roman province]] of [[Cilicia Secunda]], with the title of Metropolis. It suffered dreadfully from an earthquake both in the time of [[Eastern Roman emperor]] [[Justinian I]], and, still more, in the reign of his successor [[Justin I]]. After Justinian rebuilt the place, it was renamed '''Justinianopolis''' or '''Ioustinianoupolis''' (Ἰουστινιανούπολις). Rebuilt by [[Justin I]] after the earthquake in the 6th century, it became '''Justinopolis''' or '''Ioustinoupolis''' (Ἰουστινούπολις) (525); but the old name persisted, and when [[Thoros I of Armenia|Thoros I]], king of [[Lesser Armenia]], made it his capital early in the 12th century, it was known as '''Anazarva'''.

== Remains ==
Its great natural strength and situation, not far from the mouth of the Sis pass, and near the great road which [[debouch]]ed from the [[Cilician Gates]], made Anazarbus play a considerable part in the struggles between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the early Muslim invaders. It had been rebuilt by [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 796, refortified at great expense by the [[Hamdanid]] [[Sayf al-Dawla]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; (mid-10th century) and again destroyed in 962 by [[Nikephoros II Phokas]].

In late 1097 or early 1098 it was captured by the armies of the [[First Crusade]] and was incorporated into Bohemond's Principality of Antioch.  The Crusaders are probably responsible for the construction of an impressive donjon atop the center of the outcrop.  Most of the remaining fortifications, including the curtain walls, massive horse-shaped towers, undercrofts, cisterns, and free-standing structures date from the Armenian periods of occupation, which began with the arrival of the [[Thoros I, Prince of Armenia|Rubenid Baron T‛oros I]], {{circa|1111}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;edwards&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII |date=1987 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University| location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-88402-163-7|pages=65–72, 281, pls.9a–18b, 287b–289c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site briefly exchanged hands between the Greeks and Armenians, until it was formally part of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].  Within the fortress are two Armenian chapels and the magnificent (but severely damaged) three-aisle church built by T‛oros I to celebrate his conquests.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Edwards, &quot;Ecclesiastical Architecture in the Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: First Report, ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 36, 1982, pp.156–61, 168, pls.1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Edwards, &quot;Ecclesiastical Architecture in the Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Second Report, ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 37, 1983, pp.128–34, pls.2, 18–29, 36–46.&lt;/ref&gt;  The church was once surrounded by a continuous, well-executed dedicatory inscription in Armenian.

The [[Mamluk]] Empire of Egypt finally destroyed the city in 1374.

The present wall of the lower city is of late construction. It encloses a mass of ruins conspicuous in which are a fine [[triumphal arch]], the colonnades of two streets, a [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], etc. A stadium and a theatre lie outside the walls to the south. The remains of the acropolis fortifications are very interesting, including roads and ditches hewn in the rock. There are no notable structures in the upper town. For picturesqueness the site is not equaled in Cilicia, and it is worthwhile to trace the three fine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to their sources.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;  A necropolis on the escarpment to the south of the curtain wall can also be seen complete with signs of illegal modern excavations.

A visit in December 2002 showed that the three aqueducts mentioned above have been nearly completely destroyed. Only small, isolated sections are left standing with the largest portion lying in a pile of rubble that stretches the length of where the aqueducts once stood. A powerful earthquake that struck the area in 1945 is thought to be responsible for the destruction.

A modest Turkish farming village ([[Dilekkaya, Kozan|Dilekkaya]]) lies to the southwest of the ancient city. A small outdoor museum with some of the artifacts collected in the area can be viewed for a small fee. Also nearby are some beautiful mosaics discovered in a farmers field.  Inquire at the museum for a viewing.

Anazarbus/Anavarsa was one of a chain of Armenian fortifications stretching through Cilicia.  The [[Sis (ancient city)|castle of Sis]] (modern [[Kozan, Adana]]) lies to the north while Tumlu Castle and [[Yilankale]] are to the south, and the fortresses of [[Amouda]] and [[Sarvandikar]] are to the east.

In 2013, excavations uncovered the first known colonnaded double-lane road of the ancient world, 34 meters wide and 2700 meters long, also uncovered the ruins of a church and a bathhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailysabah.com&quot;&gt;[https://www.dailysabah.com/history/2017/11/26/statue-of-hygieia-and-eros-uncovered-in-southern-turkey Statue of Hygieia and Eros uncovered in southern Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, archaeologists discovered a limestone statue of the goddess [[Hygieia]] and the god [[Eros]]. The statue is thought to date to the third or fourth century B.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailysabah.com&quot;/&gt;

== Ecclesiastical history ==

Anazarbus was the capital and so also from 553 (the date of the [[Second Council of Constantinople]]) the [[metropolitan see]] of the Late [[Roman province]] of [[Cilicia Secunda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;edwards4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W., &quot;Anazarbos&quot; |title=The Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Early Christian Art and Archaeology, ed., Paul Corby Finney |date=2016 |publisher=William B.

In the 4th century, one of the bishops of Anazarbus was Athanasius, a &quot;consistent expounder of the theology of Arius.&quot; His theological opponent, Athanasius of Alexandria, in ''De Synodis'' 17, 1 refers to Anazarbus as Ναζαρβῶν.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. C. Hanson, The Search for the Christian Doctrine of God: The Arian Controversy 318-381 (Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1988), 41-3, quote, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 6th century ''[[Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' indicates that it had as [[suffragan]] sees [[Epiphania, Cilicia|Epiphania]], [[Alexandria Minor]], [[Irenopolis, Cilicia|Irenopolis]], [[Flavias]], [[Castabala (city)|Castabala]] and [[Aegeae (Cilicia)|Aegeae]]. [[Arsuz|Rhosus]] was also subject to Anazarbus, but after the 6th century was made exempt, and [[Mopsuestia]] was raised to the rank of [[autcephalous]] [[metropolitan see]], though without suffragans.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Le Quien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 885–888&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaetano Moroni, ''Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7QAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA40 Vol. 2], pp.&amp;nbsp;40–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siméon Vailhé, v.
