'''The Apache Software Foundation''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|æ|tʃ|i}} ('''ASF''') is an American [[non-profit corporation]] (classified as a [[501(c)(3) organization]] in the United States) to support Apache software projects, including the [[Apache HTTP Server]]. The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated on March 25, 1999.&lt;ref name=incorporation&gt;
{{cite web |first=Roy T. |last=Fielding |title=Certificate of Incorporation of the Apache Software Foundation |url=https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/certificate.html |accessdate=May 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531160220/http://apache.org/foundation/records/certificate.html |archivedate=May 31, 2009  |url-status=live}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=effDate&gt;{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Jagielski |title=The Apache Software Foundation Board of Directors Meeting Minutes 01 June 1999 |url=https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/1999/board_minutes_1999_06_01.txt |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the [[Apache License]] and is [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a [[meritocracy]], implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation&lt;ref&gt;[[François Letellier]], see 'Third Generation Open Source'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open-source software|open-source]] organization, in that commercial support is provided without the risk of [[platform lock-in]].

Among the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection&lt;ref&gt;''See'' the [[Volunteer Protection Act]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; to volunteers working on Apache projects; to prevent the ''Apache'' brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.

The ASF also holds several [[ApacheCon]] conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apachecon.com/ |title=apachecon.com |publisher=apachecon.com |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server, development beginning in February 1993. A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the [[NCSA HTTPd]] [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]. They came to be known as the Apache Group. On March 25, 1999, the Apache Software Foundation was formed.&lt;ref name=incorporation/&gt; The first official meeting of the Apache Software Foundation was held on April 13, 1999, and by general consent that the initial membership list of the Apache Software Foundation, would be: [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Ken Coar]], Miguel Gonzales, Mark Cox, [[Lars Eilebrecht]], Ralf S. Engelschall, [[Roy Fielding|Roy T. Fielding]], Dean Gaudet, Ben Hyde, [[Jim Jagielski]], Alexei Kosut, Martin Kraemer, [[Ben Laurie]], Doug MacEachern, Aram Mirzadeh, [[Sameer Parekh]], Cliff Skolnick, Marc Slemko, William (Bill) Stoddard, Paul Sutton, [[Randy Terbush]] and [[Dirk-Willem van Gulik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apache Software Foundation Board of Directors Meeting Minutes 13 April 1999|url=https://www.apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/1999/board_minutes_1999_04_13.txt|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation, the effective incorporation date of the Apache Software Foundation was set to June 1, 1999.&lt;ref name=effDate/&gt;

The foundation states that the [[Apache HTTP Server#Name|name 'Apache']] was chosen &quot;from respect for the Native American [[Apache]] Nation, well known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance&quot;.

==Projects==
{{See also|List of Apache Software Foundation projects}}
Apache divides its [[software development]] activities into separate semi-autonomous areas called &quot;top-level projects&quot; (formally known as a &quot;Project Management Committee&quot; in the bylaws&lt;ref name=bylaws&gt;
{{cite web |title=Bylaws of The Apache Software Foundation |url=https://www.apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html |publisher=Apache Software Foundation |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725012133/http://apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html |archivedate=July 25, 2011  |url-status=live}}
&lt;/ref&gt;), some of which have a number of sub-projects. Unlike some other organizations that host [[Free and open-source software|FOSS]] projects, before a project is hosted at Apache it has to be licensed to the ASF with a grant or contributor agreement.&lt;ref name=licenses&gt;
{{cite web |title=Licenses |url=https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas |publisher=Apache Software Foundation |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725011702/http://www.apache.org/licenses/ |archivedate=July 25, 2011  |url-status=live}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the ASF gains the necessary intellectual property rights for the development and distribution of all its projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=St. Amant |first=Kirk |author2=Brian Still |title=Handbook of research on open source software: technological, economic, and social perspectives |publisher=Idea Group Inc (IGI) |year=2007 |pages=217–219 |isbn=978-1-59140-999-1 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=75KT6GdcWbYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=%22apache+foundation%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22apache%20foundation%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==
The Board of Directors of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is responsible for management and oversight of the business and affairs of the corporation in accordance with the Bylaws. This includes management of the corporate assets (funds, intellectual property, trademarks, and support equipment), appointment of a President and corporate officers managing the core operations of the ASF, and allocation of corporate resources for the benefit of Apache projects. Importantly, Technical decision-making authority for every Apache project is assigned to their independent project management committee; the participants in each project provide direction, not the board.
The board is elected annually by the ASF membership.

Board meetings and minutes are published on the board calendar. Many other public records of our corporation are published publicly. Information about Apache corporate governance and organization and how board meetings work are also available.

The current board of directors is:

*Danny Angus

*Rich Bowen

*Shane Curcuru

*Ted Dunning

*Dave Fisher

*Myrle Krantz

*Daniel Ruggeri

*Craig Russell

*Roman Shaposhnik
