In [[computer science]], a '''data structure''' is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables [[Algorithmic efficiency|efficient]] access and modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1614191|title=Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition|last=Cormen|first=Thomas H.|last2=Leiserson|first2=Charles E.|last3=Rivest|first3=Ronald L.|last4=Stein|first4=Clifford|date=2009|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=978-0262033848|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Black |first1=Paul E. |editor1-last=Pieterse |editor1-first=Vreda |editor2-last=Black |editor2-first=Paul E. |title=Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures [online] |date=15 December 2004 |publisher=[[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] |chapter-url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/datastructur.html |accessdate=2018-11-06 |chapter=data structure}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |title= Data structure |url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/data-structure |access-date=2018-11-06 |edition= |date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a data structure is a collection of [[Data|data values]], the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1074100.1074312|title=Encyclopedia of Computer Science|last=Wegner|first=Peter|last2=Reilly|first2=Edwin D.|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |isbn=978-0470864128|location=Chichester, UK|pages=507–512|date=2003-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

Data structures serve as the basis for [[abstract data type]]s (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abstract Data Types |url=https://opendsa-server.cs.vt.edu/ODSA/Books/CS3/html/ADT.html |website=Virginia Tech - CS3 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, [[relational database]]s commonly use [[B-tree]] indexes for data retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/generic/0,295582,sid87_gci1184450,00.html|title=Beginning Database Design|isbn=978-0-7645-7490-0|author=Gavin Powell|chapter=Chapter 8: Building Fast-Performing Database Models|publisher=[[Wrox Press|Wrox Publishing]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[compiler]] implementations usually use [[hash table]]s to look up identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1.5 Applications of a Hash Table |url=http://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/210/Hash/ |website=University of Regina - CS210 Lab: Hash Table}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large [[database]]s and [[web indexing|internet indexing services]]. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient [[algorithm]]s. Some formal design methods and [[programming language]]s emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both [[main memory]] and [[secondary memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=When data is too big to fit into the main memory |url=http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/yye/lab/teaching/spring2014-C343/datatoobig.php |website=homes.sice.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Data structures are generally based on the ability of a [[computer]] to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]—a bit string, representing a [[memory address]], that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated  by the program. Thus, the [[Array data structure|array]] and [[record (computer science)|record]] data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with [[arithmetic operations]], while the [[linked data structure]]s are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself. 

The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of [[subroutine|procedures]] that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an [[abstract data type]], a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/883695533|title=Advanced biotechnology : For B Sc and M Sc students of biotechnology and other biological sciences.|last=Dubey, R. C.|date=2014|publisher=S Chand|isbn=978-81-219-4290-4|location=New Delhi|oclc=883695533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{main article|List of data structures}}
There are numerous types of data structures, generally built upon simpler [[primitive data type]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Data structures|last=Seymour|first=Lipschutz|date=2014|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|isbn=9781259029967|edition=Revised first|location=New Delhi, India|oclc=927793728}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An [[array data structure|''array'']] is a number of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type (depending on the language, individual elements may either all be forced to be the same type, or may be of almost any type). Elements are accessed using an integer index to specify which element is required. Typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for the elements of arrays (but this is not always a necessity). Arrays may be fixed-length or resizable.
* A ''[[linked list]]'' (also just called ''list'') is a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list. The principal advantage of a linked list over an array, is that values can always be efficiently inserted and removed without relocating the rest of the list. Certain other operations, such as [[random access]] to a certain element, are however slower on lists than on arrays.
* A [[Record (computer science)|''record'']] (also called ''tuple'' or ''struct'') is an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called ''fields'' or ''members''.
* A [[Union (computer science)|''union'']] is a data structure that specifies which of a number of permitted primitive types may be stored in its instances, e.g. ''float'' or ''long integer''. Contrast with a [[record (computer science)|record]], which could be defined to contain a float ''and'' an integer; whereas in a union, there is only one value at a time. Enough space is allocated to contain the widest member datatype.
* A ''[[tagged union]]'' (also called [[variant type|''variant'']], ''variant record'', ''discriminated union'', or ''disjoint union'') contains an additional field indicating its current type, for enhanced type safety.
* An [[Object (computer science)|''object'']] is a data structure that contains data fields, like a record does, as well as various [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] which operate on the data contents. An object is an in-memory instance of a class from a taxonomy. In the context of [[object-oriented programming]], records are known as [[plain old data structure]]s to distinguish them from objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnal.gov/docs/working-groups/fpcltf/Pkg/ISOcxx/doc/POD.html |accessdate=6 December 2016 |title=C++ Language Note: POD Types |author=Walter E. Brown |publisher=[[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]] |date=September 29, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203130543/http://www.fnal.gov/docs/working-groups/fpcltf/Pkg/ISOcxx/doc/POD.html|archive-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Graph (computer science)|''graphs'']] and ''[[binary trees]]'' are other commonly used data structures.

==Language support==
Most [[assembly language]]s and some [[Low-level programming language|low-level languages]], such as [[BCPL]] (Basic Combined Programming Language), lack built-in support for data structures. On the other hand, many [[high-level programming language]]s and some higher-level assembly languages, such as [[MASM]], have special syntax or other built-in support for certain data structures, such as records and arrays. For example, the [[C (programming language)|C]] (a direct descendant of BCPL) and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] languages support [[Record (computer science)|structs]] and records, respectively, in addition to vectors (one-dimensional [[array data type|arrays]]) and multi-dimensional arrays.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu-c&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html | title=The GNU C Manual | publisher=Free Software Foundation | accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.freepascal.org/docs-html/ref/ref.html | title=Free Pascal: Reference Guide | publisher=Free Pascal | accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most programming languages feature some sort of [[Library (computing)|library]] mechanism that allows data structure implementations to be reused by different programs. Modern languages usually come with standard libraries that implement the most common data structures. Examples are the [[C++]] [[Standard Template Library]], the [[Java Collections Framework]], and the [[Microsoft]] [[.NET Framework]].

Modern languages also generally support [[modular programming]], the separation between the [[interface (computing)|interface]] of a library module and its implementation. Some provide [[opaque data type]]s that allow clients to hide implementation details. [[Object-oriented programming language]]s, such as [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Smalltalk]], typically use [[classes (computer science)|classes]] for this purpose.

Many known data structures have [[concurrent data structure|concurrent]] versions which allow multiple computing threads to access a single concrete instance of a data structure simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mark Moir and Nir Shavit |title=Concurrent Data Structures |url=https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~shanir/concurrent-data-structures.pdf |website=cs.tau.ac.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;
