Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-2327-4|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;)}} is described in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as the third king of the [[Kingdom of Israel (United Monarchy)|United Monarchy of Israel and Judah]], becoming king after [[Ish-bosheth]]. In the [[Books of Samuel]], David is a young shepherd who gains fame first as a musician and later by killing the enemy champion [[Goliath]]. He becomes a favorite of [[Saul|King Saul]] and a [[David and Jonathan|close friend]] of Saul's son [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]]. Worried that David is trying to take his throne, Saul turns on David. After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle, David is [[Anointing|anointed]] as King. David conquers [[Jerusalem]], taking the [[Ark of the Covenant]] into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul. As king, David commits adultery with [[Bathsheba]], leading him to arrange the death of her husband [[Uriah the Hittite]]. Because of this sin, God denies David the opportunity to build the temple, and his son [[Absalom]] tries to overthrow him. David flees Jerusalem during Absalom's rebellion, but after Absalom's death he returns to the city to rule Israel. Before his peaceful death, he chooses his son [[Solomon]] as successor. He is honored in the [[Nevi'im|prophetic literature]] as an ideal king and the forefather of a future [[Messiah]], and many [[psalms]] are ascribed to him.

Historians of the [[Ancient Near East]] agree that David probably existed around 1000 BCE, but that there is little that can be said about him as a historical figure. It was initially thought that there was no evidence outside of the Bible concerning David, but the [[Tel Dan Stele]], an inscribed stone erected by a king of [[Damascus]] in the late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings, contains the phrase in {{lang-he|ביתדוד}}, ''bytdwd'', which most scholars translate as &quot;[[Davidic line|House of David]]&quot;.  Ancient Near East historians generally doubt that the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]] as described in the Bible existed.

David is richly represented in post-biblical Jewish written and oral tradition, and is discussed in the [[New Testament]]. [[Early Christians]] interpreted the life of [[Jesus]] in light of the references to the Messiah and to David; Jesus is described as being [[Davidic line|descended from David]]. David is discussed in the [[Quran]] as a major prophet and figures in Islamic oral and written tradition as well. The biblical character of David has inspired many interpretations in art and literature over centuries.

The [[Book of Chronicles]] lists his sons with his various wives and [[concubine]]s. In [[Hebron]], David had six sons: [[Amnon]], by [[Ahinoam]]; [[Daniel (son of David)|Daniel]], by [[Abigail]]; [[Absalom]], by [[Maachah]]; [[Adonijah]], by [[Haggith]]; [[Shephatiah]], by [[Abital]]; and [[Ithream]], by [[Eglah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:1–3|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Bathsheba, his sons were [[Shammua]], Shobab, [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], and [[Solomon]].

His daughter [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], by Maachah, is raped by her half-brother Amnon. David fails to bring Amnon to justice for his violation of Tamar, because he is his firstborn and he loves him, and so, Absalom murders Amnon to avenge Tamar.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version of 2 Samuel 13:21, &quot;... he did not punish his son Amnon, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn.&quot;  {{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+13&amp;version=NLT#fen-NLT-8315d|title=2 Samuel 13 NLT|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2019-09-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923043508/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+13&amp;version=NLT#fen-NLT-8315d|archive-date=2019-09-23|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative===
{{Anchor|childhood|Jesse|Bethlehem|Saul rejected}}
[[File:Samuel e david.jpg|left|thumb|[[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] [[anoint]]s David, [[Dura Europos]], [[Syria]], 3rd century CE]]
[[Yahweh|God]] is angered when [[Saul]], Israel's king, unlawfully offers a sacrifice&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|13:8–14|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later disobeys a divine command both to kill all of the [[Amalek]]ites and to destroy their confiscated property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|15:1–28|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God sends the [[prophet]] Samuel to anoint a shepherd, David, the youngest son of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]], to be king instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|16:1–13|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|At Saul's court}}
After God sends an evil spirit to torment Saul, his servants recommend that he send for a man skilled in playing the [[lyre]]. A servant proposes David, whom the servant describes as &quot;skillful in playing, a man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the Lord is with him.&quot; David enters Saul's service as one of the royal armour-bearers and plays the lyre to soothe the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|16:14–23|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|David and Goliath}}
War comes between Israel and the [[Philistines]], and the giant [[Goliath]] challenges the Israelites to send out a champion to face him in single combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:1–11|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; David, sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in Saul's army, declares that he can defeat Goliath.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:17–37|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refusing the king's offer of the royal armour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:38–39|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; he kills Goliath with his [[Sling (weapon)|sling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:49–50|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul inquires the name of the young hero's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|17:55–56|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jusepe Leonardo 001.jpeg|thumb|Saul threatening David, by [[José Leonardo]]]]
Saul sets David over his army. All Israel loves David, but his popularity causes Saul to fear him (&quot;What else can he wish but the kingdom?&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|18:5–9|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul plots his death, but Saul's son [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]], one of those who [[David and Jonathan|loves David]], warns him of his father's schemes and David flees. He goes first to [[Nob (Bible)|Nob]], where he is fed by the priest [[Ahimelech]] and given Goliath's sword, and then to [[Gath (city)|Gath]], the Philistine city of Goliath, intending to seek refuge with King [[Achish]] there. Achish's servants or officials question his loyalty, and David sees that he is in danger there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|21:10–11|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes next to the cave of [[Adullam]], where his family join him.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|22:1|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he goes to seek refuge with the king of [[Moab]], but the prophet [[Gad (prophet)|Gad]] advises him to leave and he goes to the [[Forest of Hereth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|22:5|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to [[Keilah]], where he is involved in a further battle with the Philistines. Saul plans to besiege Keilah so that he can capture David, so David leaves the city in order to protect its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|23:1–13|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he takes refuge in the mountainous [[Ziph (Judean Mountains)|Wilderness of Ziph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|23:14|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|David and Jonathan}}
Jonathan meets with David again and confirms his loyalty to David as the future king.  After the people of Ziph notify Saul that David is taking refuge in their territory, Saul seeks confirmation and plans to capture David in the Wilderness of Maon, but his attention is diverted by a renewed Philistine invasion and David is able to secure some respite at [[Ein Gedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|23:27–29|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning from battle with the Philistines, Saul heads to Ein Gedi in pursuit of David and enters the cave where, as it happens, David and his supporters are hiding, &quot;to attend to his needs&quot;. David realises he has an [[Window of opportunity|opportunity]] to kill Saul, but this is not his intention: he secretly cuts off a corner of Saul's robe, and when Saul has left the cave he comes out to pay homage to Saul as the king and to demonstrate, using the piece of robe, that he holds no malice towards Saul. The two are thus reconciled and Saul recognises David as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|24:1–22|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar passage occurs in 1 Samuel 26, when David is able to infiltrate Saul's camp on the hill of Hachilah and remove his spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lie asleep. In this account, David is advised by [[Abishai (biblical figure)|Abishai]] that this is his opportunity to kill Saul, but David declines, saying he will not &quot;stretch out [his] hand against the Lord's anointed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|26:11|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saul confesses that he has been wrong to pursue David and blesses him.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|26:25|NIV}}, NIV text&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|27:1–4|NKJV}}, Saul ceases to pursue David because David took refuge a second&lt;ref&gt;cf. {{bibleverse|1|Samuel|21:10–15|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; time with Achish, the Philistine king of Gath. Achish permits David to reside in [[Ziklag]], close to the border between Gath and Judea, from where he leads raids against the [[Geshur]]ites, the Girzites and the [[Amalek]]ites, but leads Achish to believe he is attacking the Israelites in Judah, the [[Jerahmeelite]]s and the [[Kenite]]s. Achish believes that David had become a loyal [[vassal]], but he never wins the trust of the princes or lords of Gath, and at their request Achish instructs David to remain behind to guard the camp when the Philistines march against Saul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|29:1–11|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; David returns to Ziklag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|30:1|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan and Saul are killed in battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|1 Sam|31:1–13|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and David is anointed king over Judah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|2:1–4|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, Saul's son [[Ish-Bosheth]] is anointed king of Israel, and war ensues until Ish-Bosheth is murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|2:8–11|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|Proclaimed king|Jerusalem and the Davidic covenant}}
With the death of Saul's son, the elders of Israel come to [[Hebron]] and David is anointed king over all of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|5:1–3|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conquers [[Jerusalem]], previously a [[Jebusite]] stronghold, and makes it his capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|5:6–7|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He brings the [[Ark of the Covenant]] to the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|6:1–12|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; intending to build a temple for God, but the prophet [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] forbids it, prophesying that the temple would be built by one of David's sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|7:1–13|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan also prophesies that God has made a covenant with the house of David stating, &quot;your throne shall be established forever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|7:16|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; David wins additional victories over the Philistines, Moabites, [[Edomites]], Amalekites, [[Ammon]]ites and king [[Hadadezer]] of [[Aram-Zobah]], after which they become tributaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Sam|8:1–14|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but it is likely that this is a reference to a dynasty of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] which traced its ancestry to a founder named David.{{sfn|Pioske|2015|p=180}} The [[Mesha Stele]] from [[Moab]], dating from approximately the same period, may also contain the name David in two places, although this is less certain than the mention in the Tel Dan inscription.{{sfn|Pioske|2015|p=210, fn.18}}

Besides the two steles, bible scholar and egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]] suggests that David's name also appears in a relief of Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I|Shoshenq]] (usually identified with [[Shishak]] in the Bible, 1 Kings 14:25-27).&lt;ref name=&quot;Phar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mckenzie-david.html|title=King David: A Biography (excerpt)|website=[[The New York Times]]|author=McKenzei, Steven L.|access-date=2018-06-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119124308/http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/m/mckenzie-david.html|archive-date=2018-01-19|url-status=live}} 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The relief claims that Shoshenq raided places in Palestine in 925 BCE, and Kitchen interprets one place as &quot;Heights of David&quot;, which was in Southern Judah and the [[Negev]]  where the Bible says David took refuge from Saul. The relief is damaged and interpretation is uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phar&quot;/&gt;

Apart from these, all that is known of David comes from the biblical literature. Some scholars have concluded that this was likely compiled from contemporary records of the 11th and 10th centuries BCE, but that there is no clear historical basis for determining the exact date of compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Andrew E.|last2=Walton|first2=John H.|title=A Survey of the Old Testament |edition=3rd|year=2009|origyear=1991|publisher=Zondervan Publishing House|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=978-0-310-28095-8|page=258|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PhbDc-PdvMC&amp;pg=PA258#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=The events of the book took place in the last half of the eleventh century and the early part of the tenth century BC, but it is difficult to determine when the events were recorded. There are no particularly persuasive reasons to date the sources used by the compiler later than the events themselves, and good reason to believe that contemporary records were kept (cf. 2 Sam. 20:24–25).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as A. Graeme Auld, Professor of Hebrew Bible at the University of Edinburgh, believe that the [[Books of Samuel]] were substantially composed during the time of King [[Josiah]] at the end of the 7th century BCE, extended during the [[Babylonian exile]] (6th century BCE), and substantially complete by about 550 BCE. Auld contends that further editing was done even after then—the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 &quot;almost certainly fixes the date of the story in the Persian or Hellenistic period&quot; because a quarter-shekel was known to exist in Hasmonean times.{{sfn|Auld|2003|p=219}} The authors and editors of Samuel drew on many earlier sources, including, for their history of David, the &quot;history of David's rise&quot; (1 Samuel 16:14–2 Samuel 5:10), and the &quot;succession narrative&quot; (2 Samuel 9–20 and 1 Kings 1–2).{{sfn|Knight|1991|p=853}} The [[Books of Chronicles|Book of Chronicles]], which tells the story from a different point of view, was probably composed in the period 350–300 BCE, and uses Samuel as its source.{{sfn|McKenzie|2004|p=32}}

The authors and editors of Samuel and Chronicles did not aim to record history, but to promote David's reign as inevitable and desirable, and for this reason there is little about David that is concrete and undisputed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=232–233}} The [[archeology|archaeological]] evidence indicates that in the 10th century BCE, the time of David, Judah was sparsely inhabited and Jerusalem was no more than a small village; over the following century it slowly evolved from a highland chiefdom to a kingdom, but always overshadowed by the older and more powerful [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] to the north.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2007|pp=26–27}} The biblical evidence likewise indicates that David's Judah was something less than a full-fledged monarchy: it often calls him ''negid'', for example, meaning &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;chief&quot;, rather than ''melek'', meaning &quot;king&quot;; the biblical David sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs (even his army is made up of volunteers), and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home-area around [[Hebron]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|pp=220–221}}

Beyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available. [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]], in his ''History of Israel'' (1981), takes Samuel at face value. [[Donald B. Redford]], however, sees all reconstructions from biblical sources for the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]] period as examples of &quot;academic wishful thinking&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Donald B. Redford, ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times,'' Princeton University Press, 1992 pp. 301–307.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas L. Thompson]] rejects the historicity of the biblical narrative: &quot;The history of Palestine and of its peoples is very different from the Bible's narratives, whatever political claims to the contrary may be. An independent history of Judea during the Iron I and Iron II periods has little room for historicizing readings of the stories of I-II Samuel and I Kings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Thompson TL|title= A View from Copenhagen: Israel and the History of Palestine|url= http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/copenhagen.shtml|access-date= 2012-11-03|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121029211732/http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/copenhagen.shtml|archive-date= 2012-10-29|url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amihai Mazar]] however, concludes that based on recent archeological findings, like those in [[City of David]], [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]], [[Tel Dan]], [[Tel Rehov]], [[Khirbat en-Nahas]] and others &quot;the deconstruction of United Monarchy and the devaluation of Judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data&quot;.

[[Jacob L. Wright]], Associate Professor of Hebrew Bible at Emory University, has written that the most popular legends about David, including his killing of Goliath, his affair with Bathsheba, and his ruling of a United Kingdom of Israel rather than just Judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late Persian or Hellenistic periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/07/wri388001.shtml|title=David, King of Judah (Not Israel)|date=July 2014|access-date=3 September 2017|website=bibleinterp.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510162217/http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/07/wri388001.shtml|archive-date=10 May 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of interpretation in the Abrahamic religions==

===Rabbinic Judaism===
David is an important figure in [[Rabbinic Judaism]], with many legends around him. According to one tradition, David was raised as the son of his father Jesse and spent his early years herding his father's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Legends of the Jews|url= https://archive.org/details/legendsofjews0007ginz|last= Ginzberg|first= Louis|year= 1909|publisher= Jewish Publication Society|location= Philadelphia|isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David's adultery with Bathsheba is interpreted as an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance, and the Talmud states that it was not adultery at all, quoting a Jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle. Furthermore, according to Talmudic sources, the death of Uriah was not to be considered murder, on the basis that Uriah had committed a capital offense by refusing to obey a direct command from the King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=82&amp;letter=D#260|title=David|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2014-10-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011100050/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=82&amp;letter=D#260|archive-date=2011-10-11|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in tractate Sanhedrin, David expressed remorse over his transgressions and sought forgiveness.  God ultimately forgave David and Bathsheba but would not remove their sins from Scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin|page=107a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Legends of the Jews|Jewish legend]], David's sin with Bathsheba is the punishment for David's excessive self-consciousness who had besought God to lead him into temptation so that he might give proof of his constancy as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (who successfully passed the test) whose names later were united with God's, while David eventually failed through the temptation of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Legends of the Jews|url= https://archive.org/details/legendsofjews0007ginz|last= Ginzberg|first= Louis|year= 1909|publisher= Jewish Publication Society|location= Philadelphia|isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[midrashim]], [[Adam]] gave up 70 years of his life for the life of David.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar Bereishis 91b&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to the [[Talmud Yerushalmi]], David was born and died on the Jewish holiday of [[Shavuot]] (Feast of Weeks). His piety was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from Heaven.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The concept of the Messiah is important in Christianity. Originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment (&quot;the anointed one&quot;, as the title [[Messiah]] had it), the &quot;son of David&quot; became in the last two pre-Christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver Israel and usher in a new kingdom. This was the background to the concept of Messiahship in early Christianity, which interpreted the career of Jesus &quot;by means of the titles and functions assigned to David in the mysticism of the Zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between God and man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152497/David &quot;David&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819074455/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152497/David |date=2009-08-19 }} article from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''&lt;/ref&gt; The early Church believed that &quot;the life of David [foreshadowed] the life of Christ; [[Bethlehem]] is the birthplace of both; the shepherd life of David points out Christ, [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|the Good Shepherd]]; the five stones chosen to slay Goliath are [[Typology (theology)|typical]] of the [[Holy Wounds|five wounds]]; the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, [[Ahitophel|Achitophel]], and the passage over the [[Kidron Valley|Cedron]] remind us of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|Sacred Passion]].

In European [[Christian culture]] of the [[Middle Ages]], David was made a member of the [[Nine Worthies]], a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of [[chivalry]]. His life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status. This aspect of David in the Nine Worthies was popularised firstly through literature, and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors.

David was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of [[Divine right of kings|divinely-ordained monarchy]] throughout medieval Western Europe and Eastern Christendom. David was perceived as the biblical predecessor to Christian Roman and Byzantine emperors and the name &quot;New David&quot; was used as an honorific reference to these rulers.&lt;ref name=Garipzanov&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garipzanov|first1=Ildar H.|title=The Symbolic Language of Royal Authority in the Carolingian World (c. 751–877)|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004166691|pages=128, 225|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] [[Bagrationi|Bagratids]] and the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Empire of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] claimed a direct [[Claim of the biblical descent of the Bagrationi dynasty|biological descent]] from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rapp|first=Stephen H., Jr. |title=Imagining History at the Crossroads: Persia, Byzantium, and the Architects of the Written Georgian Past |date=1997|publisher=Ph.D. dissertation, University of Michigan|page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, kings of the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Carolingian dynasty]] frequently connected themselves to David; [[Charlemagne]] himself occasionally used the name of David as his pseudonym.&lt;ref name=Garipzanov/&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|David in Islam}}
David is an important figure in [[Islam]] as one of the major [[prophet]]s sent by [[God]] to guide the [[Israelites]]. David is mentioned several times in the [[Quran]] with the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name داود, ''Dāwūd'', often with his son [[Solomon]]. In the Qur'an: David killed Goliath (2:251), a giant soldier in the Philistine army. When David killed Goliath, God granted him kingship and wisdom and enforced it (38:20). David was made God's &quot;[[vicegerent]] on earth&quot; (38:26) and God further gave David sound judgment (21:78; 37:21–24, 26) as well as the [[Psalms]], regarded as books of divine wisdom (4:163; 17:55). The birds and mountains united with David in uttering praise to God (21:79; 34:10; 38:18), while God made iron soft for David ([http://quran.com/34/10, 34:10]), God also instructed David in the art of fashioning chain-mail out of iron ([http://quran.com/21/80 21:80]); an indication of the first use of [[wrought iron]], this knowledge gave David a major advantage over his [[bronze]] and [[cast iron]]-armed opponents, not to mention the cultural and economic impact. Together with Solomon, David gave judgment in a case of damage to the fields (21:78) and David judged the matter between two disputants in his prayer chamber (38:21–23). Since there is no mention in the Qur'an of the wrong David did to [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]] nor any reference to [[Bathsheba]], [[Muslim]]s reject this narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Brannon M. (''The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', &quot;David&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim [[tradition]] and the ''[[hadith]]'' stress David's zeal in daily prayer as well as in [[fasting]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dawud&quot;. ''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; Qur'an commentators, historians and compilers of the numerous ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'' elaborate upon David's concise Qur'anic narratives and specifically mention David's gift in singing his Psalms as well as his musical and vocal talents. His voice is described as having had a captivating power, weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature, who would unite with him to praise God.&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, &quot;Story of David&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:081.David Mourns the Death of Absalom.jpg|thumb|200px|David mourning the death of Absalom, by Gustave Doré]]
Literary works about David include:
*'''1681–82''' [[John Dryden|Dryden]]'s long poem ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' is an allegory that uses the story of the rebellion of [[Absalom]] against King David as the basis for his satire of the contemporary political situation, including events such as the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] (1685), the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]].
*'''1893''' [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] may have used the story of David and Bathsheba as a foundation for the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story ''[[The Adventure of the Crooked Man]]''. Holmes mentions &quot;the small affair of Uriah and Bathsheba&quot; at the end of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C2IpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291&amp;dq=%22The+Crooked+Man%22+bathsheba#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The+Crooked+Man%22+bathsheba&amp;f=false|title=The Sherlock Holmes Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained|last=DK|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Dorling Kindersley Limited|accessdate=12 February 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780241248331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1928''' [[Elmer Davis]]'s novel ''Giant Killer'' retells and embellishes the biblical story of David, casting David as primarily a poet who managed always to find others to do the &quot;dirty work&quot; of heroism and kingship. In the novel, [[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan]] in fact killed Goliath but David claimed the credit; and [[Joab]], David's cousin and general, took it upon himself to make many of the difficult decisions of war and statecraft when David vacillated or wrote poetry instead.
*'''1936''' [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' refers to the story of Absalom, David's son; his rebellion against his father and his death at the hands of David's general, Joab. In addition it parallels Absalom's vengeance for the rape of his sister [[Tamar (daughter of David)|Tamar]] by his half-brother, [[Amnon]].
*'''1946''' [[Gladys Schmitt]]'s novel ''David the King'' was a richly embellished biography of David's entire life. The book took a risk, especially for its time, in portraying David's relationship with Jonathan as overtly [[homoerotic]], but was ultimately panned by critics as a bland rendition of the title character.
*'''1966''' [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], a Dominican political leader and writer, wrote ''David: Biography of a King'', as a realistic portrayal of David's life and political career.
*'''1970''' [[Dan Jacobson]]'s ''The Rape of Tamar'' is an imagined account, by one of David's courtiers Yonadab, of the rape of Tamar by Amnon.
*'''1972''' [[Stefan Heym]] wrote ''The King David Report'' in which the historian [[Ethan (biblical figure)|Ethan]] compiles upon King Solomon's orders &quot;a true and authoritative report on the life of David, Son of Jesse&quot;—the East German writer's wry depiction of a court historian writing an &quot;authorized&quot; history, many incidents clearly intended as satirical references to the writer's own time.
*'''1974''' In [[Thomas Burnett Swann]]'s biblical fantasy novel ''How are the Mighty Fallen'', David and Jonathan are explicitly stated to be lovers. Moreover, Jonathan is a member of a winged semi-human race (possibly [[nephilim]]), one of several such races coexisting with humanity but often persecuted by it.
*'''1980''' [[Malachi Martin]]'s [[Faction (literature)|factional]] novel ''King of Kings: A Novel of the Life of David'' relates the life of David, Adonai's champion in his battle with the Philistine deity Dagon.
*'''1984''' [[Joseph Heller]] wrote a novel based on David called ''[[God Knows (novel)|God Knows]]'', published by Simon &amp; Schuster. Told from the perspective of an aging David, the humanity—rather than the heroism—of various biblical characters is emphasized. The portrayal of David as a man of flaws such as greed, lust, selfishness, and his alienation from God, the falling apart of his family is a distinctly 20th-century interpretation of the events told in the Bible.
*'''1993''' [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''Certain Women'' explores family, the Christian faith, and the nature of God through the story of King David's family and an analogous modern family's saga.
*'''1995''' [[Allan Massie]] wrote ''King David'', a novel about David's career that portrays the king's relationship to Jonathan as sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Kane|first1=Martin|editor1-last=Exum|editor1-first=Jo Cheryl|title=Beyond the Biblical Horizon: The Bible and the Arts|page=[https://archive.org/details/beyondbiblicalho00jche/page/86 86]|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=AUd28eEXGfoC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=%22allan%20massie%22%20%22king%20david%22&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q=massie%20jonathan&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 August 2015|chapter=The Biblical King David and His Artistic and Literary Afterlives|isbn=978-9004112902|year=1999|url=https://archive.org/details/beyondbiblicalho00jche/page/86}}&lt;/ref&gt;
