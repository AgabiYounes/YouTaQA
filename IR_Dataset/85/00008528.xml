'''Disjunction introduction''' or '''addition''' (also called '''or introduction''')&lt;ref&gt;Hurley{{full|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker{{full|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copi and Cohen{{full|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[rule of inference]] of [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] and almost every other [[deduction system]]. The rule makes it possible to introduce [[logical disjunction|disjunctions]] to [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. It is the [[inference]] that if ''P'' is true, then ''P or Q'' must be true.

An example in [[English language|English]]:
:Socrates is a man.
:Therefore, Socrates is a man or pigs are flying in formation over the English Channel.

The rule can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P}{\therefore P \lor Q}&lt;/math&gt;

where the rule is that whenever instances of &quot;&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;&quot; appear on lines of a proof, &quot;&lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;&quot; can be placed on a subsequent line. 

More generally it's also a simple [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[logical form|argument form]], this means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion is also true as any rule of inference should be, and an [[immediate inference]], as it has a single proposition in its premises. 

Disjunction introduction is not a rule in some [[paraconsistent logic]]s because in combination with other rules of logic, it leads to [[Principle of explosion|explosion]] (i.e. everything becomes provable) and paraconsistent logic tries to avoid explosion and to be able to reason with contradictions. One of the solutions is to introduce disjunction with over rules. See {{slink|Paraconsistent logic|Tradeoff}}.

== Formal notation ==
The ''disjunction introduction'' rule may be written in [[sequent]] notation:

: &lt;math&gt;P \vdash (P \lor Q)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metalogic]]al symbol meaning that &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; is a [[logical consequence|syntactic consequence]] of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in some [[formal system|logical system]];

and expressed as a truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[theorem]] of propositional logic:

:&lt;math&gt;P \to (P \lor Q)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; are propositions expressed in some [[formal system]].
