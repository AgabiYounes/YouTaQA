'''''Doom''''' (stylized as '''''DOOM''''' or '''''DooM''''' in other media) is a 1993 [[first-person shooter]] developed by [[id Software]] for [[MS-DOS]]. Players assume the role of a [[space marine]], popularly known as &quot;[[Doomguy]]&quot;, fighting his way through hordes of invading [[demon]]s from [[Hell]]. The first episode, comprising nine levels, was distributed freely as [[shareware]] and played by an estimated 15–20&amp;nbsp;million people within two years; the full game, with two further episodes, was sold via [[mail order]]. An updated version with an additional episode and more difficult levels, ''Ultimate Doom'', was released in 1995 and sold at retail.

Along with its predecessor ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''Doom'' helped define the FPS genre and inspired numerous similar games, known as &quot;[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clones]]&quot;. It is one of the most significant games in [[video game history]], and is frequently cited as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest games of all time]]. It pioneered [[online distribution]] and technologies including [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], networked [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer gaming]], and support for customized [[Mod (video games)|modifications]] via packaged files ([[Doom modding|WAD]]s). Its graphic violence and hellish imagery also made it a [[video game controversies|subject of controversy]].

''Doom'' has been [[Official versions of Doom|ported to numerous platforms]]. The [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' franchise]] continued with ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' (1994) and [[expansion pack]]s including ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'' (1995). The [[source code]] was released in 1997, inspiring further adaptations. Id returned to the franchise with ''[[Doom 3]]'' (2004), a horror-focused retelling using the [[id Tech 4]] engine, followed by a 2005 [[Doom (film)|''Doom'' film]]. A 2016 reboot also titled ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]],'' powered by [[id Tech 6]], returned to the fast-paced action of the first games.

==Gameplay==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}
[[File:Doom ingame 1.png|thumb|right|The player armed with a chainsaw confronts an undead sergeant on a bridge over a chemical waste storage in &quot;Knee-Deep in the Dead&quot;]]

''Doom'' is a [[first-person shooter]] presented with early [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]]. The player controls an unnamed space marine—later termed the [[Doomguy]]—through a series of [[Level (video games)|levels]] set in military bases on the moons of Mars and in Hell. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach a marked exit room. Levels are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a [[Boss (video games)|boss fight]] with a particularly difficult enemy. While the levels are presented in a 3D perspective, the enemies and objects are instead 2D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] presented from several set viewing angles, a technique sometimes referred to as [[2.5D]] graphics. Levels are often labyrinthine, and a full screen [[automap]] is available which shows the areas explored to that point.

While traversing the levels, the player must fight a variety of enemies, including demons and [[Spirit possession|possessed]] undead humans, while managing supplies of ammunition, [[Health (games)|health]], and armor. Enemies often appear in large groups, and the game features five [[difficulty level]]s which increase the quantity and damage done by enemies, with enemies respawning upon death and moving faster than normal on the hardest difficulty setting. The monsters have very simple behavior, consisting of either moving toward their opponent, or attacking by throwing fireballs, biting, and clawing. They will [[Artificial intelligence in video games|fight each other]] if one monster is accidentally harmed by another, though most monsters are not harmed by other monsters of the same kind. Levels can also include pits of [[toxic waste]], ceilings that lower and crush anything below them, and locked doors which require a [[keycard]], skull-shaped key device, or a remote switch to be opened. The player can find weapons and ammunition placed in the levels or can collect them from dead enemies; weapons include a pistol, a [[chainsaw]], a [[plasma rifle]], and the [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], among others. The levels also feature [[power-up]]s such as items that give health or armor points, increase the player character's maximum ammunition or health, fill out the automap, give partial invisibility, or allow the player to survive in toxic waste. There are also items which apply time-limited effects such as invulnerability or a [[Berserker#Modern context|berserker]] status.

In addition to the main [[single-player video game|single-player]] game mode, ''Doom'' features two [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] modes playable over a local network: &quot;[[cooperative gameplay|cooperative]]&quot;, in which two to four players team up to play through the main game,&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomVirtualWorlds&quot;/&gt; and &quot;[[deathmatch]]&quot;, in which two to four players play against each other. [[Online multiplayer]] was later made available a year after launch through the [[DWANGO]] service.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersofdoom&quot;/&gt; ''Doom'' also contains [[cheat code]]s that allow the player to be invulnerable, obtain every weapon, be able to instantly kill every monster in a particular level, and several other abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomCheat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomAchieve&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomExtreme&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomWorld&quot;/&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:The anonymous space marine from DOOM.png|thumb|right|The unnamed protagonist of the ''Doom'' series as he appears in ''The Ultimate Doom'']]
''Doom'' is divided into three episodes: &quot;Knee-Deep in the Dead&quot;, &quot;The Shores of Hell&quot;, and &quot;Inferno&quot;. A fourth episode, &quot;Thy Flesh Consumed&quot;, was added in an expanded version of the game, ''The Ultimate Doom''. The game itself contains very few plot elements, with the minimal story instead given in the instruction manual and short text segues between episodes.

In the future, the player character (an unnamed space marine) has been punitively posted to [[Mars]] after assaulting a superior officer, who ordered his unit to fire on civilians. The space marines act as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation's radioactive waste facilities, which are used by the military to perform secret experiments with [[teleportation]] by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. Three years later, Deimos disappears entirely and &quot;something fraggin' evil&quot; starts pouring out of the teleporter gateways, killing or possessing all personnel. The Martian marine unit is dispatched to investigate, with the player character left to guard the perimeter with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside the base and is killed. Being unable to pilot the shuttle off of Phobos by himself, he realizes that the only way to escape is to go inside and fight his way through the complexes of the moon base. 

As the last man standing, the player character fights through the onslaught of demonic enemies to keep them from attacking Earth. In &quot;Knee-Deep in the Dead&quot;, he fights through the high-tech military bases, power plants, computer centers and geological anomalies on Phobos. It ends with the player character entering the teleporter leading to Deimos, only to be overwhelmed by monsters. In &quot;The Shores of Hell&quot; he fights through installations on Deimos, similar to those on Phobos, but warped and distorted from the demon invasion and interwoven with beastly architecture. After defeating the titanic [[Cyberdemon]], the marine discovers the vanished moon is floating above [[Hell]]. &quot;Inferno&quot; begins after the marine climbs off Deimos to the surface. The marine fights his way through Hell and defeats the Spider Mastermind that planned the invasion. A hidden doorway back to Earth opens for the hero, who has &quot;proven too tough for Hell to contain&quot;. However, a burning city and a rabbit's head impaled on a stake (named in ''The Ultimate Doom'' as the marine's pet rabbit, Daisy) show that the demons have invaded Earth, setting the stage for ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]''. In &quot;Thy Flesh Consumed&quot;, the marine fights the demons on Earth through a variety of disconnected high-tech bases and demonic temples, though ultimately the forces of Hell prevail in the invasion of Earth.

{{Main|Development of Doom}}

===Concept===
In May 1992, [[id Software]] released ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', later called the &quot;grandfather of 3D shooters&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;CGWHallofFame&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VGB&quot;/&gt; specifically first-person shooters, because it established the fast-paced action and technical prowess commonly expected in the genre and greatly increased the genre's popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGWHallofFame&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AGGreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WIREDretro&quot;/&gt; Immediately following its release most of the id Software team began work on a set of episodes for the game, titled ''Spear of Destiny'', while id co-founder and lead programmer [[John Carmack]] instead focused on technology research for the company's next game. Following the release of ''Spear of Destiny'' in September 1992, the team began to plan their next title. They wanted to create another 3D game using a new engine Carmack was developing, but were largely tired of ''Wolfenstein''. They initially considered making another game in the ''[[Commander Keen]]'' series, as proposed by co-founder and lead designer [[Tom Hall]], but decided that the platforming gameplay of the series was a poor fit for Carmack's fast-paced 3D engines. Additionally, the other two co-founders of id, designer [[John Romero]] and lead artist [[Adrian Carmack]], wanted to create something in a darker style than the ''Keen'' games. John Carmack then came up with his own concept: a game about using technology to fight demons, inspired by the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' campaigns the team played, combining the styles of ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD118121&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt; The concept originally had a working title of &quot;Green and Pissed&quot;, but Carmack soon named the proposed game after a line in the film ''[[The Color of Money]]'': &quot;'What's in the case?' / 'In here? Doom.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD118121&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MonsterId&quot;/&gt;

The team agreed to pursue the ''Doom'' concept, and development began in November 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt; The initial development team was composed of five people: programmers John Carmack and Romero, artists Adrian Carmack and [[Kevin Cloud]], and designer Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNvideo&quot;/&gt; They moved offices to a dark office building, which they named &quot;Suite 666&quot;, and drew inspiration from the noises coming from the dentist's office next door. They also decided to cut ties with [[3D Realms|Apogee Software]], their previous publisher, and to instead self-publish ''Doom''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD122123&quot;/&gt;

===Development===
[[File:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[John Romero]] in 2012|alt=Face of a smiling man with long black hair and glasses]]
Early in development, rifts in the team began to appear. At the end of November, Hall delivered a [[software design description|design document]], which he named the ''Doom Bible'', that described the plot, backstory, and design goals for the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt; His design was a science fiction horror concept wherein scientists on the Moon open a portal that aliens emerge from. Over a series of levels the player discovers that the aliens are demons while hell steadily infects the level design over the course of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt; John Carmack not only disliked the idea but dismissed the idea of having a story at all: &quot;Story in a game is like story in a porn movie; it's expected to be there, but it's not that important.&quot; Rather than a deep story, he wanted to focus on the technological innovations of the game, dropping the levels and episodes of ''Wolfenstein'' in favor of a fast, continuous world. Tom disliked the idea, but the rest of the team sided with Carmack.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt; Hall spent the next few weeks reworking the ''Doom Bible'' to work with Carmack's technological ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt; Hall was forced to rework it again in December, however, after the team decided that they were unable to create a single, seamless world with the hardware limitations of the time, which contradicted much of the document.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt;

At the start of 1993, id put out a press release, touting Hall's story about fighting off demons while &quot;knee-deep in the dead&quot;. The press release proclaimed the new game features that John Carmack had created, as well as other features, including multiplayer gaming features, that had not yet even been designed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt; Early versions of the game were built to match the ''Doom Bible''; a &quot;pre-alpha&quot; version of the first level included Hall's introductory base scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCV&quot;/&gt; Initial versions of the game also retain &quot;arcade&quot; elements present in ''Wolfenstein 3D'', like score points and score items, but those were removed early in development as they were out of tone.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNvideo&quot;/&gt; Other elements, such as a complex user interface, an inventory system, a secondary shield protection, and [[life (video games)|lives]] were modified and slowly removed over the course of development.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomHorizon&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Sandy Petersen in May 2004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sandy Petersen]] in 2004|upright]]
Soon, however, the ''Doom Bible'' as a whole was rejected: Romero wanted a game even &quot;more brutal and fast&quot; than ''Wolfenstein'', which did not leave room for the character-driven plot Hall had created. Additionally, the team believed it emphasized realism over entertaining gameplay, and they did not see the need for a design document at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt; Some ideas were retained, but the story was dropped and most of the game design was removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSSS249250&quot;/&gt; By early 1993, levels were being created for the game and a demo was produced. John Carmack and Romero, however, disliked Hall's military base-inspired level design. Romero especially believed that the boxy, flat level designs were uninspiring, too similar to ''Wolfenstein'', and did not show off the engine's capabilities. He began to create his own, more abstract levels for the game, which the rest of the team saw as a great improvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MattChat&quot;/&gt;

Hall was upset with the reception to his designs and how little impact he was having as the lead designer.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MCV&quot;/&gt; He was also upset with how much he was having to fight with John Carmack in order to get what he saw as obvious gameplay improvements, such as flying enemies, and began to spend less time at work.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt; In July the other founders of id fired Hall, who went to work for Apogee.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt; He was replaced in September, ten weeks before the game was released, by game designer [[Sandy Petersen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Petersen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD132147&quot;/&gt; The team also added a third programmer, [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RomeroGDC&quot;/&gt; Petersen and Romero designed the rest of ''Doom''{{'}}s levels with different aims: the team believed that Petersen's designs were more technically interesting and varied, while Romero's were more aesthetically interesting.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD132147&quot;/&gt; In late 1993, after the multiplayer component was coded, the development team began playing four-player multiplayer games matches, which Romero termed &quot;[[deathmatch]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD148153&quot;/&gt; According to Romero, the game's deathmatch mode was inspired by [[fighting game]]s such as ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior|Street Fighter II]]'', ''[[Fatal Fury]]'', and ''[[Art of Fighting]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deathmatch&quot;/&gt;

===Engine===
{{see also|Doom engine}}
[[Image:NeXTstation.jpg|thumb|A [[NeXTstation]] computer]]
''Doom'' was programmed largely in the [[ANSI C]] programming language, with a few elements done in [[assembly language]]. Development was done on [[NeXT]] computers running the [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGWLight&quot;/&gt; The data used by the game engine, including both level designs and graphics files, are all stored in [[Doom modding|WAD]] files, short for &quot;Where's All the Data&quot;. This allows for any part of the game's design to be easily changed without needing to adjust the engine code. Carmack designed this system specifically to enable fans to be able to easily modify the game; he had been impressed by the modifications made by fans of ''Wolfenstein 3D'', and wanted to support that with an easily swappable file structure along with releasing the map editor online.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD166&quot;/&gt;

Unlike ''Wolfenstein'', which had flat levels with walls at right angles, the ''Doom'' engine allows for walls and floors at any angle or height, though two traversable areas cannot be on top of each other. The lighting system was based on adjusting the color palette of surfaces directly: rather than calculating how light traveled from light sources to surfaces using [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], the game calculates the &quot;light level&quot; of a small section of a level based on its distance from light sources. It then modifies the color palette of that section's surface textures to mimic how dark it would look.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGWLight&quot;/&gt; This same system is used to cause far away surfaces to look darker than close ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt; Romero came up with new ways to use Carmack's lighting engine such as strobe lights.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt; He also programmed engine features such as switches and movable stairs and platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNvideo&quot;/&gt; After Romero's level designs started to cause problems with the engine, Carmack began to use [[binary space partitioning]] to quickly select the portion of a level that the player could see at a given time.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD132147&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchison|first=Andrew|date=2008|title=Making the water move: techno-historic limits in the game aesthetics of Myst and Doom.|url=https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/10418|journal=Game Studies |language=en|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor, along with programming other features into the game, added [[cheat codes]]; some, such as 'idspispopd', were based on ideas their fans had come up with while eagerly awaiting the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNvideo&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Spider Mastermind model.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the Spider Mastermind]]
Adrian Carmack was the lead artist for ''Doom'', with Kevin Cloud as an additional artist. They designed the monsters to be &quot;nightmarish&quot;; their intent was to have graphics that were realistic and dark as opposed to staged or rendered, so a [[mixed media]] approach was taken to the artwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSSS247&quot;/&gt; The artists sculpted models of some of the enemies, and took pictures of them in [[stop motion]] from five to eight different angles so that they could be rotated realistically in-game; the images were then digitized and converted to 2D characters with a program written by John Carmack.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt; Adrian Carmack made clay models for a few demons, and had [[Gregor Punchatz]] build latex and metal sculptures of the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNvideo&quot;/&gt; The weapons were toys, with parts combined from different toys to make more guns.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDC2011&quot;/&gt; They scanned themselves as well, using Cloud's arm as the model for the player character's arm holding a gun, and Adrian's snakeskin boots and wounded knee for in-game textures.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD124131&quot;/&gt;

=== Music and sound ===
As with ''Wolfenstein 3D'', id hired composer [[Bobby Prince]] to create the music and sound effects. Romero directed Prince to make the music in [[techno]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] styles; many tracks were directly inspired by songs by metal bands such as [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Pantera]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD132147&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metal&quot;/&gt; Prince believed that [[ambient music]] would be more appropriate, and produced numerous tracks in both styles in the hopes of convincing the team; Romero put both styles in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;SDF5255&quot;/&gt; Prince did not make music for specific levels, as they were composed before the levels were completed; instead, Romero assigned each track to each level late in development. Prince created the sound effects based on short descriptions or concept art of a monster or weapon, and adjusted them to match the completed animations.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrinceDoom&quot;/&gt; The monster sounds were created from animal noises, and Prince designed all the sounds to be distinct on the limited sound hardware of the time, even when many sounds were playing at once.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD132147&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDF5255&quot;/&gt; He also designed the sound effects to play on different frequencies from those used for the MIDI music, so they would clearly cut through the music.&lt;ref name=&quot;ComposersPlay4&quot;&gt;{{YouTube|id=_PRGzvSbZcI|title=Composers Play - &quot;Doom&quot; Coop with Bobby Prince! - Part 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Because id planned to self-publish, as ''Doom'' neared completion they had to set up the systems to sell it. Jay Wilbur, who had been brought on as CEO and sole member of the business team, planned the marketing and distribution of ''Doom''. He believed that the mainstream press was uninterested in the game, and as id would make the most money off of copies they sold directly to customers—up to 85 percent of the planned {{US$|40}} price—he decided to leverage the shareware market as much as possible, buying only a single ad in any gaming magazine. Instead, he reached out directly to software retailers, offering them copies of the first ''Doom'' episode for free, allowing them to charge any price for it, in order to spur customer interest in buying the full game directly from id.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD132147&quot;/&gt;

''Doom''{{'}}s original release date was the third quarter of 1993, which the team did not meet. By December 1993, the team was working non-stop on the game, with several employees sleeping at the office; programmer Dave Taylor claimed that working on the game gave him such a rush that he would pass out from the intensity. Id began receiving calls from people interested in the game or angry that it had missed its planned release date, as hype for the game had been building online. At midnight on December 10, 1993, after working for 30 straight hours, the development team at id uploaded the first episode of the game to the internet, letting interested players distribute it for them. So many users were connected to the first network that they planned to upload the game to—the [[University of Wisconsin–Parkside]] [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] network—that even after the network administrator increased the number of connections while on the phone with Wilbur, id was unable to connect, forcing them to kick all other users off to allow id to upload the game. When the upload finished thirty minutes later, 10,000 people attempted to download the game at once, crashing the university's network.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD148153&quot;/&gt;

Within hours of ''Doom''{{'}}s release, university networks were banning ''Doom'' multiplayer games, as a rush of players overwhelmed their systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD148153&quot; /&gt; After being alerted by network administrators the morning after release that the game's deathmatch network connection setup was crippling some [[computer network]]s, John Carmack quickly released a patch to change it, though many administrators had to implement ''Doom''-specific rules to keep their networks from crashing due to the overwhelming traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuickPatch&quot; /&gt; 

In late 1995, ''Doom'' was estimated to be installed on more computers worldwide than Microsoft's new operating system, [[Windows 95]], even with Microsoft's million-dollar advertising campaigns.&lt;ref name=&quot;windows-95&quot; /&gt; Microsoft hired id Software to port Doom to Windows with the [[WinG]] API,&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199407&quot; /&gt; and Microsoft CEO [[Bill Gates]] briefly considered buying the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersofdoom&quot; /&gt; Microsoft developed a Windows 95 port of ''Doom'' to promote Windows as a gaming platform. The development team was led by [[Gabe Newell]], who later founded the game company [[Valve Corporation|Valve]].&lt;ref name=&quot;windows-95&quot; /&gt; One Windows 95 promotional video had Gates digitally superimposed into the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelsplatter.com/doommedia.html|title=Bonus movie: Bill Gates &quot;DOOM&quot; video|author=Lombardo, Mike|publisher=Reel Splatter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002034515/http://www.reelsplatter.com/doommedia.html|archivedate=October 2, 2009|accessdate=November 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansions and ports===
{{main|Official versions of Doom}}

The popularity of ''Doom'' led to the development of an expanded version, ''The Ultimate Doom'' (1995), which includes a fourth episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;UltDoom&quot;/&gt; Numerous [[porting|ports]] of the game have been released by other companies. An unofficial port of ''Doom'' to Linux was released by id programmer [[Dave Taylor (game programmer)|Dave Taylor]] in 1994; it was hosted by id but not supported or made official.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doomlinux&quot;/&gt; Official ports of ''Doom'' were released for [[32X|Sega 32X]], [[Atari Jaguar]], and [[Mac OS]] in 1994, [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1995, [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] in 1996, [[Sega Saturn]] in 1997, [[Acorn Computers Ltd|Acorn]] [[Risc PC]] in 1998, [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2001, [[Xbox 360]] in 2006, and [[iOS]] in 2009. Notable exceptions in the list of official ports, as well as Linux, are [[AmigaOS]] and [[Symbian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNDoomVersions&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomJaguar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOOM3BFG&quot;/&gt; Some of these were bestsellers even many years after the initial release.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSMags&quot;/&gt; ''Doom'' has additionally been ported unofficially to numerous platforms; so many ports exist, including for esoteric devices such as smart thermostats and oscilloscopes, that variations on &quot;It runs ''Doom''&quot; or &quot;Can it run ''Doom''?&quot; are long-running phrases and [[meme]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ItRunsDoom1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ItRunsDoom2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ItRunsDoom3&quot;/&gt;

===Mods===
The ability for others to create custom levels and otherwise modify the game using WAD files turned out to be a popular aspect of ''Doom''. Gaining the first large [[mod (video games)|mod]]-making community, ''Doom'' affected the culture surrounding first-person shooters, and also the industry. Several future professional [[game designer]]s started their careers making ''Doom'' WADs as a hobby, among them [[Tim Willits]], who later became the lead designer at id Software.

The first [[level editor]]s appeared in early 1994, and additional tools have been created that allow most aspects of the game to be edited. Although the majority of WADs contain one or several custom levels mostly in the style of the original game, others implement new monsters and other resources, and heavily alter the gameplay; several popular movies, television series, other video games and other brands from popular culture have been turned into ''Doom'' WADs by fans, including ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball|Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Pokémon]]'', ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', ''[[Batman]]'', and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonicDoom&quot;/&gt; Some works, like the ''Theme Doom Patch'', combined enemies from several films, such as ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', and ''[[The Terminator]]''. Some add-on files were also made that changed the sounds made by the various characters and weapons.

Around 1994 and 1995, WADs were primarily distributed online over [[bulletin board system]]s or sold in collections on compact discs in computer shops, sometimes bundled with editing guide books. [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers became the primary method in later years. A few WADs have been released commercially, including the ''[[Master Levels for Doom II]]'', which was released in 1995 along with ''Maximum Doom'', a CD containing 1,830 WADs that had been downloaded from the Internet. Several thousand WADs have been created in total: the ''idgames'' FTP archive contains over 18,000 files,&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomWADFTP&quot;/&gt; and this represents only a fraction of the complete output of ''Doom'' fans. Third-party programs were also written to handle the loading of various WADs, since the game is a [[DOS]] game and all commands had to be entered on the [[command line]] to run. A typical launcher would allow the player to select which files to load from a menu, making it much easier to start. In 1995, [[WizardWorks]] released the ''D!Zone'' pack featuring hundreds of levels for ''Doom'' and ''Doom II''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon217&quot;/&gt; ''D!Zone'' was reviewed in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' by Jay &amp; Dee; Jay gave the pack 1 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the pack 1½ stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon217&quot;/&gt;

In 2016, Romero published two new ''Doom'' levels - E1M4b (&quot;''Phobo's Mission Control''&quot;) and E1M8b (&quot;''Tech Gone Bad''&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;NewLevels&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RomeroLevels&quot;/&gt; In 2018, for the 25th anniversary of DOOM, Romero announced an unofficial 5th Episodic pack of 9 levels. The 5th episode is titled ''Sigil of the Baphomet''. The music for the 5th episode is composed entirely by [[Buckethead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/10/18134302/sigil-doom-sequel-john-romero-release-date-price|title=John Romero is making a spiritual successor to the original version of Doom|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2018-12-10|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Doom'' became a problem at workplaces, both occupying the time of employees and clogging computer networks. [[Intel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199403&quot;/&gt; [[Lotus Development]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] were among many organizations reported to form policies specifically disallowing ''Doom''-playing during work hours. At the [[Microsoft]] campus, ''Doom'' was by one account equal to a &quot;religious phenomenon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mastersofdoom&quot;/&gt; Doom was #1 on ''Computer Gaming World''{{'}}s &quot;Playing Lately?&quot; survey for February 1994. One reader said that &quot;No other game even compares to the addictiveness of NetDoom with four devious players! ... The only game I've stayed up 72+ straight hours to play&quot;, while another reported that &quot;Linking four people together for a game of Doom is the quickest way to destroy a productive, boring evening of work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199404wh&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Billdoom.png|thumb|To promote [[Windows 95]], [[Bill Gates]], aware of the video game's popularity, showcased a video presentation while digitally superimposed into ''Doom'']]
Although Petersen said ''Doom'' was &quot;nothing more than the computer equivalent of [[Whack-A-Mole]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;schuytema199408&quot; /&gt; ''Doom'' received critical acclaim and was widely praised in the gaming press, broadly considered to be one of the most important and influential titles in gaming history. Upon release, ''[[GamesMaster]]'' gave it a 90% rating.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR-PC&quot; /&gt; ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' gave it five stars, praising the improvements over ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', the &quot;fast-moving [[Arcade game|arcade]] [[shoot 'em up]]&quot; gameplay, and network play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon203&quot; /&gt; A common criticism of ''Doom'' was that it was not a true 3D game, since the game engine did not allow corridors and rooms to be stacked on top of one another ([[room-over-room]]), and instead relied on graphical trickery to make it appear that the player character and enemies were moving along differing elevations.&lt;ref name=&quot;NotTrue3D&quot; /&gt;

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in February 1994 that ''Wolfenstein 3D'' fans should &quot;look forward to a delight of insomnia&quot;, and &quot;Since networking is supported, bring along a friend to share in the visceral delights&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199402&quot;/&gt; A longer review in March 1994 said that ''Doom'' &quot;was worth the wait ... a wonderfully involved and engaging game&quot;, and its technology &quot;a new benchmark&quot; for the gaming industry. The reviewer praised the &quot;simply ''dazzling''&quot; graphics&quot;, and reported that &quot;DeathMatches may be the most intense gaming experience available today&quot;. While criticizing the &quot;ho-hum endgame&quot; with a too-easy [[end boss]], he concluded that ''Doom'' &quot;is a virtuoso performance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;walker199403&quot;/&gt;

''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' criticized the &quot;fairly simple&quot; gameplay but praised the graphics and levels. The review concluded: &quot;You’lI be longing for something new in this game. If only you could talk to these creatures, then perhaps you could try and make friends with them, form alliances... Now, that would be interesting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edge&quot;/&gt; The sentiment attracted widespread mockery, and &quot;if only you could talk to these creatures&quot; became a running joke in [[gamer culture]]; however, a 2016 piece in the ''[[International Business Times]]'' defended the review as anticipating the dialogue systems of games such as ''[[Skyrim]]'', ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Undertale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/doom-infamous-talk-monsters-review-was-right-side-history-1559763|title=Doom: Infamous \'talk to the monsters\' review was on the right side of history|date=2016-05-13|website=International Business Times UK|language=en|access-date=2019-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' named ''Doom'' the third best computer game of all time. The editors wrote, &quot;Although it's only been around for a couple of months, ''Doom'' has already done more to establish the PC's arcade clout than any other title in gaming history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgameruktop50&quot;/&gt; In 1994 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' named ''Doom'' Game of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199406&quot;/&gt;

In 1995, ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' said it was &quot;The most talked about PC game ever – and with good reason. Running on a [[Intel 80486|486]] machine (essential for maximum effect), ''Doom'' took PC graphics to a totally new level of speed, detail, and realism, and provided a genuinely scary degree of immersion in the gameworld.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomRealism&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, ''Computer Gaming World'' named it the fifth best video game of all time,&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199611best&quot;/&gt; and the third most-innovative game.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199611mostinnovative&quot;/&gt;

In 1998, ''[[PC Gamer]]'' declared it the 34th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;Probably the most imitated game of all time, ''Doom'' continued what ''Wolfenstein 3D'' began and elevated the fledgling 3D-shooter genre to blockbuster status&quot;.&lt;ref name=pcgtop50&gt;{{cite journal | author=The ''PC Gamer'' Editors | title=The 50 Best Games Ever | date=October 1998 | volume=5 | number=10 | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | pages=86, 87, 89, 90, 92, 98, 101, 102, 109, 110, 113, 114, 117, 118, 125, 126, 129, 130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, ''Doom'' was voted the number one game of all time in a poll among over 100 game developers and journalists conducted by [[GameSpy]].&lt;ref name=gamespy20010701/&gt;

In 2003, [[IGN]] ranked it as the 44th top video game of all time and also called it &quot;''the'' breakthrough game of 1993&quot;, adding: &quot;Its arsenal of powerful guns (namely the shotgun and [[BFG (weapon)|BFG]]), intense level of gore and perfect balance of adrenaline-soaked action and exploration kept this gamer riveted for years.&quot;&lt;ref name=IGNtop100/&gt; ''[[PC Gamer]]'' proclaimed ''Doom'' the most influential game of all time in its ten-year anniversary issue in April 2004.

In 2004, readers of ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' voted ''Doom'' as the ninth top retro game, with the editors commenting: &quot;Only a handful of games can claim that they've changed the gaming world, and ''Doom'' is perhaps the most qualified of them all.&quot;&lt;ref name=retrogamer2004/&gt; In 2005, IGN ranked it as the 39th top game.&lt;ref name=IGNtop1002005/&gt;

On March 12, 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that ''Doom'' was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called [[game canon]].&lt;ref name=chaplin20070312/&gt; The [[Library of Congress]] took up this video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joystiq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DG-Interview&quot;/&gt;

In 2009, [[GameTrailers]] ranked ''Doom'' as the number one &quot;breakthrough PC game&quot;.&lt;ref name=gttopten/&gt; That year ''[[Game Informer]]'' put ''Doom'' sixth on the magazine's list of the games of all time, stating that it gave &quot;the genre the kick start it needed to rule the gaming landscape two decades later.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gi_best&quot;/&gt; ''Game Informer'' staff also put it sixth on their 2001 list of the 100 best games ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameInformer&quot;/&gt; IGN included ''Doom'' at 2nd place in the ''Top 100 Video Game Shooters of all Time'', just behind ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', citing the game's &quot;feel of running and gunning&quot;, memorable weapons and enemies, pure and simple fun and its spreading on nearly every gaming platform in existence.&lt;ref name=IGNtopshooters/&gt;

In 2012, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time as &quot;it established the look and feel of later shooters as surely as [[Xerox]] [[PARC (company)|PARC]] established the rules of the [[virtual desktop]],&quot; adding that &quot;its impact also owes a lot to the gonzo horror sensibility of its designers, including John Romero, who showed a bracing lack of restraint in their deployment of gore and [[Satan]]ic iconography.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AccoTimeAllTime&quot;/&gt; Including ''Doom'' on the list of the greatest games of all time, [[GameSpot]] wrote that &quot;despite its numerous appearances in other formats and on other media, longtime fans will forever remember the original 1993 release of ''Doom'' as the beginning of a true revolution in action gaming.&quot;&lt;ref name=shoemaker20060131/&gt;

The game has been [[Official versions of Doom#Consoles|ported to numerous console gaming platforms]] both domestically and abroad where it maintained its popularity, receiving generally favorable critical reception.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR-JG&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GR-PS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GR-GBA&quot;/&gt;

===Commercial and spreading performance===
With the release of ''Doom'', id Software, quickly found itself making $100,000 daily.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibt&quot;/&gt; [[Sandy Petersen]] later remarked that the game &quot;sold a couple of hundred thousand copies during its first year or so&quot;, as piracy kept its initial sales from rising higher.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamesthatchanged&quot;/&gt; Experts estimate that the game sold approximately 2-3 million physical copies from its release through 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armitage&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ibt&quot;/&gt; According to [[PC Data]], which tracked sales in the United States, the ''Doom'' shareware edition sold 1.15 million copies by September 1999. The ''Ultimate Doom'' [[Stock keeping unit|SKU]] reached sales of 787,397 units by that date. At the time, PC Data ranked them as the country's eighth- and 20th-best-selling computer games since January 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;alltimesales&quot;&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000302112243/http://pc.ign.com/news/11728.html | url=http://pc.ign.com:80/news/11728.html | title=PC Data Top Games of All Time | date=November 1, 1999 | author=IGN Staff | work=[[IGN]] | archivedate=March 2, 2000 | url-status=dead | access-date=May 31, 2018 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its sales, the game's status as shareware dramatically increased its market penetration. ''[[PC Zone]]''{{'}}s David McCandless wrote that the game was played by &quot;an estimated six million people across the globe&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;gamesthatchanged&quot;/&gt; while other sources estimate that 10–20 million people played ''Doom'' within 24 months of its launch.&lt;ref name=&quot;wargames&quot;/&gt;

===Controversies===
{{See also|List of banned video games}}
[[File:Doom gibs.png|thumb|''Doom''{{'s}} intense level of graphic violence made the game highly controversial. This screenshot shows the effects of a rocket hitting a group of enemies.]]

''Doom'' was notorious for its high levels of [[graphic violence]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomViolence&quot;/&gt; and [[Satanism|satanic]] imagery, which generated controversy from a broad range of groups. ''Doom'' for the Genesis 32X was among one of the first video games to be given an M for Mature rating from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] due to its violent gore and nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomMature&quot;/&gt; [[Yahoo! Games]] listed it as one of the top ten most controversial games of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomYahoo&quot;/&gt; It was criticized by religious organizations for its diabolic undertones and was dubbed a &quot;mass murder simulator&quot; by critic and [[Killology]] Research Group founder [[Dave Grossman (author)|David Grossman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomKillology&quot;/&gt; ''Doom'' prompted fears that the then-emerging [[virtual reality]] technology could be used to simulate extremely realistic killing.

The game again sparked controversy in the United States when it was found that [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], who committed the [[Columbine High School massacre]] on April 20, 1999, were avid players of the game. While planning for the massacre, Harris said in his journal that the killing would be &quot;like playing ''Doom''&quot;, and &quot;it'll be like the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|LA riots]], the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma bombing]], [[World War II]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], ''[[Duke Nukem 3D|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''Doom'' all mixed together&quot;, and that his shotgun was &quot;straight out of the game&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomHighSchool&quot;/&gt; A rumor spread afterwards that Harris had designed a ''Doom'' level that looked like the high school, populated with representations of Harris's classmates and teachers, and that Harris practiced for his role in the shootings by playing the level over and over. Although Harris did design ''Doom'' levels that were never affiliated with the official doom release, which later became known as the '[[Doom modding#Miscellaneous|Harris levels]]', none have been found to be based on [[Columbine High School]] and 7 of which can be played today.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Harris levels&quot;/&gt;

In the release versions before 1.2-1.4, the game has been banned in [[Germany]] due to a [[swastika]] in E1M4. The ban was lifted after id Software changed the ''Swastika'', and said that &quot;it was the homage of ''Wolfenstein 3D''&quot;.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Legacy==
===''Doom'' franchise===
{{main|Doom (franchise)}}

''Doom'' has appeared in several forms in addition to video games, including a ''Doom'' comic book, four novels by [[Dafydd Ab Hugh]] and [[Brad Linaweaver]] (loosely based on events and locations in the games), a [[Doom: The Boardgame|''Doom'' board game]] and [[Doom (film)|a live-action film]] starring [[Karl Urban]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] released in 2005. The game's development and impact on popular culture is also the subject of the book ''[[Masters of Doom|Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture]]'' by [[David Kushner]].

The ''Doom'' series remained dormant between 1997 and 2000, when ''[[Doom 3]]'' was finally announced. A retelling of the original ''Doom'' using entirely new graphics technology and a slower paced survival horror approach, ''Doom 3'' was hyped to provide as large a leap in realism and interactivity as the original game and helped renew interest in the franchise when it was released in 2004, under the [[id Tech 4]] game engine.

The series again remained dormant for 10 years until a remake, simply titled [[Doom (2016 video game)|''Doom'']] and running on the new [[id Tech 6]], was announced with a beta access to players that had pre-ordered ''[[Wolfenstein: The New Order]]''. The game held its closed alpha multiplayer testing in October 2015, as closed and open beta access ran during March to April 2016. Returning to the series' roots in fast-paced action and minimal storytelling, the full game eventually released worldwide on May 13, 2016. The project initially started as ''Doom 4'' in May 2008, set to be a remake of ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' and ditching the survival horror aspect of ''Doom 3''. Development completely restarted as id's Tim Willits remarked that ''Doom 4'' was &quot;lacking the personality of the long-running shooter franchise&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv&quot;/&gt;

===Clones===
{{Main|First-person shooter}}
[[File:Doom clone vs first person shooter.png|thumb|The phrase &quot;[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clone]]&quot; was initially popular to describe the style of gameplay in ''Doom''-style games, but was gradually replaced by &quot;[[first-person shooter]]&quot; after 1996. By 1998, the phrase &quot;first-person shooter&quot; had firmly superseded &quot;''Doom'' clone&quot;.]]
''Doom'' was influential and dozens of new first-person shooter titles appeared following ''Doom''{{'s}} release, and they were often referred to as &quot;[[Doom clone|''Doom'' clones]]&quot; rather than &quot;first-person shooters&quot;. The term &quot;''Doom'' clone&quot; was used to describe the style of gameplay in ''Doom''-style games. While the term was initially popular, it was, after 1996, gradually replaced by &quot;[[first-person shooter]]&quot;, and the phrase &quot;first-person shooter&quot; had firmly superseded &quot;''Doom'' clone&quot; around 1998. Some of these were certainly &quot;[[Clone (computing)|clones]]&quot;, hastily assembled and quickly forgotten, while others explored new grounds of the genre and were highly acclaimed. Many of the games closely imitated features in ''Doom'' such as the selection of weapons and cheat codes. ''Doom''{{'s}} principal rivals were [[3D Realms|Apogee]]'s ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'' and [[Looking Glass Studios]]' ''[[System Shock]]''. The popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed WADs is rumored to have been the factor that prompted [[LucasArts]] to create their first-person shooter ''[[Dark Forces]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomClones&quot;/&gt;

The ''Doom'' game engine was licensed by id Software to several other companies, who released their own games using the technology, including ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'', ''[[Strife (1996 video game)|Strife: Quest for the Sigil]]'', and ''[[Doom modding#Total conversions|Hacx: Twitch 'n Kill]]''. A ''Doom''-based game called ''[[Chex Quest]]'' was released in 1996 by [[Ralston Foods]] as a promotion to increase cereal sales,&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomChex&quot;/&gt; and the [[United States Marine Corps]] released ''[[Marine Doom]]''.

When [[3D Realms]] released ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'' in 1996, a tongue-in-cheek science fiction shooter based on [[Ken Silverman]]'s technologically similar [[Build (game engine)|''Build'' engine]], id Software was nearly finished developing ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', its next-generation game, which mirrored ''Doom''{{'}}s success for much of the remainder of the 1990s and reduced interest in its predecessor. (Wolfenstein 3D)

===Community===
In addition to the thrilling nature of the single-player game, the [[deathmatch]] mode was an important factor in the game's popularity. ''Doom'' was not the first first-person shooter with a deathmatch mode; ''[[Maze War]]'', an FPS released in 1974, was running multiplayer deathmatch over [[ethernet]] on Xerox computers by 1977. The widespread distribution of PC systems and the violence in ''Doom'' made deathmatching particularly attractive. Two-player multiplayer was possible over a phone line by using a [[modem]], or by linking two PCs with a null-modem cable. Because of its widespread distribution, ''Doom'' hence became the game that introduced deathmatching to a large audience and was also the first game to use the term &quot;deathmatch&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deathmatchterm&quot;/&gt;

Although the popularity of the ''Doom'' games dropped with the release of more modern first-person shooters, the game still retains a strong fan base that continues to this day by playing competitively and creating WADs, and ''Doom''-related news is still tracked at multiple websites such as Doomworld. Interest in ''Doom'' was renewed in 1997, when the [[source code]] for the [[Doom engine|''Doom'' engine]] was released (it was also placed under the [[GNU General Public License]] on October 3, 1999). Fans then began [[porting]] the game to various operating systems, even to previously unsupported platforms such as the [[Dreamcast]]. As for the PC, over 50 different [[List of Doom source ports|''Doom'' source ports]] have been developed. New features such as [[OpenGL]] rendering and [[Scripting language|scripting]] allow WADs to alter the gameplay more radically.

Devoted players have spent years creating [[speedrun]]s for ''Doom'', competing for the quickest completion times and sharing knowledge about routes through the levels and how to exploit [[software bug|bugs]] in the ''Doom'' engine for shortcuts. Achievements include the completion of both ''Doom'' and ''Doom II'' on the &quot;Ultra-Violence&quot; difficulty setting in less than 30&amp;nbsp;minutes each. In addition, a few players have also managed to complete ''Doom II'' in a single run on the difficulty setting &quot;Nightmare!&quot;, on which monsters are more aggressive, launch faster projectiles (or, in the case of the Pinky Demon, simply move faster), and respawn roughly 30&amp;nbsp;seconds after they have been killed (level designer John Romero characterized the idea of such a run as &quot;[just having to be] impossible&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomNightmare&quot;/&gt; Movies of most of these runs are available from the COMPET-N website.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoomCOMPET-N&quot;/&gt;

Online co-op and deathmatch play are still continued on [[List of Doom source ports|fan created services]].
