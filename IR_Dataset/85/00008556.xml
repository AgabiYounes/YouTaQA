'''''Diablo II''''' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[hack and slash|hack-and-slash]] [[Computer game|computer]] [[video game]] developed by [[Blizzard North]] and published by [[Blizzard Entertainment]] in 2000 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS]], and [[macOS]]. The game, with its [[dark fantasy]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] themes, was conceptualized and designed by [[David Brevik]] and Erich Schaefer, who, with Max Schaefer, acted as project leads on the game. The producers were Matthew Householder and [[Bill Roper (video game producer)|Bill Roper]].

Building on the success of its predecessor, ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]'' (1997), ''Diablo II'' was one of the most popular games of 2000&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespy_review&quot;&gt;Madigan, Jamie. [http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/reviews/diablo2_a.shtm &quot;GameSpy.com â€“ Reviews&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514181906/http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/reviews/diablo2_a.shtm |date=May 14, 2012 }}, [[GameSpy]]. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been cited as one of the [[greatest video games ever made]]. Major factors that contributed to the game's success include: its continuation of popular fantasy themes from the previous game, and its access to Blizzard's free [[Online video game|online play]] service, [[Battle.net]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3240/battlenet_defines_its_success_.php |title=Battle.net Defines Its Success: Interview With Paul Sams |last=Walter |first=Barbara |website=Gamasutra |accessdate=September 5, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921221303/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3240/battlenet_defines_its_success_.php |archivedate=September 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An expansion to the game, ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction]]'', was released in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;battle1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=27835073330 |title=Battle.net - English Forums -&gt; Patch 1.13d Now Live |publisher=Blizzard |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605063129/http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=27835073330 |archivedate=June 5, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another sequel in the series, ''[[Diablo III]]'', was announced in 2008 and released on May 15, 2012. ''[[Diablo Immortal]]'', the fourth installment in the series, was announced during [[Blizzcon 2018]] and is set after ''Diablo II: Lord of Destruction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18056370/diablo-immortal-mobile-blizzard-blizzcon-2018|title=Diablo is getting a 'full-fledged' mobile RPG|website=[[The Verge]]|author=Megan Farokhmanesh|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
&lt;!--Please note: There are only FOUR acts in the original ''Diablo II'', the fifth is added in the [[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction|''Lord of Destruction'']] expansion pack. Act V will only be briefly mentioned here, full details will be found on the LOD expansion page. --&gt;

''Diablo II''{{'}}s storyline progresses through four chapters or &quot;Acts&quot;. Each act follows a predetermined path, but the wilderness areas and dungeons between key cities are randomly generated. The player progresses through the story by completing a series of quests within each act, while there are also optional side dungeons for extra monsters and experience. In contrast to the first ''Diablo'', whose levels consisted of descending deeper and deeper into a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic-themed]] dungeon and Hell, ''Diablo II''{{'}}s environments are much more varied. Act I is similar to the original ''Diablo''; the Rogue Encampment is a simple palisade fort, while plains and forests making up the wilderness area, and the Monastery resembles the typical Middle Ages fortress. Act II mimics Ancient [[Egypt]]'s desert and tombs; Lut Gholein resembles a Middle Eastern city and palace during the Crusades. Act III is supposedly based on the [[Central America]]n jungles; Kurast is inspired by the lost [[Mayan civilization]]. Act IV takes place in Hell and is the shortest, with just three quests compared to the other Acts that have six.

The ''Lord of Destruction'' expansion adds the fifth chapter Act V which continues the story where Act IV left off. Act V's style is mainly mountainous as the player ascends Mount Arreat, with [[Alpine climate|alpine plateaus]] and icy tunnels and caverns. Occasional portals can take the player to dungeons in Hell (seen in Act IV) for extra monsters and experience. After reaching the summit of Arreat, the player gains access to the Worldstone Keep (whose architecture may be reminiscent of [[Angkor Wat]] and other [[Hindu]] temples).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/ |title=The Arreat Summit - Quests |website=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927031511/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/ |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the acts, there are three sequential difficulty levels: Normal, Nightmare, and Hell; completing the game (four Acts in the original or five Acts in the expansion) on a difficulty setting will open up the next level. On higher difficulties, monsters are more varied, stronger and may be resistant or immune to an element or physical damage; experience is penalized on dying, and the player's resistances are handicapped. However, better items are rewarded to players as they go through higher difficulties. A character retains all abilities and items between difficulties, and may return to a lower difficulty at any time, albeit it is not possible to re-play the quests that are already completed.

Players can create a hardcore character. In normal mode, the player can resurrect their character if killed and resume playing, while a hardcore character has only one life. If killed, the character is [[permadeath|permanently dead]] and unplayable. In addition, all items and equipment on that character will be lost unless another friendly character has the &quot;loot&quot; icon checked. Standard and hardcore characters play on separate online channels; as such a hardcore player can never appear in the same game session as a standard player.

===Item system===
''Diablo II'' uses a system of randomly generated equipment similar to the [[Diablo (video game)#Items|original ''Diablo'']], but more complicated. Weapons and armor are divided into several quality levels: normal, magical, set, rare and unique. Normal quality items are base items with a fixed set of basic properties, such as attribute requirements, maximum durability, armor rating (on armor), block chance (on shields), damage and attack speed (on weapons). Magical quality items have blue names and one or two randomly selected bonuses, such as bonuses attributes, skills or damage, indicated by a prefix or suffix. Rare quality items have randomly generated yellow names and 2 to 6 random properties. Unique items have fixed names in gold text, and instead of randomized properties, they have a set of 3 to 8 preselected properties. Green-named set items have fixed names and preselected properties like unique items, and belong to specific named sets of 2 to 6 items. Additional properties known as set bonuses are activated by equipping multiple or all items from the same set. These are themed on individuals, like Civerb's cudgel, shield and amulet each provide individual bonuses which are enhanced if two or more of the items are used to equip a character. It is unusual to encounter more than one item from a set in a single playthrough of the game, so collectors need to play the game many times to accumulate all items from a set, or purchase them online from other players who possess them but do not need them. Additionally, items can possess sockets, which can be used to upgrade items by adding gems for various bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/|title=The Arreat Summit - Items|author=|date=|website=classic.battle.net|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Diablo II'' includes an item crafting system. An item known as the Horadric Cube is used to combine two or more items to create a new item. For example, 3 identical lower quality gems can be combined to create a single higher quality gem, and 3 small rejuvenation potions can be combined to create a single, more powerful rejuvenation potion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/items/cube.shtml|title=The Arreat Summit - Items: The Horadric Cube|author=|date=|website=classic.battle.net|accessdate=March 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Character classes===
[[File:Diablo II characters.jpg|thumb|300px|The five character classes in ''Diablo II'' as seen during the opening selection animation. From left to right: the Amazon, Necromancer, Barbarian, Sorceress, and Paladin.]]

''Diablo II'' allows the player to choose between five different character classes: Amazon, Necromancer, Barbarian, Sorceress, and Paladin. Each character has different strengths, weaknesses and sets of skills to choose from, as well as varying beginning attributes. The maximum level that any character can obtain is level 99.

* '''The Amazon''' hails from the islands of the Twin Seas, near the border of the Great Ocean, and her clan is a rival to the Sisters of the Sightless Eye (known as Rogues). The Amazon is akin to the Rogue of ''Diablo'': both primarily use bows, and both make equal use of strength and magic, however the Amazon can also use javelins and spears. Many of her defensive skills are passive in nature, especially Dodge, Avoid, and Evade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/amazonhistory.shtml |title=Amazon History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140252/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/amazonhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazon is voiced by [[Jessica Straus (voice actress)|Jessica Straus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/197113.html |title=Diablo II: Credits |website=[[GameFAQs]] |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125104612/http://www.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/data/197113.html |archivedate=November 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Necromancer''' is a versatile death-themed spell caster. Necromancers are the priests of the Cult of Rathma from the Eastern jungles. His Summoning skills allow him to raise skeletons, create golems, and resurrect dead monsters to fight alongside him. The Necromancer possesses powerful poison spells, which rapidly drain life from afflicted monsters. He also has &quot;Bone&quot; skills, which directly damage enemies, while bypassing most resistances. His Curses also afflict the enemy with debilitating status ailments, sowing confusion and chaos in their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/necromancerhistory.shtml |title=Necromancer History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310164348/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/necromancerhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Necromancer is voiced by [[Michael McConnohie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot; /&gt;
* '''The Barbarian''' is a powerful melee fighter from the steppes of Mount Arreat. He is an expert at frontline combat, able to absorb great punishment, and is the only class capable of [[dual wield]]ing weapons. His Combat Masteries allow him to specialize in different types of weapons, and also passively increase his resistance, speed, and defense. His Warcries dramatically increase the combat effectiveness of him and his party, as well as afflicting status ailments on enemies. He has a variety of Combat Skills at his command, most of which focus on delivering great force upon a single foe, while some also give him considerable athleticism allowing him to leap over chasms and rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/barbarianhistory.shtml |title=Barbarian History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140737/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/barbarianhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barbarian is voiced by [[David A. Thomas (voice actor)|David Thomas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot; /&gt;
* '''The Sorceress''' hails from a rebellious coven of female witches who have wrested the secrets of magic use from the male-dominated mage clans of the East. She can cast ice, lightning and fire spells. Nearly all of these skills are offensive in nature, besieging the enemy with elemental calamity. Her Cold Skills can freeze enemies solid and bypass resistances, but do less damage than lightning or fire. The Sorceress's ''Teleport'' spell allows her to instantly travel to a new destination, making her very difficult to hit. The strong point of the Sorceress is her damaging spells and casting speed; her weakness is her relatively low hit points and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/sorceresshistory.shtml |title=Sorceress History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327090651/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/sorceresshistory.shtml |archivedate=March 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sorceress is voiced by Liana Young.&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot; /&gt;
* '''The Paladin''' is a crusader from the Church of Zakarum, fighting for the glory of the Light. He is part of the forces that defeated King Leoric's army in the first ''Diablo'', although his Order is eventually corrupted by Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred. To reflect his holy nature, the zealous Paladin's combat skills range from fanatical attacks to heavenly thunderbolts. His skills are split into Combat Skills, Defensive Auras, and Offensive Auras. His auras have a range of abilities, such as increasing damage, resisting magic attacks, or boosting defense. Most auras either affect all party members and allies, or all enemies within the area of effect. The Paladin is highly proficient in the use of a shield, and is the only character that can use it as a weapon. The Paladin also has specialized skills for eliminating the undead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/paladinhistory.shtml |title=Paladin History |website=Arreat Summit |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317141317/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/classes/paladinhistory.shtml |archivedate=March 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paladin is voiced by [[Larry B. Scott]].&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot; /&gt;

Two additional character classes, the Druid and Assassin, were added in the [[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction|expansion]].

*'''The Druid''' is a shapeshifter with the ability to transform into a bear or werewolf form, summon various creatures such as ravens and wolves, and attack with nature-based elemental magic like lightning or poisonous vines. The Druid offers a wide versatility of skills and  can be built in several different playstyles. The Druid is voiced by Michael Bell.

*'''The Assassin''' is a [[martial arts]] based class from the Viz-Jaq'taar clan who fights with claw blades and supplements her attacks with the use of shadow magic skills and fire or lightning elemental traps, which remain stationary and affect groups of enemies. The Assassin is voiced by Carrie Gordon.

The player can enlist the help of one hireling (computer-controlled [[mercenary|mercenaries]]) from a mercenary captain in the town; the Rogue Scouts, Desert Mercenaries, Ironwolves, and Barbarians, from Acts I, II, III, and V ([[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction|expansion]] only). The expansion allows players to retain their mercenary throughout the entire game as well as equipping them with armor and weapons. Hirelings gain experience and attributes like the player, although their level cannot surpass that of their master character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/basics/hirelings.shtml |title=The Arreat Summit - Basics: Hirelings |website=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715021422/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/basics/hirelings.shtml |archivedate=July 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically players choose a hireling that provides something missing from their character class; for instance the melee-focused Barbarian may choose an Ironwolf for ranged magical support.

In ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' (2015), Blizzard's crossover [[multiplayer online battle arena]], playable heroes Cassia and Xul represent the Amazon and the Necromancer character classes, respectively.

===Multiplayer===
''Diablo II'' can be played multiplayer on a [[local area network]] (LAN) or the Blizzard's [[Battle.net]] online service. Unlike the original ''Diablo'', ''Diablo II'' was made specifically with online gaming in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/faq/multiplayer.shtml |title=The Arreat Summit â€“ F.A.Q.: Multiplayer |website=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826062406/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/faq/multiplayer.shtml |archivedate=August 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several spells (such as auras or war cries) multiply their effectiveness if they are cast within a party, and although dungeons still exist, they were largely replaced by open spaces.

Battle.net is divided into &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Closed&quot; realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/faq/realms.shtml |title=The Arreat Summit â€“ F.A.Q.: Realms |website=Classic.battle.net |date=June 20, 2001 |accessdate=September 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915142453/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/faq/realms.shtml |archivedate=September 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may play their single-player characters on open realms; and Battle.net characters on closed realms that are stored on Blizzard's servers, as a measure against [[cheating in online games|cheating]], where they must be played at least once every 90 days to avoid expiration. Open games are subject to many abuses as the characters are stored on the players' own hard drives. There has been many cheats over the years on closed realms, however, many of these cheats that were used on the closed realms do not exist or work any longer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=clownshoes |url=http://www.gamebanshee.com/news/97610-320000-cheaters-banned-from-battlenet.html |title=320,000 Cheaters Banned From Battle.net |website=Gamebanshee.com |date=April 21, 2010 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608012955/http://www.gamebanshee.com/news/97610-320000-cheaters-banned-from-battlenet.html |archivedate=June 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hacks, bots, and programs which allow the player to run multiple instances of the game at the same time are not allowed by Blizzard were commonly used but are rarely used anymore. Spambots are no longer a thing and used to (programs which advertise sites selling Diablo II's virtual items for real-world currency) run rampant on the service but not anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20759202929 |title=Diablo 2 Fights Spambots &amp;#124; Video Clip &amp;#124; Game Trailers &amp; Videos |website=GameTrailers.com |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218022240/http://www.gametrailers.com/user-movie/diablo-2-spambots/349513 |archivedate=February 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the game can be played cooperatively (Players vs. Environment, PvE), groups of players with specific sets of complementary skills can finish some of the game's climactic battles in a matter of seconds, providing strong incentives for party-oriented character builds. Up to eight players can be in one game; they can either unite as a single party, play as individuals, or form multiple opposing parties. Experience gained, monsters' hit points and damage, and the number of items dropped are all increased as more players join a game, though not in a strictly proportional manner. Players are allowed to duel each other with all damage being reduced in player vs player (PvP). The bounty for a successful kill in PvP is a portion of the gold and the &quot;ear&quot; of the defeated player (with the previous owner's name and level at the time of the kill).

The Ladder System is reset at various intervals by Blizzard to allow for all players to start fresh with new characters on an equal footing. Ladder seasons have lasted from as short as six months to over a year. When a ladder season ends, all ladder characters are transferred to the non-ladder population. Certain rare items are available only within ladder games, although they can be traded for and exchanged on non-ladder after the season has ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/beta/patchchanges.shtml |title=The Arreat Summit â€“ Diablo II Patch 1.10 Beta |website=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811224713/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/beta/patchchanges.shtml |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game has been patched extensively; the precise number of patches is impossible to determine as Battle.net has the capability of making minor server-side patches to address immediate issues. {{As of|July 2016}}, the game is in version 1.14d.&lt;ref name=&quot;battle2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20745244961 |title=Battle.net - English Forums -&gt; Diablo 2 Patch 1.14D is Now Done And Running BUT what about patch notes? |publisher=Blizzard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702021743/https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20745244961 |archive-date=July 2, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the patch history, several exploits and issues have been addressed (such as illegal item duplication, though it still exists), as well as major revamps to the game's balance (such as the ability to redo skills and attributes). Not all patches have affected ''Diablo II'' directly, as several were designed to address issues in the expansion to the game and had minimal effects on ''Diablo II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=15443288961&amp;sid=3000 |title=Battle.net â€“ English Forums -&gt; Diablo II 1.13 â€“ Tell Us Your #1 Patch Note |website=Forums.battle.net |accessdate=September 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726082803/http://forums.battle.net/thread.html?topicId=15443288961&amp;sid=3000 |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Diablo II'' takes place after the end of the previous game, ''Diablo'', in the world of Sanctuary. In ''Diablo'', an unnamed warrior defeated Diablo and attempted to contain the Lord of Terror's essence within his own body.  Since then, the hero has become corrupted by the demon's spirit, causing demons to enter the world around him and wreak havoc.

A band of adventurers who pass through the Rogue Encampment hear these stories of destruction and attempt to find out the cause of the evil, starting with this corrupted &quot;Dark Wanderer.&quot; As the story develops, the truth behind this corruption is revealed: the soulstones were originally intended to imprison the Prime Evils after they were banished to the mortal realm by the Lesser Evils.  With the corruption of Diablo's soulstone, the demon is able to control the Dark Wanderer and is attempting to free his two brothers Mephisto, and Baal.  Baal, united with the mage Tal-Rasha, is imprisoned in a tomb near Lut Gholein.  Mephisto is imprisoned in the eastern temple city of Kurast.

As the story progresses, cut scenes show the Dark Wanderer's journey as a drifter named Marius follows him.  The player realizes that the Dark Wanderer's mission is to reunite with the other prime evils, Baal and Mephisto. The story is divided up into four acts:

:'''Act I''' - The adventurers rescue Cain, who is imprisoned in Tristram, and then begin following the Dark Wanderer. The Dark Wanderer has one of the lesser evils, Andariel, corrupt the Sisters of the Sightless Eye (Rogues) and take over their Monastery. The adventurers overcome Andariel and then follow the Wanderer east.
:'''Act II''' - While the adventurers search the eastern desert for Tal-Rasha's tomb, the Dark Wanderer gets there first. Marius is tricked into removing Baal's soulstone from Tal-Rasha and the Archangel Tyrael charges Marius with taking the soulstone to Hell to destroy it.
:'''Act III''' - The Dark Wanderer and Baal look for Mephisto in the Temple of Kurast. Still imprisoned in the dungeon below the temple, Mephisto was able to corrupt the High Council of Zakarum and take over the region. While the adventurers fight their way to the temple, Mephisto is rejoined by his brothers; the three open a portal to Hell, the Dark Wanderer sheds his human form, becomes the demon Diablo, and go through the portal. The adventurers arrive later, defeat Mephisto, who was left guarding the entrance, and take his soulstone.
:'''Act IV''' - The adventurers slay Diablo in Hell and destroy the soulstones of Mephisto and Diablo on the Hellforge, preventing their return.

In the epilogue, Marius, speaking in a prison cell, indicates he was too weak to enter Hell, and that he fears the stone's effects on him. He gives the soulstone to his visitor. The visitor reveals himself to be Baal, the last surviving Prime Evil now in possession of his own soulstone. He then kills Marius and sets the prison cell on fire.

The story continues in the expansion ''[[Diablo II: Lord of Destruction]]'' where Baal attempts to corrupt the mythical Worldstone on Mount Arreat. Upon returning to the Pandemonium Fortress after defeating Diablo, Tyrael opens a portal to send the adventurers to Arreat.

===Development===
{{expand section|date=November 2019}}
''Diablo II'' was announced by Blizzard in 1997, with a planned launch in the first quarter of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=In the Studio|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=35|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1997|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to designer and project lead Erich Schaefer, &quot;Diablo II never had an official, complete design document... for the most part we just started making up new stuff.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaefer, Erich&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3124/postmortem_blizzards_diablo_ii.php |title=Postmortem: Blizzard's Diablo II |website=Gamasutra |date=October 25, 2000 |accessdate=February 28, 2014 |author=Schaefer, Erich |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514015319/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3124/postmortem_blizzards_diablo_ii.php |archivedate=May 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was slated to have two years of development work, but it took Blizzard North over three years to finish. ''Diablo II'', despite having less than one percent of the original code from ''Diablo'' and having much of its content and internal coding done from scratch, was seen by the testers as &quot;more of the same.&quot; The game was meant to be released simultaneously both in North America and internationally. This allowed the marketing and PR department for Blizzard North to focus their efforts in building up excitement in players worldwide for the first week of sales, contributing to the game's success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaefer, Erich&quot;/&gt;

===Music development===
{{main|Diablo II Soundtrack}}

The score was composed by [[Matt Uelmen]] and integrates creepy ambience with melodic pieces. The style of the score is [[ambient industrial]] and [[Experimental music|experimental]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mp3oftheweek&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/mp3/ |title=Battle.net Matt Uelmen Liner Notes |last=Uelmen |first=Matt |website=Gamasutra |accessdate=January 20, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324043641/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/mp3/ |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was recorded in Redwood City, Oakland, and San Mateo, California, from April 1997 to March 2000.

Some tracks were created by reusing the tracks from the original game, while others by rearranging tracks that were out-takes. Other scores are combinations of parts that were created more than a year after the first game's release. A single track usually integrates recorded samples from sound libraries, live recorded instrument interpretation samples specially meant for the game (guitar, flute, oriental percussion), and electronic instruments also, making the tracks difficult for later live interpretations.

While the player visits the town, the game recreates the peaceful atmosphere from the first ''Diablo'' game, so for that the theme from Act I called &quot;Rogue&quot; comes back with the same chords of the original piece, reproducing only a part of the original ''Diablo'' town theme. For Act II Mustafa Waiz, a percussionist, and Scott Petersen, the game's sound designer, worked on the drum samples. Waiz played on the dumbek, djembe, and finger cymbals which gave Matt Uelmen a base upon which to build tracks around.

The town theme from Act II, &quot;Toru&quot;, makes strong statement of departure from the world of Act I while also maintaining a thematic connection to what had come before. It is the first time in the series to be used some radically different elements than the guitars and choral sounds that dominate both the original Diablo and the opening quarter of ''Diablo II''. The foundation of the &quot;Toru&quot; piece is found in exciting dynamics of a Chinese wind gong. The instrument radically changes color from a steady mysterious drone to a harsh, fearsome noise, that gives exotic feeling and at the same time the pacing of the second town. In all sequences of Act II with deserts and valleys, Arabic percussion sounds dominate.

The composer was impressed by two of the Spectrasonics music libraries, ''Symphony of Voices'' and ''Heart of Asia.'' He used samples from ''Heart of Asia'' in the ''Harem'' piece from Act II. The &quot;Crypt&quot; track uses a sample from ''Symphony of Voices''; the choral phrase ''Miserere''. Voice samples from ''Heart of Asia'', ''Heart of Africa'', and ''Symphony of Voices'' by [[Spectrasonics]].
The &quot;Harem&quot; track samples from ''Heart of Asia'' the Sanskrit Female 1 samples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart of Asia Akai CD-ROM Directory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilio.com/spectrasonics/heartofasia/cdrom.html |title=Akai CD-ROM Directory |publisher=ilio |accessdate=January 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205044629/http://www.ilio.com/spectrasonics/heartofasia/cdrom.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
The game was released in ''Collector's Edition'' format, containing bonus [[Collector's edition|collector's material]], a copy of the ''Diablo'' ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' pen-and-paper campaign setting, and promotional movies for other Blizzard games. In 2000, the ''Diablo II: Exclusive Gift Set'' similarly contained exclusive collector's material and promotional videos, as well as a copy of the official strategy guide. The 2000 released ''Diablo Gift Pack'' contained copies of ''Diablo'' and ''Diablo II'', but no expansions. The 2001 ''Diablo: Battle Chest'' version contained copies of ''Diablo II'', ''Diablo II: Lord of Destruction'', the official strategy guide, and the original ''Diablo''. Recently however {{when|date=April 2015}}, the ''Battle Chest'' edition no longer contains the original ''Diablo''.

==Secret Cow Level==
The &quot;Secret Cow Level&quot; is the result of a running joke from the original ''Diablo'' that spawned from an Internet rumor about the cows that appear in the game, seemingly without purpose. Supposedly, if the cow was clicked a certain number of times, a portal to a secret level would open. The rumor turned out to be a hoax&lt;!-- [[Diablo (video game)#The Cow Level]] --&gt;, but the legend was born, and player after player asked Blizzard about how to access the level.

In ''[[Diablo: Hellfire]]'', an add-on for ''Diablo'' created by third-party developer [[Synergistic Software]], it was possible to change a parameter in a specific text file, so that the farmer was dressed in a cow suit, with appropriate new dialogue (&quot;Moo.&quot; &quot;I said Moo!&quot;). To stop the rumors, Blizzard included a cheat in ''[[StarCraft (video game)|StarCraft]]'' that read &quot;There is no cow level&quot;, adding to the official denial of the cow level.&lt;ref name=&quot;cow level&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Secret Cow Level |url=http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/cow.shtml |publisher=Classic.battle.net |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813041425/http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/quests/cow.shtml |archivedate=August 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 1999, a ''Diablo II Screenshot of the Week'' featured cows fighting.
