The '''Detroit Lions''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. They compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC North|North division]]. The team plays its home games at [[Ford Field]] in [[Downtown Detroit]].

Originally based in [[Portsmouth, Ohio]] and called the '''[[History of the Portsmouth Spartans|Portsmouth Spartans]]''', the team formally joined the NFL on July 12, 1930 and began play in the 1930 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;DetroitLionsFacts&quot; /&gt; Despite success within the NFL, they could not survive in Portsmouth, then the NFL's second smallest city. The team was purchased and [[relocation of professional sports teams|relocated]] to Detroit and subsequently renamed the Lions for the 1934 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=C.

The Lions have won four [[List of NFL champions|NFL championships]]. However, their last was in 1957, which gives the club the second-longest NFL championship drought behind the [[Arizona Cardinals]] (who last won in 1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Schwartz|title=The last time every NFL team played in a Super Bowl|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/gallery/super-bowl-2019-droughts-ranked|website=USA Today|date=January 31, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Caldwell&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Caldwell|title=Meet The NFL Team That Might Never Make It To A Super Bowl|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davecaldwell/2019/02/01/meet-the-nfl-team-that-might-never-make-it-to-a-super-bowl/#19ff45d37d51|website=Forbes|date=February 1, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are one of four current teams and the only NFC team to have not yet played in the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Charlotte|last=Carroll|title=What Teams Have Never Won the Super Bowl?|url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/02/03/what-teams-have-never-won-super-bowl|website=SI.com|date=February 3, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also the only franchise to have been in operation for all 54 seasons of the Super Bowl era without having appeared in one (the [[Cleveland Browns]] were not in operation for the 1996 to 1998 seasons).&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daisy|last=Barringer|title=21 Football Facts to Fake Your Super Bowl Street Cred|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/rally/21-football-facts-for-your-super-bowl-party/|website=Eventbrite|date=January 2, 2019|accessdate=January 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos and uniforms==
Aside from a brief change to maroon in 1948 instituted by then head coach [[Bo McMillin]], which was influenced by his years as coach at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana]], the Lions uniforms have basically remained the same. The design consists of silver helmets, silver pants, and either blue or white jerseys.&lt;ref name=Uniforms&gt;{{cite web|title=TBT: Lions uniforms through the years|url=https://www.detroitlions.com/photos/tbt-lions-uniforms-through-the-years-18733536#e55b2720-c6d2-41b3-b0d5-e97fa29894d0|website=Detroit Lions|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dow&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Dow|title=The Evolution of the Detroit Lions' Uniforms|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2009/04/22/the-evolution-of-the-detroit-lions%E2%80%99-uniform/|website=Vintage Detroit|date=April 22, 2009|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shade of blue used for Lions uniforms and logos is officially known as &quot;Honolulu blue&quot;, which is supposedly inspired by the color of the waves off the coast of Hawaii.&lt;ref name=Dow/&gt;

There have been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the silver stripe patterns on the jersey sleeves, and changing the colors of the jersey numbers. &quot;TV numbers&quot;, which are auxiliary uniform numbers to help TV broadcasters identify players from the line of scrimmage, were added to the jersey sleeves in 1956.&lt;ref name=Dow/&gt; White trim was added to the logo in 1970, with outlines (white on the blue jersey, silver on the white jersey) added to the numbers in 1972; the color arrangement on the numbers on the blue jerseys was reversed in 1982.&lt;ref name=Uniforms/&gt; The gray facemasks became blue in 1984. In 1998, the team wore blue pants with their white jerseys along with grey socks but dropped that combination after the season.&lt;ref name=Uniforms/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Lukas|title=The Detroit Lions' uniforms for 2017 will be evolution of the current look|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/19154129/the-detroit-lions-uniforms-2017-evolution-current-look|website=ESPN.com|date=April 13, 2017|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the &quot;TV numbers&quot; on the sleeves were moved to the shoulders.&lt;ref name=Uniforms/&gt;

In 1994, every NFL team wore throwback jerseys, and the Lions' were similar to the jerseys used during their 1935 championship season. The helmets and pants were solid silver, the jerseys Honolulu blue with silver numbers and the jersey did not have &quot;TV numbers&quot; on the sleeves. The team wore solid blue socks and black cleats. The helmets also did not have a logo, as helmets were simple leather back then.&lt;ref name=Uniforms/&gt; The Lions also wore '50s-style jerseys during their traditional [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] games from 2001 to 2004 as the NFL encouraged teams to wear throwback jerseys on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Little consolation: Lions rally, but still fall to 0-10|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=211122008|website=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=November 22, 2001|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lions give too charitably to Patriots|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=221128008|website=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=November 28, 2002|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Packers' playoff hopes hurt|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=231127008|website=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=November 27, 2003|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manning throws 6 TDs in less than three quarters|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap?gameId=241125008|website=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=November 25, 2004|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Illuminati|title=NFL Thanksgiving Throwback Jerseys|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/nfls-worst-thanksgiving-tradition-throwback-jerseys-114326/|website=Rolling Stone|date=November 23, 2016|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the team added black trim to their logo and jerseys. The face masks on the helmet changed from blue to black with the introduction of the new color. In 2005, the team introduced an alternate black jersey.&lt;ref name=Uniforms/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2017 logo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Birkett|title=Detroit Lions tweak logo and font, will alter uniforms, too|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2017/02/01/detroit-lions-logo/97332380/|newspaper=Detroit Free Pres|date=February 1, 2017|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2008, the team dropped the black jersey in favor of a throwback uniform to commemorate the franchise's 75th anniversary. The throwback uniform became the team's permanent alternate jersey in 2009, replacing the former black alternate.&lt;ref name=noblack&gt;{{cite news|last=Kowalski|first=Tom|title=Tom Lewand: Lions' black uniforms discarded|url=http://www.mlive.com/lions/index.ssf/2009/02/lions_black_uniforms_have_been.html|work=[[The Grand Rapids Press]]|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lions officially unveiled a new logo and uniforms on April 20, 2009.

On February 1, 2017, the Lions announced a new typeface, logo, and the complete removal of the color black from the team identity. While the previous logo was retained, the border was changed from black to silver.&lt;ref name=&quot;LionsReBrand2017&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2017 logo&quot;/&gt; The Lions then unveiled the new uniforms on April 13, 2017, which include blue pants for the first time since 1998; the facemasks also became chrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hanzus|first=Dan|title=Lions unveil new uniforms, bring back throwbacks|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000800029/article/lions-unveil-new-uniforms-bring-back-throwbacks|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=April 13, 2017|access-date=November 18, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Lions unveil new uniforms|url=https://www.detroitlions.com/news/lions-unveil-new-uniforms-18737536|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DetroitLions.com|date=April 13, 2017|access-date=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lions also added the initials &quot;WCF&quot; to the left sleeve as a permanent tribute to [[William Clay Ford Sr.|William Clay Ford]], who owned the team from 1963 until his death in 2014.

In 1934, then-team owner George A.

==Rivalries==
The Lions have had several division rivals in their existence. Their oldest [[National Football League rivalries|rivals]] are the [[Bears–Lions rivalry|Chicago Bears]] and the [[Lions–Packers rivalry|Green Bay Packers]], whom they have faced since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Matchups, Detroit Lions vs. Chicago Bears|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=det&amp;tm2=chi&amp;yr=all|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Matchups, Detroit Lions vs. Green Bay Packers|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=det&amp;tm2=gnb&amp;yr=all|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lions–Vikings rivalry|Minnesota Vikings]] have been in a division with Detroit ever since their inaugural season in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Matchups, Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_query.cgi?tm1=det&amp;tm2=min&amp;yr=all|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Peters|title=Game Preview: Vikings at Lions|url=https://www.vikings.com/news/game-preview-vikings-at-lions-week-7|website=Vikings.com|date=October 15, 2019|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable longtime division opponent was the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] (25 seasons from 1977–2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Scott|last=Smith|title=Series History: Bucs-Lions|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/series-history-bucs-lions-14490348|website=Buccaneers.com|date=December 3, 2014|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lions also have a preseason rivalry with the [[Cleveland Browns]], dubbed the Great Lakes Classic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle for the Barge&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/sports/football/browns/baskin-browns-lions-battle-for-barge-trophy|title=Baskin: Browns-Lions battle for 'Barge' trophy|date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2013|author=Baskin, Andy|publisher=[[WEWS-TV]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130811102730/http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/sports/football/browns/baskin-browns-lions-battle-for-barge-trophy|archive-date=August 11, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two teams have been playing for The Barge Trophy since 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Lakes Classic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.morningjournal.com/news/great-lakes-classic-has-lacked-luster-since-its-beginning/article_02b7781e-abb4-5b9c-bede-f5f477ff1bde.html|title=Great Lakes Classic has lacked luster since its beginning|date=November 22, 2009|accessdate=January 21, 2020|author=Schudel, Jeff|newspaper=[[The Morning Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lions and Browns had a solid rivalry in the 1950s, when they met four times for the [[List of NFL champions (1920–1969)#NFL champions (1933–69)|NFL championship]] (Detroit won three of the matchups); they have met much less frequently during the regular season since the [[AFL–NFL merger|1970 AFL–NFL merger]] due to the Browns' move to the [[American Football Conference|AFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Week 2 - Lions-Browns Rivalry|url=https://www.profootballhof.com/news/week-2-lions-browns-rivalry/|website=Pro Football Hall of Fame|date=January 1, 2005|accessdate=October 22, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and television==
{{Main|List of Detroit Lions broadcasters}}

===Radio===
{{Main|Detroit Lions Radio Network}}

The Lions' [[Flagship (radio)|flagship]] radio station is [[WJR]] 760 AM.&lt;ref name=stations&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Lions Schedule - Radio Affiliates|url=https://www.detroitlions.com/schedule/radio-affiliates|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=DetroitLions.com|access-date=June 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Miller (sportscaster)|Dan Miller]] does [[play-by-play]] and [[Lomas Brown]] does color commentary.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite web|title=WJR replaces Jim Brandstatter on Lions radio broadcasts with Lomas Brown|url=https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20180710/news/665686/wjr-replaces-jim-brandstatter-on-lions-radio-broadcasts-with-lomas|website=Crain's Detroit Business|date=July 10, 2018|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the team announced that they were moving from [[WXYT-FM]] to WJR for the [[2016 NFL season]], ending a 20-year relationship with [[CBS Radio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freepress-wjrmove&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Birkett|title=Want to listen to the Lions in 2016?

A CBS Radio spokesperson stated that their refusal was meant to maintain the station's integrity.&lt;ref name=&quot;freepress-wjrmove&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;detroitnews-censorship&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony|last=Paul|title=CBS Detroit: Lions censorship demands caused split|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/11/20/detroit-lions-radio-change/76103168/|newspaper=The Detroit News|date=November 20, 2015|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regular season====
Regular season games are broadcast regionally on [[NFL on Fox|Fox]], except when the Lions play an AFC team in Detroit, in which case the game airs regionally on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]]; however, since 2014, with the institution of the NFL's &quot;cross flex&quot; broadcast rules, any Lions game slated to air on Fox can be moved to CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kevin|last=Draper|title=Why People in Mississippi Have to Watch the Giants|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/sports/football/why-people-in-mississippi-have-to-watch-the-giants.html?smid=tw-nytsports&amp;smtyp=cur|website=The New York Times|date=November 19, 2017|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gregg|last=Rosenthal|title=2014 NFL Schedule: Flex games can now start in Week 5|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000343369/article/2014-nfl-schedule-flex-games-can-now-start-in-week-5|website=NFL.com|date=April 23, 2014|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] in Detroit is always televised nationally.&lt;ref name=Beach/&gt; In 2011, the Lions became the last NFC team to play on [[NBC]]'s ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' since the network began airing Sunday night games in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael David|last=Smith|title=Lions-Saints on NBC Week 13|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/11/21/lions-saints-on-nbc-week-13/|website=Pro Football Talk|date=November 21, 2011|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blackouts====
{{Main|National Football League television blackout policies}}
The Lions' winless performance in 2008 and 2–14 season in 2009, coupled with the effects of the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]] in Michigan, led to several local broadcast blackouts, as local fans did not purchase enough tickets by the 72-hour blackout deadline. The first blackout in the then seven-year history of [[Ford Field]] was on October 26, 2008 against the [[2008 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. The previous 50 regular season home games had been sellouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Kowalski|title=It's official: Lions' game will be blacked out|url=https://www.mlive.com/lions/2008/10/its_official_the_blackout_stre.html|website=MLive|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second home game of the 2009 season in which the Lions broke the losing streak, also against the Redskins, was blacked out locally, as well as the comeback victory over the Cleveland Browns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Kowalski|title=Lions beat Redskins to snap 19-game losing streak; 'we got King Kong off our back'|url=https://www.mlive.com/lions/2009/09/detroit_lions_snap_19-game_los.html|website=MLive|date=September 28, 2009|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Florio|title=Lions-Browns blacked out in Detroit area|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2009/11/19/lions-browns-blacked-out-in-detroit-area/|website=Pro Football Talk|date=November 19, 2009|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stafford guides Lions to dramatic win over Browns|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81467df2/article/stafford-guides-lions-to-dramatic-win-over-browns|website=NFL.com|agency=Associated Press|date=November 22, 2009|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lions had only one blackout in 2010, yet another Redskins game, which the Lions won 37–25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kowalski|first=Tom|title=Detroit Lions' game on Sunday will be blacked out locally|url=http://www.mlive.com/lions/index.ssf/2010/10/detroit_lions_game_on_sunday_w.html|website=MLive|date=October 28, 2010|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015, the NFL suspended its blackout policies, meaning that all Lions games will be shown on local TV, regardless of tickets sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Evan|last=Grossman|title=Why the NFL Finally Lifted Its Blackout Rules|url=https://www.mensjournal.com/adventure/why-the-nfl-finally-lifted-its-blackout-rules-20150326/|website=Men's Journal|date=March 26, 2015|accessdate=December 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Games were also often blacked out at the Lions' previous home, the 80,000-seat [[Pontiac Silverdome]], despite winning seasons and the success and popularity of star players such as [[Barry Sanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paula|last=Pasche|title=Detroit Lions at Silverdome: The glory days|url=https://www.theoaklandpress.com/sports/detroit-lions-at-silverdome-the-glory-days/article_c17089f2-9aec-575c-b6eb-9122c799c9fd.html|website=The Oakland Press|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Steve|last1=Schrader|first2=Brian|last2=McCollum|first3=Brian|last3=Manzullo|title=Best moments in Pontiac Silverdome history|url=https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2015/10/29/pontiac-silverdome-memories/74835284/|website=Detroit Free Press|date=October 29, 2015|accessdate=October 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
