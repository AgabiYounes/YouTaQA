A '''dragon''' is a large, [[snake|serpent]]ine [[legendary creature]] that appears in the [[folklore]] of many cultures around the world. Beliefs about dragons vary drastically by region, but [[European dragon|dragons in western cultures]] since the [[High Middle Ages]] have often been depicted as winged, horned, [[Quadrupedalism|four-legged]], and capable of [[Fire breathing|breathing fire]]. [[Chinese dragon|Dragons in eastern cultures]] are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence.

The earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes. Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the [[ancient Near East]] and appear in [[Art of Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamian art]] and literature. Stories about [[Weather god|storm-gods]] slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] and Near Eastern mythologies. Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the ''[[mušḫuššu]]'' of [[Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamia]]; [[Apep]] in [[Egyptian mythology]]; [[Vritra|Vṛtra]] in the ''[[Rigveda]]''; the [[Leviathan]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]; [[Big Ghoul|Grand'Goule]] in the Poitou region in [[France]], [[Python (mythology)|Python]], [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], [[Wyvern]], and the [[Lernaean Hydra]] in [[Greek mythology]]; [[Jörmungandr]], [[Níðhöggr]], and [[Fafnir]] in [[Norse mythology]]; and [[The dragon (Beowulf)|the dragon]] from ''[[Beowulf]]''.

The popular western image of a dragon is based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes. In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by [[saint]]s or [[culture hero]]es, as in the popular legend of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]. They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure. These dragons appear frequently in western [[fantasy]] literature, including ''[[The Hobbit]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series by [[J. K. Rowling]], and ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' by [[George R. R. Martin]].

The word &quot;dragon&quot; has also come to be applied to the Chinese ''lung'' (traditional 龍, simplified 龙, [[Pinyin]] ''long''), which are associated with good fortune and are thought to have power over rain. Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of [[dragon dance|dragon dancing]] and [[dragon boat|dragon boat racing]]. Many [[East Asia]]n deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions. Dragons were also identified with the [[Emperor of China]], who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles.

Commonalities between dragons traits are often a hybridization of avian, feline, and reptilian features, and may include: snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth. Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating [[crocodile]]s bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern dragon imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/where-did-dragons-come-from-23969126/|title=Where Did Dragons Come From?|last=Stromberg|first=Joseph|date=January 23, 2012|website=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.people.cn/english/200004/29/eng20000429_40001.html|title=Archeologists Find Crocodile is Prototype of Dragon|date=April 29, 2000|website=People's Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also fits with the ancient words 'Draco' and 'Drakon', meaning 'large serpent' or 'sea serpent.'

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - dracan.jpg|thumb|An early appearance of the [[Old English]] word ''dracan'' in ''[[Beowulf]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OCc8TF53RhMC&amp;pg=PA196 Beowulf; a heroic poem of the 8th century, with tr., note and appendix by T. Arnold], 1876, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The word ''dragon'' entered the [[English language]] in the early 13th century from [[Old French]] ''dragon'', which in turn comes from {{lang-la|draconem}} (nominative ''draco'') meaning &quot;huge serpent, dragon&quot;, from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:δράκων|δράκων]]}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|drákōn}}'' (genitive {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:δράκοντος|δράκοντος]]}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|drákontos}}'') &quot;serpent, giant seafish&quot;.{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=4}}&lt;ref name=&quot;LiddelScott&quot;&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddra%2Fkwn2 Δράκων], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek and Latin term referred to any great serpent, not necessarily mythological.{{sfn|Ogden|2013|pages=2–4}} The Greek word {{lang|grc|δράκων}} is most likely derived from the Greek verb {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:δέρκομαι|δέρκομαι]]}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|dérkomai}}'') meaning &quot;I see&quot;, the [[aorist]] form of which is {{lang|grc|ἔδρακον}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|édrakon}}'').&lt;ref name=&quot;LiddelScott&quot;/&gt;

==Sources of inspiration for dragon myths==
[[File:Bone of Wawel Dragon.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Several bones purported to belong to the [[Wawel Dragon]] hang outside of [[Wawel Cathedral]], but actually belong to a [[Pleistocene]] mammal.]]
Draconic creatures appear in virtually all cultures around the globe.{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=96}} Nonetheless, scholars dispute where the idea of a dragon originates from{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=98}} and a wide variety of theories have been proposed.

{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=98}} In his book ''[[An Instinct for Dragons]]'' (2000), [[anthropologist]] [[David E. Jones]] suggests a hypothesis that humans, just like [[monkey]]s, have inherited instinctive reactions to snakes, [[Big cat|large cats]], and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32-40}} He cites a study which found that approximately 39 people in a hundred are afraid of snakes{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} and notes that fear of snakes is especially prominent in children, even in areas where snakes are rare.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=63}} The earliest attested dragons all resemble snakes or bear snakelike attributes.{{sfn|Jones|2000|pages=166–168}} Jones therefore concludes that the reason why dragons appear in nearly all cultures is because of humans' innate fear of snakes and other animals that were major predators of humans' primate ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=32}} Dragons are usually said to reside in &quot;dank caves, deep pools, wild mountain reaches, sea bottoms, haunted forests&quot;, all places which would have been fraught with danger for early human ancestors.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=108}}

In her book ''The First Fossil Hunters: Dinosaurs, Mammoths, and Myth in Greek and Roman Times'' (2000), [[Adrienne Mayor]] argues that some stories of dragons may have been inspired by ancient discoveries of fossils belonging to [[dinosaur]]s and other prehistoric animals.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|pages=xiii–xxii}} She argues that the dragon lore of northern India may have been inspired by &quot;observations of oversized, extraordinary bones in the fossilbeds of the [[Siwalik Hills]] below the [[Himalayas]]&quot;{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} and that ancient Greek artistic depictions of the [[Cetus (mythology)|Monster of Troy]] may have been influenced by fossils of ''[[Samotherium]]'', an extinct species of giraffe whose fossils are common in the Mediterranean region.{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xxii}} In China, a region where fossils of large prehistoric animals are common, these remains are frequently identified as &quot;dragon bones&quot;{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and are commonly used in Chinese [[traditional medicine]].{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} Mayor, however, is careful to point out that not all stories of dragons and giants are inspired by fossils{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} and notes that Scandinavia has many stories of dragons and sea monsters, but has long &quot;been considered barren of large fossils.&quot;{{sfn|Mayor|2000|page=xix}} In one of her later books, she states that &quot;Many dragon images around the world were based on folk knowledge or exaggerations of living reptiles, such as [[Komodo dragon]]s, [[Gila monster]]s, [[iguana]]s, [[alligator]]s, or, in California, [[Elgaria|alligator lizards]].&quot;{{sfn|Mayor|2005|page=149}}

[[File:Set speared Apep.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration from an ancient Egyptian papyrus manuscript showing the god [[Set (deity)|Set]] spearing the serpent [[Apep]] as he attacks the [[Matet boat|sun boat]] of [[Ra]]]]
In [[Egyptian mythology]], [[Apep]] is a giant serpent who resides in the [[Duat]], the Egyptian Underworld.{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=11}}{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=35}} The Bremner-Rhind papyrus, written in around 310 BC, preserves an account of a much older Egyptian tradition that the setting of the sun is caused by [[Ra]] descending to the Duat to battle Apep.{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=11}}{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=35}} In some accounts, Apep is as long as the height of eight men with a head made of [[flint]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=35}} Thunderstorms and earthquakes were thought to be caused by Apep's roar{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} and [[solar eclipse]]s were thought to be the result of Apep attacking Ra during the daytime.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} In some myths, Apep is slain by the god [[Set (deity)|Set]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|pages=35–36}} [[Nehebkau]] is another giant serpent who guards the Duat and aided Ra in his battle against Apep.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} Nehebkau was so massive in some stories that the entire earth was believed to rest atop his coils.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=36}} Denwen is a giant serpent mentioned in the [[Pyramid Texts]] whose body was made of fire and who ignited a conflagration that nearly destroyed all the gods of the Egyptian pantheon.{{sfn|Niles|2013|pages=36–37}} He was ultimately defeated by the [[Pharaoh]], a victory which affirmed the Pharaoh's divine right to rule.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=37}}

The [[ouroboros]] was a well-known Egyptian symbol of a serpent swallowing its own tail.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} The precursor to the ouroboros was the &quot;Many-Faced&quot;,{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} a serpent with five heads, who, according to the [[Amduat]], the oldest surviving [[Book of the Dead|Book of the Afterlife]], was said to coil around the corpse of the sun god Ra protectively.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} The earliest surviving depiction of a &quot;true&quot; ouroboros comes from the gilded shrines in [[KV62|the tomb]] of [[Tutankhamun]].{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} In the early centuries AD, the ouroboros was adopted as a symbol by [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christians{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=44}} and chapter 136 of the ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', an early Gnostic text, describes &quot;a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth&quot;.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=44}} In medieval alchemy, the ouroboros became a typical western dragon with wings, legs, and a tail.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}} A famous image of the dragon gnawing on its tail from the eleventh-century [[Codex Marcianus CCXXVIII (406)|Codex Marcianus]] was copied in numerous works on alchemy.{{sfn|Hornung|2001|page=13}}

In the ''[[Rigveda]]'', the oldest of the four [[Vedas]], [[Indra]], the Vedic god of storms, battles [[Vritra|Vṛtra]], a giant serpent who represents drought.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–257}} Indra kills Vṛtra using his ''[[vajra]]'' (thunderbolt) and clears the path for rain,{{sfn|West|2007|pages=256–257}}{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=16}} which is described in the form of cattle: &quot;You won the cows, hero, you won the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]],/You freed the seven streams to flow&quot; (''Rigveda'' 1.32.12).{{sfn|West|2007|page=257}} In another Rigvedic legend, the three-headed serpent [[Trisiras|Viśvarūpa]], the son of [[Tvastar|Tvaṣṭṛ]], guards a wealth of cows and horses.{{sfn|West|2007|page=260}} Indra delivers Viśvarūpa to a god named [[Trita|Trita Āptya]],{{sfn|West|2007|page=260}} who fights and kills him and sets his cattle free.{{sfn|West|2007|page=260}} Indra cuts off Viśvarūpa's heads and drives the cattle home for Trita.{{sfn|West|2007|page=260}} This same story is alluded to in the [[Younger Avesta]],{{sfn|West|2007|page=260}} in which the hero [[Fereydun|Thraētaona]], the son of Āthbya, slays the three-headed dragon [[Zahhak|Aži Dahāka]] and takes his two beautiful wives as spoils.{{sfn|West|2007|page=260}} Thraētaona's name (meaning &quot;third grandson of the waters&quot;) indicates that Aži Dahāka, like Vṛtra, was seen as a blocker of waters and cause of drought.{{sfn|West|2007|page=260}}

The [[Druk]] ({{lang-dz|འབྲུག་}}), also known as 'Thunder Dragon', is one of the [[National symbols of Bhutan]]. In the [[Dzongkha]] language, [[Bhutan]] is known as ''Druk Yul'' &quot;Land of Druk&quot;, and Bhutanese leaders are called [[Druk Gyalpo]], &quot;Thunder Dragon Kings&quot;.

Archaeologist Zhōu Chong-Fa believes that the Chinese word for dragon is an [[onomatopoeia]] of the sound of thunder&lt;ref&gt;''People's Daily On-line'' (2001), &quot;Chinese Dragon Originates From Primitive Agriculture: Archaeologist&quot;. Retrieved June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  or ''lùhng'' in [[Cantonese]].&lt;ref&gt;Guan, Caihua.

The [[Chinese dragon]] ({{zh|t=龍|s=龙|p=lóng}}) is the highest-ranking creature in the Chinese animal hierarchy. Its origins are vague, but its &quot;ancestors can be found on Neolithic pottery as well as Bronze Age ritual vessels.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Patricia Bjaaland. ''Chinese Art: A Guide to Motifs and Visual Imagery'', Tuttle Publishing, 2008, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; A number of popular stories deal with the rearing of dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} The ''[[Zuo zhuan]]'', which was probably written during the [[Warring States period]], describes a man named Dongfu, a descendant of Yangshu'an, who loved dragons{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} and, because he could understand a dragon's will, he was able to tame them and raise them well.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} He served Emperor Shun, who gave him the family name Huanlong, meaning &quot;Dragon-Raiser&quot;.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} In another story, [[Kongjia]], the fourteenth emperor of the [[Xia dynasty]], was given a male and a female dragon as a reward for his obedience to the god of heaven,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} but could not train them, so he hired a dragon-trainer named Liulei, who had learned how to train dragons from Huanlong.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} One day, the female dragon died unexpectedly, so Liulei secretly chopped her up, cooked her meat, and served it to the king,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} who loved it so much that he demanded Liulei to serve him the same meal again.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} Since Liulei had no means of procuring more dragon meat, he fled the palace.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}}

One of the most famous dragon stories is about the Lord Ye Gao, who loved dragons obsessively, even though he had never seen one.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} He decorated his whole house with dragon motifs{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} and, seeing this display of admiration, a real dragon came and visited Ye Gao,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} but the lord was so terrified at the sight of the creature that he ran away.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} In Chinese legend, the culture hero [[Fu Hsi]] is said to have been crossing the [[Luo River (Henan)|Lo River]], when he saw the ''[[Longma|lung ma]]'', a Chinese horse-dragon with seven dots on its face, six on its back, eight on its left flank, and nine on its right flank.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=64}} He was so moved by this apparition that, when he arrived home, he drew a picture of it, including the dots.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=64}} He later used these dots as letters and invented [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], which he used to write his book ''[[I Ching]]''.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=64}} In another Chinese legend, the physician Ma Shih Huang is said to have healed a sick dragon.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Another legend reports that a man once came to the healer Lo Chên-jen, telling him that he was a dragon and that he needed to be healed.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} After Lo Chên-jen healed the man, a dragon appeared to him and carried him to heaven.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}}

In the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas|Shanhaijing]]'', a classic mythography probably compiled mostly during the [[Han dynasty]], various deities and demigods are associated with dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=103–104}} One of the most famous Chinese dragons is Ying Long (&quot;Responding Dragon&quot;), who helped the [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]], the Yellow Emperor, defeat the tyrant [[Chiyou]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The dragon [[Zhulong (mythology)|Zhulong]] (&quot;Torch Dragon&quot;) is a god &quot;who composed the universe with his body.&quot;{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} In the ''Shanhaijing'', many mythic heroes are said to have been conceived after their mothers copulated with divine dragons, including Huangdi, [[Shennong]], [[Emperor Yao]], and [[Emperor Shun]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The god [[Zhurong]] and the emperor [[Qi of Xia|Qi]] are both described as being carried by two dragons,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=104–105}} as are Huangdi, [[Zhuanxu]], [[Yuqiang]], and Roshou in various other texts.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} According to the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', an evil black dragon once caused a destructive deluge,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} which was ended by the mother goddess [[Nüwa]] by slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}}

A large number of ethnic myths about dragons are told throughout China.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} The ''[[Houhanshu]]'', compiled in the fifth century BC by [[Fan Ye (historian)|Fan Ye]], reports a story belonging to the Ailaoyi people, which holds that a woman named Shayi who lived in the region around [[Mount Lao]] became pregnant with ten sons after being touched by a tree trunk floating in the water while fishing.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} She gave birth to the sons and the tree trunk turned into a dragon, who asked to see his sons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The woman showed them to him,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} but all of them ran away except for the youngest, who the dragon licked on the back and named Jiu Long, meaning &quot;Sitting Back&quot;.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The sons later elected him king and the descendants of the ten sons became the Ailaoyi people, who [[tattoo]]ed dragons on their backs in honor of their ancestor.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=104}} The [[Miao people]] of southwest China have a story that a divine dragon created the first humans by breathing on monkeys that came to play in his cave.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=105}} The [[Han Chinese|Han people]] have many stories about Short-Tailed Old Li, a black dragon who was born to a poor family in [[Shandong]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} When his mother saw him for the first time, she fainted{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} and, when his father came home from the field and saw him, he hit him with a spade and cut off part of his tail.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=106}} Li burst through the ceiling and flew away to the [[Amur River|Black Dragon River]] in northeast China, where he became the god of that river.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=106–107}} On the anniversary of his mother's death on the Chinese lunar calendar, Old Li returns home, causing it to rain.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=107}} He is still worshipped as a rain god.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=107}}

[[File:Dragon Gods.svg|thumb|left|Diagram illustrating the four great Dragon Kings of the [[Four Seas]]]]

Many traditional Chinese customs revolve around dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=108–109}} During various holidays, including the [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]] and [[Lantern Festival]], villagers will construct an approximately sixteen-foot-long dragon from grass, cloth, bamboo strips, and paper, which they will parade through the city as part of a [[dragon dance]].{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} The original purpose of this ritual was to bring good weather and a strong harvest,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} but now it is done mostly only for entertainment.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} During the [[Dragon Boat Festival|Duanwu]] festival, several villages, or even a whole province, will hold a [[Dragon boat|dragon boat race]], in which people race across a body of water in boats carved to look like dragons, while a large audience watches on the banks.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} The custom is traditionally said to have originated after the poet [[Qu Yuan]] committed suicide by drowning himself in the [[Miluo River]] and people raced out in boats hoping to save him,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} but most historians agree that the custom actually originated much earlier as a ritual to avert ill fortune.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Starting during the Han dynasty and continuing until the Qing dynasty, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] gradually became closely identified with dragons,{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} and emperors themselves claimed to be the incarnation of a divine dragon.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} Eventually, dragons were only allowed to appear on clothing, houses, and articles of everyday use belonging to the emperor{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} and any commoner who possessed everyday items bearing the image of the dragon were ordered to be executed.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|page=109}} After the last Chinese emperor was overthrown in 1911, this situation changed and now many ordinary Chinese people identify themselves as descendants of dragons.{{sfn|Yang|An|Turner|2005|pages=109–110}}

{{Main|Korean dragon}}
The Korean dragon is in many ways similar in appearance to other East Asian dragons such as the [[Chinese dragon|Chinese]] and [[Japanese dragon]]s. It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard. Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the Yeouiju (여의주), the Korean name for the mythical [[Cintamani]], in its claws or its mouth. It was said that whoever could wield the Yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons. As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9×9) scales on their backs, representing yang essence. Dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds. Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds. And human journeys to undersea realms, and especially the undersea palace of the Dragon King (용왕), are common in Korean folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Hayward | first = Philip| title= Scaled for Success: The Internationalisation of the Mermaid | year = 2018|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0861967322|url= |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Korean myths, some kings who founded kingdoms were described as descendants of dragons because the dragon was a symbol of the monarch. [[Lady Aryeong]], who was the first queen of [[Silla]] is said to have been born from a [[cockatrice]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Samguk yusa]]&lt;/ref&gt; while the grandmother of [[Taejo of Goryeo]], founder of [[Goryeo]], was reportedly the daughter of the dragon king of the West Sea.&lt;ref&gt;The book of the genealogy of [[Taejo of Goryeo]] - ''Pyeonnyeon-Tong-Long'' (편년통록)&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Munmu of Silla|King Munmu]] of Silla, who on his deathbed wished to become a dragon of the East Sea in order to protect the kingdom. Dragon patterns were used exclusively by the royal family. The royal robe was also called the dragon robe (용포). In [[Joseon Dynasty]], the royal insignia, featuring embroidered dragons, were attached to the robe's shoulders, the chest, and back. The King wore five-taloned dragon insignia while the Crown Prince wore four-taloned dragon insignia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=우리 옷 만들기 | year = 2004|publisher=Sungshin Women's University Press|isbn=978-8986092639|url= |pages=25–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally [[:ko:이무기|Imugis]] (이무기), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents. There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons. Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, ''yong'' or ''mireu'', if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven. Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons. By other accounts, an Imugi is a ''proto-dragon'' which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully fledged dragon. In either case they are said to be large, benevolent, [[Pythonidae|python]]-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Seo | first = Yeong Dae| title= 용, 그 신화와 문화 | year = 2002|publisher=Min sokwon|isbn=978-8956380223|url= |page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Japanese dragon}}
Japanese dragon myths amalgamate native legends with imported stories about dragons from China, Korea and India. Like these other Asian dragons, most Japanese ones are [[water deities]] associated with rainfall and bodies of water, and are typically depicted as large, wingless, serpentine creatures with clawed feet. Gould writes (1896:248),&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gould (geologist)|Gould, Charles]]. 1896. [https://archive.org/details/mythicalmonster00goulgoog &lt;!-- quote=mythical monsters. --&gt; Mythical Monsters&quot;]. W. H. Allen &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; the Japanese dragon is &quot;invariably figured as possessing three claws&quot;. A story about the ''[[samurai]]'' [[Minamoto no Mitsunaka]] tells that, while he was hunting in his own territory of [[Settsu Province|Settsu]], he fell asleep under a tree and had a dream in which a beautiful woman appeared to him and begged him to save her land from a giant serpent which was defiling it.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Mitsunaka agreed to help and the maiden gave him a magnificent horse.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} When he woke up, the horse was standing before him.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} He rode it to the [[Sumiyoshi taisha|Sumiyoshi]] temple, where he prayed for eight days.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Then he confronted the serpent and slew it with an arrow.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}}

It was believed that dragons could be appeased or [[exorcism|exorcised]] with metal.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} [[Nitta Yoshisada]] is said to have hurled a famous sword into the sea at [[Sagami Province|Sagami]] to appease the dragon-god of the sea{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} and [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] threw a metal mirror into the sea at Sumiyoshi for the same purpose.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Japanese Buddhism has also adapted dragons by subjecting them to [[Buddhist law]];{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} the Japanese Buddhist deities [[Benten]] and [[Kwannon]] are often shown sitting or standing on the back of a dragon.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} Several Japanese ''[[sennin]]'' (&quot;immortals&quot;) have taken dragons as their mounts.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} [[Bômô]] is said to have hurled his staff into a puddle of water, causing a dragon to come forth and let him ride it to heaven.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} The ''[[Arhat|rakan]]'' Handaka is said to have been able to conjure a dragon out of a bowl, which he is often shown playing with on ''kagamibuta''.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} The ''[[shachihoko]]'' is a creature with the head of a dragon, a bushy tail, fishlike scales, and sometimes fire emerging from its armpits.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} The ''[[shifun]]'' has the head of a dragon, feathered wings, and the tail and claws of a bird.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=62}} A white dragon was believed to reside in a pool in [[Yamashiro Province]]{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=63}} and, every fifty years, it would turn into a bird called the Ogonchô, which had a call like the &quot;howling of a wild dog&quot;.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=63}} This event was believed to herald terrible famine.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=63}} In the Japanese village of Okumura, near [[Edo]], during times of drought, the villagers would make a dragon effigy out of straw, [[magnolia]] leaves, and [[bamboo]] and parade it through the village to attract rainfall.{{sfn|Volker|1975|page=63}}

According to an ancient [[origin myth]], the [[Vietnamese people]] are descended from a dragon and a fairy. To Vietnamese people, the dragon brings rain, essential for agriculture. It represents the emperor, the prosperity and power of the nation. Like the [[Chinese dragon]], the Vietnamese dragon is the symbol of [[Yin and yang|yang]], representing the universe, life, existence, and growth.

In Ferdowsi's ''[[Shahnameh]],'' the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] hero [[Rostam]] must slay an 80-meter-long dragon (which renders itself invisible to human sight) with the aid of his legendary horse, [[Rakhsh]]. As Rostam is sleeping, the dragon approaches; Rakhsh attempts to wake Rostam, but fails to alert him to the danger until Rostam sees the dragon. Rakhsh bites the serpent, while Rostam decapitates it. This is the third trial of Rostam's [[Rostam's Seven Labours|Seven Labors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/cult/inside/gallery/dragon/dragon.html|title=Rakhsh helping Rostam defeat the dragon|website=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=231078&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Shahnameh&amp;page=1|title=Rustam killing a dragon|website=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/learning/cult/inside/corner/shah/synopsis.html|title=Shahname Synopsis|website=British Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rostam is also credited with the slaughter of other dragons in the ''Shahnameh'' and in other Iranian oral traditions, notably in the myth of ''[[Babr-e Bayan|Babr-e-Bayan]]''. In this tale, Rostam is still an adolescent and kills a dragon in the &quot;Orient&quot; (either India or China depending on the source) by forcing it to swallow either ox hides filled with quicklime and stones or poisoned blades. The dragon swallows these foreign objects and its stomach bursts, after which Rostam flays the dragon and fashions a coat from its hide called the ''babr-e bayān''. In some variants of the story, Rostam then remains unconscious for two days and nights, but is guarded by his steed [[Rakhsh]]. On reviving, he washes himself in a spring. In the [[Mandaeism|Mandean]] tradition of the story, Rostam hides in a box, is swallowed by the dragon and kills it from inside its belly. The king of China then gives Rostam his daughter in marriage as a reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azdaha-dragon-various-kinds#pt1|title=Azdaha|website=Encyclopedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/babr-e-bayan-or-babr|title=Babr-e-Bayan|website=Encyclopedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greek word usually translated as &quot;dragon&quot; (δράκων ''drákōn'', [[genitive]] δράκοντοϛ ''drákontos'') could also mean &quot;snake&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hartsock, ''Sight and Blindness in Luke-Acts: The Use of Physical Features in Characterization'', Brill, Leiden-Boston, 2008, [https://archive.org/details/sightblindnessin00chad/page/193 pp. 193–4].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ogden|2013|pages=2–4}} but it usually refers to a kind of giant serpent that either possesses supernatural characteristics or is otherwise controlled by some supernatural power.{{sfn|Ogden|2013|pages=2–3}} The first mention of a &quot;dragon&quot; in [[ancient Greek literature]] occurs in the ''[[Iliad]]'', in which [[Agamemnon]] is described as having a blue dragon motif on his sword belt and an emblem of a three-headed dragon on his breast plate.&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Nevill, ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric'', Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2003 {{ISBN|81-208-1989-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k-tVr09oq3IC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=earliest+mention+of+dragon&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fxq_n3SLTa&amp;sig=zKfmIXx1BT3nQAZq3I0vkx9akhM&amp;hl=en p.79].&lt;/ref&gt; In lines 820–880 of the ''[[Theogony]]'', a Greek poem written in the seventh century BC by the [[Boeotia]]n poet [[Hesiod]], the Greek god [[Zeus]] battles the monster [[Typhon]], who has one hundred serpent heads that breathe fire and speak all kinds of frightening animal noises.{{sfn|West|2007|page=257}} Zeus scorches all of Typhon's heads with his lightning bolts and then hurls Typhon into [[Tartarus]].{{sfn|West|2007|page=258}} In the ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Apollo]]'', the god [[Apollo]] uses his [[Arrow poison|poisoned arrows]] to slay the serpent [[Python (mythology)|Python]], who has been causing death and pestilence in the area around [[Delphi]].{{sfn|Ogden|2013|pages=47–48}}{{sfn|West|2007|page=258}} Apollo then sets up his shrine there.{{sfn|West|2007|page=258}}

In [[Albanian mythology|Albanian mythology and folklore]], ''[[stihi]]'', ''[[ljubi]]'', ''[[Kulshedra|bolla, bollar, errshaja and kulshedra]]'' are mythological figures described as serpentine dragons. It is believed that ''bolla'', a water and chthonic demonic serpent, undergoes [[metamorphosis]] passing through four distinct phases if it lives many years without being seen by a human. The ''bollar'' and ''errshaja'' are the intermediate stages, while the ''kulshedra'' is the ultimate phase, described as a huge multi-headed fire-spitting female serpent which causes drought, storms, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters against mankind. She is usually fought and defeated by a [[drangue]], a semi-human winged divine hero and protector of humans. Heavy thunderstorms are thought to be the result of their battles.{{sfnp|Doja|2005|p=449–462}}{{Sfn|Elsie|2001|pp=46-47, 74-76, 153-156}}

In [[Slavic mythology]], the words ''&quot;zmey&quot;'', ''&quot;zmiy&quot;'' or ''&quot;zmaj&quot;'' are used to describe dragons. These words are masculine forms of the Slavic word for &quot;snake&quot;, which are normally feminine (like Russian ''zmeya''). In [[Romania]], there is a similar figure, derived from the Slavic dragon and named ''[[zmeu]]''. Exclusively in Polish and Belarusian folklore, as well as in the other Slavic folklores, a dragon is also called (variously) ''смок'', ''цмок'', or ''smok''. In South Slavic folklores, the same thing is also called ''lamya'' (ламя, ламjа, lamja). Although quite similar to other [[European dragon]]s, Slavic dragons have their peculiarities.

In [[Folklore of Russia|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian folklore]], [[Zmey Gorynych]] is a dragon with three heads, each one bearing twin goatlike horns.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=146}} He is said to have breathed fire and smelled of [[sulfur]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=146}} It was believed that [[eclipse]]s were caused by Gorynych temporarily swallowing the sun.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} According to one legend, Gorynych's uncle was the evil sorcerer Nemal Chelovek, who abducted the daughter of the [[tsar]] and imprisoned her in his castle in the [[Ural Mountains]].{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} Many knights tried to free her, but all of them were killed by Gorynych's fire.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=147}} Then a palace guard in [[Moscow]] named [[Ivan Tsarevich]] overheard two crows talking about the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|pages=147–148}} He went to the tsar, who gave him a magic sword, and snuck into the castle.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} When Chelovek attacked Ivan in the form of a giant, the sword flew from Ivan's hand unbidden and killed him.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} Then the sword cut off all three of Gorynych's heads at once.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}} Ivan brought the princess back to the tsar, who declared Ivan a nobleman and allowed him to marry the princess.{{sfn|Niles|2013|page=148}}

A popular Polish folk tale is the legend of the [[Wawel Dragon]],{{sfn|Sikorski|1997|page=235}}{{sfn|Dębicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-Łysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} which is first recorded in the ''[[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|Chronica Polonorum]]'' of [[Wincenty Kadłubek]], written between 1190 and 1208.{{sfn|Dębicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-Łysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} According to Kadłubek, the dragon appeared during the reign of [[Krakus|King Krakus]]{{sfn|Dębicka}} and demanded to be fed a fixed number of cattle every week.{{sfn|Dębicka}} If the villagers failed to provide enough cattle, the dragon would eat the same number of villagers as the number of cattle they had failed to provide.{{sfn|Dębicka}} Krakus ordered his sons to slay the dragon.{{sfn|Dębicka}} Since they could not slay it by hand,{{sfn|Dębicka}} they tricked the dragon into eating calfskins filled with burning sulfur.{{sfn|Dębicka}} Once the dragon was dead, the younger brother attacked and murdered his older brother and returned home to claim all the glory for himself,{{sfn|Dębicka}} telling his father that his brother had died fighting the dragon.{{sfn|Dębicka}} The younger brother became king after his father died, but his secret was eventually revealed and he was banished.{{sfn|Dębicka}} In the fifteenth century, [[Jan Długosz]] rewrote the story so that King Krakus himself was the one who slew the dragon.{{sfn|Sikorski|1997|page=235}}{{sfn|Dębicka}}{{sfn|Kitowska-Łysiak|Wolicka|1999|page=231}} Another version of the story told by [[Marcin Bielski]] instead has the clever shoemaker Skubę come up with the idea for slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Dębicka}}{{sfn|Rożek|1988|page=27}} Bielski's version is now the most popular.{{sfn|Dębicka}}

[[File:Smaug par David Demaret.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Modern [[Fan art|fan illustration]] by David Demaret of the dragon [[Smaug]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s 1937 [[high fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'']]
Dragons and dragon motifs are featured in many works of modern literature, particularly within the [[fantasy]] genre.{{sfn|Malone|2012|pages=96–98}}{{sfn|Williamson|2015|page=28}} As early as the eighteenth century, critical thinkers such as [[Denis Diderot]] were already asserting that too much literature had been published on dragons: &quot;There are already in books all too many fabulous stories of dragons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|title=Dragons|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.976|website=The Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s classic [[Children's literature|children's novel]] ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' (1872), one of the inset poems describes the [[Jabberwocky|Jabberwock]], a kind of dragon.{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=96}} Carroll's illustrator [[John Tenniel]], a famous [[Editorial cartoon|political cartoonist]], humorously showed the Jabberwock with the [[waistcoat]], [[Malocclusion|buck teeth]], and [[Near-sightedness|myopic eyes]] of a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] university lecturer, such as Carroll himself.{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=96}} In works of comedic children's fantasy, dragons often fulfill the role of a magic fairy tale helper.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|2012|page=56}} In such works, rather than being frightening as they are traditionally portrayed, dragons are instead represented as harmless, benevolent, and inferior to humans.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|2012|page=56}} They are sometimes shown living in contact with humans, or in isolated communities of only dragons.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|2012|page=56}} Though popular in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, &quot;such comic and idyllic stories&quot; began to grow increasingly rare after the 1960s, due to demand for more serious children's literature.{{sfn|Nikolajeva|2012|page=56}}

One of the most iconic modern dragons is [[Smaug]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s classic novel ''[[The Hobbit]]''.{{sfn|Malone|2012|pages=96–98}} Dragons also appear in the best-selling ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of children's novels by [[J. K. Rowling]].{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=96}} Other prominent works depicting dragons include [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'', [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Earthsea|Earthsea Cycle]]'', [[George R. R. Martin]]'s series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', and [[Christopher Paolini]]'s ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]''. Sandra Martina Schwab writes, &quot;With a few exceptions, including McCaffrey's Pern novels and the 2002 film ''Reign of Fire'', dragons seem to fit more into the medievalized setting of fantasy literature than into the more technological world of science fiction. Indeed, they have been called the emblem of fantasy. The hero's fight against the dragon emphasizes and celebrates his masculinity, whereas revisionist fantasies of dragons and dragon-slaying often undermine traditional gender roles. In children's literature the friendly dragon becomes a powerful ally in battling the child's fears.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Schwab, Sandra Martina |chapter= Dragons |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders |editor= [[Gary Westfahl]] |location= Westport, CT |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |year= 2005 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 216 |isbn= 0-313-32951-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular [[role-playing game]] system ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (D&amp;D) makes heavy use of [[Dragon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dragons]].{{sfn|Malone|2012|page=98}}

After recent discoveries in [[palaeontology]], fictional dragons are sometimes represented with no front legs, but (when on the ground) walking on their back feet and the wrists of their wings, like [[pterosaur]]s did: for example see [https://media.entertainmentearth.com/assets/images/9b4952bb41f041aeae8b17d8c60e9b89lg.jpg (in Game of Thrones)] and [https://www.cgstudio.com/imgd/l/45/5a43e11ea70248094b8b4567/8130-smaug-hobbit-dragon.jpg (Smaug, as in the movie)].
