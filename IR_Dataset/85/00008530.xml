The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the [[Mediterranean Basin]] for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts (for [[Herod the Great]]), and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummification]] to [[potash]] for [[fertiliser]]s.

The Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is {{convert|605|km2|abbr=on}}, having been {{convert|1050|km2|abbr=on}} in 1930. The recession of the Dead Sea has begun causing problems, and multiple canals and pipelines proposals exist to reduce its recession. One of these proposals is the [[Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance]] project, carried out by [[Jordan]], which will provide water to neighbouring countries, while the brine will be carried to the Dead Sea to help stabilise its water level. The first phase of the project is scheduled to begin in 2018 and be completed in 2021.&lt;ref name=&quot;JT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/5-alliances-shortlisted-execute-red-dead%E2%80%99s-phase-i|title=5 alliances shortlisted to execute Red-Dead's phase I|accessdate=3 December 2016|date=27 November 2016|work=The Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and toponymy==
In Hebrew, the Dead Sea is ''{{Audio|He-Dead Sea.ogg|Yām ha-Melaḥ}}'' ({{Hebrew|ים המלח}}), meaning &quot;sea of [[salt]]&quot; ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:3). The Bible uses this term alongside two others: the Sea of the Arabah (''{{transl|he|Yām ha-‘Ărāvâ}}'' {{Hebrew|ים הערבה}}), and the Eastern Sea (''{{transl|he|ha-Yām ha-kadmoni}}'' {{Hebrew|הים הקדמוני}}). The designation &quot;Dead Sea&quot; never appears in the Bible. In prose sometimes the term ''{{transl|he|Yām ha-Māvet}}'' ({{Hebrew|ים המוות}}, &quot;sea of death&quot;) is used, due to the scarcity of aquatic life there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bridger|author2=Samuel Wolk|title=The New Jewish Encyclopedia|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hZqpCrG3qw0C&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=July 25, 2011|date=September 1976|publisher=Behrman House, Inc|isbn=978-0-87441-120-1|page=109|quote=It was named the &quot;Dead Sea&quot; because of the fact that no living thing can exist there, since the water is extremely salty and bitter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the Dead Sea is called {{Audio|ArDeadSea.ogg|''al-Bahr al-Mayyit''}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; (&quot;the Dead Sea&quot;), or less commonly ''{{transl|ar|baḥrᵘ lūṭᵃ}}'' ({{lang|ar|بحر لوط}}, &quot;the Sea of [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]]&quot;). Another historic name in Arabic was the &quot;Sea of [[Neve Zohar|Zoʼar]]&quot;, after a nearby town in biblical times. The Greeks called it ''Lake Asphaltites'' ([[Attic Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἡ Θάλαττα ἀσφαλτῖτης}}, ''{{transl|el|hē Thálatta asphaltĩtēs}}'', &quot;the Asphaltite&lt;ref&gt;See [[bitumen]] and [[asphalt]] for more about ''asphaltite''.&lt;/ref&gt; sea&quot;).

==Geography==
[[File:Dead Sea Galilee.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Satellite photography|Satellite photograph]] showing the location of the Dead Sea east of the Mediterranean Sea]]
The Dead Sea is an [[endorheic basin|endorheic lake]] located in the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], a geographic feature formed by the [[Dead Sea Transform]] (DST). This left lateral-moving [[transform fault]] lies along the [[tectonics|tectonic]] [[plate tectonics|plate boundary]] between the [[African Plate]] and the [[Arabian Plate]]. It runs between the [[East Anatolian Fault]] zone in [[Turkey]] and the northern end of the [[Red Sea Rift]] offshore of the southern tip of [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. It is here that the Upper Jordan River/Sea of Galilee/Lower Jordan River water system comes to an end.

The [[Jordan River]] is the only major water source flowing into the Dead Sea, although there are small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and [[quicksand]] pits along the edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tommyimages.com/Stock_Photos/Middle_East/Israel/Dead_Sea/index.html|title=Springs and quicksand at the Dead Sea|accessdate=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no outlet streams.

The Mujib River, biblical Arnon, is one of the larger water sources of the Dead Sea other than the Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSDSC&quot;/&gt; The [[Wadi Mujib]] valley, 420 m below the sea level in the southern part of the Jordan valley, is a [[Man and the Biosphere Programme#Biosphere reserves|biosphere reserve]], with an area of {{convert|212|km2|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/environment/ecological-sciences/biosphere-reserves/arab-states/jordan/mujib/|title= Mujib |publisher=UNESCO|accessdate= 7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other more substantial sources are Wadi Darajeh (Arabic)/Nahal Dragot (Hebrew), and [[Ein Gedi|Nahal Arugot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RSDSC&quot;&gt;[http://www.gsi.gov.il/_uploads/ftp/GsiReport/2010/Tahal-GSI-19-2010.pdf Red Sea – Dead Sea Water Conveyance Study (RSDSC) Program: Dead Sea Study, July 2010, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wadi Hasa]] (biblical Zered) is another [[wadi]] flowing into the Dead Sea.

Rainfall is scarcely {{convert|100|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely {{convert|50|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the southern part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exact-me.org/overview/p4144.htm |title=Dead Sea |publisher=Exact Me.org |accessdate=January 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120074227/http://exact-me.org/overview/p4144.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the [[rain shadow|rainshadow]] effect of the [[Judaean Mountains]]. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.

To the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a {{convert|210|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} tall [[Halite (mineral)|Halite]] mineral formation called [[Mount Sodom]].

==Geology==
[[File:Dead Sea, Jordanian Shore.jpg|thumb|The Jordanian shore of the Dead Sea, showing salt deposits left behind by falling water levels.]]
===Formation theories===
There are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that the Dead Sea lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the [[Red Sea Rift]], or even of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]] of [[East Africa|eastern Africa]]. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a &quot;step-over&quot; discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating an extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.

===Sedom Lagoon===
During the late [[Pliocene]]-early [[Pleistocene]]&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gsi.gov.il/_Uploads/4739SteinF.pdf |title= The limnological history of late Pleistocene – Holocene water bodies in the Dead Sea basin |author= Mordechai Stein |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130513022228/http://www.gsi.gov.il/_Uploads/4739SteinF.pdf |archivedate= 2013-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, around 3.7 million years ago,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and the northern [[Arabah|Wadi Arabah]] was repeatedly inundated by waters from the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt; The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay that is called by geologists the Sedom Lagoon, which was connected to the sea through what is now the [[Jezreel Valley]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The floods of the valley came and went depending on long-scale changes in the tectonic and [[climate change (general concept)|climatic conditions]].&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;

The Sedom Lagoon extended at its maximum from the [[Sea of Galilee]] in the north to somewhere around {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} south of the current southern end of the Dead Sea, and the subsequent lakes never surpassed this expanse. The [[Hula Valley|Hula Depression]] was never part of any of these water bodies due to its higher elevation and the high threshold of the [[Chorazin#Geomorphology|Korazim block]] separating it from the Sea of Galilee basin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kafri2010&quot;/&gt;

===Salt deposits===
The Sedom Lagoon deposited [[evaporites]] mainly consisting of [[halite|rock salt]], which eventually reached a thickness of {{convert|2.3|km|2|abbr=on}} on the old basin floor in the area of today's [[Mount Sedom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BenAvrahamKatsman15&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Zvi |surname1= Ben-Avraham |first2= Regina |surname2= Katsman |title= The formation of graben morphology in the Dead Sea Fault, and its implications |journal= Geophysical Research Letters |publisher= American Geophysical Union |volume= 42 |issue= 17 |year= 2015 |at= 2.2. Sedimentary Regime, p. 6991 (of 6989–6996) |doi-access=free |doi= 10.1002/2015GL065111 |quote= Estuarine-lagoonal series of syn-rift evaporites of the latest Miocene—Pliocene ages. Sedimentary regime and mineral composition indicate that .... the Sedom formation in the DSB [Dead Sea Basin] .... , consisting mainly of [[halite]], can be related to ingression of sea waters .... through the Yezreel Valley inland into the Jordan-Arava rift valley (from the Sea of Galilee to the present-day Dead Sea....) in the Late Neogene. After its disconnection from the open sea that could be associated with either eustatic changes in the sea, tectonic uplift of Judea-Samaria anticline, or other processes [Stein, 2014], the rift valley was occupied by a series of hypersaline terminal lakes. They occasionally evaporated and precipitated halite. .... Restoration of the Sedom diapir to its original uniform thickness covering the basin floor yields 2.3 km.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lake formation===
Approximately two million years ago,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} the land between the [[Rift valley|Rift Valley]] and the Mediterranean Sea rose to such an extent that the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long lagoon became a landlocked lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kafri2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1= Uri Kafri |author2= Yoseph Yechieli |title= Groundwater Base Level Changes and Adjoining Hydrological Systems |year= 2010 |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn= 9783642139444 |page= 123 |bibcode= 2010gblc.book.....K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prehistoric lake to follow the Sedom Lagoon is named '''Lake Amora''' (which possibly appeared in the early Pleistocene; its sediments developed into the Amora (Samra) Formation, dated to over 200-80 [[kyr]] [[Before Present|BP]]), followed by '''[[Lake Lisan]]''' (c. 70-14 kyr) and finally by the Dead Sea.&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;

===Lake salinity===
The water levels and salinity of the successive lakes (Amora, Lisan, Dead Sea) have either risen or fallen as an effect of the tectonic dropping of the valley bottom, and due to climate variation. As the climate became more arid, Lake Lisan finally shrank and became saltier, leaving the Dead Sea as its last remainder.&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kafri2010&quot;/&gt;

From 70,000 to 12,000 years ago, Lake Lisan's level was {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|250|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} higher than its current level. Its level fluctuated dramatically, rising to its highest level around 26,000 years ago, indicating a very wet climate in the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SocietySociety1971&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1= Geochemical Society |author2= Meteoritical Society |title= Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=3LccAQAAIAAJ |access-date= April 12, 2011 |year= 1971 |publisher= Pergamon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 10,000 years ago, the lake's level dropped dramatically, probably  even lower than today. During the last several thousand years, the lake has fluctuated approximately {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, with some significant drops and rises. Current theories as to the cause of this dramatic drop in levels rule out [[volcano|volcanic activity]]; therefore, it may have been a seismic event.

===Salt mounts formation===
In [[prehistory|prehistoric times]]{{dubious|Seems far too recent. Much rather: geologic times. Please check, specify which geological era(s).|date=October 2019}}, great amounts of sediment collected on the floor of Lake Amora. The sediment was heavier than the salt deposits and squeezed the salt deposits upwards into what are now the [[Lisan Peninsula]] and [[Mount Sodom]] (on the southwest side of the lake). Geologists explain the effect in terms of a bucket of mud into which a large flat stone is placed, forcing the mud to creep up the sides of the bucket. When the floor of the Dead Sea dropped further due to tectonic forces, the salt mounts of Lisan and Mount Sodom stayed in place as high cliffs (see [[salt dome]]).

==Climate==
The Dead Sea has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] BWh), with year-round sunny skies and dry air. It has less than {{convert|50|mm|in|0|}} mean annual rainfall and a summer average temperature between {{convert|32|and|39|C|F}}. Winter average temperatures range between {{convert|20|and|23|C|F}}. The region has weaker [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]], particularly the UVB (erythrogenic rays). Given the higher [[atmospheric pressure]], the air has a slightly higher [[oxygen]] content (3.3% in summer to 4.8% in winter) as compared to oxygen concentration at sea level.&lt;ref name=DSRC&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Resources|url=http://www.deadsea-health.org/new_html/general_main.html|work=Dead Sea Research Center|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.extremescience.com/dead-sea.htm|title=Lowest Elevation: Dead Sea |accessdate=May 22, 2007|work=Extreme Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barometric pressures at the Dead Sea were measured between 1061 and 1065 hPa and clinically compared with health effects at higher altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramer |first=MR |author2=Springer C |author3=Berkman N |author4=Glazer M |author5=Bublil M |author6=Bar-Yishay E |author7=Godfrey S |title=Rehabilitation of hypoxemic patients with COPD at low altitude at the Dead Sea, the lowest place on earth |journal=Chest |date=March 1998 |volume=113 |issue=3 |pages=571–575 |quote={{PMID|9515826}} |url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/21761/571.pdf |doi=10.1378/chest.113.3.571 |pmid=9515826 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195349/http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/data/Journals/CHEST/21761/571.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This barometric measure is about 5% higher than sea level standard atmospheric pressure of 1013.25 hPa, which is the global ocean mean or ATM.) The Dead Sea affects temperatures nearby because of the moderating effect a large body of water has on climate. During the winter, sea temperatures tend to be higher than land temperatures, and vice versa during the summer months. This is the result of the water's mass and [[specific heat capacity]]. On average, there are 192 days above {{cvt|30|°C|||}} annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climatological Averages for Dead Sea |url=http://www.ims.gov.il/IMS/CLIMATE |publisher=IMS |accessdate=June 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607231313/http://ims.gov.il/IMS/CLIMATE |archivedate=June 7, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
[[File:Dead Sea Halite View 031712.jpg|thumb|Halite deposits (and teepee structure) along the western Dead Sea coast]]With 34.2% [[salinity]] (in 2011), it is one of the [[List of bodies of water by salinity|world's saltiest bodies of water]], though [[Lake Vanda]] in [[Antarctica]] (35%), [[Lake Assal (Djibouti)|Lake Assal]] in [[Djibouti]] (34.8%), Lagoon [[Garabogazköl]] in the [[Caspian Sea]] (up to 35%) and some hypersaline ponds and lakes of the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] in [[Antarctica]] (such as [[Don Juan Pond]] (44%)) have reported higher salinities.

Until the winter of 1978–79, when a major mixing event took place,&lt;ref name=overturn/&gt; the Dead Sea was composed of two stratified layers of water that differed in temperature, density, age, and salinity. The topmost {{convert|35|m|ft|0|sp=us}} or so of the Dead Sea had an average salinity of 342 [[Concentration|parts per thousand]] (in 2002), and a temperature that swung between {{convert|19|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and {{convert|37|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. Underneath a zone of transition, the lowest level of the Dead Sea had waters of a consistent {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}} temperature and complete saturation of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Since the water near the bottom is [[Saturated solution|saturated]], the salt precipitates out of solution onto the [[seabed|sea floor]].

Beginning in the 1960s, water inflow to the Dead Sea from the Jordan River was reduced as a result of large-scale irrigation and generally low rainfall. By 1975, the upper water layer was saltier than the lower layer. Nevertheless, the upper layer remained suspended above the lower layer because its waters were warmer and thus less dense. When the upper layer cooled so its density was greater than the lower layer, the waters mixed (1978–79). For the first time in centuries, the lake was a homogeneous body of water. Since then, [[stratification (water)|stratification]] has begun to redevelop.&lt;ref name=overturn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/deadsea.htm|title=Dead Sea Canal|publisher=American.edu|date=1996-12-09|accessdate=May 5, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522133748/http://www1.american.edu/TED/deadsea.htm|archivedate=May 22, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:SaltCementedPebblesDeadSea.JPG|thumb|Pebbles cemented with [[Halite]] on the western shore of the Dead Sea near Ein Gedi|alt=|left]]

The mineral content of the Dead Sea is very different from that of ocean water. The exact composition of the Dead Sea water varies mainly with season, depth and temperature. In the early 1980s, the concentration of ionic species (in g/kg) of Dead Sea surface water was Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (181.4), Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (4.2), SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (0.4), HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (0.2), Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (14.1), Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (32.5), K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (6.2) and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (35.2). The total salinity was 276 g/kg.&lt;ref&gt;I. Steinhorn, ''In Situ Salt Precipitation at the Dead Sea'', Limnol. Oceanogr. 28(3),1983, 580-583&lt;/ref&gt; These results show that the composition of the salt, as anhydrous chlorides on a weight percentage basis, was [[calcium chloride]] (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 14.4%, [[potassium chloride]] (KCl) 4.4%, [[magnesium chloride]] (MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 50.8% and [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) 30.4%. In comparison, the salt in the water of most [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s is approximately 85% [[sodium chloride]]. The concentration of [[sulfate]] ions (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) is very low, and the concentration of [[bromide]] ions (Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is the highest of all waters on Earth.[[File:Halite Dead Sea Beach Pebbles.JPG|thumb|Beach pebbles made of [[Halite]]; western coast]]

The salt concentration of the Dead Sea fluctuates around 31.5%. This is unusually high and results in a nominal density of 1.24&amp;nbsp;kg/l. Anyone can easily float in the Dead Sea because of natural [[buoyancy]]. In this respect the Dead Sea is similar to the [[Great Salt Lake]] in [[Utah]] in the United States.

An unusual feature of the Dead Sea is its discharge of [[asphalt]]. From deep [[Petroleum seep|seeps]], the Dead Sea constantly spits up small pebbles and blocks of the black substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 =Bein, A. |author2 =O.

==Putative therapies==
{{More medical citations needed|date=March 2015}}
The Dead Sea area has become a location for [[health]] [[research]] and potential treatment for several reasons. The mineral content of the water, the low content of [[pollen]]s and other [[allergen]]s in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], the reduced [[ultraviolet]] component of [[Sunlight|solar radiation]], and the higher [[atmospheric pressure]] at this great depth each may have specific [[health effect]]s. For example, persons experiencing reduced [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] function from [[disease]]s such as [[cystic fibrosis]] seem to benefit from the increased atmospheric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadsea-health.org/new_html/diseases_respiratory.html |title=Asthma, Cystic Fibrosis, Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease|accessdate=May 22, 2007|work=Dead Sea Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region's climate and low elevation have made it a popular center for assessment of putative therapies:
*[[Climatotherapy]]: Treatment which exploits local climatic features such as [[temperature]], [[humidity]], [[Sunlight|sunshine]], [[Atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] and special atmospheric constituents
*[[Light therapy|Heliotherapy]]: Treatment that exploits the biological effects of the [[sun]]'s radiation

== Fauna and flora ==
[[File:Dead Sea Sunrise.jpg|thumb|Dead Sea in the morning, seen from [[Masada]]]]

The sea is called &quot;dead&quot; because its high salinity prevents macroscopic aquatic organisms, such as fish and [[aquatic plant]]s, from living in it, though minuscule quantities of bacteria and microbial fungi are present.

In times of flood, the salt content of the Dead Sea can drop from its usual 35% to 30% or lower. The Dead Sea temporarily comes to life in the wake of rainy winters. In 1980, after one such rainy winter, the normally dark blue Dead Sea turned red. Researchers from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] found the Dead Sea to be teeming with a type of [[alga]] called ''[[Dunaliella]]''. ''Dunaliella'' in turn nourished [[carotenoid]]-containing (red-[[pigment]]ed) [[halobacteria]], whose presence caused the color change. Since 1980, the Dead Sea basin has been dry and the algae and the bacteria have not returned in measurable numbers.

In 2011 a group of scientists from Be'er Sheva, Israel and Germany discovered fissures in the floor of the Dead Sea by scuba diving and observing the surface. These fissures allow fresh and brackish water to enter the Dead Sea. They sampled biofilms surrounding the fissures and discovered numerous species of bacteria and [[archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= PLOS ONE |journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=6|pages=e38319|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0038319 |year = 2012|last1 = Ionescu|first1 = Danny|last2=Siebert|first2=Christian|last3=Polerecky|first3=Lubos|last4=Munwes|first4=Yaniv Y.|last5=Lott|first5=Christian|last6=Häusler|first6=Stefan|last7=Bižić-Ionescu|first7=Mina|last8=Quast|first8=Christian|last9=Peplies|first9=Jörg|last10=Glöckner|first10=Frank Oliver|last11=Ramette|first11=Alban|last12=Rödiger|first12=Tino|last13=Dittmar|first13=Thorsten|last14=Oren|first14=Aharon|last15=Geyer|first15=Stefan|last16=Stärk|first16=Hans-Joachim|last17=Sauter|first17=Martin|last18=Licha|first18=Tobias|last19=Laronne|first19=Jonathan B.|last20=De Beer|first20=Dirk|pmid=22679498|pmc=3367964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animal species live in the mountains surrounding the Dead Sea. Hikers can see [[ibex]], [[hare]]s, [[hyrax]]es, [[jackal]]s, [[fox]]es, and even [[Arabian Leopard|leopard]]s. Hundreds of [[bird]] species inhabit the zone as well. Both Jordan and Israel have established [[nature reserve]]s around the Dead Sea.

The delta of the Jordan River was formerly a [[jungle]] of [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus]] and [[Arecaceae|palm tree]]s. The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] described [[Jericho]] as &quot;the most fertile spot in [[Judea]]&quot;. In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, [[sugarcane]],{{dubious|Fatimid and Crusader period only, unless proven differently.|date=October 2015}} [[henna]], and [[Ficus sycomorus|sycamore fig]] all made the lower Jordan valley wealthy. One of the most valuable products produced by Jericho was the [[Balsam of Mecca|sap]] of the [[Commiphora|balsam]] tree, which could be made into [[perfume]]. By the 19th century, Jericho's fertility had disappeared.{{dubious|Really? Why? Source? Jordan, other streams still there, population and water needs low.|date=October 2015}}

==Human settlement==
There are several small communities near the Dead Sea. These include [[Ein Gedi]], [[Neve Zohar]] and the [[Israeli settlement]]s in the [[Megilot Regional Council]]: [[Kalya]], [[Mitzpe Shalem]] and [[Avnat]]. There is a nature preserve at Ein Gedi, and several Dead Sea hotels are located on the southwest end at [[Ein Bokek]] near Neve Zohar. [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Highway 90]] runs north-south on the Israeli side for a total distance of {{convert|565|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Metula]] on the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] border in the north to its southern terminus at the [[Egypt]]ian border near the [[Red Sea]] port of [[Eilat]].

[[Potash City]] is a small community on the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, and others including Suweima. [[Highway 65 (Jordan)|Highway 65]] runs north-south on the Jordanian side from near Jordan's northern tip down past the Dead Sea to the port of [[Aqaba]].

==Human history==
[[File:MountSodom061607.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Sodom]], Israel, showing the so-called &quot;[[Lot's Wife]]&quot; pillar (made of [[Halite (mineral)]] like the rest of the mountain)]]

===Biblical period===
Dwelling in caves near the Dead Sea is recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as having taken place before the [[Israelites]] came to [[Canaan]], and extensively at the time of King [[David]].

Just northwest of the Dead Sea is [[Jericho]]. Somewhere, perhaps on the southeastern shore, would be the cities mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] which were said to have been destroyed in the time of [[Abraham]]: [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom and Gomorra]] (Genesis 18) and the three other &quot;Cities of the Plain&quot;, [[Admah]], [[Zeboim (Hebrew Bible)|Zeboim]] and [[Zoara|Zoar]] (Deuteronomy 29:23). Zoar escaped destruction when Abraham's nephew [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] escaped to Zoar from Sodom (Genesis 19:21–22). Before the destruction, the Dead Sea was a valley full of natural [[tar pit]]s, which was called the '''vale of Siddim'''. King David was said to have hidden from [[Saul]] at Ein Gedi nearby.

In {{bibleverse-lb||Ezekiel|47:8–9|HE}} there is a specific prophecy that the sea will &quot;be healed and made fresh&quot;, becoming a normal lake capable of supporting [[marine biology|marine life]]. A similar prophecy is stated in {{bibleverse-lb||Zechariah|14:8|HE}}, which says that &quot;living waters will go out from [[Jerusalem]], half of them to the eastern sea [likely the Dead Sea] and half to the western sea [the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]].&quot;

===Greek and Roman period===
[[Aristotle]] wrote about the remarkable waters. The [[Nabataeans|Nabatean]]s and others discovered the value of the globs of natural [[asphalt]] that constantly floated to the surface where they could be harvested with nets. The Egyptians were steady customers, as they used asphalt in the [[embalming]] process that created [[mummy|mummies]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] knew the Dead Sea as &quot;''Palus Asphaltites''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordnik.com/words/Asphaltites |title=Asphaltites examples from ancient sources |publisher=Wordnik.com |accessdate=2013-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Asphalt Lake).

[[File:Madaba BW 9 THERMA KALLIROIS highlighted.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A cargo boat on the Dead Sea as seen on the [[Madaba Map]], from the 6th century AD]]
The Dead Sea was an important trade route with ships carrying salt, asphalt and agricultural produce. Multiple anchorages existed on both sides of the sea, including in [[Ein Gedi]], [[Khirbet Mazin]] (where the ruins of a [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]]-era dry dock are located), [[Numeira]] and near [[Masada]].&lt;ref name = anchorages&gt;{{cite journal |last1=  Hadas|first1= Gideon|date= April 2011|title= Dead Sea Anchorages|journal= Revue Biblique |volume= 118 |issue= 2|pages= 161–179|jstor= 44092052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imj.org.il/en/exhibitions/special-find-sailing-dead-sea Sailing the Dead Sea], [[Israel Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Herod the Great]] built or rebuilt several fortresses and palaces on the western bank of the Dead Sea. The most famous was [[Masada]], where in 70 CE a small group of Jewish [[Zealotry|zealots]] fled after the fall of the destruction of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Second Temple]]. The zealots survived until 73 CE, when a siege by the [[Roman legion|X Legion]] ended in the deaths by suicide of its 960 inhabitants. Another historically important fortress was [[Machaerus]] (מכוור), on the eastern bank, where, according to Josephus, [[John the Baptist]] was imprisoned by [[Herod Antipas]] and died.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+18.119 18.119]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=BabbaQ |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in Roman times, some [[Essenes]] settled on the Dead Sea's western shore; [[Pliny the Elder]] identifies their location with the words, &quot;on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast ... [above] the town of Engeda&quot; (''Natural History'', Bk 5.73); and it is therefore a hugely popular but contested hypothesis today, that same Essenes are identical with the settlers at [[Qumran]] and that &quot;the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]&quot; discovered during the 20th century in the nearby caves had been their own library.

[[Josephus]] identified the Dead Sea in geographic proximity to the ancient Biblical city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. However, he referred to the lake by its Greek name, Asphaltites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-1.htm|author=Josephus|title=Antiquities of the Jews|volume=1 |chapter=9|title-link=Antiquities of the Jews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various sects of Jews settled in caves overlooking the Dead Sea. The best known of these are the [[Essenes]] of [[Qumran]], who left an extensive library known as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].&lt;ref&gt;Found today in the [[Shrine of the Book]] at the Israel Museum of Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Ein Gedi]], mentioned many times in the [[Mishna]], produced [[persimmon]] for the temple's fragrance and for export, using a secret recipe. &quot;Sodomite salt&quot; was an essential mineral for the temple's holy incense, but was said to be dangerous for home use and could cause blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/weekly-talmud/2009-02-12.php |title=Sodomite salt could cause blindness |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815040437/http://www.pardes.org.il/online_learning/weekly-talmud/2009-02-12.php |archivedate=2009-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman camps surrounding [[Masada]] were built by Jewish slaves receiving water from the towns around the lake. These towns had drinking water from the [[Ein Feshcha]] springs and other sweetwater springs in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;A synagogue mosaic floor (circa 100 BCE) at Ein Gedi repeats the Mishna, portraying a curse on whoever reveals the town's secret persimmon recipe. Papyrus parchments found in caves near the Dead Sea document the vast amount of cultivated land in the area, especially persimmon trees, but also olive and date trees&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine period===
Intimately connected with the Judean wilderness to its northwest and west, the Dead Sea was a place of escape and refuge. The remoteness of the region attracted [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] [[monk]]s since the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era. Their [[monastery|monasteries]], such as [[Saint George]] in Wadi Kelt and [[Mar Saba]] in the [[Judaean Desert]], are places of [[pilgrimage]].

===Modern times===

In the 19th century the River Jordan and the Dead Sea were explored by boat primarily by [[Christopher Costigan]] in 1835, Thomas Howard Molyneux in 1847, [[William Francis Lynch]] in 1848, and [[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadseaguide.com/dead_sea_history|title=History of the Dead Sea - Discover the Dead Sea with Us! |date=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of W.

After the find of the &quot;[[Mesha Stele|Moabite Stone]]&quot; in 1868 on the plateau east of the Dead Sea, [[Moses Wilhelm Shapira]] and his partner Salim al-Khouri forged and sold a whole range of presumed &quot;Moabite&quot; antiquities, and in 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the &quot;Shapira Strips&quot;, a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the Dead Sea. The strips were declared to be forgeries and Shapira took his own life in disgrace.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, hundreds of religious documents dated between 150 BCE and 70 CE were found in caves near the ancient settlement of [[Qumran]], about {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea (presently in the West Bank). They became known and famous as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].

The world's lowest roads, [[Highway 90 (Israel)|Highway 90]], run along the Israeli and West Bank shores of the Dead Sea, along with Highway 65 on the [[Jordan]]ian side, at {{convert|393|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level.

==Tourism and leisure==
[[File:Ein Bokek - Dead Sea2.jpg|thumb|[[Ein Bokek]], a resort on the Israeli shore]]

===British Mandate period===
A [[golf course]] named for [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] was built by the British at [[Kalya|Kalia]] on the northern shore.

===Israel===
The first major Israeli hotels were built in nearby [[Arad, Israel|Arad]], and since the 1960s at the [[Ein Bokek]] resort complex.

Israel has 15 hotels along the Dead Sea shore, generating total revenues of $291 million in 2012. Most Israeli hotels and resorts on the Dead Sea are on a {{convert|6|km|mi|spell=in|adj=mid|abbr=off}} stretch of the southern shore.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt;

===Jordan===
[[File:Kempinski Hotel Ishtar - Dead Sea - Jordan.jpg|thumb|Kempinski Hotel, one of the many hotels on the [[Jordan]]ian shore]]
On the Jordanian side, nine international franchises have opened [[seaside resort]] hotels near the [[King Hussein Bin Talal Convention Center]], along with resort apartments, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 hotels have boosted the Jordanian side's capacity to 2,800 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jordantimes.com/news/local/dead-sea-aqaba-hotels-packed-during-eid-al-fitr-holiday|title=Dead Sea, Aqaba hotels packed during Eid Al Fitr holiday|accessdate=12 July 2016|date=10 July 2016|work=The Jordan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22, 2015, the Dead Sea panorama road was included along with [[Google Street View in Jordan|40 archaeological locations]] in Jordan, to become live on [[Google Street View]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/streetview/#jordan-highlights|title=Google Street View}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Bank===
The Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off}} long. The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea tourism industry could generate $290 million of revenues per year and 2,900 jobs.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt; However, Palestinians have been unable to obtain construction permits for tourism-related investments on the Dead Sea.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt; According to the World Bank, Officials in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities state that the only way to apply for such permits is through the Joint Committees established under the Oslo Agreement, but the relevant committee has not met with any degree of regularity since 2000.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt;

===British Mandate period===
In the early part of the 20th century, the Dead Sea began to attract interest from chemists who deduced the sea was a natural deposit of [[potash]] (potassium chloride) and [[bromine]]. The Palestine Potash Company was chartered in 1929, after its founder, Siberian Jewish engineer and pioneer of [[Lake Baikal]] exploitation, [[Moshe Novomeysky|Moses Novomeysky]], worked for the charter for over ten years having first visited the area in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norris2013&quot;/&gt; The first plant, on the north shore of the Dead Sea at [[Kalya]], commenced production in 1931&lt;ref name=&quot;Norris2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacob Norris|title=Land of Progress: Palestine in the Age of Colonial Development, 1905-1948|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hV9zeYpzCawC&amp;pg=PA159|date=11 April 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966936-3|pages=159–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and produced potash by solar evaporation of the brine. Employing Arabs and Jews, it was an island of peace in turbulent times.&lt;ref name = &quot;PM Nov 1930&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine| title = Wealth From The Dead Sea |magazine= Popular Mechanics | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages =794–798 | publisher = Hearst Magazines | location = Chicago | date = November 1930| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uOQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA794}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company quickly grew into the largest industrial site in the Middle East,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and in 1934 built a second plant on the southwest shore, in the [[Mount Sodom]] area, south of the [[Lisan Peninsula|'Lashon' region]] of the Dead Sea. Palestine Potash Company supplied half of Britain's potash during [[World War II]]. Both plants were destroyed by the Jordanians in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=1o_pCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 |title= Saline Lakes V: Proceedings of the Vth International Symposium on Inland Saline Lakes, held in Bolivia, 22–29 March 1991 |first= Stuart H. |last= Hurlbert |date= 6 December 2012 |publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media |via= Google Books |isbn= 9789401120760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
The [[Dead Sea Works]] was founded in 1952 as a state-owned enterprise based on the remnants of the Palestine Potash Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/who-really-owns-the-dead-sea.premium-1.515340|title=Who Really Owns the Dead Sea?|first=Asher|last=Schechter|date=14 April 2013|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the company was privatized and it is now owned by [[Israel Chemicals]]. From the Dead Sea brine, Israel produces (2001) 1.77 million [[ton]]s potash, 206,000 tons elemental bromine, 44,900 tons [[sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]], 25,000 tons [[magnesium]] metal, and sodium chloride. Israeli companies generate around US$3 billion annually from the sale of Dead Sea minerals (primarily potash and bromine), and from other products that are derived from Dead Sea Minerals.&lt;ref name=WorldBank&gt;World Bank, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management Department, [http://hlrn.org/img/violation/Area+C+Report+Oct-13.pdf Area C and the Future of the Palestinian Economy], October 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordan===
On the Jordanian side of the Dead Sea, [[Arab Potash]] (APC), formed in 1956, produces 2.0 million tons of potash annually, as well as sodium chloride and bromine. The plant is located at Safi, South Aghwar Department, in the [[Karak Governorate]].

Jordanian Dead Sea mineral industries generate about $1.2 billion in sales (equivalent to 4 percent of Jordan's GDP).

===West Bank===
The Palestinian Dead Sea Coast is about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=off}} long. The Palestinian economy is unable to benefit from Dead Sea chemicals due to restricted access, permit issues and the uncertainties of the investment climate.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt; The World Bank estimates that a Palestinian Dead Sea chemicals industry could generate $918M incremental value added per year, &quot;almost equivalent to the contribution of the entire manufacturing sector of Palestinian territories today&quot;.&lt;ref name=WorldBank/&gt;

===Extraction===
Both companies, Dead Sea Works Ltd. and Arab Potash, use extensive salt [[pan evaporation|evaporation pan]]s that have essentially diked the entire southern end of the Dead Sea for the purpose of producing [[carnallite]], potassium magnesium chloride, which is then processed further to produce potassium chloride. The [[Salt evaporation pond|ponds]] are separated by a central dike that runs roughly north-south along the international border. The [[power station|power plant]] on the Israeli side allows production of magnesium metal (by a subsidiary, Dead Sea Magnesium Ltd.).

Due to the popularity of the sea's therapeutic and healing properties, several companies have also shown interest in the manufacturing and supplying of Dead Sea salts as raw materials for body and skin care products.

==Recession and environmental concerns==
[[File:Dead Sea Coastal Erosion March 2012.JPG|thumb|right|Gully in unconsolidated Dead Sea sediments exposed by recession of water levels. It was excavated by floods from the [[Judean Mountains]] in less than a year.]]

Since 1930, when its surface was {{convert|1050|km2|abbr=on}} and its level was {{convert|390|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level, the Dead Sea has been monitored continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/water2.html#Dead|title=Overview of Middle East Water Resources_Dead Sea|date=December 1998|accessdate=31 May 2014|encyclopedia=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades,{{which|date=May 2019}} the Dead Sea has been rapidly shrinking because of diversion of incoming water from the Jordan River to the north. The southern end is fed by a canal maintained by the Dead Sea Works, a company that converts the sea's raw materials. From a water surface of {{convert|395|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. Klein |author2=A. Flohn|title=Contribution to the Knowledge in the Fluctuations of the Dead Sea Level|publisher=Theoretical and Applied Climatology|volume=38|pages=151–156, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; it fell {{convert|22|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|418|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level in 2006, reaching a drop rate of {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} per year. As the water level decreases, the characteristics of the Sea and surrounding region may substantially change.

{{anchor|sinkholes}}
The Dead Sea level drop has been followed by a [[groundwater]] level drop, causing brines that used to occupy underground layers near the shoreline to be flushed out by freshwater. This is believed to be the cause of the recent appearance of large [[sinkhole]]s along the western shore—incoming freshwater dissolves salt layers, rapidly creating subsurface cavities that subsequently collapse to form these sinkholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Abelson|author2=Y. Yechieli |author3=O. Crouvi |author4=G. Baer |author5=D. Wachs |author6=A. Bein |author7=V.

In May 2009 at the [[World Economic Forum]], Jordan announced its plans to construct the &quot;[[Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance|Jordan National Red Sea Development Project]]&quot; (JRSP). This is a plan to convey seawater from the [[Red Sea]] near Aqaba to the Dead Sea. Water would be desalinated along the route to provide fresh water to Jordan, with the brine discharge sent to the Dead Sea for replenishment. Israel has expressed its support and will likely benefit from some of the water delivery to its [[Negev]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jordan, Israel agree $900 million Red Sea-Dead Sea project |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-economy-water/jordan-israel-agree-900-million-red-sea-dead-sea-project-idUSKBN0LU23Z20150226 |accessdate=11 December 2018 |work=Reuters |date=26 February 2015 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JRSP&gt;Jordan Red Sea Project: {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324005936/http://www.jrsp-jordan.com/imgs/JRSP%20Project%20Description.pdf |date=2012-03-24 }} Original: [http://www.jrsp-jordan.com/imgs/JRSP%20Project%20Description.pdf Jordan Red Sea Project Description], retrieved on May 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

At a regional conference in July 2009, officials expressed concern about the declining water levels. Some suggested industrial activities around the Dead Sea might need to be reduced. Others advised environmental measures to restore conditions such as increasing the volume of flow from the Jordan River to replenish the Dead Sea. Currently, only sewage and effluent from fish ponds run in the river's channel. Experts also stressed the need for strict conservation efforts. They said agriculture should not be expanded, sustainable support capabilities should be incorporated into the area and pollution sources should be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Features/Back-from-the-Dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027040042/http://www.jpost.com/Features/Back-from-the-Dead |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 27, 2013 |title=Back from the Dead? |author=Ehud Zion Waldoks |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=July 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the Jordanians announced accelerated plans to extract around {{convert|300|e6m3|e9cuft|0|abbr=off}} of water per year from the Red Sea, desalinate it for use as fresh water and send the waste water to the Dead Sea by tunnel, despite concerns about inadequate time to assess the potential environmental impact. According to Jordan's minister for water, General Maysoun Zu'bi, this project could be considered as the first phase of the [[Red Sea–Dead Sea Water Conveyance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/6285055/Jordan-to-refill-shrinking-Dead-Sea-with-salt-water.html|title=Jordan to refill shrinking Dead Sea|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=10 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Israel, Jordan and the [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] signed an agreement for laying a water pipeline to link the Red Sea with the Dead Sea. The pipeline will be {{convert|180|km|abbr=on}} long and is estimated to take up to five years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/09/dead-sea-pipeline-water-red-sea|date=2013-12-09|title=Dead Sea neighbours agree to pipeline to pump water from Red Sea|first=Harriet|last=Sherwood|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015 it was reported that the level of water is now dropping by {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/news/international/middle_east/story.php?id=58290|title=Dead Sea Dying: Levels of salt water are dropping by three feet annually|author=Catholic Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November 2016, it was announced that the Jordanian government is shortlisting five consortiums to implement the project. Jordan's ministry of Water and Irrigation said that the $100 million first phase of the project will begin construction in the first quarter of 2018, and will be completed by 2021.&lt;ref name=&quot;JT&quot;/&gt;
