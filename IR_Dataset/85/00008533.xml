'''Depeche Mode''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˌ|p|ɛ|ʃ|-|,_|d|iː|–|,_|d|ɪ|–}}) are&lt;!-- This article is written in British English, in which band names take the plural verb form; do not change &quot;are&quot; to &quot;is&quot;. See WP:ENGVAR. --&gt; an English [[electronic music]] band formed in [[Basildon]], Essex in 1980. The group as of now consists of a trio of [[Dave Gahan]] (lead vocals and co-songwriting), [[Martin Gore]] (keyboards, guitar, co-lead vocals and main songwriting), and [[Andy Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]] (keyboards).

Depeche Mode released their debut album ''[[Speak &amp; Spell (album)|Speak &amp; Spell]]'' in 1981, bringing the band onto the British [[new wave music|new wave]] scene. Founding member [[Vince Clarke]] left after the release of the album; they recorded ''[[A Broken Frame]]'' as a trio. Gore took over as main songwriter and, later in 1982, [[Alan Wilder]] replaced Clarke, establishing a lineup that continued for 13 years.

The band's last albums of the 1980s, ''[[Black Celebration]]'' and ''[[Music for the Masses]]'', established them as a dominant force within the electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's June 1988 concert at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Pasadena Rose Bowl]], where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In early 1990, they released ''[[Violator (album)|Violator]]'', an international mainstream success. The following album, ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]],'' released in 1993, was also a success, though internal struggles within the band during recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995.

Depeche Mode has had 54 songs in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and 17 top 10 albums in the UK chart; they have sold more than 100 million records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.musikindustrie.de/presse_aktuell_einzel/back/82/page/3/news/depeche-mode-mit-weltpremiere-beim-echo/ |title= Depeche Mode mit Weltpremiere beim ECHO |publisher= [[Bundesverband Musikindustrie]] |date= 3 February 2009 |accessdate= 18 August 2014 |language= de |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140819082648/http://www.musikindustrie.de/presse_aktuell_einzel/back/82/page/3/news/depeche-mode-mit-weltpremiere-beim-echo/ |archivedate= 19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Kerri |last= Mason |title= Depeche Mode Prepares For Tour Of The Universe |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/269153/depeche-mode-prepares-for-tour-of-the-universe |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 23 March 2009 |accessdate= 5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' included the band in the list of the &quot;50 Bands That Changed the World!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;50Bands&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Q – 50 Bands That Changed The World! |magazine= Q |issue= 214 |date= May 2004 |publisher= Rocklist.net |accessdate= 31 March 2012 |url= http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlistspage3.htm#50%20Bands%20That%20Changed%20The%20World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depeche Mode also ranks number 98 on [[VH1]]'s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= brandon |title= VH1 100 Greatest Artists Of All Time |date= 13 April 2011 |publisher= [[Stereogum]] |url= http://www.stereogum.com/495331/vh1-100-greatest-artists-of-all-time/franchises/list/attachment/depeche-mode/ |accessdate= 26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named Depeche Mode the 10th most successful dance club artist of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1 |magazine= Billboard |accessdate= 29 September 2017 |url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2017 and 2018, and will be inducted as part of the Class of 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;Class&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title= Class of 2020|publisher= [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] |url= https://www.rockhall.com/class-2020-inductees |accessdate= 15 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation and debut album (1977–1981)===
Depeche Mode's origins date to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher formed a [[The Cure|Cure]]-influenced{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=14}} band called No Romance In China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass guitar. Fletcher would later recall, &quot;Why am I in the band? It was accidental right from the beginning. I was actually forced to be in the band. I played the guitar and I had a bass; it was a question of them roping me in.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;P93&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Marc |last= Weidenbaum |title= Fashion Victims |magazine= Pulse! magazine |issue= 114 |date= May 1993 |pages= 48–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Clarke played guitar in an &quot;[[Ultravox]] rip-off band&quot;, The Plan, with friends [[Robert Marlow]] and Paul Langwith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.erasureinfo.com/features/interviews_03.html |title= Interviews – &quot;Robert Marlow Interview (1999)&quot; |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121023130210/http://www.erasureinfo.com/features/interviews_03.html |archivedate= 23 October 2012}}. Erasureinfo.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978–79, [[Martin Gore]] played guitar in an acoustic duo, Norman and the Worms, with school friend Phil Burdett on vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://philburdett.com/fr_biography.cfm |title= Phil Burdett – Biography |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715074414/http://philburdett.com/fr_biography.cfm |archivedate= 15 July 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Marlow, Gore and friend Paul Redmond formed a band called the French Look, with Marlow on vocals/keyboards, Gore on guitar and Redmond on keyboards. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass.

Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke heard [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]] band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD), whose output inspired him to make electronic music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Erasure |series= [[The O-Zone]] |network= [[BBC Two]] |station= [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |airdate= 29 November 1995 |minutes= 8 |quote= When I was 18 or 19 I heard a single called 'Electricity' by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. It sounded so different from anything I'd heard; that really made me want to make electronic music, 'cause it was so unique.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=41|ps=: What motivated me to actually buy a synthesiser was, again, probably Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's 'Almost'... not that I don't like Gary Numan; don't get me wrong, I was blown away by him on ''Top of the Pops'' – but OMD sounded more home-made, and I suddenly thought, 'I can do that!' There was this sudden connection.}} Along with OMD, other early influences included [[the Human League]], [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] and [[Fad Gadget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Synth Britannia (Part Two: Construction Time Again) |series= [[List of Britannia documentaries|Britannia]] |network= [[BBC Four]] |station= [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |airdate= 16 October 2009 |minutes= 4 |quote= When I first started playing synthesizers it [my inspiration] would have been people like the Human League; Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, their very first album; I was a big fan of Daniel Miller's work, as the Silicon Teens and as the Normal; and also of Fad Gadget, who was on Mute Records.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke and Fletcher switched to synthesisers, working odd jobs in order to buy the instruments, or borrowing them from friends. [[Dave Gahan]] joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local [[Scout hall|Scout hut]] [[jam session]], singing a rendition of [[David Bowie]]'s [[&quot;Heroes&quot; (David Bowie song)|&quot;Heroes&quot;]],&lt;ref name=&quot;D93&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|first= William |last= Shaw |title= In The Mode |magazine= [[Details (magazine)|Details]] |date= April 1993 |pages= 90–95, 168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Depeche Mode was born. Gahan's and Gore's favourite artists included [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/lkn051281/page1.htm |title= Collect-a-Page (Dave Gahan's questionnaire) |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081127211058/http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/lkn051281/page1.htm |archivedate= 27 November 2008}}.

When explaining the choice for the new name, taken from French fashion magazine ''Dépêche mode'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Excelsior Publications suspend Dépêche mode |magazine= Stratégies |date= 8 November 2001 |accessdate= 1 May 2017 |url= http://www.strategies.fr/actualites/medias/r67272W/excelsior-suspend-la-parution-de-depeche-mode.html |language= fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gore said, &quot;It means hurried fashion or fashion dispatch.

Gore recalled that the first time the band played as Depeche Mode was a school gig in May 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quietus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first= John |last= Doran |title= Depeche Mode Interviewed: Universal Truths And Sounds |work= [[The Quietus]] |date= 20 April 2009 |accessdate= 5 November 2014 |url= http://thequietus.com/articles/01503-depeche-mode-interviewed-sounds-of-the-universe-martin-gore-dave-gahan-mute}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a plaque commemorating the gig at the [[James Hornsby School]] in Basildon, where Gore and Fletcher were pupils. The band made their recording debut in 1980 on the ''[[Some Bizzare Album]]'' with the song &quot;Photographic&quot;, later re-recorded for their debut album ''[[Speak &amp; Spell (album)|Speak &amp; Spell]]''.

The band made a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] but, instead of mailing the tape to record companies, they would go in and personally deliver it. They would demand the companies play it; according to Dave Gahan, &quot;most of them would tell us to fuck off. They'd say 'leave the tape with us' and we'd say 'it's our only one'. Then we'd say goodbye and go somewhere else.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Jeff |last= Giles |title= This band wants your respect – Depeche Mode may sell millions of albums and play to capacity crowds in huge football stadiums but these techno-pop idols still aren't happy |url= http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/websites/index2.php?username=depechemodefile&amp;page=20 |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |publisher= TipTopWebsite.com |date= 26 July 1990 |pages= 84–87 |accessdate= 5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gahan, prior to securing their record contract, they were receiving offers from all the major labels. [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]] offered them &quot;money you could never have imagined and all sorts of crazy things like clothes allowances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles&quot;/&gt;

While playing a live gig at the Bridge House in [[Canning Town]],&lt;ref&gt;Tickell, Paul (January 1982). {{cite web|url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/fac010182/fac010182main.htm |title=A Year In The Life of Depeche Mode |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110808174432/http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/fac010182/fac010182main.htm |archivedate= 8 August 2011}}. ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]''. Sacred DM.&lt;/ref&gt; the band was approached by Daniel Miller, an [[electronic music]]ian and founder of [[Mute Records]], who was interested in their recording a single for his burgeoning label.&lt;ref&gt;Paige, Betty (31 January 1981). {{cite web|url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/sou310181/sou310181maina.htm |title= This Year's Mode(L) |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724052454/http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/sou310181/sou310181maina.htm |archivedate= 24 July 2011}}. ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''. Sacred DM.&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this verbal contract was their first single, &quot;[[Dreaming of Me]]&quot;, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981. It reached number 57 in the UK charts. Encouraged by this, the band recorded their second single, &quot;[[New Life (song)|New Life]]&quot;, which climbed to number 11 in the UK charts and got them an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The band went to London by train, carrying their synthesisers all the way to the [[BBC]] studios.

The band's next single was &quot;[[Just Can't Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]&quot;. The [[synth-pop]] single became the band's first UK top ten hit. The video is the only one of the band's videos to feature Vince Clarke. Depeche Mode's debut album, ''Speak &amp; Spell'', was released in October 1981 and peaked at number ten on the UK album charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC&quot;/&gt; Critical reviews were mixed; ''[[Melody Maker]]'' described it as a &quot;great album … one they had to make to conquer fresh audiences and please the fans who just can't get enough&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Colbert, Paul (31 October 1981). {{cite web|url= http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/mel311081/mel311081main.htm |title= Talking Hook Lines |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724052535/http://www.sacreddm.net/1980s/mel311081/mel311081main.htm |archivedate= 24 July 2011}}. ''[[Melody Maker]]''. Sacred DM.&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' was more critical, calling the album &quot;[[Rated PG|PG-rated]] fluff&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= David |last= Fricke |authorlink= David Fricke |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/speak-spell-19820513 |title= Speak &amp; Spell – Depeche Mode |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= 13 May 1982 |accessdate= 4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clarke departs and Wilder joins (1981–1982)===
Clarke began to voice his discomfort at the direction the band was taking, saying &quot;there was never enough time to do anything. Not with all the interviews and photo sessions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Mark (February 1982). {{cite web|url= http://www.tuug.utu.fi/~jaakko/dm/smash4.txt |title= A Clean Break |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140204023346/http://www.tuug.utu.fi/~jaakko/dm/smash4.txt |archivedate= 4 February 2014}}. ''[[Smash Hits]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke also said he was sick of touring, which Gahan said years later was &quot;bullshit to be quite honest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles&quot;/&gt; Gahan went on to say he &quot;suddenly lost interest in it and he started getting letters from fans asking what kind of socks he wore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles&quot;/&gt; In November 1981, Clarke publicly announced that he was leaving Depeche Mode.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=103}}

Soon afterwards, Clarke joined up with blues singer [[Alison Moyet]] to form [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]] (or Yaz in the United States). Initial talk of Clarke's continuing to write material for Depeche Mode ultimately amounted to nothing. According to third-party sources, Clarke offered the remaining members of Depeche Mode the track &quot;[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]&quot;, but they declined.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=107}} Clarke, however, denied in an interview that such an offer ever took place saying, &quot;I don't know where that came from. That's not true.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first= Stefan |last= Reinke |first2= Kerstin |last2= Goh |url= https://www.derwesten.de/kultur/musik/erasure-im-soundcheck-id6079325.html?doply=true |title= Erasure im Soundcheck |language= de |newspaper= [[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]] |date= 16 November 2011 |accessdate= 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song went on to become a UK Top 3 hit for Yazoo. Gore, who had written &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Big Muff&quot; for ''Speak &amp; Spell'', became the band's main lyricist.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=125}}

In late 1981, the band placed an anonymous ad in ''Melody Maker'' looking for another musician: &quot;Name band, synthesise, must be under twenty-one.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;D93&quot;/&gt; [[Alan Wilder]], a classically trained keyboardist from West London, responded and, after two auditions and despite being 22 years old, was hired in early 1982, initially on a trial basis as a touring member.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=121}} Wilder would later be called the &quot;Musical Director&quot; of the band, responsible for the band's sound until his departure in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;P93&quot;/&gt; As producer [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] would say, &quot;[Alan] is sort of the craftsman, Martin's the idea man and [Dave] is the attitude.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;P93&quot;/&gt;

In January 1982, the band released &quot;[[See You (Depeche Mode song)|See You]]&quot;, their first single without Clarke, which managed to beat all three Clarke-penned singles in the UK charts, reaching number six.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=113}} The following tour saw the band playing their first shows in North America. Two more singles, &quot;[[The Meaning of Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Leave in Silence]]&quot;, were released ahead of the band's second studio album, on which they began work in July 1982. Daniel Miller informed Wilder that he was not needed for the recording of the album, as the core trio wanted to prove they could succeed without Vince Clarke.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=134}} ''[[A Broken Frame]]'' was released that September, and the following month the band began [[Broken Frame Tour|their 1982 tour]]. A non-album single, &quot;[[Get the Balance Right!]]&quot;, was released in January 1983, the first Depeche Mode track to be recorded with Wilder.{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=58}}

===''Construction Time Again'' (1983)===
For their third album, ''[[Construction Time Again]]'', Depeche Mode worked with producer [[Gareth Jones (music producer)|Gareth Jones]], at [[John Foxx]]'s Garden Studios and at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studios]] in West Berlin (where much of [[David Bowie]]'s [[Berlin Trilogy|trilogy]] of seminal electronic albums featuring [[Brian Eno]] had been produced). The album saw a dramatic shift in the group's sound, due in part to Wilder's introduction of the [[Synclavier]] and [[E-mu Emulator]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Singles 81–85 |url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8185/spring2_99.htm |publisher= Recoil.co.uk |accessdate= 14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By sampling the noises of everyday objects, the band created an eclectic, [[Industrial music|industrial]]-influenced sound, with similarities to groups such as the [[Art of Noise]] and [[Einstürzende Neubauten]] (the latter becoming Mute labelmates in 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Benne (3 May 2005). {{cite web|url= http://www.muna.de/Single.853.0.html?&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=84&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=854&amp;cHash=c5c23fb615 |title= Inga Humpe – Mit Depeche Mode in einer 2raumwohnung |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091029130845/http://www.muna.de/Single.853.0.html?&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=84&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=854&amp;cHash=c5c23fb615 |archivedate= 29 October 2009}} (in German). MUNA.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Everything Counts&quot; rose to number six in the UK, also reaching the top 30 in Ireland, South Africa, Switzerland, Sweden and West Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;OCC&quot;/&gt; Wilder contributed two songs to the album, &quot;The Landscape Is Changing&quot; and &quot;Two Minute Warning&quot;. In September 1983, to promote ''Construction Time Again'', the band launched [[Construction Time Again Tour|a European concert tour]].

===''Some Great Reward'' and growing international success (1984–1985)===
In their early years, Depeche Mode had only really attained success in Europe and Australia.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This changed in March 1984, when they released the single &quot;[[People Are People]]&quot;. The song became a hit, reaching No. 2 in Ireland and Poland, No. 4 in the UK and Switzerland, and No. 1 in West Germany — the first time a DM single topped a country's singles chart — where it was used as the theme to West German TV's coverage of the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]].{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=82}} Beyond this European success, the song also reached No. 13 on the US charts in mid-1985, the first appearance of a DM single on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and was a Top 20 hit in Canada. &quot;People Are People&quot; became an anthem for the LGBT community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= B. |last= Voss |title= Masters of 'The Universe' |magazine= [[David Atlanta]] |date= 6 May 2009 |accessdate= 10 January 2012 |url= http://www.davidatlanta.com/2009/5-6/cover/coverstory/2686.cfm |archivedate= 9 June 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090609225243/http://www.davidatlanta.com/2009/5-6/cover/coverstory/2686.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; regularly played at gay establishments and [[gay pride]] festivals in the late 1980s.

On the American tour, the band was, according to Gore, &quot;shocked by the way the fans were turning up in droves at the concerts&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles&quot;/&gt; He said that although the concerts were selling well, Depeche Mode struggled to sell records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles&quot;/&gt;

''Melody Maker''. Sacred DM.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the political and environmental subjects addressed on the previous album, the songs on ''Some Great Reward'' were mostly concerned with more personal themes such as sexual politics (&quot;[[Master and Servant]]&quot;), adulterous relationships (&quot;Lie to Me&quot;), and arbitrary divine justice (&quot;[[Blasphemous Rumours / Somebody|Blasphemous Rumours]]&quot;). Also included was the first Martin Gore ballad, &quot;Somebody&quot; — such songs would become a feature of all following albums.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} &quot;Somebody&quot; was released as a double A-side with &quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot;, and was the first single with Gore on lead vocal. ''Some Great Reward'' became the first Depeche Mode album to enter the US album charts, and made the Top 10 in several European countries.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

''[[The World We Live In and Live in Hamburg]]'' was the band's first video release, almost an entire concert from their 1984 [[Some Great Reward Tour]]. In July 1985, the band played their first-ever concerts behind the [[Iron Curtain]], in [[Budapest]] and [[Warsaw]].{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=95}} In October 1985, Mute released a compilation, ''[[The Singles 81→85]]'' (''[[Catching Up with Depeche Mode]]'' in the US), which included the two non-album hit singles &quot;[[Shake the Disease]]&quot; and &quot;[[It's Called a Heart]]&quot; along with their B-sides.

In the United States, the band's music first gained prominence on college radio and [[modern rock]] stations such as [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] in Los Angeles, [[KQAK]] (&quot;The Quake&quot;) in San Francisco, [[WFNX]] in Boston and [[WLIR]] on [[Long Island|Long Island, New York]], and hence they appealed primarily to an [[Alternative rock|alternative]] audience who were disenfranchised with the predominance of &quot;soft rock and 'disco hell'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/afiles/hist/athree.htm |title= Alan Wilder's history – Historical evidence Part 1 |publisher= Shunt |accessdate= 19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the radio.

''[[Record Mirror]]''. Sacred DM.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, France, and other European countries, Depeche Mode were considered teen idols and regularly featured in European teen magazines, becoming one of the most famous synth-pop bands in the mid-'80s.

===''Black Celebration'' (1986)===
Depeche Mode's musical style shifted slightly again in 1986 with the release of their fifteenth single, &quot;[[Stripped (song)|Stripped]]&quot;, and its accompanying album ''[[Black Celebration]]''. Retaining their often imaginative sampling and beginning to move away from the &quot;industrial pop&quot; sound that had characterised their previous two LPs, the band introduced an ominous, highly atmospheric and textured sound. Gore's lyrics also took on a darker tone and became even more pessimistic.

The music video for &quot;[[A Question of Time]]&quot; was the first to be directed by [[Anton Corbijn]], beginning a working relationship that continues to the present day. Corbijn has directed 20 of the band's videos (the latest being 2017's &quot;Where's the Revolution.&quot;) He has also filmed some of their live performances and designed stage sets, as well as most covers for albums and singles from ''Violator'' and onwards.

===''Music for the Masses'' and ''101'' (1987–1988)===
1987's ''[[Music for the Masses]]'' saw further alterations in the band's sound and working methods. For the first time a producer not related to Mute Records, Dave Bascombe, was called to assist with the recording sessions, although, according to Alan Wilder, Bascombe's role ended up being more that of engineer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shunt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8698/mftm1.htm |title= Music for the Masses – Depeche Mode |publisher= Shunt |accessdate= 16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the album, the band largely eschewed [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] in favour of [[synthesizer]] experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oldsite.recoil.co.uk/report/edit/dm8698/mftm2.htm |title= Music for the Masses – Depeche Mode |publisher= Shunt |accessdate= 16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While chart performance of the singles &quot;[[Strangelove (song)|Strangelove]]&quot;, &quot;[[Never Let Me Down Again]]&quot; and &quot;[[Behind the Wheel]]&quot; proved to be disappointing in the UK, they performed well in countries such as Canada, Brazil, West Germany, South Africa, Sweden and Switzerland, often reaching the top 10.

===''Violator'' and worldwide fame (1989–1991)===
In mid-1989, the band began recording in [[Milan]] with producer Flood and engineer [[François Kevorkian]]. The initial result of this session was the single &quot;[[Personal Jesus]].&quot; Prior to its release, a marketing campaign was launched with advertisements placed in the [[Personal advertisement|personals columns]] of UK regional newspapers with the words &quot;Your own personal Jesus.&quot; Later, the ads included a phone number one could dial to hear the song. The resulting furor helped propel the single to number 13 on the UK charts, becoming one of their biggest sellers to date; in the United States, it was their first gold single and their first Top 40 hit since &quot;People Are People&quot;, eventually becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch single in [[Warner Bros.

To promote ''Playing the Angel'', the band launched [[Touring the Angel]], a concert tour of Europe and North America that began in November 2005 and ran for nine months. During the last two legs of the tour Depeche Mode headlined a number of festivals including the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] and the [[Wireless Festival|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Wireless Festival]].

==Charity work==
Early in their career, Depeche Mode was dismissive of benefit concerts such as [[Live Aid]]. Martin himself stated, &quot;If these bands really care so much, they should just donate the money and let that be it. Why can't they do it without all the surrounding hype?&quot;.{{sfn|Malins|2001|p=95}} But in recent years, the band has applied their celebrity and cultural longevity to help promote and raise funds for several notable charity endeavors. They lent their support to high-profile charities such as [[MusiCares]], [[Cancer Research UK]] and the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]]. The band has also supported the Small Steps Project, a humanitarian organization based in the United Kingdom, aiming to assist economically disadvantaged children into education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Depeche Mode: Charity Work, Events and Causes |website= Look to the Stars |accessdate= 25 March 2017 |url= https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/depeche-mode}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, Depeche Mode have partnered with Swiss watchmaker [[Hublot]] to support Charity: Water, aimed at the provision of clean drinking water in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Joelle |last= Diderich |title= Hublot and Depeche Mode Link Up to Benefit Charity: Water |website= WWD |date= 30 January 2014 |accessdate= 25 March 2017 |url= http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/hublot-and-depeche-mode-link-up-to-benefit-charity-water-7402778/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such collaboration led to the release of two different limited edition watches, the Hublot Big Bang Depeche Mode in 2017 and The Singles Limited Edition series based from the Big Bang model in 2018. The proceeds helped raised $1.7 million for Charity:Water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Laurie |last= Kahle |title= Hublot and Depeche Mode Expand Fundraising for Clean Water with Collector Watches |work= [[Barron's (newspaper)|Barron's]] |date= 7 June 2018 |accessdate= 22 February 2020 |url= https://www.barrons.com/articles/hublot-and-depeche-mode-expand-fundraising-for-charity-water-with-collector-watches-1528404224}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the partnership hosted a gala and fundraiser at the [[TsUM (Moscow)|TsUM]] building in Moscow, raising $1.4 million for the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Depeche Mode and Hublot Raise 1.4 Million Dollars for Charity: Water |work= Geneva Seal |date= 5 August 2014 |accessdate= 25 March 2017 |url= http://www.genevaseal.com/journal/2014/8/5/depeche-mode-and-hublot-raise-14-million-dollars-for-charity-water}}&lt;/ref&gt;
