'''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[3D Realms]]. It is a sequel to the [[platform game]]s ''[[Duke Nukem (video game)|Duke Nukem]]'' and ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', published by 3D Realms.

''Duke Nukem 3D'' features the adventures of the titular [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]], voiced by [[Jon St. John]], who fights against an [[alien invasion]] on Earth. Along with ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''Duke Nukem 3D'' is considered to be responsible for popularizing first-person shooters, and was released to major acclaim. Reviewers praised the interactivity of the environments, gameplay, level design, and unique risqu√© humor, a mix of pop-culture satire and lampooning of over-the-top Hollywood action heroes. The game's violent nature, [[eroticism|erotic elements]], and [[Gender representation in video games|portrayal of women]] incited controversy.

The shareware version of the game was originally released on January 29, 1996, while the full version was released on April 19, 1996 as version 1.3d. The ''Plutonium PAK'', an expansion pack which updated the game to version 1.4 and added a fourth eleven-level episode, was released in November 1996. The ''Atomic Edition'', a standalone version of the game that included the content from the ''Plutonium PAK'' and updated the game to version 1.5, was later released; the original version of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' has since been discontinued. An official fifth episode was released on October 11, 2016 with ''20th Anniversary World Tour'' published by [[Gearbox Software]]. After [[Development of Duke Nukem Forever|fifteen years]] in [[development hell]], a direct sequel was released in 2011 called ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Duke3d 000.png|thumb|left|''Duke Nukem 3D'' gameplay at the beginning of the first level (&quot;Hollywood Holocaust&quot;)]]
As a [[first-person shooter]] whose gameplay is similar to ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', the gameplay of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' involves moving through levels presented from the protagonist's point of view, shooting enemies on the way. The environments in ''Duke Nukem 3D'' are highly destructible and interactive; most props can be destroyed by the player.&lt;ref name=&quot;history1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespotr&quot;/&gt;

Levels were designed in a fairly non-linear manner such that players can advantageously use [[air duct]]s, back doors, and sewers to avoid enemies or find hidden caches. These locations are also filled with objects with which the player can interact, that either benefit the player in some form, light switches make it easier to see, while [[water fountain]]s and broken [[hydrant]]s provide some health points or simply diversion, and tipping [[strippers]] provokes a quote from Duke, and a provocative reveal from the dancer.

Duke's arsenal consists of the &quot;Mighty Foot&quot; (a basic kick attack), a [[pistol]], a [[shotgun]], a triple-barrelled [[chain gun]], a [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rocket-propelled grenade launcher]], [[pipe bomb]]s, freeze and [[shrink ray]]s, laser [[land mines]], and the rapid fire &quot;Devastator&quot; rocket launcher. There is also an extra weapon known as the &quot;Expander&quot;, the opposite of the shrink ray weapon, which is only available in the ''Atomic Edition'' version of the game.

Various items can be picked up during gameplay. The portable [[First-aid kit|medkit]] allows players to heal Duke at will. [[Steroid]]s speed up Duke's movement, as well as instantly reversing the effects of the shrink ray weapon and increasing the strength of Duke's Mighty Foot for a short period. [[Night vision]] goggles allow players to see enemies in the dark. The &quot;HoloDuke&quot; device projects a [[hologram]] of Duke which can be used to distract enemies. Protective boots allow Duke to cross dangerously hot or toxic terrain. In sections where progress requires more aquatic legwork, an [[aqua-lung]] allows Duke to take longer trips underwater. Duke's [[jet pack]] allows the player to move vertically and gain access to otherwise inaccessible areas.

The game features a wide variety of enemies; some of which are [[extraterrestrial life in culture|aliens]] and other [[mutant (fictional)|mutated]] humans. The [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] have been turned into &quot;Pig Cops&quot;, a [[play on words|play]] on the derogatory term &quot;pig&quot; for police officers, with '''LARD''' emblazoned on their uniforms. As is usual for a first-person shooter, Duke Nukem encounters a large number of lesser foes, as well as [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]], usually at the end of episodes. Like Duke, these enemies have access to a wide range of weapons and equipment, and some weaker enemies have jet packs.

=== Multiplayer ===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' features multiplayer. At the time of its release, Internet-based gaming was just beginning. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' did not support the [[TCP/IP]] client/server model, instead based its network play on the [[IPX]] [[LAN]], modem or serial cable. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' players often either battled modem-to-modem, using the IPX network utility [[Kali (software)|Kali]]&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-Kali&quot;/&gt; or the [[Total Entertainment Network]] (TEN) online pay service.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-TenNet&quot;/&gt; Kali allowed users to connect to a chat room to host and join games. ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was one of the more popular games on TEN prior to the closure of the network in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;TEntertainment&quot;/&gt; The game was also supported by [[DWANGO]].&lt;ref name=UGO/&gt;

''Duke Nukem 3D''{{'s}} levels were often used as the battlegrounds for these encounters, and users were even able to create their own [[level (video gaming)|levels]], or maps, using the [[Build engine|level editor]] bundled with the game, which was also used by the developers to design the initial levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;dukemaps&quot;/&gt; The game also features co-operative play which allows players to complete the story-based mode together. In ''Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition'', a new gameplay mode was introduced: Duke-Tag, a &quot;[[capture the flag]]&quot; style mode.

''Duke Nukem 3D'' has been ported to run on modern Microsoft Windows variants including Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 8. This has been made possible since the game's [[source code]] was publicly released in 2003. Various [[source port]]s have been made including ''EDuke32'', ''JFDuke3D'', ''nDuke'', ''hDuke'', and ''xDuke''. All five offer the original visual appearance of the game, while ''EDuke32'' also supports [[OpenGL]] rendering including the capability to use fan-created modern graphics using the High Resolution Pack.&lt;ref name=&quot;hrp&quot;/&gt; ''nDuke'', ''hDuke'' and ''xDuke'' can still be played online in multiplayer 'DukeMatch' format using launchers such as Duke Matcher and YANG, both freely available. ''EDuke32''{{'s}} multiplayer is in a state of [[development hell]] following an attempt to rewrite the network functionality using a [[client‚Äìserver model]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' is set on Earth &quot;sometime in the early 21st century&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;3drealms&quot;/&gt; The levels of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' take players outdoors and indoors through rendered street scenes, military bases, [[desert]]s, a flooded city, [[space station]]s, moon bases, and a [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] restaurant.

The game contains several humorous references to pop culture. Some of Duke's lines are drawn from movies such as ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', ''[[Evil Dead II]]'', ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;stuff gaming greats&quot;/&gt; ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', and ''[[They Live]]'';&lt;ref name=&quot;stuff gaming greats&quot;/&gt; the captured women saying &quot;Kill me&quot; is a reference to ''Aliens''. Players will encounter corpses of famous characters such as [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Indiana Jones]], [[Snake Plissken]], [[Doomguy|the protagonist]] of ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', and a smashed [[Terminator (character)|T-800]]. In the first episode, players navigate a tunnel in the wall of a prison cell hidden behind a poster, just like in ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]''. During the second episode, players can see [[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|The Monolith]] (from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') on the moon. In the bathroom of the first level, [[867-5309]] is written on a wall.

The game cover itself is a parody of ''[[Army of Darkness]]'', with Duke posing as [[Ash Williams]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

=== Story ===
There is little narrative in the game, only a brief text prelude located under &quot;Help&quot; in the Main Menu, and a few [[cutscene]]s after the completion of an episode. The game picks up right after the events of ''[[Duke Nukem II]]'', with Duke returning to Earth in his space cruiser. As Duke descends on [[Los Angeles]] in hopes of taking a vacation, his ship is shot down by unknown hostiles. While sending a distress signal, Duke learns that aliens are attacking Los Angeles and have mutated the [[LAPD]]. With his vacation plans now ruined, Duke hits the &quot;eject&quot; button, and vows to do whatever it takes to stop the alien invasion.

In &quot;Episode One: ''L.A. Meltdown''&quot;, Duke fights his way through a [[dystopia]]n Los Angeles. At a [[strip club]], he is captured by pig-cops, but escapes the alien-controlled penitentiary and tracks down the alien cruiser responsible for the invasion in the [[San Andreas Fault]]. Duke discovers that the aliens were capturing women, and detonates the ship. Levels in this episode include a movie theater, a Red Light District, a prison, and a nuclear-waste disposal facility.

In &quot;Episode Two: ''Lunar Apocalypse''&quot;, Duke journeys to [[outer space|space]], where he finds many of the captured women held in various [[incubator (neonatal)|incubator]]s throughout space stations that had been conquered by the aliens. Duke reaches the alien mothership on the Moon and kills an alien Overlord. As Duke inspects the ship's computer, it is revealed that the plot to capture women was merely a ruse to distract him. The aliens have already begun their attack on Earth.

In &quot;Episode Three: ''Shrapnel City''&quot;, Duke battles the massive alien presence through Los Angeles once again, and kills the leader of the alien menace: the Cycloid Emperor. The game ends as Duke promises that after some &quot;[[R&amp;R (military)|R&amp;R]]&quot;, he will be &quot;...ready for more action!&quot;, as an anonymous woman calls him back to bed. Levels in this episode include a sushi bar, a movie set, a subway, and a hotel.

The story continues in the ''Atomic Edition''. In &quot;Episode Four: ''The Birth''&quot;, it is revealed that the aliens used a captured woman to give birth to the Alien Queen, a creature which can quickly spawn deadly alien protector drones. Duke is dispatched back to Los Angeles to fight hordes of aliens, including the protector drones. Eventually, Duke finds the lair of the Alien Queen, and kills her, thus thwarting the alien plot. Levels in this episode include a fast-food restaurant (&quot;Duke Burger&quot;), a supermarket, a Disneyland parody called &quot;Babe Land,&quot; a police station, the [[Exxon Valdez]], and [[Area 51]].

With the release of ''20th Anniversary World Tour'', the story progresses further. In &quot;Episode Five: ''Alien World Order''&quot;, Duke finds out that the aliens initiated a world-scale invasion, so he sets out to repel their attack on various countries. Duke proceeds to clear out aliens from [[Amsterdam]], [[Moscow]], [[London]], [[San Francisco]], [[Paris]], the [[Giza pyramid complex]], and [[Rome]], with the final showdown with the returning alien threat taking place in Los Angeles, taking the game full circle. There, he defeats the Cycloid Incinerator, the current alien leader, stopping their threat for good.

== Development ==
''Duke Nukem 3D'' was developed on a budget of roughly $300,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton99&quot;/&gt; The development team consisted of eight people for most of the development cycle, increasing to 12 or 13 people near the end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton99&quot;/&gt; At one point, the game was being programmed to allow the player to switch between first person view, third person view, and fixed camera angles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nextgen-3DRealms&quot;/&gt; [[Scott Miller (entrepreneur)|Scott Miller]] of 3D Realms recalled that &quot;with ''Duke 3D'', unlike every shooter that came before, we wanted to have sort of real life locations like a cinema theatre, you know, strip club, bookstores...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton99&quot;/&gt;

''LameDuke'' is a [[beta version]] of ''Duke Nukem 3D'', which was released by 3D Realms as a &quot;bonus&quot; one year after the release of the official version. It has been released as is, with no support.&lt;ref name=&quot;LameDuke&quot;/&gt; ''LameDuke'' features four episodes: ''Mr. Caliber'', ''Mission Cockroach'', ''Suck Hole'', and ''Hard Landing''. Certain weapons were altered from the original versions and/or removed.

[[Lee Jackson (composer)|Lee Jackson]]'s theme song &quot;Grabbag&quot; has elicited many covers and remixes over the years by both fans and professional musicians, including an officially sanctioned studio version by [[thrash metal]] band [[Megadeth]]. Another version of the song was recorded by [[Chris Kline]] in August 2005. [[3D Realms]] featured it on the front page of their website and contracted with Kline to use it to promote their [[Xbox Live]] release of ''Duke Nukem 3D''.&lt;ref name=&quot;YT_vertexguy_dukeXBL&quot;/&gt;

The original official website was created by [[Jeffrey D. Erb]] and Mark Farish of Intersphere Communications Ltd.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-IntComm&quot;/&gt;

== Release ==
=== PC versions ===
* '''''Shareware Version''''': The shareware version was the early version released on January 29, 1996 and contained the original first episode, but does not include the other two episodes, this version originally intended to be a demonstration of the game on the old shareware distribution model, so 3D Realms only officially allowed this version to be shared between multiple users.
* '''''Full Version''''': The full version was the first official version released on April 19, 1996 and contained the original three episodes. It also includes the full versions of ''Duke Nukem'' and ''Duke Nukem II'' as bonus content.
* '''''Plutonium PAK/Atomic Edition''''': The ''Atomic Edition'' of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was released in November 1996 as a standalone game. It contained the original three episodes, as well as a new eleven-level fourth episode, bringing the level total to 41 as opposed to 30 in the original ''Duke Nukem 3D''. The ''Plutonium PAK'' was released as an upgrade package to convert the original release of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' (v1.3d) to the ''Atomic Edition'' (v1.4, later updated to v1.5 with the standalone ''Atomic Edition'' release and via a free download patch for the ''Plutonium PAK'' version on 3D Realms' website). It introduced two new enemies, the Protector Drone and the Pig Cop Tank, a new final boss, the Alien Queen, and a new weapon, the Expander. Changes to the script made the game easier to [[mod (video gaming)|mod]], and players could set up a multiplayer session against CPU [[artificial intelligence (video games)|bots]]. This is the only official add-on for the game developed by 3D Realms. Unlike the original release of ''Duke Nukem 3D'', however, the ''Atomic Edition'' does not include ''Duke Nukem'' and ''Duke Nukem II''.
* '''''Macintosh Version''''': The Macintosh release came in June 6, 1997 in Minneapolis, being shipped by MacSoft.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDuke&quot;/&gt;

* '''''Duke: The Apocalypse 2''''' contains ''Duke!ZONE'', ''Duke It Out In D.C.'', a strategy guide, and a T-shirt.
* '''''Kill-A-Ton Collection''''': The ''Kill-A-Ton Collection'' was released in 1998 and includes: ''Duke Nukem I'' (''Duke Nukum''), ''Duke Nukem II'', ''Duke Nukem 3D'' (both v1.3d and v1.5), ''Duke It Out In D.C.'', ''Duke!ZONE II'', ''Duke Xtreme'', and various editing utilities.
* '''''GOG Version''''': The Atomic Edition was released on [[GOG.com]] along with Duke Nukem 1, 2 and Manhattan Project in 2009. The entire catalog was removed from the website on December 31, 2015 due to a licensing agreement with [[Gearbox Software]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-GOG&quot;/&gt;
*[[File:Duke Nukem 3D gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|''Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition''. Note the higher-resolution HUD and [[OpenGL]] graphics.]]'''''Megaton Edition''''': Developed by General Arcade and published by [[Devolver Digital]], it was released through [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on March 20, 2013. The ''Megaton Edition'' includes ''Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition'', ''Duke It Out In D.C.'', ''Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach'', and ''Duke: Nuclear Winter'' all running on OpenGL, as well as the original MS-DOS version of ''Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition''. It supports SteamPlay for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, and is based on the code of the ''JFDuke3D'' source port by Jonathon Fowler. Online multiplayer was added to the game in January 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;ShackNews&quot;/&gt; However, about a year later, the Megaton Edition was removed from all digital distribution as Devolver Digital's agreement with Gearbox Software has ended now that the latter company currently owns the [[intellectual property]]. In 2016, Gearbox informed TechRaptor that they have plans to &quot;bring the game back this year,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TechRaptor&quot;/&gt; and that game became the 20th Anniversary World Tour.
* '''''Kill-a-Ton 2015 Collection''''': Released in May 2015 on [[Steam (software)|Steam]], includes everything that Kill-a-Ton Collection contained (with exception of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' v1.3D and ''Duke Xtreme''), plus two other expansions, ''Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach'', and ''Duke: Nuclear Winter'', as well as ''[[Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project]]'' and the ''[[Balls of Steel (video game)|Balls of Steel]]'' game. Like with the [[GOG.com]] release and Megaton Edition, it was removed from Steam at the end of 2015.
* '''''20th Anniversary World Tour''''': Developed by [[Nerve Software]] and Gearbox Software and published by Gearbox Publishing. It was announced by Gearbox Software on September 2, 2016 at PAX East, and it's a re-release for the [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]], and PC via Steam. World Tour includes an all-new 5th episode by the original episode designers, new music by composer [[Lee Jackson (composer)|Lee Jackson]], re-recorded voice lines by [[Jon St. John]], new enemies and new lighting effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-Gearbox&quot;/&gt; However, it does not contain the expansions from ''Kill-A-Ton Collection'' and ''Megaton Edition''. World Tour was released on October 11, 2016.

=== Expansion packs ===
* '''''Nuke It''''. This is an expansion pack developed by [[Micro Star]] in 1996, consisting of 300 custom made levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;NukeIt&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rowe |first=Garrett |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/nuke-it-1.92980 |title=Nuke It |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=October 5, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was made with the Build Editor, Micro Star was charged by [[Micro Star v. FormGen Inc.|FormGen and 3D Realms of copyright infringement]] for unauthorized sales of the pack. Ultimately Micro Star lost their case.&lt;ref name=&quot;NukeItCase&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/IP/1998%20Micro%20Star%20Abridged.pdf |title=Micro Star v. FormGen Inc. |author=Kozinski |date=September 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Duke It Out In D.C.''''': This is an authorized add-on developed by [[Sunstorm Interactive]] and published by [[WizardWorks]]; it was released in March 1997. President [[Bill Clinton]] is captured by alien forces, and Duke must save him. This expansion pack featured 10 new levels that were based on real-world locations, such as: the [[White House]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] headquarters, the [[Smithsonian]] museum, the [[Washington Monument]], and other areas in Washington, D.C. The add-on was also included as part of an official compilation called ''Duke Nukem: Kill-A-Ton Collection'' through business deals with 3D Realms. Charlie Wiederhold created levels for this add-on.
* '''''Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach''''': This is an authorized add-on developed by Sunstorm Interactive and published by WizardWorks; it was released in January 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;DukeExpsRel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1998-01-05.html|title=Now Shipping|author=Staff|date=January 5, 1998|website=[[PC Gamer]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980218070330/http://www.pcgamer.com/news/news-1998-01-05.html|archive-date=February 18, 1998|url-status=dead|access-date=December 6, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke is relaxing on a tropical island when he discovers that the aliens are having their own &quot;vacation&quot;. This add-on includes a sunny Caribbean theme with 12 new levels that take place on beaches and vacation hotels. Charlie Wiederhold created several levels for this add-on. Wiederhold was later hired by 3D Realms to work on the sequel ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''.
* '''''Duke: Nuclear Winter''''': This is an authorized add-on developed by Simply Silly Software and published by WizardWorks; it was released in January 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;DukeExpsRel&quot;/&gt; [[Santa Claus]] is being mind-controlled by aliens into causing trouble on Earth. Several of the levels take place in [[Alaska]] and the [[North Pole]].
* '''''Duke!ZONE''''': An authorized add-on released in 1996, published by WizardWorks, which includes 500 fan-made levels and various editing utilities.
* '''''Duke!ZONE II''''': An authorized follow-up add-on to ''Duke!ZONE'', published by WizardWorks and released in 1997. ''Duke!ZONE II'' contains three new episodes, each containing seven levels, created by Simply Silly Software and the same 500 fan-made levels from the original ''Duke!ZONE''.
* '''''Duke Xtreme''''': An authorized add-on released in 1997 and developed by Sunstorm Interactive, containing 50 levels and various editing utilities.
* '''''Duke Assault''''': An add-on released in 1997 containing over 1,500 levels for ''Duke Nukem 3D''. It was published by WizardWorks and created by fans in the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' modding community.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-Assault&quot;/&gt;
* '''''Duke Nukem's Penthouse Paradise''''': This is an official add-on for ''Duke Nukem 3D'', created by [[Jeffrey D.

Duke has to fight his way through a hotel, clubs, and, finally, the Penthouse offices. The level features music from the industrial rock band [[Needle (band)|Needle]].
* '''''Duke - It's Zero Hour''''': An add-on developed by ZeroHour Software and released in November 1997. It was originally slated to be a retail product via WizardWorks, but the developers ended up releasing it for free. It has 11 new levels that feature 12 all-new monsters, five new weapons, music, and sound effects.

=== Console versions and add-ons ===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' was ported to many consoles of the time. All of the ports featured some sort of new content.

* '''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Game.com]]) was released in 1997 in the USA only. Unlike every other version of the game, Duke Nukem cannot turn; he can only move forward, backward, and strafe to the left or right. Due to the Game.com's monochrome screen, it is also the only version to lack color. It only includes four levels from each of the original three episodes for a total of 12 levels. These levels were modified to accommodate Duke Nukem's inability to turn.
* '''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Sega Saturn]]) was ported by [[Lobotomy Software]] and published by [[Sega]] in 1997. It retains the original name and uses Lobotomy Software's own fully 3D ''SlaveDriver'' engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlaveDriver&quot;/&gt; This version uses the [[Sega NetLink]] for online gaming, and has built-in support for the Saturn's analog pad. It also includes a hidden multiplayer mini-game called ''[[Death Tank Zwei]]'', and an exclusive bonus level called Urea 51, accessed through the level &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;. It was the final game branded by Sega of America under the Deep Water label, employed for games featuring adult content such as ''[[Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side]]''.
* '''''Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown''''' (titled simply ''Duke Nukem'' in Europe), the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] port released in 1997, contains all three original episodes, plus an exclusive fourth episode, ''Plug 'n' Pray'', which includes six new levels and a secret level. The secret level was also included in the PC version of ''Duke Nukem 3D''. The new episode features several new enemies, including three new types of Pig Cops, and a new final boss, the CyberKeef. This version also features remixed music, some rearranged from the PC version, and some original, in streaming XA-Audio made by [[Mark Knight (musician)|Mark Knight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PSX-DN3D&quot;/&gt; It includes support for analog pads and the [[PlayStation Link Cable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=100 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=November 1997|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Duke Nukem 64''''' is a port released in 1997 for the [[Nintendo 64]] which features a [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] 4-player mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=E3 Unleashed! |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=106 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=July 1997 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[Eurocom]].&lt;ref name=GPro109&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Dan Elektro |title=Duke Nukem 64|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=109 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=October 1997|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In-game music was removed due to [[Nintendo 64 Game Pak|limited storage capacity]], many items were renamed to avoid drug and sex references, and new lines of dialogue were recorded specifically for this version to remove profanity. Several levels were altered to include areas from the ''Atomic Edition'', such as a Duke Burger outlet in the second level which was not in the original PC version. Levels are played sequentially instead of as separate episodes. Other changes include the addition of [[Rumble Pak]] support,&lt;ref name=GPro109/&gt; four new weapons, dual sub-machine guns, a grenade launcher, a missile launcher, and the Plasma Cannon, alternative ammo types for the pistol, shotgun, and missile launcher, and a fully 3D model for the Cycloid Emperor boss. The Protector Drone, an enemy from the ''Atomic Edition'', also appears a few times in the standard levels. Originally, the weapons and end bosses were going to be polygonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n64.com/news/547.html |title=The president of 3D Realms speaks about future titles and N64 ports |author=Staff |date= |website=N64.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970605220539/http://www.n64.com/news/547.html |archive-date=June 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]]) was released in 1998 by [[Tec Toy]]. The visuals were drastically simplified, being closer to early shooters like ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''. It consisted solely of ''Lunar Apocalypse'', the second from the original game's three episodes, which was heavily modified to suit the game engine. This version was released in [[South America]] only.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-SegaGen&quot;/&gt; In 2015, Piko Interactive acquired the rights to the port from Tec Toy and released it worldwide in cartridge form on October 16, 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-MegDrive&quot;/&gt;
* '''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[Xbox 360]]) was released on September 24, 2008. This version features: the ability to &quot;rewind&quot; the game to any prior point upon dying, save clips of gameplay, and play cooperatively online, as well as the standard &quot;Dukematch&quot; online multiplayer mode. The music received a slight quality upgrade with modern [[MIDI]] tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-XBOX360&quot;/&gt;
* '''''Duke Nukem 3D''''' ([[iPhone]]/[[iPod Touch]]) was released on August 11, 2009, and ported by MachineWorks Northwest.

== Source ports ==
{{Anchor|Source code}}
Following the release of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] in 1997, gamers wanted a similar source code release from 3D Realms. The last major game to make use of the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source code was TNT Team's ''[[World War II GI]]'' in 1999. Its programmer, Matthew Saettler, obtained permission from 3D Realms to expand the gameplay enhancements done on ''WWII GI'' to ''Duke Nukem 3D''.

''EDuke'' was a semi-official branch of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' that was released as a patch as ''Duke Nukem 3D'' v2.0 for ''Atomic Edition'' users on July 28, 2000. It included a demo mod made by several beta testers.&lt;ref name=&quot;EDuke&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EDuke-Patch&quot;/&gt; It focused primarily on enhancing the CON scripting language in ways which allowed those modifying the game to do much more with the system than originally possible. Though a further version was planned, it never made it out of beta. It was eventually cancelled due to programmer time constraints. About a month after the release of the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source code, ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]'' project manager Matt Saettler released the source code for both ''EDuke'' v2.0 and EDuke v2.1, the test version of which would have eventually become the next ''EDuke'' release, under the GPL.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The [[source code]] to the ''Duke Nukem 3D'' v1.5 executable, which uses the Build engine, was released as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] on April 1, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;SourceCode&quot;/&gt; The game content remains under a proprietary license. The game was quickly ported by enthusiasts to modern operating systems.

The first ''Duke Nukem 3D'' port was from icculus.org. It is a cross-platform project that allows the game to be played on [[AmigaOS]], [[AmigaOS 4]], [[AROS]], [[BeOS]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[MorphOS]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] rather than MS-DOS. The icculus.org codebase would later be used as the base for several other ports, including ''Duke3d_32''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-32&quot;/&gt;

Another popular early project was Jonathon Fowler's ''JFDuke3D'', which, in December 2003, received backing from the original author of Build, programmer [[Ken Silverman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jfduke3d&quot;/&gt; Fowler, in cooperation with Silverman, released a new version of ''JFDuke3D'' using [[Build engine#Polymost|Polymost]], an [[OpenGL]]-enhanced renderer for Build which allows hardware acceleration and 3D model support along with 32-bit color high resolution textures. Another project based on ''JFDuke3D'' called ''xDuke'', unrelated to the ''xDuke'' project based on ''Duke3d_w32'', runs on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Silverman has since helped Fowler with a large portion of other engine work, including updating the network code, and helping to maintain various other aspects of the engine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Development appears to have stopped; as of January 2015, there have been no new versions since October 9, 2005.

While a few short-lived [[DOS]]-based ''EDuke'' projects emerged, it was not until the release of ''EDuke32'', an extended version of ''Duke3D'' incorporating variants of both Fowler's [[Microsoft Windows]] ''JFDuke3D'' code, and Saettler's ''EDuke code'', by one of 3D Realms' forum moderators in late 2004, that ''EDuke's'' scripting extensions received community focus.&lt;ref name=&quot;eduke32&quot;/&gt; Among the various enhancements, support for advanced [[shader model]] 3.0 based graphics was added to ''EDuke32'' during late 2008-early 2009. In June 2008, thanks to significant porting contributions from the [[DOSBox]] team, ''EDuke32'' became the only ''Duke Nukem 3D'' source port to compile and run natively on [[64-bit]] Linux systems without the use of a 32-bit compatibility environment.

On April 1, 2009, an [[OpenGL]] Shader Model 3.0 renderer was revealed to have been developed for ''EDuke32'', named ''Polymer'' to distinguish from Ken Silverman's ''Polymost''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} It allows for much more modern effects such as dynamic lighting and [[normal mapping]]. Although Polymer is fully functional, it is technically incomplete and unoptimized, and is still in development. As of the fifth installment of the ''High Resolution Pack'', released in 2011, the Polymer renderer is mandatory. In 2011, another significant development of ''EDuke32'' was the introduction of true room over room (TROR), where sectors can be placed over other sectors, and can be seen at the same time. In practice, this allows for true three-dimensional level design that was previously impossible, although the base engine is still 2D.

On December 18, 2012, ''Chocolate Duke3D''&lt;ref name=&quot;ChocolateDuke3D&quot;/&gt; port was released. Inspired by ''[[Chocolate Doom]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;chocolateDoom&quot;/&gt; the primary goal was to refactor the code so developers would easily read and learn from it.

In February 2013, a source [[code review]] article was published that described the internal working of the code.&lt;ref name=&quot;CodeReview&quot;/&gt;

All versions of the game have earned a positive aggregate score on [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]].

Daniel Jevons of ''Maximum'' gave it five out of five stars, calling it &quot;absolutely perfect in every respect.&quot; He particularly cited the game's speed and fluidity even on low-end PCs, imaginative weapons, varied and identifiable environments, true 3D level designs, and strong multiplayer mode.&lt;ref name=Max7/&gt; A ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic summarized: &quot;''Duke Nukem 3D'' has everything ''Doom'' doesn't, but it also doesn't leave out the stuff that made ''Doom'' a classic.&quot; He praised the imaginative weapons, long and complex single-player campaign, competitive multiplayer, built-in level editor, and parental lock.&lt;ref name=NG20/&gt; Reviewers paid a lot of attention to the sexual content within the game. Reception of this element varied: Tim Soete of [[GameSpot]] felt that it was &quot;morally questionable&quot;,&lt;ref name=gamespotr/&gt; while the [[Game Revolution]] reviewer noted that it was &quot;done in a tongue-in-cheek manner,&quot; and he was &quot;not personally offended&quot;.&lt;ref name=GRevReview/&gt; GamingOnLinux reviewer Hamish Paul Wilson commented in a later retrospective how the game's &quot;dark dystopian atmosphere filled with pornography and consumerist decadence&quot; in his view helped to ground &quot;the game's more outlandish and obscene moments in context&quot;, concluding that &quot;in a world as perverse as this, someone like Duke becoming its hero seems almost inevitable.&quot;&lt;ref name=GamingOnLinux/&gt;

''Next Generation'' reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, and stated that &quot;Though it took a year, the Mac port of ''Duke Nukem 3D'' is an impressive feat, both for the game's own features, and the quality of the port.&quot;&lt;ref name=NG33&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Finals |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=33 |publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]] |date=September 1997 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saturn version also received generally positive reviews, with critics particularly praising the use of real-world settings for the levels&lt;ref name=EGM101/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSM24/&gt;&lt;ref name=GPro111/&gt; and Duke's numerous one-liners.&lt;ref name=EGM101/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSM24/&gt; Reviewers were also generally impressed with how accurately it replicates the PC version.&lt;ref name=EGM101/&gt;&lt;ref name=SSM24/&gt;&lt;ref name=GPro111/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that &quot;All the gore, vulgarity, go-go dancers, and ultra-intense 3D combat action that made Duke Nukem [3D] excel on the PC are firmly intact in the Saturn version, making it one of the premier corridor shooters on the system.&quot;&lt;ref name=GPro111&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Special K |title=Saturn ProReview: Duke Nukem 3D|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=111 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=December 1997|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some complained at the limitations of this version's multiplayer. Dan Hsu of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' said it was unfortunate that it supports only two players instead of four,&lt;ref name=EGM101/&gt; while ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' editor Rich Leadbetter complained at the multiplayer being only supported through the [[Sega NetLink]] and not the Saturn link cable, since the NetLink was not being released in Europe, effectively making the Saturn version single-player only to Europeans.&lt;ref name=SSM24/&gt;

''Next Generation'' reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game ''Duke Nukem 64'', and stated that &quot;The sound effects and music are solid, the levels are still interactive as heck, and it's never quite felt so good blasting enemies with a shotgun or blowing them to chunks with pipe bombs.&quot;&lt;ref name=NG37&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Finals |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=37 |publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]] |date=January 1998 |page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Duke Nukem 3D'' was a finalist for [[CNET Gamecenter]]'s 1996 &quot;Best Action Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamecenter1996&quot;/&gt; In 1996, ''Next Generation'' ranked it as the 35th top game of all time, called &quot;for many, the game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' should have been.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NG21&quot;/&gt; In 1996 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' named ''Duke Nukem 3D'' #37 overall among the best games of all time&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199611best&quot;/&gt; and #13 among the &quot;best ways to die in computer gaming&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cgw199611bestwaystodie&quot;/&gt; It won a 1996 [[Spotlight Awards|Spotlight Award]] for Best Action Game.&lt;ref name=NGen31/&gt; In 1998, ''[[PC Gamer]]'' declared it the 29th-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;a gaming icon&quot; and &quot;an absolute blast&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgtop50&quot;/&gt;

''[[PC Gamer]]'' magazine's readers' voted it #13 on its all-time top games poll.&lt;ref&gt;April 2000 issue&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of ''PC Game'' ranked it as the 12th top game of all time in 2001 citing the game's humor and pop-culture references,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGame2001&quot;/&gt; and as the 15th best games of all time in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCGame2005&quot;/&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' included it among the most important video games of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-GPro&quot;/&gt; In 2009, [[IGN]]'s Cam Shea ranked it as the ninth top 10 Xbox Live Arcade game, stating that it was as fun as it was in its initial release, and praised the ability to rewind to any point before the player died.&lt;ref name=&quot;XboxLiveArcade&quot;/&gt;

Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' reviewed the PlayStation console port, giving it a 21 out of 40 score.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-Famitsu&quot;/&gt;

=== Controversy ===
''Duke Nukem 3D'' was attacked by some critics, who alleged that it promoted [[pornography]] and murder. Jamia Wilson, then vice president of [[Women's Media Center]], criticized the depictions of women for being &quot;extremely harmful, especially to young women&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaptureBabe&quot;/&gt; In response to the criticism encountered, [[Censorship|censored]] versions of the game were released in certain countries in order to avoid it being banned altogether. A similar censored version was carried at [[Wal-Mart]] retail stores in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walmart-Wired&quot;/&gt;

In Australia, the game was originally refused classification on release.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 3D Realms repackaged the game with the parental lock feature permanently enabled, although a patch available on the 3D Realms website allowed the user to revert the game back into its uncensored U.S. version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uncensored&quot;/&gt; The [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|OFLC]] then attempted to have the game pulled from the shelves, but it was discovered that the distributor had notified them of this fact and the rating could not be surrendered; six months later, the game was reclassified and released uncensored with an MA15+ rating.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In Germany, the [[Bundespr√ºfstelle f√ºr jugendgef√§hrdende Medien|BPjM]] placed the game on their &quot;List B&quot; (&quot;List of Media Harmful to Young People&quot;) of videos games, thus prohibiting its advertisement in the public. However, it was not fully confiscated, meaning that an adult could still request to see the game and buy it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ListB&quot;/&gt; In 1999, ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was banned in Brazil, along with ''Doom'' and several other first-person shooters after a rampage, in and around a movie theater, was supposedly inspired by the first level in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;DN3D-Banned&quot;/&gt;

Despite such concerns from critics, legislators, and publishers, Scott Miller later recounted that 3D Realms saw very little negative feedback to the game's controversial elements from actual gamers or their parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton99&quot;/&gt; He pointed out that ''Duke Nukem 3D'' was appropriately rated &quot;M&quot; and had no real nudity, and speculated that that was enough to make it inoffensive to the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton99&quot;/&gt;
