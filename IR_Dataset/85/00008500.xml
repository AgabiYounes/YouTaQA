'''Dar es Salaam''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɑːr|_|ɛ|s|_|s|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|m}}; from {{lang-ar|دار السلام|Dār as-Salām, meaning: place of peace}}) is the largest city and former capital of [[Tanzania]].

Until 1974, Dar es Salaam served as Tanzania's capital city, at which point the capital city commenced transferring to [[Dodoma]], by order of then-president Julius Nyerere &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/04/tanzanian-city-may-soon-be-one-of-the-worlds-most-populous/|title=This Tanzanian city may soon be one of the world’s most populous. Is it ready?|date=2019-04-05|website=Environment|language=en|access-date=2020-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was officially completed in 1996. However, as of 2018, it remains a focus of central government bureaucracy, although this is in the process of fully moving to Dodoma. It is Tanzania's most prominent city in arts, fashion, media, music, film and television, and is a leading financial centre. The city is the leading arrival and departure point for most tourists who visit Tanzania, including the national parks for safaris and the islands of [[Unguja]] and [[Pemba Island|Pemba]].

It is the capital of the co-extensive Dar es Salaam [[Regions of Tanzania|Region]], which is one of Tanzania's [[Regions of Tanzania|31 administrative regions]] and consists of five [[Districts of Tanzania|districts]]: [[Kinondoni District|Kinondoni]] in the north, [[Ilala District|Ilala]] in the centre, [[Ubungo]] and [[Temeke]] in the south and [[Kigamboni]] in the east across the [[Kurasini]] creek.

==History==
[[File:Dar-es-Salam.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Image of the Port of Dar es Salaam from the book ''Von Unseren Kolonien'' by Ottomar Beta in the year 1908]]

{{see also|Timeline of Dar es Salaam}}
{{further|History of Zanzibar}}

In the 19th century, '''Mzizima''' ([[Swahili language|Swahili]] for &quot;healthy town&quot;) was a coastal fishing [[village]] on the periphery of [[Indian Ocean trade]] routes.&lt;ref name=UNHSP&gt;{{Cite book  |last = United Nations Human Settlements Programme |authorlink = United Nations Human Settlements Programme |title = The State of African Cities 2008 |publisher = UN-HABITAT |year = 2009 |pages =130 |url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UR0fckrquD8C&amp;pg=PA130 |isbn =92-1-132015-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{Cite book |last = Brennan |first = James R.  |last2 = Burton |first2 = Andrew |chapter = The Emerging Metropolis: A history of Dar es Salaam, circa 1862–2000 |title = Dar es Salaam: histories from an emerging African metropolis |publisher = African Books Collective |year = 2007 |pages = 13 |url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-54DSfk0ZMgC&amp;pg=PA13 |isbn = 9987-449-70-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865 or 1866, Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar]] began building a new city very close to Mzizima&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; and named it '''Dar es Salaam'''. The name is commonly translated as &quot;abode/home of peace&quot;, based on the Arabic ''dar'' (&quot;house&quot;), and the Arabic ''es salaam'' (&quot;of peace&quot;).&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887 when the [[German East Africa Company]] established a station there. The [[town]]'s growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of [[German East Africa]] and industrial expansion resulting from the construction of the [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Railway Line]] in the early 1900s.

[[German East Africa]] was captured by the British during [[World War I]] and became [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]] with Dar es Salaam remaining the administrative and commercial centre. Under British [[indirect rule]], separate European (e.g., [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]]) and African (e.g., [[Kariakoo]] and [[Ilala District|Ilala]]) areas developed at a distance from the city centre. The city's population also included a large number of [[Indians in Tanzania|workers from British India]], many of whom [[middleman minority|came to take advantage of the trade and commercial opportunities presented to them]]. After [[World War II]], Dar es Salaam experienced a period of rapid growth.
[[File:Dar es Salaam in 1930s.JPG|320x240px|thumbnail|right|Dar es Salaam during the 1930s, with the [[Old Boma, Dar es Salaam|Old Boma]] and [[St. Joseph's Cathedral, Dar es Salaam|St. Joseph's Cathedral]] prominently in view]]
Political developments, including the formation and growth of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]], led to [[Tanganyika]] attaining independence from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to serve as its capital, even when in 1964 Tanganyika and [[People's Republic of Zanzibar]] merged to form Tanzania. In 1973, however, provisions were made to relocate the capital to Dodoma, a more centrally located city in the interior. The relocation process has not yet been completed, and Dar es Salaam remains Tanzania's primary city.

In 1967, the [[Government of Tanzania|Tanzanian government]] declared the ''[[Ujamaa]] policy'', which set Tanzania into a socialist path. The move slowed down the potential growth of the city as the government encouraged people not to move in cities but stay in Ujamaa socialist villages. However, by the 1980s the Ujamaa policy proved to be a failure in combating increasing poverty and hunger that Tanzania faced, and delayed the development that it needed. This led to the 1980s liberalization policy that virtually ended socialism and its proponents within Tanzania's government.

Until the late 1990s, Dar es Salaam was not put into the same category as Africa's leading cities like [[Nairobi]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Lagos]], or [[Addis Ababa]]. The 2000s became the turning point when the city experienced one of Africa's fastest urbanization rates. Businesses were opened and prospered, growth expanded in the construction sector with new multi-story buildings, bridges and roads,&lt;ref name=&quot;allafrica.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201308060352.html|title=allAfrica.com: Tanzania: Construction Booms As Public, Private Sector Investments Soar|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of banks in Tanzania|Tanzanian banks]] headquartered in the city began to be run with better regulation,{{clarify|date=December 2015}} the [[Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange]] expanded and the [[Port of Dar es Salaam|Dar es Salaam harbour]] continued to be the most important in Tanzania.  The port is prominent for entrepot trade with landlocked countries like eastern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], and [[Zambia]]. The CBD skyline hosts tall buildings, among them the 35-floor PSPF Tower, finished in 2015, and the [[Tanzania Ports Authority]] (TPA) Tower, currently under construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;allafrica.com&quot;/&gt;

==Geography==
Dar es Salaam is located at 6°48'&amp;nbsp;South, 39°17'&amp;nbsp;East (−6.8000, 39.2833),&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html NGA: Country Files] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504031911/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |date=May 4, 2012 }}, NGA.mil&lt;/ref&gt; on a natural harbour on the eastern coast of East Africa, with sandy beaches in some areas.

The region of Dar es Salaam is divided into five [[Dar es Salaam#Districts of Dar es Salaam Region|districts]].

All five are governed as municipal councils, and so all of the city's suburbs or wards are affiliated with them. The regional commissioner is [[Paul Makonda]].

====Kinondoni====
[[File:Msakai, Dar es salaam.jpg|thumb|Msasani Bay View from Masaki]]
[[File:Coco Beach.jpg|thumb|The Coco Beach public beach during the daytime, on the western shores of the [[Indian Ocean]]]]
Kinondoni is the most populated amongst the districts, with half of the city's population residing within it. It is also home to high-income suburbs. These include:

* '''Masaki, [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oysterbay]] and [[Ada Estate]]''' are the high-income suburbs located along the central beach. During the Colonial Era, they were the major European suburbs of the city. Now diplomats and expatriates reside in these areas.  Oysterbay Beach, also known as Coco Beach, is the only white sandy beach east of Kinondoni.
* '''Mikocheni and Regent Estate''' are also suburbs within the district. According to the 2012 census, the Mikocheni ward had a population of 32,947.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012 census&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page 75}}
* '''[[Msasani]]''' is a peninsula to the northeast of the city center. It is home to expatriates from the United Kingdom and other western countries. Msasani contains a mixture of traditional shops and western-oriented resorts and stores.
* '''Mbezi Beach''' is the beachfront suburb located along the northern Dar es Salaam Beach. It contains several tourist hotels, residences and further more a kite surfing area by Upepo Avenue.
* '''Sinza, Kijitonyama, Magomeni, [[Kinondoni]] and [[Mwenge, Dar es Salaam|Mwenge]]''' are more ethnically mixed than the areas above. These are located west of Dar es Salaam's central business district.
* '''Tandale, Mwananyamala-Kisiwani and Kigogo''' are considered{{by whom|date=April 2018}} low-income neighborhoods characterized by poor settlement planning, low quality housing and social services.

====Ilala====
[[File:The Askari Monument in Dar es Salaam.jpg|thumb|The Askari Monument along Samora Avenue marks the exact centre of Dar es Salaam, in the [[Ilala district]].]]
Ilala is the administrative district of Dar es Salaam where almost all government offices and ministries are housed. The Central Business District (locally called &quot;Posta&quot;) is located in this district. It is the transportation hub of the city, as the [[Julius Nyerere International Airport]], Central Railway Station and Tazara Railway Station are all within the district boundaries. The residential areas are mainly middle to high-income, and some of these are:
* '''Upanga and [[Kisutu]]''' had the highest concentration of Asian communities within Dar es Salaam, with residents of Indian and Arabian descent. These areas contain colonial houses and mansions built in [[India]]n, Arabic and European styles. Upanga contains [[Upanga East]] and [[Upanga West]].
* '''[[Kariakoo]]''' is the shopping district of the city. Shops, bazaars and merchants dot the streets, selling products from foodstuffs to hardware materials. The Kariakoo Market, which is the largest, contains the only underground section of the city. It is the major supply point of the food consumed by all the residents of Dar es Salaam.
* '''Tabata, Segerea and Ukonga''' are located a bit farther west from the city center. They are becoming busier in terms of business and entertainment, which has caused serious traffic congestion.
* '''Ilala''' is among the middle-income suburbs very near to the city center, and is marked by the [[Askari Monument]]. It suffers from [[gang]] activity.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

====Temeke====

Temeke is the industrial district of the city, where the manufacturing centers (heavy and light industry) are located. The [[Port of Dar es Salaam]], which is the largest in the country, is found east of Temeke.

Temeke is believed to have the largest concentration of low-income residents due to industry. Port officials, military and police officers live there.
*'''Kurasini''' located on the Dar es Salaam Harbour, is the home of the Dar es Salaam Port, The Police College, Mgulani Police Barracks and the [[Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair]] Grounds. Thus, the main residents are police officers and port officials.
*'''Chang'ombe''' is one of the only higher income areas in Temeke. It has maintained this status due to occupation by African high colonial officers and some industry owners from the colonial era. Chang'ombe is the home of the Dar es Salaam University College of Education, the National Stadium and Uhuru Stadium.
*'''Temeke, Mtoni and Tandika''' are middle to low-income suburbs.
* '''Mbagala and Kijichi''' are middle to low-income suburbs. Mbagala is the largest suburb in the whole district.

====Ubungo====
[[File:Nyerere Bridge - Kigamboni .jpg|thumb|[[Kigamboni Bridge]]]]
The Ubungo terminal serves as a transportation link to most large Dar es Salaam urban nodes.{{clarify|what exactly is an urban node?|date=April 2018}} The [[narrow-gauge]] commuter rail runs from there to the city centre, with ten [[level crossing]]s along the route.

====[[Kigamboni]]====
*'''Kigamboni (South Beach)''', a beachfront suburb on a peninsula, is home to an economically diverse population. Access to the suburb is mainly by ferry, although the [[Kigamboni Bridge]] provides an alternative.

===Climate===
Due to close proximity to the [[equator]] and the warm Indian Ocean, the city experiences tropical climatic conditions, typified by hot and humid weather throughout much of the year. It has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Aw). Annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1100|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and in a normal year there are two rainy seasons: &quot;the long rains&quot; in April and May and &quot;the short rains&quot; in November and December.

===Globalisation===
As any growing city Dar es Salaam is the city in Tanzania to which villagers flock for better opportunities. [[Westerners]] and Asians are also settling in Dar es Salaam, and the movement of foreigners has put a good workload on the relevant government body for developing better policies to accommodate the growing and the diverse population of the Dar es Salaam together with its suburbs.

==Population==
Dar es Salaam is the most populous city in Tanzania. With a population increase of 5.6 percent per year from 2002 to 2012, it is the third-fastest-growing city in Africa, after [[Bamako]] and [[Lagos]], and the ninth-fastest-growing in the world. The [[Metropolitan area|metro population]] is expected to reach 5.12 million by 2020 and predicted to be as high as 76 million by the year 2100, making it the third largest city on earth (after Lagos and Kinshasa), by 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html|title=City Mayors: World's fastest growing urban areas (1)|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoornweg |first1=Daniel |last2=Pope |first2=Kevin |title=Socioeconomic Pathways and Regional Distribution of the World’s 101 Largest Cities |url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/672989_62cfa13ec4ba47788f78ad660489a2fa.pdf |website=media.wix.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2012 national census, the region had a population of 4,364,541, which was much higher than the pre-census projection of 3,270,255.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012 Census&quot;&gt;[http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf Population Distribution by Administrative Units, United Republic of Tanzania, 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230453/http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf |date=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page 2}} For 2002–2012, the region's 5.6 percent average annual population growth rate was the highest in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012 Census&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page 4}} It was also the most densely populated region with 3,133 people per square kilometer.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012 Census&quot;/&gt;{{rp|page 6}}

The sprawling suburbs furthest from the city centre are generally populated by Tanzanians of African descent, with the exception of [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]], where there is a large population of foreign [[expatriates]]. The edges of Dar es Salaam are spreading rapidly, severely taxing the transportation network (which aside from ferries, lacks any kind of mass transit facilities)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Taxi Ride to the Client Office in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania |url=http://drshem.com/2011/05/30/a-taxi-ride-to-the-client-office-in-dar-es-salaam-tanzania/ |work=A Taxi Ride to the Client Office in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raising the prospect of future urban overcrowding.

Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's most important city for both business and government. The city contains high concentrations of trade and other services and manufacturing compared to other parts of Tanzania, which has about 80 percent of its population in rural areas. Downtown includes  small businesses, many of which are run by traders and proprietors whose families originated from the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent—areas of the world with which the settlements of the Tanzanian coast have had long-standing trading relations.

The Dar es Salaam Central Business District is the largest in Tanzania and comprises the [[Kisutu, Dar Es Salaam|Kisutu]], [[Kivukoni]], [[Upanga West|Upanga]] and [[Kariakoo]] areas.  The downtown area is located in the Ilala district. Kivukoni is home to the Tanzania central bank, The [[Bank of Tanzania]], the [[Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange]] and the city's important Magogoni fish market.&lt;ref name=&quot;allafrica.com&quot;/&gt; Kisutu has businesses and offices and is the location of Dar es Salaam central railway station, the PSPF Towers and the TPA tower.

Dar es Salaam has had{{when|date=June 2013}} a major construction boom. The [[PSPF Twin Towers]] with more than 35 stories is the tallest building in the city and the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Dar-s-skyscraper-boom--Watchers-see-signs-of-prosperity-/-/1840392/2412228/-/15fryogz/-/index.html|title=Dar skyscraper boom: Here’s the untold story - National|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dar es Salaam has major infrastructural challenges, including an outdated transport system and occasional power rationing.

===Local public transport ===
The most common form of transport in Dar es Salaam are the public buses, called ''[[dala dala]]'', which are often found at the major bus terminals of [[Makumbusho]] and [[Ubungo]]. Since the introduction of motorcycle transit business known as &quot;Bodaboda&quot;, most of the people prefer this type of transportation,{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} which allows them to get into the city faster compared to the minibuses which face a lot of traffic. Other types of transport include motorcycles and [[auto rickshaw|bajaj]].

===Art===
[[File:Nyumba ya sanaa dar es salaam.jpg|thumb|The main gate of Nyumba ya Sanaa, with decorations by Tanzanian sculptor George Lilanga]]
Dar es Salaam (and specifically the area of Oyster Bay) is home to the brightly coloured and tourist-oriented [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style. The [[Nyumba ya sanaa]] (&quot;House of Art&quot;) is a cultural centre, workshop and shop dedicated to Tanzanian art, showcasing and promoting Tanzanian craftmanship.  Prominent Tanzanian sculptor [[George Lilanga]] has donated  some of his works to the centre, including decorations of the building's main entrance.

===Music===
[[File:The African tranditional dance in Dar es Salaam..jpg|left|thumb|A traditional African dance in Dar es Salaam]]
The music scene in Dar es Salaam is divided between several styles. The longest standing style is live dance music ([[muziki wa dansi]]), played by bands such as [[DDC Mlimani Park Orchestra]] and Malaika Musical Band. [[Taarab]] which was traditionally strong in Zanzibar has also found a niche. However, it remains small compared both to dance music and &quot;[[Tanzanian hip hop|Bongo Flava]]&quot;, a broad category that represents the Tanzanian take on hip hop and R&amp;B, which has quickly become the most popular locally produced music. Traditional music, which locally is used to refer to tribal music is still performed but typically only on family oriented occasions such as weddings.

This [[rap music|rap]] scene is also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.africanhiphop.com/update/halisi.htm |title=Africanhiphop.com presents: Hali Halisi—the Real Situation |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205010455/http://www.africanhiphop.com/update/halisi.htm |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the Ministry of National Youth Culture aimed to create a national culture, which stressed the importance of music.  Dar es Salaam became the music center in Tanzania, with the local radio showcasing new bands and dominating the music and cultural scene. With this ujamaa, or family, mentality governing culture and music a unified people's culture was created, leading to the rise of hip hop music.&lt;ref name=Lemelle/&gt; Throughout the years, the radio in Dar es Salaam has played a major role in the dissemination of music because many people don't have television and cassettes are used over CDs.

===Tourism===

Dar es Salaam has two of the five museums comprising the [[National Museum of Tanzania]] consortium, namely the National Museum proper and the Makumbusho Cultural Centre &amp; Village Museum.  The National Museum is dedicated to the history of Tanzania; most notably, it exhibits some of the bones of ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'' that were among the findings of [[Louis Leakey]] at [[Olduvai Gorge|Olduvai]]. The Makumbusho Cultural Centre &amp; Village Museum,&lt;ref&gt;makumbushovillage.blogspot.de&lt;/ref&gt; located in the outskirts of the city on the road to [[Bagamoyo]], showcases traditional [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s from 16 different Tanzanian ethnic groups.  There are also examples of traditional cultivations, and traditional music and dance shows are held daily. In 2016, there was a breakthrough discovery in Northern Tanzania by a scientist, from the University of Dar es Salaam, of footprints thought to be of a hominid that predates Homo sapiens.

Close to the National Museum are also the [[botanical garden]]s, with tropical plants and trees.

There are beaches on the [[Msasani]] peninsula north of Dar es Salaam and in [[Kigamboni]] to the south. Trips to the nearby islands of the  [[Dar es Salaam Marine Reserve]] are a popular daytrip from the city and a spot for snorkeling, swimming and sunbathing. [[Bongoyo Island]] can be reached by boat from the Msasani Slipway.

==Media==
===Newspapers===
[[File:TTCL Downtown Posta Dar Es Salaam.jpg|thumb|220px|The head office of Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited at the Extelecom's Building in Samora Avenue, east of [[Kisutu]]]]
Newspapers in Dar es Salaam are often sold by people prowling through stationary traffic at road intersections. English-language ones, with online presences, include ''The Citizen'' and ''The Guardian'' and the [[Kiswahili]] dailies, ''Tanzania Daima'' and ''Mwananchi''. ''Business Times'' is the only financial and economic newspaper in the city. It was established in 1988 and became the first private newspaper in Tanzania. ''Business Times'' owns ''Majira'', another Kiswahili newspaper.

===Television stations===

Dar es Salaam is home to ITV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IPPMEDIA |url=https://www.ippmedia.com/en |website=www.ippmedia.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibuka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibuka Footage Stock |url=https://sibukamedia.com/ |website=sibukamedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Channel Ten Television Station formerly known as Dar es Salaam Television (DTV) and Azam TV, a subscription-based service from the Azam group of companies.

Ayo TV, a television station,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Millardayo.com - millard ayo |url=http://millardayo.com/ |website=millardayo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also based in [[Ubungo]], Dar es Salaam, as is the [[Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation]].

===Internet access===
Installation of a [[SEACOM (African cable system)|trans-Indian Ocean backbone cable]] in 2009 has, in theory, made Internet access much more readily available in Dar in particular and in East Africa in general. However, roll-out to end-users is slow, partly because of spotty telephone line coverage at the moment provided by the [[Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TTCL Corporation |url=https://www.ttcl.co.tz/newsite/home.asp |website=www.ttcl.co.tz}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly due to the substantial prices and long contracts demanded for purchase of bandwidth for small ISPs. Mobile-telephone access to the Internet via [[3G]] and [[3.75G]] is still relatively expensive. [[4G]] is making its way through major cities and towns {{As of|2015|lc=y}} with plans to go countrywide in the advanced planning stages.

[[Internet café]]s are found in the city centre and free wifi hotspots in various government and non government institutions as well as public transport.

The expressed aim of the [[SEACOM (African cable system)|SEACOM cable]] is to enable East Africa to develop economically through increased online trading.

* The [[Ardhi University]] (ARU) was established on 1 July 1996 after transforming the former University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS) which was then a Constituent College of the [[University of Dar es Salaam]]. Historically, Ardhi University, dates back to 1956 when it started as Surveying Training School offering land surveying technician certificate courses at the present location of Mgulani Salvation Army Camp in Dar es Salaam. In 1958, the School was moved to the present location (i.e. the Observation Hill). In 1972, the school was transformed to Ardhi Institute. Then the Institute offered two-year diploma programmes in the fields of Land Surveying and Land Management and Valuation. In the same year, a three-year diploma program in Urban and Rural Planning was introduced. In 1975, all the three-year diploma programmes were upgraded to Advanced Diplomas. The Building Design and Building Economics courses started in 1976 and 1978 respectively. In 1996 Ardhi Institute was affiliated with the [[University of Dar es Salaam]] as a constituent college of the university; subsequently its name changed to the University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS). Within ten years, UCLAS increased the number of academic programmes from six to 39. The programmes ranging from diplomas to PhDs were offered by two faculties, the Faculty of Architecture and Planning (FAP) and the Faculty of Lands and Environmental Engineering (FLEE). As a result of these changes, student enrollment increased from only 400 in 1996 to about 1,400 in 2007. At the same time, the number of academic staff with PhD increased from 3 in 1996 to over 60 in 2012. At present there are over 80 PhD holders who have graduated from over 25 universities worldwide. In 2007 Ardhi University came into being following the signing of the Ardhi University Charter by His Excellency the President of The United Republic of Tanzania. Concurrently, the structure and number of programmes and academic units has increased significantly. At present, the university comprises four schools, one institute and several centres. Schools include the School of Architecture, Construction Economics and Management (SACEM); the School of Earth Sciences, Real Estates, Business and Informatics (SERBI); the School of Environmental Science and Technology (SEST); and the School of Spatial Planning and Social Science (SSPSS), alongside the Institute of Human Settlements Studies (IHSS).
