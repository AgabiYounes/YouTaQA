They may be smooth-haired, wire-haired, or long-haired.

The standard-size dachshund was developed to [[Macrosmatic|scent]], [[hunting|chase]], and flush out [[badger]]s and other [[burrow]]-dwelling animals, while the miniature dachshund was bred to hunt smaller prey such as [[rabbit]]s. In the Western United States, they have also been used to track wounded [[deer]] and hunt [[prairie dog]]s.

Dachshunds also participate in [[conformation show]]s, [[Field trial|field trials]] and many other events organized through [[Purebred dog|pure-bred dog]] organizations such as the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC). According to the AKC, the dachshund is ranked 13th in popularity among dog breeds in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics|url=http://www.akc.org/content/news/articles/most-popular-dog-breeds-full-ranking-list/|publisher=American Kennel Club|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''dachshund'' is of [[German language|German]] [[word origin|origin]] and literally means &quot;badger dog,&quot; from ''Dachs'' (&quot;[[European badger]]&quot;) and ''Hund'' (&quot;hound, dog&quot;). The pronunciation varies in [[English language|English]]: variations of the first and second [[syllable]]s include {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|k|s|-}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|k|s|-}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|æ|ʃ|-}} and {{IPAc-en|-|h|ʊ|n|t}}, {{IPAc-en|-|h|ʊ|n|d}}, {{IPAc-en|-|ən|d}}. It may be mispronounced as &quot;dash-hound&quot; by some English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/560280/right-way-pronounce-dachshund|title=The Right Way to Pronounce 'Dachshund'|date=2018-10-14|website=mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/dog-breeds-youre-probably-mispronouncing-2018-4|title=7 dog breeds you're probably mispronouncing|last=Stiefvater|first=Sarah|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although &quot;dachshund&quot; is a German word, in modern German they are more commonly known by the short name ''Dackel'' or ''Teckel''. The German word is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈdaks.hʊnt|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dachshund |publisher=Duden |url=http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Dachshund |access-date=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their long, narrow build, they are often nicknamed wiener dog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pavz3m/wiener-dog-trevor-dachshund-blows-up-deflated-vgtrn |title=We Can't Stop Staring at This Wiener Dog That Had to Be 'Deflated' |date=2018-06-01 |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=2018-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sausage dog. 

== Classification ==
While classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the United States and Great Britain, the breed has its own group in the countries which belong to the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (World Canine Federation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fédération Cynologique Internationale Group 4 &quot;Dachshund Group&quot;|url=http://old.fci.be/nomenclatures_detail.asp?lang=en&amp;file=group4|work=Fédération Cynologique Internationale|accessdate=16 June 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815103443/http://old.fci.be/nomenclatures_detail.asp?lang=en&amp;file=group4|archivedate=15 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired subtype, may exhibit behavior and appearance that are similar to that of the [[terrier]] group of dogs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholas&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholas | first = Anna | title = Dachshund | publisher = TFH Publications | location = Neptune City | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-86622-158-1 | page = [https://archive.org/details/dachshund0000nich/page/10 10] | url = https://archive.org/details/dachshund0000nich/page/10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument can be made for the scent (or hound) group classification because the breed was developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals, and probably descended from the Saint Hubert Hound like many modern scent hound breeds such as [[bloodhound]]s and [[Basset Hound]]s; but with the persistent personality and love for digging that probably developed from the terrier, it can also be argued that they could belong in the [[terrier]], or &quot;earth dog&quot;, group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholas&quot; /&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Appearance ===
[[File:Dachshund.jpg|thumb|A wire-haired dachshund]]
A typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular with short stubby legs. Its front paws are disproportionately large, being paddle-shaped and particularly suitable for digging. Its skin is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. The dachshund has a deep chest which provides appropriate lung capacity for stamina when hunting. Its [[snout]] is long.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= A Brief History of the Breed |url=http://www.almosthomerescue.org/about_dach/history.htm |work=AlmostHomeRescue.org |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the AKC standards for the breed, &quot;scars from honorable wounds shall not be considered a fault&quot; because the dachshund is a hunting dog.&lt;ref name=&quot;AKC Standards&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=American Kennel Club Official Standard of the Dachshund |url=https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Dachshund.pdf |work=akc.org |accessdate=11 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612143635/https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Dachshund.pdf |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coat and color ====
[[File:Trixie the red haired dachshund.png|thumb|A redhaired miniature dachshund]]
There are three dachshund coat varieties: smooth coat (short hair), longhaired, and wirehaired.&lt;ref name=&quot;gkpnso&quot; /&gt; Longhaired dachshunds have a silky coat and short featherings on legs and ears. Wirehaired dachshunds are the least common coat variety in the United States (although it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;gkpnso&quot; /&gt;
Dachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns, the most common one being red. Their base coloration can be single-colored (either red or cream), tan pointed (black and tan, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, or [[Isabelline (colour)|isabella]] and tan), and in wirehaired dogs, a color referred to as wildboar. Patterns such as dapple (merle), sable, brindle and piebald also can occur on any of the base colors. Dachshunds in the same litter may be born in different coat colors depending on the genetic makeup of the parents. 

The dominant color in the breed is red, followed by black and tan. Tan pointed dogs have tan (or cream) markings over the eyes, ears, paws, and tail.  The reds range from coppers to deep rusts, with or without somewhat common black hairs peppered along the back, face and ear edges, lending much character and an almost burnished appearance; this is referred to among breeders and enthusiasts as an &quot;overlay&quot; or &quot;sabling&quot;. Sabling should not be confused with a more unusual coat color referred to as sable. At a distance, a sable dachshund looks somewhat like a black and tan dog. Upon closer examination, however, one can observe that along the top of the dog's body, each hair is actually banded with red at the base near the skin transitioning to mostly black along the length of the strand. An additional striking coat marking is the brindle pattern. &quot;Brindle&quot; refers to dark stripes over a solid background—usually red. If a dachshund is brindled on a dark coat and has tan points, it will have brindling on the tan points only. Even one single, lone stripe of brindle is a brindle. If a dachshund has one single spot of dapple, it is a dapple.

The Dachshund Club of America (DCA) and the [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) consider both the piebald pattern and the double dapple (double merle) pattern to be nonstandard. However, both types continue to be shown and sometimes even win in the conformation ring.

Dogs that are double-dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple, but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat. The DCA excluded the wording &quot;double-dapple&quot; from the standard in 2007 and now strictly uses the wording &quot;dapple&quot; as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness.

&lt;gallery caption=&quot;There are three types of dachshund, which can be classified by their coats: short-haired, called 'smooth'; long-haired; and wire-haired&quot;&gt;

==== Size ====
Dachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature,&lt;ref name=&quot;gkpnso&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/#standard |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=3 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''kaninchen'' (German for &quot;rabbit&quot;). Although the standard and miniature sizes are recognized almost universally, the rabbit size is not recognized by clubs in the United States and the United Kingdom. The rabbit size is recognized by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (World Canine Federation) (FCI), which contain kennel clubs from 83 countries all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fédération Cynologique Internationale Official Website |url=http://www.fci.be/default.aspx |work=Fédération Cynologique Internationale |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasingly common size for family pets falls between the miniature and the standard size, frequently referred to as &quot;tweenies,&quot; not an official classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/dachshund |title=Dachshund |publisher=dogtime.com |accessdate=14 April 2014 }}{{better source|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full-grown standard dachshund averages {{convert|16|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|32|lb|abbr=on}}, while the miniature variety normally weighs less than {{convert|12|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;gkpnso&quot; /&gt; The kaninchen weighs {{convert|8|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|11|lb|abbr=on}}. According to kennel club standards, the miniature (and kaninchen, where recognized) differs from the full-size only by size and weight, thus offspring from miniature parents must never weigh more than the miniature standard to be considered a miniature as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;gkpnso&quot; /&gt; While many kennel club size divisions use weight for classification, such as the American Kennel Club, other kennel club standards determine the difference between the miniature and standard by chest circumference; some kennel clubs, such as in Germany, even measure chest circumference in addition to height and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=For the Love of Dachshunds| last=Hutchinson |first=Robert  |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=BrownTrout Publishers |location= |isbn=1-56313-903-0 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_XAakNgDJwC&amp;pg=PA14 |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. L. Mencken]] said that &quot;A dachshund is a half-dog high and a dog-and-a-half long,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quote Daddy |url=http://www.quotesdaddy.com/quote/609465/Henry+Louis+Mencken/dachshund-a-half-a-dog-high-and-a-dog-and-a-half |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have been referred to as &quot;two dogs long&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dachshund Poetry |work=QuotesDaddy.com |url=http://members.tripod.com/~mcox_2/type.html |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This characteristic has led them to be quite a recognizable breed, and they are featured in many jokes and cartoons, particularly ''[[The Far Side]]'' by [[Gary Larson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Larson | first = Gary | title = Wiener Dog Art: A Far Side Collection | publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-8362-1865-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eye color ====

[[File:Red piebald dox miniature long hair.jpg|thumbnail|Red piebald long hair miniature dachshund puppy]]
Light-colored dachshunds can sport amber, light brown, or green eyes; however, kennel club standards state that the darker the eye color, the better. Dapple and double dapple dachshunds can have multi coloured “wall” eyes with fully blue, partially blue or patched irises due to the effect of the dapple gene on eye pigmentation expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dachshund.org/article_double_dapple.html |title=The Double Dapple |publisher=The Dachshund Magazine Online |accessdate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “Wall” eye is permissible according to DCA standards but undesirable by AKC standards. Piebald-patterned dachshunds will never have blue in their eyes, unless the dapple pattern is present.

=== Temperament ===
Dachshunds are playful, but as hunting dogs can be quite stubborn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dachshund|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/#standard|accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are known for their propensity for chasing small animals, birds, and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity.&lt;ref name=Stall&gt;{{cite book|last = Stall|first = Sam|title = The Good, the Bad, and the Furry|pages = [https://archive.org/details/goodbadfurrychoo0000stal/page/93 93–94]|publisher = Quirk Books|year = 2005|isbn = 1-59474-021-6|url = https://archive.org/details/goodbadfurrychoo0000stal/page/93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paws&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Kilcommons|first1 = Brian|authorlink1 = Brian Kilcommons|last2 = Wilson|first2 = Sarah|title = Paws to Consider|pages = [https://archive.org/details/pawstoconsiderch00kilc/page/156 156–157]|isbn = 0-446-52151-5|url = https://archive.org/details/pawstoconsiderch00kilc/page/156|year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADR&gt;{{cite web|title = Dachshund info|url = http://www.albertadachshundrescue.com/dachshundinfo.cfm|accessdate = 25 July 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090418212636/http://albertadachshundrescue.com/dachshundinfo.cfm|archive-date = 18 April 2009|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many dachshunds are stubborn, making them a challenge to train.&lt;ref name=paws /&gt;&lt;ref name=CDR&gt;{{cite web|title = Is a Dachshund Right For You |url = http://www.wienerdogrescue.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=45&amp;Itemid=61|work=WienerDogRescue.com |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Frequently Asked Questions|url = http://www.dachshundrescue.org/faq.html|work=DachshundRescue.org|accessdate =25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Dachshund Facts|url= http://www.3doxies.com/archives/2011/04/08/dachshund-facts/|work= 3doxies.com|accessdate= 8 April 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110416003654/http://www.3doxies.com/archives/2011/04/08/dachshund-facts/|archive-date= 16 April 2011|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DCA /&gt;

Dachshunds are burrowers by nature and are likely to burrow in blankets and other items around the house, when bored or tired.

According to the American Kennel Club's breed standards, &quot;the dachshund is clever, lively and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dachshund/#standard |title=Dachshund Breed Standard |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=14 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their temperament and body language give the impression that they do not know or care about their relatively small size. Like many small hunting dogs, they will challenge a larger dog. Indulged dachshunds may become snappy or extremely obstinate.&lt;ref name=paws /&gt;&lt;ref name=CDR /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burkesbackyard.com.au/1999/archives/25/roadtests/dog_breeds/dachshunds |title=Dachshunds |publisher=Burke's Backyard with Don Burke |accessdate=14 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dog's behavior is such that it is not the dog for everyone. A bored, untrained dachshund will become destructive.&lt;ref name=Stall /&gt; If raised improperly and not socialized at a young age, dachshunds can become aggressive or fearful.&lt;ref name=paws /&gt; They require a caring, loving owner who understands their need for entertainment and exercise.

Dachshunds may not be the best pets for small children. Like any dog, dachshunds need a proper introduction at a young age. Well-trained dachshunds and well-behaved children usually get along fine. Otherwise, they may be aggressive and bite an unfamiliar child, especially one that moves quickly around them or teases them.&lt;ref name=paws /&gt;&lt;ref name=ADR /&gt;&lt;ref name=CDR /&gt; However, many dachshunds are very tolerant and loyal to children within their family, but these children should be mindful of the vulnerability of the breed's back.

A 2008 [[University of Pennsylvania]] study of 6,000 dog owners who were interviewed indicated that dogs of smaller breeds were more likely to be &quot;genetically predisposed towards aggressive behaviour&quot;. Dachshunds were rated the most aggressive, with 20% having bitten strangers, as well as high rates of attacks on other dogs and their owners. The study noted that attacks by small dogs were unlikely to cause serious injuries and because of this were probably under-reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dobson |first=Roger |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2254479/Sausage-dogs-are-the-most-aggressive-dogs.html |title= Sausage dogs are the most aggressive dogs |work=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=19 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some double dapples, there are varying degrees of vision and hearing loss, including reduced or absent eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parizo|first=Angie|url=http://www.starlightkennel.com/Dapple.html |title=Double Dapple Warnings|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all double dapples have problems with their eyes and/or ears, which may include degrees of hearing loss, full deafness, malformed ears, congenital eye defects, reduced or absent eyes, partial or full blindness, or varying degrees of both vision and hearing problems; but heightened problems can occur due to the genetic process in which two dapple genes cross, particularly in certain breeding lines. Dapple genes, which are dominant genes, are considered &quot;dilution&quot; genes, meaning whatever color the dog would have originally carried is lightened, or diluted, randomly; two dominant &quot;dilution&quot; genes can cancel each other out, or &quot;cross&quot;, removing all color and producing a white recessive gene, essentially a white mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherlysdachshunds.com/genes.html |title=Recessive and Dominant Genes|work=Weatherly's Miniature Dachshunds| accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When occurring genetically within the eyes or ears, this white mutation can be detrimental to development, causing hearing or vision problems.

Dachshunds are also 2.5 times more likely than other breeds of dogs to develop [[patent ductus arteriosus]], a congenital heart defect. Dilute color dogs (Blue, Isabella, and Cream) are very susceptible to [[Canine follicular dysplasia#Color dilution alopecia|color dilution alopecia]], a skin disorder that can result in hair loss and extreme sensitivity to sun. Since the occurrence and severity of these health problems is largely hereditary, breeders are working to eliminate these.

Factors influencing the litter size of puppies and the proportion of stillborn puppies per litter were analyzed in normally sized German dachshunds.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15803761&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gresky C, Hamann H, Distl O |title=[Influence of inbreeding on litter size and the proportion of stillborn puppies in dachshunds] |language=German |journal=Berl.

It was found that as the [[Inbreeding#Domestic animals|inbreeding]] coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating [[inbreeding depression]]. It was also found that young and older dams had smaller litter sizes and more stillborn puppies than middle-aged dams.

[[File:olddachshund.jpg|thumb|Old-style dachshund showing the longer legs]]
[[File:Deiker Jagdbare Tiere 1093210.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a dachshund baying a [[European badger]]]]

The dachshund is a creation of German [[Dog breeding|breeders]] and includes elements of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], and [[England|English]] hounds and [[terrier]]s. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], who was particularly enamored by the breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dachshund History Queen Victoria |url=http://smalldogbreedsinformation.com/dachshund/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140531034424/http://smalldogbreedsinformation.com/dachshund/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 May 2014 |work=Dachshund History Sub Category |accessdate=3 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first verifiable references to the dachshund, originally named the &quot;'''Dachs Kriecher'''&quot; (&quot;badger crawler&quot;) or &quot;'''Dachs Krieger'''&quot; (&quot;badger warrior&quot;), came from books written in the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Der vollkommene teutsche Jäger (The Complete German Hunter), Johann Friedrich von Flemming, 1719–1724, Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, there exist references to &quot;badger dogs&quot; and &quot;hole dogs&quot;, but these likely refer to purposes rather than to specific breeds. The original German dachshunds were larger than the modern full-size variety, weighing between {{convert|14|and|18|kg|abbr=on|lbs}}, and originally came in straight-legged and crook-legged varieties (the modern dachshund is descended from the latter). Though the breed is famous for its use in exterminating badgers and [[badger-baiting]], dachshunds were also commonly used for [[rabbit]] and [[fox]] hunting, for locating wounded [[deer]], and in packs were known to hunt game as large as [[Wild Boar|wild boar]] and as fierce as the [[wolverine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 14, 1875|title=THE CHAMPION DACHSHUND, MANN|url=|journal=Forest and Stream; A Journal of Outdoor Life, Travel, Nature Study, Shooting, Fishing, Yachting (1873-1930)|volume=|pages=149|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are huge differences of opinion as to when dachshunds were specifically bred for their purpose of badger hunting, as the American Kennel Club states the dachshund was bred in the 15th century, while the Dachshund Club of America states that foresters bred the dogs in the 18th or 19th century.

Double-dapple dachshunds, which are prone to eye disease, blindness, or hearing problems, are generally believed to have been introduced to the United States between 1879 and 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.easypetmd.com/doginfo/dachshund|title=Dachshund Breed Information: History, Health, Pictures, and more|website=www.easypetmd.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327023802/http://www.easypetmd.com/doginfo/dachshund|archive-date=27 March 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dachshundbreedcouncil.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/dach-facts-dapple1.pdf|title=Dach-Facts: Double Dapple Health Risks|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dachshundbreedcouncil.org.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flap-down ears and famous curved tail of the dachshund have deliberately been bred into the dog. In the case of the ears, this is to keep grass seeds, dirt, and other matter from entering the [[ear canal]]. The curved tail is dual-purposed: to be seen more easily in long grass and, in the case of burrowing dachshunds, to help haul the dog out if it becomes stuck in a burrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHR&quot; /&gt;
The smooth-haired dachshund, the oldest style, may be a cross between the [[German Shorthaired Pointer]], a [[Pinscher]], and a Bracke (a type of [[bloodhound]]), or to have been produced by crossing a short [[Bruno Jura Hound]] with a pinscher.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History and Development |url=http://www.dachshund-dca.org/faq.html#development |work=Dachshund Club of America |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe it was a cross from a miniature French pointer and a pinscher; others claim that it was developed from the [[bloodhound|St. Hubert Hound]], also a bloodhound, in the 18th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;5star&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Dachshund Dog Breed Origins |url=http://www.5stardog.com/dog-breeds-dachshund.asp |work=5StarDog |accessdate=16 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909152551/http://www.5stardog.com/dog-breeds-dachshund.asp |archive-date=9 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and still others believe that they were descended from [[Basset Hound]]s, based upon their scent abilities and general appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheilds&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor-last= Shields |editor-first= George O. |title= The American Book of the Dog |last= Loeffler |first= William |chapter=Dachshunds | pages= 217–239 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14JCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 |publisher= Cassell and Co |location= University of California |year= 1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dachshunds can track a scent that is more than a week old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mepuppy.com/dachshund/|title=Daschund - Me Puppy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906195640/https://mepuppy.com/dachshund/|archive-date=6 September 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact origins of the dachshund are therefore unknown. According to William Loeffler, from '' The American Book of the Dog (1891)'', in the chapter on dachshunds: &quot;The origin of the Dachshund is in doubt, our best authorities disagreeing as to the beginning of the breed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheilds&quot; /&gt; What can be agreed on, however, is that the short-haired dachshund gave rise to both the long-haired and the wire-haired varieties.

There are two theories about how the standard longhaired dachshund came about. One theory is that smooth Dachshunds would occasionally produce puppies which had slightly longer hair than their parents. By selectively breeding these animals, breeders eventually produced a dog which consistently produced longhaired offspring, and the longhaired dachshund was born. Another theory is that the standard longhaired dachshund was developed by breeding smooth dachshunds with various land and water spaniels. The long-haired dachshund may be a cross among any of the small dog breeds in the spaniel group, including the [[German Spaniel|German Stoeberhund]], and the smooth-haired dachshund.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCA&quot; /&gt;

The wire-haired dachshund, the last to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a possibility the wire-haired dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and wire-haired pinschers, such as the [[Schnauzer]], the [[Dandie Dinmont Terrier]], the [[German Wirehaired Pointer]], or perhaps the [[Scottish Terrier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DCA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Critter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Dachshund Breed Resources |url=http://www.furrycritter.com/resources/dogs/Dachshund.htm |work=FurryCritterNetwork |accessdate=16 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417235345/http://www.furrycritter.com/resources/dogs/Dachshund.htm |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbol of Germany ==
Dachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany. [[Political cartoon]]ists commonly used the image of the dachshund to ridicule [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Political Cartoon for War Bonds |url=http://dachshundlove.blogspot.com/search/label/history |work=The New York Times |date=5 April 1943 |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War I]] the dachshunds' popularity in the United States plummeted because of this association. As a result, they were often called &quot;liberty hounds&quot; by their owners similar to &quot;liberty cabbage&quot; becoming a term for sauerkraut mostly in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sort of Life |last=Green |first=Graham |pages=49 |url=http://richardshepherd.net/2006/ClaudiasSunangel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stigma of the association was revived to a lesser extent during [[World War II]], though it was comparatively short-lived. Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] and German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] were known for keeping dachshunds.

Due to the association of the breed with Germany, as well as its particular popularity among dog keepers in Munich back then, the dachshund was chosen to be the first official [[mascot]] for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich, with the name [[Waldi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;higher&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php |title=Meet the Mascots: Waldi (Munich 1972) |author=Whelliston, Kyle |date=8 July 2008 |publisher=Swifter Higher |accessdate=7 January 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100308075540/http://swifterhigher.com/2008/07/meet-the-mascots-waldi-munich.php

== Sports ==
[[File:Short haired dachshund in race.jpg|thumb|A short haired dachshund in organized race]]
Some people train and enter their dachshund to compete in [[dachshund racing|dachshund races]], such as the [[Wiener Nationals]]. Several races across the United States routinely draw several thousand attendees, including races in [[Germantown, Tennessee]]; [[Bossier City, Louisiana]]; [[Buda, Texas]]; [[Davis, California]]; [[Phoenix, Arizona]]; [[Los Alamitos, California]]; [[Findlay, Ohio]]; [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]; [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]; [[Kansas City, Kansas]]; [[Palo Alto, California]]; and [[Shakopee, Minnesota]]. There is also an annual dachshund run in [[Kennywood]], located in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], called the Wiener 100, in [[Huntington, West Virginia]] called the Dachshund Dash and in [[Lovettsville, Virginia]] as part of the town's annual Oktoberfest celebration.&lt;ref&gt;https://loudounnow.com/2017/09/19/short-on-legs-long-on-competition-its-the-2017-wiener-dog-races/&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the popularity of these events, the Dachshund Club of America opposes &quot;wiener racing&quot;, as many greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds to their facilities. The DCA is also worried about potential injuries to dogs, due to their predisposition to back injuries. Another favorite sport is [[earthdog trial]]s, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate an artificial bait or live but caged and protected rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earthdog Den Trials |publisher=Canada's Guide to Dogs |url=http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/clubs/earthdog.htm |accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Dackel'' versus ''Teckel'' ==
In Germany, dachshunds are widely called ''Dackel'' (both singular and plural). Among hunters, they are mainly referred to as ''Teckel''. There are [[kennel]]s which specialize in breeding hunting dachshunds, the so-called ''jagdliche Leistungszucht'' (&quot;hunting-related performance breed&quot;) or ''Gebrauchshundezucht'' (&quot;working dog breed&quot;), as opposed to breeding family dogs. Therefore, it is sometimes incorrectly believed that ''Teckel'' is either a name for the hunting breed or a mark for passing the test for a trained hunting dog (called &quot;VGP&quot;, &quot;Verband-Gebrauchsprüfung&quot;) in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;dtk&quot;&gt;[http://www.dtk1888.de/fragen.html FAQ of the German Teckelclub on the naming issue] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==
Dachshunds are one of the most popular dogs in the United States, ranking 13th in the 2016 AKC registration statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/content/news/articles/most-popular-dog-breeds-full-ranking-list/ |title=AKC Dog Registration Statistics |publisher=American Kennel Club |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are popular with urban and apartment dwellers, ranking among the top ten most popular breeds in 76 of 190 major US cities surveyed by the AKC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/register/top-dogs-by-city/ |title=2006 AKC Top Breeds By City |publisher=American Kennel Club |access-date=24 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218194740/http://www.akc.org/register/top-dogs-by-city/ |archive-date=18 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
