{{IPA notice}}
The English words '''Daoism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) and '''Taoism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) are alternative spellings for the same-named [[Chinese philosophy#Daoism|Chinese philosophy]] and [[Religion in China#Taoism|religion]]. The root for [[Daoism]] or [[Taoism]] is the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word [[wikt:道|道]] (&quot;road&quot; or &quot;way&quot;), which was transcribed ''[[wikt:tao#English|tao]]'' or ''tau'' in the earliest systems for the [[romanization of Chinese]] and ''[[wikt:dao#English|dao]]'' or ''dau'' in 20th century systems.

==Phonology==
In order to explain why English ''Taoism'' might be pronounced ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}), it is necessary to introduce some technical terminology from [[linguistics]]. A [[phoneme]] is the smallest unit of [[speech sound]]s that a particular language distinguishes, and unrelated languages can have disparate [[Phoneme#Numbers of phonemes in different languages|phonemic inventories]]. For instance, [[Standard English]], depending on dialect, has about 24 consonant phonemes and [[Standard Chinese]] has 19. To illustrate how phonemic gaps can affect borrowed words, English has {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} consonants and Chinese has {{IPA|/l/}} but not {{IPA|/r/}}, thus, Chinese uses /l-/ to transcribe both /l-/ and /r-/ [[List of loanwords in Chinese#English|English loanwords]]; for example, ''léishè'' [[wikt:镭射|镭射]] &quot;[[laser]]&quot; and ''léidá'' [[wikt:雷达|雷达]] &quot;[[radar]]&quot;. Conversely, Japanese has the /r-/ phoneme but not /l-/, with borrowings of ''rēza'' [[wikt:レーザ|レーザ]] and ''rēdā'' [[wikt:レーダー|レーダー]].

In [[phonetics]], the consonant of Chinese ''tao'' or ''dào'' 道 is classified as an [[unaspirated consonant|unaspirated]] [[denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar stop]]. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] is [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] that involves an audible puff of breath; for example, the /t/ in English ''tore'' {{IPA|[tʰɔr]}} is aspirated with a burst of air while the /t/ in ''store'' {{IPA|[stɔr]}} is unaspirated. The IPA symbol for aspiration is a superscript &quot;h&quot;, {{IPA|[ʰ]}} (e.g., {{IPA|pʰ}}), and the optional diacritic for unaspiration is a superscript equals sign &quot;=&quot;, {{IPA|[⁼]}} (e.g., {{IPA|p⁼}}). A [[stop consonant]] or oral [[occlusive]] is a [[consonant]] in which the speaker blocks the vocal tract so that all [[airstream mechanism|airflow]] ceases, and a [[denti-alveolar consonant]] is articulated with a flat tongue against the [[alveolar ridge]] and upper teeth. 

The present Chinese unaspirated denti-alveolar stop in pinyin ''dào'' 道 is commonly transcribed with the IPA symbol [{{IPA link|t}}], although some linguists prefer using {{IPA|[d̥]}} with the [[slack voice|voiceless]] [[Ring (diacritic)#Underring|under-ring]] diacritic. The sinologist and phonologist [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] explains the reason for using {{IPA|[d̥]}} instead of [t] for Pinyin ''d''. Chinese stops and [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] fall into two contrasting unaspirated and aspirated series. The unaspirated series (''b'', ''d'', ''z'', etc.) is [[lenis]], and &quot;often gives the impression of being voiced to the untrained ear&quot;, while the aspirated series (''p'', ''t'', ''c'', etc.) is strongly aspirated (1988:139). [[Standard Chinese phonology]] uses aspiration for the [[Contrastive distribution#Phonology|contrastive distribution]] of consonantal stops. For example, phonemically differentiating the unaspirated denti-alveolar stop /{{IPA link|t}}/ with the aspirated denti-alveolar stop /{{IPA link|tʰ}}/, as in unaspirated ''dào'' or /{{IPA|taʊ}}/ 道 &quot;way&quot; and aspirated ''tào'' or /{{IPA|tʰaʊ}}/ [[wikt:套|套]] &quot;sheath; case; cover&quot;. 

Instead of aspiration, [[English phonology]] primarily contrasts stop consonants by [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]], that is, the [[vocal cords]] vibrate in a voiced sound but not in a voiceless or unvoiced one. The voiced stops ({{IPAblink|d}}, {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, and {{IPAblink|b}}) are in complementary distribution with voiceless ({{IPAblink|t}}, {{IPAblink|k}}, and ({{IPAblink|p}}). Voiced stops are usually unaspirated and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated. There are six voiceless plosives in Chinese: simple and aspirated p p', t t', k k', which would correspond to English voiceless and voiced p b, t d, k g. The six Chinese plosives are generally rendered by English p t k, for instance, simple t in [[moutan]], and [[Tanka people|Tanka]], and aspirated t' in [[Fan-Tan|fantan]] and [[Widow_Twankey#History|twankay]] (Yuan 1981: 251).

In English, aspiration is [[allophone|allophonic]], meaning multiple alternative pronunciations for a single phoneme in a particular language. For example, {{IPA|[pʰ]}} as in ''pin'' and {{IPA|[p]}} as in ''spin'' are allophones for the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} because they cannot distinguish words. English-speakers treat them as the same sound, but they are phonetically different, the first is aspirated and the second is unaspirated.

[[Phonological rule]]s can miss the point when it comes to loanwords, which are borrowings that move from a language with one set of well-formedness conditions to a language with a different set, with the result that adjustments have to be made to meet the new constraints (Yip 1993:262). Coming back to the Chinese unaspirated denti-alveolar stop {{IPA|[t]}} in pinyin ''dào'' 道, this speech sound exists in English—but never as the [[Stress (linguistics)#Lexical stress|stressed]] first syllable in a word. Unaspirated {{IPA|[t]}} occurs instead in words such as &quot;s'''t'''op&quot; or &quot;pa'''t'''&quot; as a complementary /t/ allophone of the aspirated {{IPA|[tʰ]}} initial ''t'' in English, such as in &quot;'''t'''ap&quot;. Owing to the linguistic difference between the Chinese aspirated /tʰ/ vs. unaspirated /t/ phonemic contrast and English voiced /d/ vs. unvoiced /t/ phonemic contrast, an English speaker who is unfamiliar with Chinese romanization will likely pronounce ''Dao'' with the [[voiced alveolar stop]] {{IPAblink|d}} and ''Tao'' with the [[voiceless alveolar stop]] {{IPAblink|t}}. Thus, the Chinese unaspirated {{IPA|/t/}} phoneme in ''dào'' 道 /taʊ/ is nearer to the pronunciation of English voiced unaspirated {{IPA|/d/}} in ''Dow'' /daʊ/ than the voiceless aspirated {{IPA|/t/}} in ''Taos'' [taʊs], but it is neither (Carr 1990: 60).

==Romanizations==
Scholars have been developing [[romanization of Chinese|Chinese romanization]] systems for four centuries, and the unaspirated {{IPA|[taʊ]}} 道 &quot;road; way&quot; has many transcriptions.

[[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries in China]] recorded the earliest romanizations of /taʊ/ 道. The first bilingual [[Chinese dictionary]] in a Western language, [[Michele Ruggieri]]'s and [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] 1583-1588 ''Dicionário Português-Chinês'' or ''Pú-Hàn cídiǎn'' 葡漢辭典 (Yong and Peng 2008: 385), transcribed /taʊ/ as &quot;táo&quot; (Witek 2001: 190).{{Citation needed|reason=What Portuguese word does this dictionary translate as 道?|date=August 2018}} The [[Latin language|Latin]] 1615 ''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'', compiled by Matteo Ricci and [[Nicolas Trigault]], romanized it as &quot;tau&quot; in the Chinese term &quot;Tausu&quot; (i.e., ''[[Taoist priest|Daoshi]]'' 道士, &quot;Daoist priest&quot;), which [[Samuel Purchas]]'s 1625 English translation gave as &quot;Tausa&quot; (XII: 461).

During the 19th and 20th centuries, new and revised Chinese romanization schemes flourished. The Standard Chinese pronunciation of 道 is variously transcribed as [[Wade–Giles]] ''tao'' (or ''tao''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; marking [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tonal categories|4th tone]]), [[Legge romanization]] ''tâo'', [[Latinxua Sin Wenz]] ''dau'', [[Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] ''daw'',  [[Yale romanization of Mandarin|Yale]] ''dàu'', and [[Hanyu Pinyin]] ''dào''. In addition to [[Latin alphabet]] romanizations, there are [[Transliteration of Chinese|transliterations]] of [[Zhuyin fuhao]] ㄉㄠ and Cyrillic [[Cyrillization of Chinese from pinyin|Pallidius System]] ''дао''. Romanization systems use one of two arbitrary ways to represent the Chinese phonemic opposition between aspirated and unaspirated consonants. Take for example, Chinese unaspirated {{IPA|[t̥aʊ]}} [[Wikt:道|道]] &quot;way&quot; and aspirated {{IPA|[tʰaʊ]}} [[Wikt:桃|桃]] &quot;peach&quot;. Some systems, like Wade–Giles ''tao'' 道 and ''t'ao'' 桃, introduce a special symbol for aspiration, in this case the [[Greek diacritics|Greek]] [[rough breathing]] diacritic (῾) indicating {{IPA|/h/}} before a vowel; others, like Pinyin ''dao'' 道 and ''tao'' 桃, use &quot;d&quot; and &quot;t&quot;. In English and other languages, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;t&quot; indicate a voiced and unvoiced distinction, which is not phonemic in Chinese (Carr 1990: 59).

While many scholars prefer the more familiar spelling &quot;Taoism&quot;, arguing that it is now an English word in its own right, the term &quot;Daoism&quot; is becoming increasingly popular.  In one work, &quot;Daoism&quot; was preferred to &quot;Taoism&quot; principally for technical, phonological and conventional reasons, but also because it was thought the modern term &quot;Daoism&quot; helped highlight a departure from earlier Western interpretations of the philosophy (Girardot, Miller, and Liu 2001: xxxi).  Miller later added that &quot;Daoism&quot; is his preferred usage as a distinction &quot;from what 'Taoism' represented in the 20th-century Western imagination&quot; (Miller 2008: xiii).  One commentator, who goes beyond the spelling distinction between [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] &quot;Taoism&quot; and academic &quot;Daoism&quot;, discriminates &quot;Taoism&quot; with its common voiced /ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/ mispronunciation. Having explained that both &quot;Daoism&quot; and &quot;Taoism&quot; are pronounced &quot;with a 'd' sound&quot;, i.e., /ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/, Komjathy describes a [[new religious movement]] labeled &quot;American Taoism&quot; or &quot;Popular Western Taoism&quot; (a term coined by Herman 1998) in which &quot;Taoism&quot; is pronounced with a &quot;hard 't' sound&quot;, /ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/ (2014: 1, 206).

==Borrowings==
Within the [[lexical set]] of [[List of English words of Chinese origin|English words originating from Chinese]], the loanword ''Tao/Dao'' is more typical than the loanblend ''Taoism/Daoism''. Most Sinitic borrowings in English are [[loanwords]] directly [[transliterated]] from Chinese (for example, ''Tao/Dao'' from ''dào'' 道 &quot;way, path; say&quot; or ''[[kowtow]]'' from ''kòutóu'' 叩頭 lit. &quot;knock head&quot;), some are [[calques]] or loan translations (''[[brainwashing]]'' from ''xǐnăo'' 洗腦, lit. &quot;brain wash&quot; or ''[[Red Guards]]'' from ''Hóngwèibīng'' 红卫兵), and a few are [[hybrid word]]s or loanblends that combine a borrowing with a native element (''Taoism/Daoism'' from ''Tao/Dao'' &quot;the Way&quot; and [[-ism]] suffix or ''[[Peking duck]]'' from ''Běijīng kǎoyā'' 北京烤鴨 &quot;roast Beijing duck&quot;). Besides English ''Taoism/Daoism'', other common ''-ism'' borrowings include ''[[Confucianism]]'', ''[[Mohism]]'', and ''[[Maoism]]''. While most Chinese loanwords have a &quot;foreign appearance&quot;, monosyllabic ones such as [[Li (Confucianism)|li]] or [[Tong (organization)|tong]] are more likely to remain &quot;alien&quot; than loanblends with English elements such as Taoism or [[tangram]] that are more readily &quot;naturalized&quot; (Yuan 1981: 250).

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed.) records the progression of occurrences over the succeeding centuries:  ''Tao'' 1736, ''Tau'' 1747, ''Taouism'' and ''Taouist'' 1838, ''Taoistic'' 1856, ''Tao-ism'' 1858, ''Taoism'' 1903, ''Daoism'' 1948, ''Dao'' and ''Daoist'' 1971.

Linguists distinguish between [[hypercorrection]], the erroneous use of a nonstandard word form due to a belief that it is more accurate than the corresponding standard form (for instance, the /fra:ns/ pronunciation for France /fræns/), and [[hyperforeignism]], the misapplication of foreign loanword pronunciation patterns extended beyond their use in the original language (such as dropping the &quot;t&quot; in [[Bordeaux wine#&quot;Claret&quot; term|claret]] /ˈklærɪt/). ''Taoism'' is neither a hypercorrection because it originated from a spelling misunderstanding rather than a phonemic modification, nor a hyperforeignism because it is not an attempt to sound more Chinese (Carr 1990: 68).

The pronunciation of ''Taoism'' as {{IPA|/ˈtaʊ.ɪzəm/}} instead of {{IPA|/ˈdaʊ.ɪzəm/}} is not unique and typifies many Chinese borrowings in English (e.g., [[gung-ho]], Cohen 1989) that are distorted owing to Chinese romanization systems. Wade-Giles ''[[I Ching]]'' and ''[[T'ai Chi Ch'üan]]'' (Pinyin ''Yìjīng'' and ''Tàijíquán'') are two common cases in which the Pinyin romanization more accurately represents Chinese pronunciation than Wade–Giles (Carr 1990: 67-68). ''I Ching'' transcribes the Chinese /i  t͡ɕiŋ/ [[wikt:易經|易經]] [[Book of Changes]], but some English speakers pronounce it /ˈaɪ tʃiːŋ/, reading Chinese ''I'' /i/ as the English pronoun ''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'' /aɪ/ and the aspirated alveolo-palatal ''Ch'' /  t͡ɕʰ/ as the fortis [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] /tʃ/. The ''T'ai Chi Ch'üan'' martial art /tʰaɪ̯   t͡ɕi   t͡ɕʰy̯ɛn/ [[wikt:太极拳|太极拳]] is commonly misspelled ''Tai Chi Chuan'' (Pinyin ''Daijizhuan'') without umlaut or apostrophes (the Wikipedia article is titled [[Tai chi]]), and is similarly naturalized as English /ˌtaɪ ˌtʃi ˈtʃwɑn/.

==Lexicography==
English dictionaries provide some insights into the ''Daoism''/''Taoism'' pronunciation issue. For over a century, British and American [[lexicography|lexicographers]] glossed the pronunciation of ''Taoism'' as ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}), but gradually began changing it to ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) and added ''Daoism'' entries.

One scholar analyzed ''Taoism'' pronunciation glosses in general-purpose English dictionaries, comparing twelve published in Great Britain (1933–1989) and eleven published in the United States (1948–1987). After standardizing the various dictionary [[Pronunciation respelling for English|respelling systems]] into the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], there are four types of ''Taoism'' glosses involving [[prescriptive linguistics]] and [[descriptive linguistics]]: ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) is prescriptively accurate, ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) describes a common distortion, and the alternate ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) and ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) glosses are more comprehensive (Carr 1990: 63-64).

Nine of the twelve British-English dictionaries gloss the pronunciation of ''Taoism'' as ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}), and three give ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}). The eleven American-English references haves more varied glosses: ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) six times, ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) twice, ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) twice, and ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) once (''[[Oxford American Dictionary|OAD]]'', 1979). The respective first accurate American and British lexicographic glosses for ''Taoism'' were &quot;''douizm; tou''-&quot; (''[[Webster%27s Dictionary#Webster’s New International Dictionary (second edition, 1934)|Webster's Second]]'', 1934) and &quot;Also '''Daoism''' and with pronunc. (dau•iz'm)&quot; (''[[Oxford English Dictionary#Second supplement|OED supplement]]'', 1986). Within the present sample of English-language dictionaries, the American publications were faster to rectify the mistaken ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) pronunciation to ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|aʊ|.|ɪ|z|əm}}) (Carr 1990: 64-65).

Besides ({{IPAc-en|t}}) and ({{IPAc-en|d}}) pronunciation variations for the consonant ''T'' in ''Taoism'', the dictionaries also glosses the vocalic ({{IPAc-en|aʊ}}) [[diphthong]] as (/{{IPA|au}}/), (/{{IPA|ɑu}}/), and the [[triphthong]] (/{{IPA|ɑːəu}}/), which may be owing to the old ''Taouism'', ''Tauism'', and ''Tavism'' variant spellings (Carr 1990: 64). For instance, the 1989 ''[[Oxford English Dictionary#Second_edition|OED2]]'' mixed gloss &quot;(ˈtɑːəʊɪz(ə)m, ˈdaʊɪz(ə)m)&quot; combines the (/{{IPA|ɑːəʊ}}/) pronunciation from the 1933 ''[[Oxford English Dictionary#Completion of first edition and first supplement|OED1]]'' ''Taoism'' entry and the ({{IPAc-en|aʊ}}}) from the 1986 ''OED supplement''.
