'''Ajaigarh''' or '''Adjygurh''' is a town and a [[nagar panchayat]] in the [[Panna District]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] state in central [[India]].

==History==
{{main article|Ajaigarh State}}
[[File:Ajaigarhflag.png|thumb|Flag of Ajaigarh state]]
Ajaigarh was the capital of a [[princely state]] of the same name during the [[British Raj]]. Ajaigarh was founded in 1765 by Guman Singh, a [[bundela]] [[Rajput]] who was the nephew of Raja Pahar Singh of Jaitpur. After Ajaigarh was captured by the British in 1809, it became a princely state in the [[Bundelkhand Agency]] of the [[Central India Agency]]. It had an area of {{convert|771|sqmi}}, and a population of 78,236 in 1901. The rulers bore the title of ''sawai maharaja''. He commanded an estimated annual revenue of about £15,000/-, and paid a tribute of £460/-.  The chief resided at the town of [[Nowgong, Chhatarpur|Nowgong]], at the foot of the hill-fortress of Ajaigarh, from which the state took its name. This fort, situated on a steep hill, towers more than 800&amp;nbsp;ft (244 m) above the eponymous township, and contains the ruins of several temples adorned with elaborately carved sculptures. The town was often afflicted by [[malaria]], and suffered severely from famine in 1868–1869 and 1896–1897.

The state acceded to the [[Government of India]] on 1 January 1950; the ruling chief was granted a privy purse of Rs. 74,700/-, and the courtesy use of his styles and titles. All of these were revoked by the government of [[India]] in 1971, at the time when these privileges were revoked from all erstwhile princes. The former princely state became part of the new Indian state of [[Vindhya Pradesh]], and most of the territory of the former state, including the town of Ajaigarh, became part of Panna District, with a smaller portion going to [[Chhatarpur District]]. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]] on 1 November 1956.

== Ajaigarh Fort ==
Ajaigarh or Ajaygarh Fort is listed among the top attractions of the region. It stands alone on a hilltop in the district of Panna and is easily accessible from Khajuraho. The fort is bordered by beautiful Vindhya Hills and provides absolutely stunning views of the Ken River. This grand fort is noted for its rich historical past and architectural beauty, which speaks volumes about the Chandela dynasty.

There is plenty to explore at the fort, which makes it a treat for history and art lovers. Reminiscent of old times, this fort has two gates (earlier there were five), two temples and two rock-cut tanks, close to the northern gate. These tanks have been named as Ganga and Yamuna.
