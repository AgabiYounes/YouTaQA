'''Ajmer''' {{IPA-hns|ədʒmeːr|pron|Ajmer.ogg}} is one of the major and oldest cities in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]] and the centre of the eponymous [[Ajmer District]]. It is located at the centre of [[Rajasthan]], and is home to the [[Ajmer Sharif]] shrine.

The city was established as &quot;''Ajayameru''&quot; (Translated as '''Invincible Hills''&lt;nowiki/&gt;') by a [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Shakambhari Chahamana]] (Chauhan) ruler, either [[Ajayaraja I]] or [[Ajayaraja II]], and served as the ''Chahamana'' capital until the 12th century CE.{{sfn|Har Bilas Sarda|1911|pp=68-74}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=87}}

Ajmer is surrounded by the [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli Mountains]]. Ajmer had been a municipality since 1869.

Ajmer has been selected as one of the heritage cities for the [[HRIDAY - Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hridayindia.in/hriday-cities/|title=Hriday Cities {{!}} Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY)|website=www.hridayindia.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Smart City Mission schemes of Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hridayindia.in/|title=Introduction|website=Hriday official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jahangir Receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on His Return from the Mewar Campaign.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Jahangir receives Prince Khurram at Ajmer on his return from the Mewar campaign]]

Ajmer was originally known as ''Ajayameru''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tourism.rajasthan.gov.in/ajmer|title=Ajmer Tourism: Places to Visit in Ajmer - Rajasthan Tourism|website=tourism.rajasthan.gov.in|language=en-IN|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th century text ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]'' states that the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Shakambhari Chahamana]] (Chauhan) king [[Ajayaraja II]] (ruled {{circa|1110}}{{snd}}1135 CE) established the city of Ajayameru.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=87}} Historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]] notes that the earliest mention of the city's name occurs in Palha's ''[[Pattavali]]'', which was copied in 1113 CE (1170 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]) at [[Dhara (city)|Dhara]]. This suggests that Ajmer was founded sometime before 1113 CE.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=40}} A ''[[prashasti]]'' (eulogistic inscription), issued by [[Vigraharaja IV]] and found at [[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra]], states Ajayadeva (that is, Ajayaraja II) moved his residence to Ajmer.{{sfn|Har Bilas Sarda|1911|pp=68-74}}

The later text ''[[Prabandha Kosha|Prabandha-Kosha]]'' states that it was the 8th-century king [[Ajayaraja I]] who commissioned the Ajayameru fort, which later came to be known as the [[Taragarh Fort, Ajmer|Taragarh fort]] of Ajmer.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=87}} According to historian R. B. Singh, this claim appears to be true, as inscriptions dated to the 8th century CE have been found at Ajmer.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=88}} Singh theorizes that Ajayaraja II later expanded the town area, constructed palaces, and moved the Chahamana capital from [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Shakambhari]] to Ajmer.{{sfn|R.B. Singh|1964|pp=131-132}}

Mughal prince [[Dara Shikoh]] was born here in 1615. [[Jahanara Begum]] powerful Mughal princess also born here.

During Colonial times Ajmer city served as the headquarters of [[Ajmer-Merwara|Ajmer - Merwara]] Province and possessed a Central jail, a [[Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Ajmer#Attached Hospitals|large General Hospital]], and two smaller hospitals according to Gazetteer, 1908. It was the headquarters of a native regiment and of a Railway Volunteer corps.

At the time of Independence Ajmer Continued as a separate state with its own legislature until its merger with erstwhile Rajputana province then called Rajasthan. The Legislature of Ajmer State was housed in the building which now houses T. T. College. It had 30 MLAs. and Haribhau Upadhaya was the first Chief Minister of the erstwhile state and Bhagirath Chaudhary as the first Vidhan Sabha Speaker. In 1956, after acceptance of the proposal by Fazil Ali, Ajmer was merged into Rajasthan to form Ajmer District with the addition of Kishangarh sub-division of Jaipur district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://epaper.patrika.com/c/32616903|title=Clipping of Patrika Group - Ajmer|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
