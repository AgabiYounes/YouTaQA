'''Abd ar-Rahman V''' ({{Lang-ar|عبد الرحمن بن هشام المستظهر بالله|ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Hishām al-Mustaẓhir bi-llāh}}) was an Umayyad [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Caliph of Córdoba]].

In the agony of the [[Umayyad dynasty]] in the [[Al-Andalus]] ([[Moors|Moorish]] [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]), two princes of the house were proclaimed [[Caliph of Córdoba]] for a very short time, '''[[Abd-ar-Rahman IV]]''' Mortada (1017), and '''Abd-ar-Rahman V''' Mostadir (1023–1024). Both were the mere puppets of factions, who deserted them at once. Abd-ar-Rahman IV was murdered the same year he was proclaimed at [[Cadiz]], in flight from a battle in which he had been deserted by his supporters. Abd-ar-Rahman V was proclaimed caliph in December 1023 at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], and murdered in January 1024 by a mob of unemployed workmen, headed by one of his own cousins.
