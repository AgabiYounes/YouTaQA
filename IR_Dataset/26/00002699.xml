'''Aberavon''' ([[Welsh (language)|Welsh]]: ''Aberafan'') is a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

==History==
The constituency was created for the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] by the dividing of the [[Swansea District (UK Parliament constituency)|Swansea District]]. With the exception of the first term, it has always been held by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Ramsay MacDonald]], who became Labour's first [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 1924, held the seat from 1922 to 1929. Its current MP, Stephen Kinnock, is the son of [[Neil Kinnock]], who was Labour leader and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] from 1983 to 1992.

It is one of the most consistently [[safe seat]]s for Labour; since the end of the Second World War, the Labour candidate has always won Aberavon with a majority at least 33%, and with the exception of [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], the Labour candidate has also always won an overall majority of the vote in the seat. In 2015, Kinnock only won 48.9% of the vote in Aberavon, against a surge in the vote for the [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]] candidate; however, in 2017, Kinnock's voteshare rose by 19.2 percentage points, the biggest increase in the Labour vote in the seat's history, and his majority increased to 50.4%, the highest for an Aberavon MP since [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. The 2017 result also made Aberavon the safest Labour seat in Wales, however the seat saw a significant swing against Labour in 2019.

Commenting on the 1983 boundary changes to the constituency when moving the 2000 Loyal Address of the Blair Government in Parliament, then-MP [[John Morris, Baron Morris of Aberavon|Sir John Morris]], who would retire at [[2001 United Kingdom general election|the next general election]], said:

{{quote|It is a happy tradition on this occasion to refer to one's constituency and to the people who sent one here....Whatever may occur in future, I would deplore the loss of the Member-constituency link. When, after 23 years, I lost part of my constituency, I missed the friendship of two generations. My constituents and I had grown up and grown older together.}}
