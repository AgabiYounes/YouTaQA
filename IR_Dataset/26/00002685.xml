'''Abdera''' is a [[municipalities and communities of Greece|municipality]] in the [[Xanthi (regional unit)|Xanthi Prefecture]] of [[western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Greece]]. In [[classical antiquity]], it was a major [[ancient Greece|Greek]] ''[[polis]]'' on the [[Thrace|Thracian]] coast.

The ancient polis is to be distinguished from the municipality, which was named in its honor. The polis lay 17&amp;nbsp;km east-northeast of the mouth of the [[Nestos River]], almost directly opposite the island of [[Thasos]]. It was a colony placed in previously unsettled Thracian territory, not then a part of Hellas, during the age of [[Greek colonization]]. The city that developed from it became of major importance in ancient Greece. After the 4th century{{nbsp}}{{sc|ad}} it declined, contracted to its [[acropolis]], and was abandoned, never to be reoccupied except by archaeologists. 

Meanwhile, life went on as the changing population settled in other communities in the region. One named Polystylus changed its name to Abdera. In 2011 the municipality of Abdera was [[synoecism|synoecized]] from three previous municipalities comprising a number of modern settlements. The ancient site remains in it as a ruin. The municipality of Abdera has 19,005 inhabitants (2011). The seat of the municipality is the town [[Genisea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web3.eetaa.gr:8080/metaboles/show_metaboles_ota.jsp?toponymio_code=6910 |title=Administrative changes in OTA |date=4 December 1997 |publisher=EETAA |accessdate=9 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161212141303/http://web3.eetaa.gr:8080/metaboles/show_metaboles_ota.jsp?toponymio_code=6910 |archivedate=2016-12-12 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The name ''Abdera'' is of [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] origin and was shared in antiquity by [[Abdera, Spain]] and a town near [[Carthage]] in [[North Africa]].{{sfnp|Graham|1992|pp=44–45}}{{efn|The name of the African town is written {{lang|grc|Ἄβδειρα}} (''Ábdeira'') in Claudius [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ἄβδειρα|url=https://logeion.uchicago.edu/Ἄβδειρα|website=Logeion|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=20 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It was variously [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] as {{lang|grc|Ἄβδηρα}} (''Ábdēra''), {{lang|grc|Αὔδηρα}} (''Aúdēra''),&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrg&quot; /&gt; {{lang|grc|Ἄβδαρα}} (''Ábdara''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ἄβδηρα|url=https://logeion.uchicago.edu/Ἄβδηρα|website=Logeion|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=20 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|grc|Ἄβδηρον}} (''Ábdēron''),&lt;ref name=&quot;dgrg&quot; /&gt; and {{lang|grc|Ἄβδηρος}} (''Ábdēros''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ἄβδηρος|url=https://logeion.uchicago.edu/Ἄβδηρος|website=Logeion|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=20 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being [[latinisation of names|Latinized]] as ''Abdera''.&lt;ref name=dgrg&gt;{{cite DGRG|wstitle=Abdera}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek mythology|Greek legend]] attributed the name to an eponymous [[Abderus]] who fell nearby and was memorialized by [[Hercules]]'s founding of a city at the location.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke|Bibliotheca]]'', ed. Wagner, R. Leipzig: Teubner, 1894; ''Mythographi Graeci'' 1, Chapter 2, section 97, line 7ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present-day town is written '''Avdira''' ({{lang|el|Άβδηρα}}) and pronounced {{IPA-el|ˈavðira|}} in [[modern Greek]].

==History==
===Antiquity===
[[File:Abdera location.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Location of Abdera and its two successive [[metropolis]]es, [[Clazomenae]] and [[Teos]].]]
[[File:Abderacoin.png|thumb|290px|The chief coin type, with [[Griffin|griffon]].]]
The [[Phoenicia]]ns apparently began the settlement of Abdera at some point before the mid-7th century{{sfnp|Graham|1992|pp=44–45}} and the town long maintained Phoenician standards in its coinage.

The Greek settlement was begun as a failed colony from [[Klazomenai]], traditionally dated to 654{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. (Evidence in 7th-century-{{sc|bc}} [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek pottery]] tends to support the traditional date but the exact timing remains uncertain.)&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Hornblower| first = Simon| title = Abdera | encyclopedia = The Oxford Classical Dictionary| pages = 1| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] reports that the leader of the colony had been [[Timesios]] but, within his generation, the [[Thracians]] had expelled the colonists. Timesios was subsequently honored as a [[hero (ancient Greece)|local protective spirit]] by the later Abderans from Teos.{{sfnp|Graham|1992|p=46}} Others recount various legends about this colony. [[Plutarch]] and [[Aelian]] relate that Timesios grew insufferable to his colonists because of his desire to do everything by himself; when one of their children let him know how they all really felt, he quit the settlement in disgust; modern scholars have tried to split the difference between the two accounts of early Abdera's failure by giving the latter as the reason for Timesios's having left Klazomenai.{{sfnp|Graham|1992|pp=45–47}}

The successful foundation occurred in 544{{nbsp}}BC, when the majority of the people of [[Teos]] (including the poet [[Anacreon]]) migrated to Abdera to escape the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] yoke.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], i.168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=|first=|authorlink=|editor-first=|editor-last=|editor-link=|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Abdera|edition=15th|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|volume=I: A-Ak - Bayes|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/19 19]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopaedia2009ency/page/19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief coin type, a ''[[Griffin|griffon]]'', is identical with that of Teos; the rich silver coinage is noted for the beauty and variety of its reverse types.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abdera (Thrace)|display=Abdera|volume=1|page=33}} Endnotes:

*''Mém. de l'Acad. des Inscriptions'', xxxix. 211;
*K. F. Hermann, ''Ges. Abh.'' 90-111, 370 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 513 and 512{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, the Persians, under [[Darius the Great|Darius]] conquered Abdera, by which time the city seems to have become a place of considerable importance, and is mentioned as one of the cities which had the expensive honour of entertaining the great king on his march into Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Herod. vii. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; In 492{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, after the [[Ionian Revolt]], the Persians again conquered Abdera, again under [[Darius I]] but led by his general [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]]. On his flight after the [[Battle of Salamis]], Xerxes stopped at Abdera and acknowledged the hospitality of its inhabitants by presenting them with a tiara and scimitar of gold.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite DGRG|wstitle=Abdera}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thucydides]]&lt;ref&gt;ii. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; mentions Abdera as the westernmost limit of the [[Odrysian kingdom]] when at its height at the beginning of the [[Peloponnesian war]]. It later became part of the [[Delian League]] and fought on the side of Athens in the Peloponnesian war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibliotheca historica'', ed. Vogel, F., Fischer, K.T. (post I. Bekker &amp; L. Dindorf), Leipzig: Teubner, 1:1888; 2:1890; 3:1893; 4–5:1906, Repr. 1964. Book 13, chapter 72, section 2, line 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdera was a wealthy city, the third richest in the League, due to its status as a prime port for trade with the interior of Thrace and the [[Odrysian kingdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OCD&quot;/&gt; In 408{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, Abdera was reduced under the power of Athens by [[Thrasybulus]], then one of the Athenian generals in that quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus|Diod.]] xiii. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

A valuable prize, the city was repeatedly sacked: by the [[Triballi]] in 376{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, [[Philip II of Macedon]] in 350{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}; later by [[Lysimachus|Lysimachos of Thrace]],&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]], the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]], and again by the Macedonians. In 170{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} the Roman armies and those of [[Eumenes II|Eumenes II of Pergamon]] besieged and sacked it.

The town seems to have declined in importance after the middle of the 4th century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; Cicero ridicules the city as a byword for stupidity in his letters to [[Atticus (philosopher)|Atticus]], writing of a debate in the Senate, &quot;Here was Abdera, but I wasn't silent&quot; (&quot;Hic, Abdera non tacente me&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''Epistulae ad Atticum'',  4.17.3, 7.7.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the city counted among its citizens the philosophers [[Democritus]], [[Protagoras]]&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; and [[Anaxarchus]], historian and philosopher [[Hecataeus of Abdera]], and the lyric poet [[Anacreon]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] speaks of Abdera as being in his time a free city.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|N.H.]] iv. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abdera West gate.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The west gate of classical Abdera]]

Abdera had flourished especially in ancient times mainly for two reasons: because of the large area of their territory and their highly strategic position. The city controlled two great road passages (one of Nestos river and other through the mountains north of Xanthi). Furthermore, from their ports passed the sea road, which from Troas led to the Thracian and then the Macedonian coast.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Samsaris, Historical  Geography of Western Thrace during the Roman Antiquity (in Greek), Thessaloniki 2005, p. 91-96&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins of the town may still be seen on Cape Balastra (40°56'1.02&quot;N 24°58'21.81&quot;E); they cover seven small hills, and extend from an eastern to a western harbor; on the southwestern hills are the remains of the medieval settlement of Polystylon.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

===Modern===
The municipality Abdera was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of three former municipalities that became municipal units: Abdera, [[Selero]], and [[Vistonida]].&lt;ref name=Kallikratis&gt;[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikratis.pdf Kallikratis law] Greece Ministry of Interior {{in lang|el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The municipality has an area of 352.047&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the municipal unit 161.958&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=stat01&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |publisher=National Statistical Service of Greece |title=Population &amp; housing census 2001 (incl. area and average elevation) |language=el |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921212047/http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00098%20.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipal unit Abdera is subdivided into the communities Abdera, [[Mandra, Xanthi|Mandra]], [[Myrodato]] and [[Nea Kessani]]. The community Abdera consists of the settlements Abdera, [[Giona, Xanthi|Giona]], Lefkippos, [[Pezoula]] and Skala.
