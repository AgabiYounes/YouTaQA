{{wtp|-ware#Etymology 2|-ware}}

'''Adware''', or '''advertising-supported software''', is [[software]] that generates revenue for its developer by automatically generating [[Online advertising|online advertisements]] in the user interface of the software or on a screen presented to the user during the installation process. The software may generate two types of revenue: one is for the display of the advertisement and another on a &quot;[[pay-per-click]]&quot; basis, if the user clicks on the advertisement. The software may implement advertisements in a variety of ways, including a static box display, a banner display, full screen, a [[video]], [[pop-up ad]] or in some other form.

The 2003 ''Microsoft Encyclopedia of Security'' and some other sources use the term &quot;adware&quot; differently: &quot;any software that installs itself on your system without your knowledge and displays advertisements when the user browses the Internet&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;MS-Enc-Sec&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., a form of [[malware]].

Some software developers offer their software free of charge, and rely on revenue from advertising to recoup their expenses and generate income. Some also offer a version of the software at a fee without advertising.

The software's functions may be designed to analyze the user's location and which Internet sites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there.

== Advertising-supported software ==
In legitimate software, the advertising functions are integrated into or bundled with the program. Adware is usually seen by the developer as a way to recover development costs, and to generate revenue. In some cases, the developer may provide the software to the user free of charge or at a reduced price. The income derived from presenting advertisements to the user may allow or motivate the developer to continue to develop, maintain and upgrade the software product.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnetfeature&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/feature-ad-supported-software-1339291796/|title=Feature: Ad-supported software|first=David|last=Braue|date=4 September 2008|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of advertising-supported software in business is becoming increasingly popular, with a third of [[information technology|IT]] and business executives in a 2007 survey by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] planning to be using ad-funded software within the following two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;informationweek&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/businesses-warm-to-no-cost-ad-supported-software-/d/d-id/1054803|title=Businesses Warm To No-Cost, Ad-Supported Software|last=Hayes Weier|first=Mary|date=5 May 2007|work=[[Information Week]]|accessdate=4 December 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808025452/http://www.informationweek.com/businesses-warm-to-no-cost-ad-supported-software-/d/d-id/1054803|archive-date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisement-funded software is also one of the [[business models for open-source software]].

=== Application software ===
Some software is offered in both an advertising-supported mode and a paid, advertisement-free mode. The latter is usually available by an online purchase of a license or registration code for the software that unlocks the mode, or the purchase and download of a separate version of the software.{{efn|For example, in 2007 [[Microsoft]] changed its productivity suite [[Microsoft Works]] to be advertising-supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-works-to-become-a-free-ad-funded-product/604|title=Microsoft Works to become a free, ad-funded product|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|date=30 July 2007|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works was subsequently replaced with the [[Microsoft Office 2010]] software suite operating in a &quot;starter&quot; mode that included advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-adds-an-office-starter-edition-to-its-distribution-plans/4197|title=Microsoft adds an 'Office Starter' edition to its distribution plans|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|date=9 October 2009|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2012}}, this product is also being phased out and replaced with [[Office Online]] (formerly Office Web Apps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-begins-phasing-out-starter-edition-of-its-office-suite/13001|title=Microsoft begins phasing out Starter edition of its Office suite|first=Mary Jo|last=Foley|date=21 June 2012|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some software authors offer advertising-supported versions of their software as an alternative option to business organizations seeking to avoid paying large sums for software licenses, funding the development of the software with higher fees for advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Ad-supported-software-reaches-specialized-audience-3501806.php|title=Ad-supported software reaches specialized audience|first=Ari|last=Levy|date=23 April 2012|newspaper=[[SF Gate]]|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of advertising-supported software include [[Adblock Plus]] (&quot;Acceptable Ads&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads|title=Allowing acceptable ads in Adblock Plus|website=adblockplus.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of the [[Internet telephony]] application [[Skype]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itnews.com.au/News/250426,skype-now-free-ad-supported-software.aspx|title=Skype now free ad-supported software|first=Liam|last=Tung|date=11 March 2011|publisher=iT News for Australian Business|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Amazon Kindle#Kindle 3|Amazon Kindle 3]] family of [[e-reader|e-book readers]], which has versions called &quot;Kindle with Special Offers&quot; that display advertisements on the home page and in sleep mode in exchange for substantially lower pricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kindle, Wi-Fi, Graphite, 6&quot; Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology&amp;nbsp;— includes Special Offers &amp; Sponsored Screensavers|url=https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Special-Offers-Wireless-Reader/dp/B004HFS6Z0|work=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Microsoft]] and its advertising division, [[Microsoft Advertising]],{{efn|Formed in 2008 following Microsoft's acquisition of digital marketing company [[aQuantive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/msn/factsheet/MSAdTimeline.mspx|title=Microsoft Advertising Historical Timeline|date=September 2008|publisher=Microsoft Advertising|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} announced that [[Windows 8]], the major release of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, would provide built-in methods for software authors to use advertising support as a business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advertising.microsoft.com/ads-in-apps |title=Windows 8 Ads in Apps |publisher=Microsoft Advertising |accessdate=20 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121192941/http://advertising.microsoft.com/ads-in-apps |archivedate=21 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.advertising.microsoft.com/msa/en/global/b/blog/archive/2012/10/01/windows-8-ads-in-apps-concepts-agency-partners-advertising-week-2012.aspx|title=Microsoft Advertising Unveils New Windows 8 Ads in Apps Concepts with Agency Partners at Advertising Week 2012|last=Kim|first=Stephen|date=1 October 2012|website=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927224909/http://community.advertising.microsoft.com/msa/en/global/b/blog/archive/2012/10/01/windows-8-ads-in-apps-concepts-agency-partners-advertising-week-2012.aspx|archive-date=27 September 2013|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea had been considered since as early as 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5951569.html|title=Microsoft eyes making desktop apps free|last=Fried|first=Ina|date=14 November 2005|newspaper=[[CNET]]|accessdate=20 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124140201/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5951569.html|archivedate=24 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software as a service ===
Support by advertising is a popular business model of [[software as a service]] (SaaS) on the [[World Wide Web|Web]]. Notable examples include the email service [[Gmail]]&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnetfeature&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teeter|first=Ryan|title=Google Apps For Dummies|isbn=978-1-118-05240-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5TUv9jCaJdwC&amp;pg=SA3-PA27|author2=Karl Barksdale|pages=3–27|date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[G Suite|Google Apps]] (now G Suite) products,&lt;ref name=&quot;informationweek&quot;/&gt; and the social network [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/|title=Facebook's Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010|author= by Jolie O'Dell 203|date=17 January 2011|website=[[Mashable]]|publisher=Mashable.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Womack |first=Brian |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html |title=Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=20 September 2011 |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has also adopted the advertising-supported model for many of its [[social software]] SaaS offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/meet-microsoft-the-advertising-company/419|title=Meet Microsoft, the advertising company|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|date=3 May 2007|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Microsoft Office Live]] service was also available in an advertising-supported mode.&lt;ref name=&quot;informationweek&quot;/&gt;

In the view of [[Federal Trade Commission]] staff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/os/2005/03/050307spywarerpt.pdf|title=FTC Staff Report. Monitoring Software on Your PC: Spyware, Adware, and Other Software|last=Majoras|first=Deborah Platt|date=March 2005|website=|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=4 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; there appears to be general agreement that software should be considered &quot;[[spyware]]&quot; only if it is downloaded or installed on a computer without the user's knowledge and consent. However, unresolved issues remain concerning how, what, and when consumers need to be told about software installed on their computers for consent to be adequate. For instance, distributors often disclose in an [[EULA|end-user license agreement]] that there is additional software bundled with primary software, but some panelists and commenters did not view such disclosure as sufficient to infer consent to the installation of the bundled software.

== Malware ==
The term ''adware'' is frequently used to describe a form of [[malware]] (malicious software)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/keep-a-clean-machine/malware-and-botnets|title=Malware &amp;amp; Botnets|author=[[National Cyber Security Alliance]]|publisher=StaySafeOnline.org|quote=The terms 'spyware' and 'adware' apply to several different [malware] technologies...|accessdate=4 December 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213043120/http://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/keep-a-clean-machine/malware-and-botnets|archivedate=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/itsecurity/basics/malicious-software/ |title=Viruses and other forms of malicious software |date=5 July 2012 |publisher=[[Princeton University]] Office of Information Technology |quote=malware also includes worms, spyware and adware. |accessdate=4 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224024932/http://www.princeton.edu/itsecurity/basics/malicious-software/ |archivedate=24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which presents unwanted advertisements to the user of a computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spywareloop.com/news/adware|title=Adware in SpyWareLoop.com|author=Vincentas|date=11 July 2013|newspaper=Spyware Loop|accessdate=27 July 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323203234/http://www.spywareloop.com/news/adware|archivedate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/securitycenter/spyware-glossary#Adware|title=Malware from A to Z|publisher=[[Lavasoft]]|quote=[Adware] delivers advertising content potentially in a manner or context that may be unexpected and unwanted by users.|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisements produced by adware are sometimes in the form of a [[Pop-up ad|pop-up]] or sometimes in an &quot;unclosable window&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-day/glossary/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320110430/http://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-day/glossary/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 March 2013 |title=Data Privacy Day Glossary |author=[[National Cyber Security Alliance]] |publisher=StaySafeOnline.org |quote=Adware: type of malware that allows popup ads on a computer system, ultimately taking over a user's Internet browsing. |accessdate=4 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the term is used in this way, the severity of its implication varies. While some sources rate adware only as an &quot;irritant&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.rm.com/TechnicalArticle.asp?cref=TEC276510|title=Spyware, Adware and Malware&amp;nbsp;— Advice for networks and network users|website=|publisher=[[RM Education]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=4 December 2012|quote=[Adware] tend[s] to be more of an irritant than do actual damage to your system, but [is] an unwanted presence nonetheless.}}&lt;/ref&gt; others classify it as an &quot;online threat&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/about/news/2008/20080916_120000_y.aspx |title=McAfee, Inc.

Programs have been developed to detect, quarantine, and remove advertisement-displaying malware, including [[Ad-Aware]], [[Malwarebytes (software)|Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware]], [[Spyware Doctor]] and [[Spybot – Search &amp; Destroy]]. In addition, almost all commercial [[antivirus software]] currently detect adware and spyware, or offer a separate detection module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/security/expert/honeycutt_spyware.mspx|title=How to protect your computer from Spyware and Adware|last=Honeycutt|first=Jerry|date=20 April 2004|work=Microsoft.com|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207042601/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/security/expert/honeycutt_spyware.mspx|archive-date=7 February 2006|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new wrinkle is adware (using stolen certificates) that disables anti-malware and virus protection; technical remedies are available.&lt;ref name=&quot;vonteera&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/latest-adware-disables-antivirus-software-152920421.html|title=Latest adware disables antivirus software|last1=Casey|first1=Henry T.|authorlink1=Henry T.

Adware has also been discovered in certain low-cost [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, particularly those made by small Chinese firms running on [[Allwinner Technology|Allwinner]] [[System on a chip|systems-on-chip]]. There are even cases where adware code is embedded deep into files stored on the system and boot partitions, to which removal involves extensive (and complex) modifications to the [[firmware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CMtrojan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cmcm.com/blog/en/security/2015-11-09/838.html|title=Decompile: Technical analysis of the Trojan|date=9 November 2015|publisher=[[Cheetah Mobile]]|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
