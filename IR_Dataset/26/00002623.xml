The '''Aegadian Islands ''' ({{lang-it|Isole Egadi}}; {{lang-scn|Ìsuli Ègadi}}, {{lang-la|Aegates Insulae}}; {{lang-gr|Aἰγάται Νῆσοι||the islands of goats}}) are a group of five small mountainous islands in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] off the northwest coast of [[Sicily]], [[Italy]], near the cities of [[Trapani]] and [[Marsala]], with a total area of {{convert|37.45|km2|sqmi|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Egadi-Islands Egadi Islands | islands, Italy | Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Favignana#Island|Island of Favignana]] (''Aegusa''), the largest, lies {{convert|16|km|mi}} southwest of Trapani; [[Levanzo]] (''Phorbantia'') lies {{convert|13|km|mi}} west; and [[Marettimo]], the ancient ''Hiera Nesos'', {{convert|24|km|mi}} west of Trapani, is now reckoned as a part of the group. There are also two minor islands, [[aaFormica|Formica]] and [[Maraone]], lying between Levanzo and Sicily. For administrative purposes the archipelago constitutes the [[Favignana|comune of Favignana]] in the [[Province of Trapani]].

The overall population in 2017 was 4,292.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://demo.istat.it/pop2017/index.html | title = Geo Demo | publisher = Istat | access-date = April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter frost is unknown and rainfall is low. The main occupation of the islanders is fishing, and the largest [[tuna]] fishery in Sicily is there.

==History==
There is evidence of [[Neolithic]] and even [[Paleolithic]] paintings in caves on Levanzo, and to a lesser extent on Favignana.

The islands were the scene of the [[Battle of the Aegates]] of 241&amp;nbsp;BC, in which the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] fleet was defeated by the Roman fleet led by [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus|Lutatius Catulus]]; the engagement ended the [[First Punic War]]. After the end of [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] power in the first millennium AD, the islands, to the extent that they were governed at all, were part of territories of [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Saracens]], before the [[Normans]] fortified Favignana in 1081.

The islands belonged to the Pallavicini-Rusconi family of [[Genoa]] until 1874, when the [[Florio]] family of [[Palermo]] bought them.
