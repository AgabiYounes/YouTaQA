An '''antacid''' is a substance which [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralizes]] [[gastric acid|stomach acidity]] and is used to relieve [[heartburn]], [[indigestion]] or an upset stomach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overviewcookie&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Dyspepsia and Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease: Investigation and Management of Dyspepsia, Symptoms Suggestive of Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease, or Both|last=Internal Clinical Guidelines Team. (UK)|first=|date=2014|publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK)|year=|isbn=|series=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence: Clinical Guidelines|location=London|pages=|pmid=25340236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
Antacids are available [[over the counter]] and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional [[heartburn]], the major symptom of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]] and [[indigestion]]. Treatment with antacids alone is [[Symptomatic treatment|symptomatic]] and only justified for minor symptoms.&lt;ref name=AHRQ&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality 23 September 2011 [http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/?pageaction=displayproduct&amp;productID=756 Consumer Summary – Treatment Options for GERD or Acid Reflux Disease: A Review of the Research for Adults] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011121858/http://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/index.cfm/search-for-guides-reviews-and-reports/?productid=756&amp;pageaction=displayproduct |date=2014-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antacids are distinct from acid-reducing drugs like [[H2 antagonist|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor antagonist]]s or [[proton pump inhibitor]]s and they do not kill the bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'', which causes most [[gastric ulcer|ulcers]].&lt;ref name=AHRQ/&gt;

Non-particulate antacids (sodium citrate, magnesium trisilicate) increase gastric pH with little or no effect on gastric volume.  Sodium citrate should be given within 1 hour of surgery to be the most effective.&lt;ref&gt;Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting and the Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration: Application to Healthy Patients Undergoing Elective Procedures: An Updated Report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Preoperative Fasting and the Use of Pharmacologic Agents to Reduce the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration. Anesthesiology. 2017 March; 126(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side effects==
Versions with magnesium may cause diarrhea, and brands with calcium or aluminium may cause constipation and rarely, long-term use may cause kidney stones. Long-term use of versions with aluminium may increase the risk for getting [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MedlinePlus&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, U.S. National Library of Medicine.

==Mechanism of action==
When excessive amounts of acids are produced in the stomach the natural mucous barrier that protects the lining of the stomach can damage the esophagus in people with [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|acid reflux]]. Antacids contain [[alkaline]] ions that [[Neutralization (chemistry)|chemically neutralize]] stomach [[gastric acid]], reducing damage and relieving pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overviewcookie&quot; /&gt;

==Formulations and brands==
Antacids may be formulated with other [[active pharmaceutical ingredient|active ingredients]] such as [[simethicone]] to control [[Flatulence|gas]] or [[alginic acid]] to act as a physical barrier to acid.&lt;ref&gt;IFFGD.

===Effervescents===
Effervescent tablets are tablets which are designed to dissolve in water, and then release a level of [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dubogrey|first1=Ilya|title=Putting the Fizz into Formulation|url=http://www.samedanltd.com/magazine/11/issue/204/article/3622|work=European Pharmaceutical Contractor|issue=Autumn|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130103012204/http://www.newdruginfo.com/pharmacopeia/bp2003/British%20Pharmacopoeia%20Volume%20III/Monographs/Formulated%20Preparations%20Genearal%20Monographs/TABLETS.htm British Pharmacopeia 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Pharmacopoeia 2006|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_s_sBKJNf184C|accessdate=1 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156301-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_s_sBKJNf184C/page/n993 966]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The common ingredients are [[citric acid]] and [[sodium bicarbonate]], which react when in contact with water to produce carbon dioxide. Effervescent antacids may also contain [[aspirin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alkaseltzer.ie/en/about-alka-seltzer/|title=Alka Seltzer Directions of use, Sodium &amp; Aspirin content - Alka Seltzer relief from Headaches, Migraine &amp; Upset stomach|work=alkaseltzer.ie|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429145428/http://www.alkaseltzer.ie/en/about-alka-seltzer/|archive-date=2015-04-29|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sodium carbonate]], or [[tartaric acid]].&lt;ref name=Blair&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last1 = Blair | first1 = G.

Well known brands are [[Alka-Seltzer]], [[Eno (drug)|Eno]] and [[Andrews (drug)|Andrews]].

===Algeldrate===

[[Image:Old aluminum tablets.JPG|160px|thumb|Wyeth amphojel tablets of aluminum hydroxide.]]
Under the generic name algeldrate, [[aluminium hydroxide]] is used as an antacid. Aluminium hydroxide is preferred over other alternatives such as [[sodium bicarbonate]] because Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, being insoluble, does not increase the pH of stomach above 7 and hence, does not trigger secretion of excess [[stomach acid]]. Brand names include Alu-Cap, Aludrox, Gaviscon, and Pepsamar.  In 2016 Gaviscon was one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £62 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A breakdown of the over-the-counter medicines market in Britain in 2016|url=http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/20202662.article|accessdate=29 May 2017|publisher=Pharmaceutical Journal|date=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It reacts with excess acid in the stomach, reducing the acidity of the stomach content,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Galbraith, A |author2=Bullock, S |author3=Manias, E |author4=Hunt, B. |author5=Richards, A. | year = 1999 | title = Fundamentals of pharmacology: a text for nurses and health professionals | location = Harlow | publisher = Pearson | pages = 482}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which may relieve the symptoms of ulcers, heartburn or dyspepsia. Such products can cause [[constipation]], because the aluminum ions inhibit the contractions of [[smooth muscle cells]] in the gastrointestinal tract, slowing [[peristalsis]] and lengthening the time needed for stool to pass through the colon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington1991&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Washington|first1=Neena|title=Antacids and Anti Reflux Agents|date=2 August 1991|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-0-8493-5444-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some such products are formulated to minimize such effects through the inclusion of equal concentrations of [[magnesium hydroxide]] or [[magnesium carbonate]], which have counterbalancing laxative effects.
