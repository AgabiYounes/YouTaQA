'''Abbas II Helmy Bey''' (also known as ''‘Abbās Ḥilmī [[Pasha]]'', {{lang-ar|عباس حلمي باشا}}) (14 July 1874&amp;nbsp;– 19 December 1944) was the last [[Khedive]] ([[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] viceroy) of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]], ruling from 8 January 1892 to 19 December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thorne|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|name=death|Sources give different dates for the deposition of Abbas. Some state that date as 20 or 21 December 1914.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1914, after the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], the nationalist Khedive was removed by the British, then ruling Egypt, in favor of his more pro-British uncle, [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]], marking the ''[[de jure]]'' end of Egypt's [[Ottoman Egypt|four-century era]] as a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which [[Ottoman conquest of Egypt|had begun]] in 1517.

==Early life==
Abbas II (full name: Abbas Hilmy), the great-great-grandson of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], was born in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] on 14 July 1874.&lt;ref name=rulers&gt;{{harvnb|Schemmel|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded his father, [[Tewfik Pasha]], as [[Khedive]] of Egypt and Sudan on 8 January 1892. In 1887 he was ceremonially [[Khitan (circumcision)|circumcised]] together with his younger brother Mohammed Ali Tewfik. The festivities lasted for three weeks and were carried out under great pomp. As a boy he visited the [[United Kingdom]], and he had a number of British tutors in Cairo including a governess who taught him English.&lt;ref name=eb1911&gt;{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a profile of Abbas II, the boys' annual, ''Chums'', gives a lengthy account of his education.{{sfn|Pemberton|1897|loc=Abbas II}} His father established a small school near the [[Abdin Palace]] in [[Cairo]] where European, Arab and Turkish masters taught Abbas and his brother [[Mohammed Ali Tewfik]]. An American officer in the Egyptian army took charge of his military training.  He attended school at [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]];&lt;ref name=Colliers&gt;{{harvnb|Vucinich|1997|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; then, at the age of twelve he was sent to the Haxius School in [[Geneva]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!--Probably in Chums (Pemberton) but needs checking as EB1911 does not mention Abdin Palace and places his Swiss school in Lausanne--&gt; in preparation for his entry into the [[Theresianum]] in [[Vienna]]. In addition to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he had good conversational knowledge of English, French and German.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt;&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt;

==Reign==
He was still in college in [[Vienna]] when he assumed the throne of the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] upon the sudden death of his father, 8 January 1892. He was barely of age according to Egyptian law; normally, eighteen in cases of succession to the throne.&lt;ref name=eb1911/&gt; For some time he did not cooperate very cordially with the [[United Kingdom|British]], whose army had occupied Egypt in 1882.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; As he was young and eager to exercise his new power, he resented the interference of the British Agent and Consul General in Cairo, Sir [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Baring]], later made [[Earl of Cromer|Lord Cromer]].&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; At the outset of his reign, Khedive Abbas II surrounded himself with a coterie of European advisers who opposed the British occupation of Egypt and Sudan and encouraged the young khedive to challenge Cromer by replacing his ailing prime minister with an Egyptian nationalist.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; At Cromer's behest, [[Lord Rosebery]], the British foreign secretary, sent Abbas II a letter stating that the Khedive was obliged to consult the British consul on such issues as cabinet appointments. In January 1894 Abbas II made an inspection tour of Sudanese and Egyptian frontier troops stationed near the southern border, the Mahdists being at the time still in control of the Sudan itself. At [[Wadi Halfa]] the Khedive made public remarks disparaging the Egyptian army units commanded by British officers.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; The British commander of the Egyptian army, Sir [[Herbert Kitchener]], immediately threatened to resign. Kitchener further insisted on the dismissal of a nationalist under-secretary of war appointed by Abbas II and that an apology be made for the Khedive's criticism of the army and its officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.B.|last=Tauris|pages=62–63|title=Kitchener Hero and Anti-Hero|isbn=1-85532-516-0|date=17 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1899 he had come to accept British counsels.&lt;ref name=Col/&gt; Also in 1899 British diplomat [[Alfred Mitchell-Innes]] was appointed Under-Secretary of State for Finance in Egypt, and in 1900 Abbas II paid a second visit to Britain, during which he said he thought the British had done good work in Egypt, and declared himself ready to cooperate with the British officials administering Egypt and Sudan. He gave his formal approval for the establishment of a sound system of justice for Egyptian nationals, a great reduction in taxation, increased affordable and sound education, the inauguration of the substantial irrigation works such as the [[Aswan Low Dam]] and the [[Assiut Barrage]], and the [[Anglo-Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1896-99|reconquest of Sudan]].&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; He displayed more interest in [[agriculture]] than in statecraft. His farm of cattle and horses at [[Qubbah]], near Cairo, was a model for [[agricultural science]] in Egypt, and he created a similar establishment at [[Montaza Palace|Muntazah]], just east of downtown [[Alexandria]]. He married the Princess [[Ikbal Hanem]] and had several children. [[Prince Muhammad Abdul Moneim|Muhammad Abdul Mun'im]], the heir-apparent, was born on 20 February 1899. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--For all the information in the paragraph--&gt;
[[File:Abbas II and George V aboard HMS Medina 1911.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Abbas II with King George V in 1911]]
Although Abbas II no longer ''publicly'' opposed the British, he secretly created, supported, and sustained the Egyptian nationalist movement, which came to be led by [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]]. He also funded the anti-British newspaper [[Al-Mu'ayyad (newspaper)|Al-Mu'ayyad]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; As Kamil's thrust was increasingly aimed at winning popular support for a National Party, Khedive Abbas publicly distanced himself from the Nationalists. Their demand for a constitutional government in 1906 was rebuffed by Abbas II, and the following year he formed the [[National Party (Egypt)|National Party]], led by [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha]], to counter the [[Umma Party (Egypt)|Ummah Party]] of the Egyptian moderates.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=stear&gt;{{harvnb|Stearns|2001|p=545}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in general, he had no real political power. When the Egyptian Army was sent to fight [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]] in [[Sudan]] in 1896, he only found out about it because the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Archduke Francis Ferdinand]] was in Egypt and told him after being informed of it by a British Army officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1968|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His relations with Cromer's successor, Sir [[Eldon Gorst]], however, were excellent, and they co-operated in appointing the cabinets headed by [[Boutros Ghali|Butrus Ghali]] in 1908 and [[Muhammad Said Pasha|Muhammad Sa'id]] in 1910 and in checking the power of the Nationalist Party. The appointment of Kitchener to succeed Gorst in 1912 displeased Abbas II, and relations between the Khedive and the British deteriorated. Kitchener, who exiled or imprisoned the leaders of the National party,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; often complained about &quot;that wicked little Khedive&quot; and wanted to depose him.

On 25 July 1914, at the onset of [[World War I]], Abbas II was in [[Constantinople]] and was wounded in his hands and cheeks during a failed assassination attempt. On 5 November 1914 when Great Britain declared war on [[Turkey]], he was accused of deserting [[Egypt]] by not returning home forthwith. The British also believed that he was plotting against their rule,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; as he had attempted to appeal to Egyptians and Sudanese to support the [[Central Powers]] against the British, so when the [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]], the United Kingdom declared Egypt a Sultanate under British [[protectorate|protection]] on 18 December 1914 and deposed Abbas II.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Magnusson|Goring|1990|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, Abbas II supported the Ottomans, including leading an attack on the [[Suez Canal]]. He was replaced by the British by his uncle [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] from 1914 to 1917, with the title of sultan.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=stear/&gt; Hussein Kamel issued a series of restrictive orders to strip Abbas II of property in Egypt and Sudan and forbade contributions to him. These also barred Abbas from entering Egyptian territory and stripped him of the right to sue in Egyptian courts. This did not prevent his progeny, however, from exercising their rights. Abbas II finally accepted the new order on 12 May 1931 and formally abdicated. He retired to [[Switzerland]], where he wrote ''The Anglo-Egyptian Settlement'' (1930). &lt;ref name=Col&gt;{{harvnb|Lagassé|2000|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Geneva]] on 19 December 1944, aged 70,&lt;ref name=Colliers/&gt; 30 years to the day after the end of his reign as khedive.{{refn|group = nb|name=death}}
