The '''Community acquis'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurovoc.europa.eu/210682 EuroVoc: Community acquis]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''acquis communautaire''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|iː|_|k|ə|ˈ|m|juː|n|ə|t|ɛər}}; {{IPA-fr|aˌki kɔmynoˈtɛːʁ|lang}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=acquis communautaire |publisher=collinsdictionary.com |author=Collins English Dictionary |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/acquis-communautaire |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called the '''EU acquis''' and often shortened to '''acquis''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;/&gt; is the accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions which constitute the body of [[European Union law]]. The term is French: ''acquis'' meaning &quot;that which has been acquired or obtained&quot;, and ''communautaire'' meaning &quot;of the community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudolf|first1=Uwe Jens|last2=Berg|first2=Warren G.|date=2010|title=Historical Dictionary of Malta|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=nwuUOVkaMB0C&amp;pg=PA22|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=22|isbn=9780810873902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapters==
During the process of the [[enlargement of the European Union]], the acquis was divided into 31 chapters for the purpose of negotiation between the EU and the candidate member states for the fifth enlargement (the ten that joined in 2004 plus [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] which joined in 2007). These chapters were:

#[[Free movement of goods]]

#[[Freedom to provide services]]

#[[Customs union]]

#[[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] (CFSP)

For the negotiations with [[Croatia]] (which joined in 2013), [[Iceland]], [[Turkey]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]] and in the future, with [[North Macedonia]], [[Albania]] ([[Future enlargement of the European Union#Recognised candidates|candidate countries]]), the acquis is split up into 35 chapters instead, with the purpose of better balancing between the chapters: dividing the most difficult ones into separate chapters for easier negotiation, uniting some easier chapters, moving some policies between chapters, as well as renaming a few of them in the process:

Such negotiations usually involved agreeing transitional periods before new member states needed to implement the laws of the European Union fully and before they and their citizens acquired full rights under the ''acquis''.

==Terminology==
The term ''acquis'' is also used to describe laws adopted under the [[Schengen Agreement]], prior to its integration into the European Union legal order by the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], in which case one speaks of the ''Schengen acquis''.

The term ''acquis'' has been borrowed by the [[World Trade Organization]] Appellate Body, in the case ''Japan &amp;ndash; Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages'', to refer to the accumulation of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) and WTO law (&quot;''acquis gattien''&quot;), though this usage is not well established.

It has been used to describe the achievements of the [[Council of Europe]] (an international organisation unconnected with the European Union):&lt;ref&gt;Section 12, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Resolution 1290&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Council of Europe's ''acquis'' in standard setting activities in the fields of democracy, the [[rule of law]] and fundamental human rights and freedoms should be considered as milestones towards the European political project, and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] should be recognised as the pre-eminent judicial pillar of any future architecture.}}

It has also been applied to the body of &quot;principles, norms and commitments&quot; of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osce.org/documents/sg/2004/06/3241_en.pdf Intervention by Ambassador Aleksi Härkönen, Permanent Representative of Finland to the OSCE], Annual Security Review Conference.
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Another question under debate has been how the Partners and others could implement the OSCE acquis, in other words its principles, norms, and commitments on a voluntary basis.}}

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) introduced the concept of the OECD Acquis in its &quot;Strategy for enlargement and outreach&quot;, May 2004.
