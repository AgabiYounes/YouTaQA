'''Áed mac Cináeda''' (died 878) was a son of [[Cináed mac Ailpín]]. He became king of the [[Picts]] in 877, when he succeeded his brother [[Constantín mac Cináeda]]. He was nicknamed '''Áed of the White Flowers''', '''the wing-footed''' ({{lang-la|alipes}}) or '''the white-foot''' ({{lang-la|albipes}}).

The ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'' says of Áed: &quot;Edus [Áed] held the same [i.e. the kingdom] for one year. The shortness of his reign has bequeathed nothing memorable to history. He was slain in the civitas of Nrurim.&quot; Nrurim is unidentified.

The [[Annals of Ulster]] say that in 878: &quot;Áed mac Cináeda, king of the Picts, was killed by his associates.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iAa6JoLgFRwC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%C3%81ed+mac+Cin%C3%A1eda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBmoVChMIqLHD_5vZxgIVBQ2SCh2kwgDZ#v=onepage&amp;q=%C3%81ed%20mac%20Cin%C3%A1eda&amp;f=false Calise, J. M. P., ''Pictish Sourcebook'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002] {{ISBN|9780313322952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition, reported by [[George Chalmers (antiquarian)|George Chalmers]] in his ''Caledonia'' (1807), and by the [[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|New Statistical Account]] (1834&amp;ndash;1845), has it that the early-historic mound of the Cunninghillock by [[Inverurie]] is the burial place of Áed. This is based on reading Nrurim as ''Inruriu''.

A longer account is interpolated in [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland''. This says that Áed reigned one year and was killed by his successor [[Giric]] in [[Strathallan]] and other king lists have the same report.

It is uncertain which, if any, of the ''[[Prophecy of Berchán]]'''s kings should be taken to be Áed. [[William Forbes Skene]] presumed that the following verses referred to Áed:&lt;blockquote&gt;129. Another king will take [sovereignty]; small is the profit that he does not divide. Alas for Scotland thenceforward. His name will be the Furious.&lt;br&gt;130. He will be but a short time over Scotland. The will be no [word uncertain] unplundered. Alas for Scotland, through the youth; alas for their books, alas for their bequests.&lt;br&gt;131. He will be nine years in the kingdom. I shall tell you&amp;mdash;it will be a tale of truth&amp;mdash;he dies without bell, with communion, at evening, in a fatal pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Charles|title=An Attempt to Decipher and Explain the Inscriptions on the Newton Stone|journal=Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|date=1886|volume=20|page=312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kO0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA312&amp;lpg=PA312&amp;dq=skene+berchan+aedh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nGx8Ag7tRY&amp;sig=oGofquwhP358OnMaJxchpBhhEnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwir-pmQlbjOAhXL5CYKHRnLBJUQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=skene&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Áed's son, [[Constantín mac Áeda]], became king in 900.
