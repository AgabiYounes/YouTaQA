'''Abbas Mirza''' ({{lang-fa|عباس میرزا}}; August 20, 1789{{snd}}October 25, 1833)&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] [[crown prince]] of [[Iran|Persia]]. He developed a reputation as a military commander during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)|Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813]] and the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)|Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828]], as well as through the [[Ottoman-Persian War (1821-1823)|Ottoman-Persian War of 1821-1823]]. He is furthermore noted as an early modernizer of [[Persia]]'s armed forces and institutions, and for his death before his father, [[Fath Ali Shah]]. Abbas was an intelligent prince, possessed some literary taste, and is noteworthy on account of the comparative simplicity of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abbas Mirza|volume=1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, with Abbas Mirza as the military commander of the Persian forces, Iran lost all of its territories in the [[Caucasus]] comprising [[Transcaucasia]] and parts of the [[North Caucasus]] ([[Dagestan]]) to Russia in conformity with the 1813 [[Treaty of Gulistan]] and the 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], following the outcomes of the 1804–1813 and 1826–1828 wars.

==Biography==
Abbas Mirza was born on August 20, 1789 in Nava, [[Mazandaran]]. He was a younger son of [[Fath Ali Shah]], but on account of his mother's royal birth was destined by his father to succeed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; Considered the favorite son by his father,&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{harvnb|Magnusson|Goring|1990|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was named governor (''beglarbeg'') of the [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] region of [[Persia]], in approximately 1798, when he was 10 years old.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} In 1801, three years after [[Agha Mohammad Khan]]'s death, the Russians capitalized on the moment, and annexed [[Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti|Kartli-Kakheti]]. As (Eastern) Georgia had been under intermittent Iranian suzerainty since the early 16th century, this act by the Russians was seen as intrusion into Iranian territory. In 1804, eager to take the rest of Iran's territories, the Russian army led by general [[Pavel Tsitsianov]], [[Battle of Ganja (1804)|besieged, captured and sacked]] the city of [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], thereby initiating the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]]. Fath-Ali Shah appointed Abbas Mirza as commander of the expeditionary force of 30,000 men.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} His aid was eagerly solicited by both England and [[Napoleon]], anxious to checkmate one another in the East,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; especially as Persia bordered a common rival, namely Imperial Russia. Preferring the friendship of France, Abbas Mirza continued the war against Russia's young [[General Kotlyarevsky]], aged only twenty-nine but his new ally could give him very little assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkirk, pp.60-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The early stages of the war following Fath Ali Shah's orders to invade and regain Georgia and the northern parts of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic ended up in years of relatively territorial stale warfare. However, as Prof. [[Alexander Mikaberidze]] adds, Abbas Mirza led the army in an overall disastrous campaign against the Russians, suffering defeats at [[Gyumri]], [[Kalagiri]], the [[Zagam River]] (1805), [[Karakapet]] (1806), [[Qarababa, Nakhchivan|Karababa]] (1808), [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] (1809), [[Meghri]], the [[Aras River]], and [[Akhalkalaki]] (1810).{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} The tide started to decisively turn as Russia was sending more and more advanced weaponry and increasing numbers of soldiers.  Commanding the southernmost Russian divisions during the long war, Kotlyarevsky defeated the numerically superior Persian army in the [[Battle of Aslanduz]] (1812) and in early 1813 [[Storming of Lankaran|stormed and took Lankaran]].  The Russians were encamped on the opposite bank of River Aras when his two British advisers Capt Christie and Lt Pottinger told him to post sentry pickets in short order, but Mirza ignored the warnings.  Christie and other British officers tried to rally an army retreating in panic; for days the Russians launched fierce assaults, but at last Christie fell, and Mirza ordered a full retreat.  Complacency cost 10,000 Persian lives; Mirza believing wrongly in the weight of superior numbers.  In spite of the absence of leadership, The Persians at Lenkoran held out for weeks, until breaking through the Russians slaughtered the garrison of 4,000 officers and men.

In October 1813, with Abbas Mirza still commander-in-chief, Persia was compelled to make a severely disadvantageous peace known as the [[Treaty of Gulistan]], irrevocably ceding swaths of its territory in the [[Caucasus]], comprising present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], and most of what most recently became the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy C. Dowling [https://books.google.nl/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA728&amp;dq=russo+persian+war+1804-1813&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QnOXVJXpCcz7UPevhPAK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=russo%20persian%20war%201804-1813&amp;f=false ''Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond''] p 728 ABC-CLIO, 2 dec. 2014 {{ISBN|1598849484}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only promise the Shah received in return was a lukewarm guarantee the Mirza would succeed to his throne, without let or hindrance.  Persia's dire losses attracted the attention of the British Empire; following the reversal of initial successes, the Russians now posed a serious threat from the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkirk, pp.65-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The drastic losses suffered by his forces made him realize that he needed to train Persia's military in the European style of war, and he started sending his students to Europe for military training.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} By introducing European-style regiments, Abbas Mirza believed it would enable Iran to gain the upper hand over Russia and to reclaim its lost territories.  {{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} Influenced by Sultan [[Selim III]]'s reforms, Abbas Mirza set out to create an Iranian version of the Ottoman ''[[Nizam-ı Cedid]]'', and reduce the Qajar dependence on tribal and provincial forces.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2011|page=2}} In 1811 and 1815, two groups were sent to Britain, and in 1812 a printing press was finished in [[Tabriz]] as a means to reproduce European military handbooks. Tabriz also saw a gunpowder factory and a munitions depot. The training continued with constant drilling by British advisers, with a focus on the infantry and artillery.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

[[File:Treaty_of_Turkmenchay_by_Moshkov.jpg|thumb|Abbas Mirza with [[Ivan Paskevich]] at the signing of the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]], 1828]]
He received his opportunity to test his newly reformed military when the [[Ottoman–Persian War (1821–1823)]] began, and they proved themselves adept with several victories. This resulted in a peace treaty signed in 1823 after the [[Battle of Erzurum (1821)|Battle of Erzurum]]. The war was a victory for Persia, especially considering they were outnumbered, and this gave much needed confidence to his forces. His [[Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828|second war with Russia]], which began in 1826, started off on a good note as he won back most of the territory lost in the [[Russo-Persian War (1804–13)]]; however it ended in a string of costly defeats after which Persia was forced to cede the last of its Caucasian territories, comprising all of what is modern day [[Armenia]], [[Nakhichevan Khanate|Nakhchivan]], the rest of the remainder of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic that was still in Iranian hands, and [[Igdir Province]], all conform the 1828 [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy C. Dowling [https://books.google.nl/books?id=KTq2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA728&amp;dq=russo+persian+war+1804-1813&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QnOXVJXpCcz7UPevhPAK&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=russo%20persian%20war%201804-1813&amp;f=false ''Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond''] p 729 ABC-CLIO, 2 dec. 2014 {{ISBN|1598849484}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual loss was due less to his and his armies skill and more to do with lack of reinforcements and overwhelming superiority in numbers. The irrevocable losses, which in total amounted up for all of Qajar Iran's territories in the [[North Caucasus]] and the [[South Caucasus]], affected Abbas Mirza severely and his health began to suffer. He also lost enthusiasm for any more military reform.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; In 1833, he sought to restore order in the province of [[Khorasan (Province)|Khorasan]], which was nominally under Persian supremacy, and while engaged in the task died at [[Mashhad]] in 1833. In 1834 his eldest son, [[Mohammed Mirza]], succeeded [[Fath Ali Shah]] as the next king.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;  R. G. Watson (History of Persia, 128-9) describes him as “the noblest of the Qajar race”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lockhart|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is most remembered for his valor in battle and his failed attempts to modernize the Persian army. He was not successful in part due to the lack of government centralization in Iran during the era. Furthermore, it was Abbas Mirza who first dispatched Iranian students to Europe for a western education.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clawson|Rubin|2005|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to prove successful in the long run in his wars with Russia as he ended up losing more territory than he gained.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;
