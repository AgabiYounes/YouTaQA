[[Image:Aeacus telemon.jpg|thumb|339x339px|''Aeacus and [[Telamon]]'' by [[Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune]].]]'''Aeacus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|ə|k|ə|s}}; also spelled '''Eacus'''; [[Ancient Greek]]: Αἰακός ''Aiakos'' or ''Aiacos'') was a [[Greek mythology|mythological]] king of the island of [[Aegina]] in the [[Saronic Gulf]].

== Family ==
Aeacus was the son of [[Zeus]] by [[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]], a daughter of the river-god [[Asopus]], and thus, brother of [[Damocrateia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Pindar]], Olympian Ode 9, 107&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts, his mother was [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]] and thus possible brother to [[Minos]], [[Rhadamanthus]] and [[Sarpedon (brother of Minos)|Sarpedon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Schmitz|first=Leonhard|title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]|year=1867|author-link=|volume=1|pages=22–23|contribution=Aeacus|contribution-url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0031.html|place=Boston|publisher=|editor-last=Smith|editor-first=William}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare Plato, ''Gorgias'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0178%3Atext%3DGorg.%3Asection%3D524a 524a]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the father of [[Peleus]], [[Telamon]] and [[Phocus]] and was the grandfather of the [[Trojan War|Trojan war]] warriors [[Achilles]] and [[Telemonian Ajax]]. In some accounts, Aeacus had a daughter called [[Alcimache]] who bore [[Medon]] to [[Oileus]] of [[Locris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on ''[[Iliad]]'', 13. 694&lt;/ref&gt; Aeacus’ sons Peleus and Telamon were jealous of Phocus and killed him. When Aeacus learned about the murder, he exiled Peleus and Telamon. &lt;ref&gt;Roman, L., &amp; Roman, M.

==Mythology==

=== Birth and early days ===
Aeacus was born on the island of Oenone or Oenopia, where Aegina had been carried by Zeus to secure her from the anger of her parents; afterward, this island became known as [[Aegina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6&quot;&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' iii. 12. § 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] ii. 29. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;comp. Nonn. Dionys. vi. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vi. 113, vii. 472, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some traditions related that, at the time when Aeacus was born, [[Aegina]] was not yet inhabited, and that Zeus either changed the ants ({{lang|grc|μύρμηκες}}) of the island into  the men ([[Myrmidons]]) over whom Aeacus ruled, or he made the men grow up out of the earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''Fragm.'' 67, ed. Gottling&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''l.c.''&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ovid]], on the other hand, supposed that the island was not uninhabited at the time of the birth of Aeacus, instead stating that during the reign of Aeacus, [[Hera]], jealous of Aegina, ravaged the island bearing the name of the latter by sending a plague or a fearful [[dragon]] into it, by which nearly all its inhabitants were carried off. Afterward, Zeus restored the population by changing the ants into men.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vii. 520&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;comp. Hygin. ''Fab.'' 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], viii. p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;{{Greek myth (Hades)}}These legends seem to be a mythical account of the colonization of Aegina, which seems to have been originally inhabited by [[Pelasgians]], and afterwards received colonists from [[Phthiotis]], the seat of the Myrmidons, and from [[Phlius]] on the [[Asopus]].  While he reigned in Aegina, Aeacus was renowned in all Greece for his justice and piety, and was frequently called upon to settle disputes not only among men, but even among the gods themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian Odes'' viii. 48, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], i. 39. § 5&lt;/ref&gt;  He was such a favourite with the latter, that when Greece was visited by a [[drought]] as a consequence of a murder that had been committed, the oracle of Delphi declared that the calamity would not cease unless Aeacus prayed to the gods to end it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], iv. 60, 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Aeacus prayed, and as a result, the drought ceased. Aeacus then demonstrated his gratitude by erecting a temple to ''Zeus Panhellenius'' on Mount Panhellenion,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 30. § 4&lt;/ref&gt; and afterward, the Aeginetans built a sanctuary on their island called Aeaceum, which was a square temple enclosed by walls of white marble.  Aeacus was believed in later times to be buried under the altar of this sacred enclosure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pausanias, ii. 29. § 6&quot;&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 29. § 6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later adventures ===
A legend preserved in [[Pindar]] relates that [[Apollo]] and [[Poseidon]] took Aeacus as their assistant in building the walls of Troy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Olympian Odes'' viii. 39, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the work was completed, three [[dragon]]s rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Thereafter, Apollo prophesied that [[Troy]] would fall at the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the [[Aeacidae]] (i.e. his sons Telamon and Peleus joined [[Heracles]] when he sieged the city during Laomedon's rule. Later, his great grandson Neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse).

Aeacus was also believed by the Aeginetans to have surrounded their island with high cliffs in order to protect it against [[piracy|pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ii. 29. § 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other incidents connected to the story of Aeacus are mentioned by [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vii. 506, &amp;c., ix. 435, &amp;c&lt;/ref&gt;  By [[Endeïs]] Aeacus had two sons, [[Telamon]] (father of [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] and [[Teucer]]) and [[Peleus]] (father of [[Achilles]]), and by [[Psamathe (Nereid)|Psamathe]] a son, [[Phocus of Aegina|Phocus]], whom he preferred to the former two sons, both of whom conspired to kill Phocus during a contest, and then subsequently fled from their native island.

=== In the afterlife ===

After his death, Aeacus became one of the three judges in [[Hades]] (along with the [[Minoan Crete|Cretan]] brothers Rhadamanthus and Minos)&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' xiii. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''Carmen'' ii. 13. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[Plato]], was specifically concerned with the shades of Europeans upon their arrival to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]]. ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]],'' ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0178%3Atext%3DGorg.%3Asection%3D524a p.524a]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Isocrates]], ''Evag.'' 5&lt;/ref&gt;  In works of art he was depicted bearing a sceptre and the keys of Hades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollodorus, iii. 12. § 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Isthmian Odes'' viii. 47, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aeacus had sanctuaries in both [[Athens]] and in [[Aegina]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Pausanias, ii. 29. § 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesychius of Miletus|Hesychius]] ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schol. ''ad Pind. Nem.'' xiii. 155&lt;/ref&gt; and the Aeginetans regarded him as the tutelary deity of their island by celebrating the [[Aeacea]] in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]], ''Nemean Odes'' viii. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Frogs]]'' (405 BC) by [[Aristophanes]], [[Dionysus]] descends to [[Hades]] and proclaims himself to be Heracles. Aeacus, lamenting the fact that [[Heracles]] had stolen [[Cerberus]], sentences [[Dionysus]] to [[Acheron]] to be tormented by the hounds of [[Cocytus]], the [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], the Tartesian eel, and Tithrasian Gorgons.

[[Alexander the Great]] traced his ancestry through his mother to Aeacus.
