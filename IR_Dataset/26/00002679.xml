'''Abd ar-Rahman IV Mortada''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الرحمن المرتضى|ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān al-Murtaḍā}}) was the [[Caliph of Córdoba]] in the [[Umayyad]] dynasty in [[Al-Andalus]], succeeding [[Sulayman ibn al-Hakam]], in 1018. That same year, he was murdered at [[Cadiz]] while fleeing from a battle in which he had been deserted by the very supporters which had brought him into power. His brief reign was similar to that of [[Abd ar-Rahman V|Abd ar-Rahman V Mostadir]].
