'''Abdülhamid I''', '''Abdul Hamid I''' or '''Abd Al-Hamid I''' ({{lang-ota|عبد الحميد اول}}, ''`Abdü’l-Ḥamīd-i evvel''; {{lang-tr|Birinci Abdülhamit}}; 20 March 1725 – 7 April 1789)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; was the 27th  [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]], reigning over the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1774 to 1789.

==Early life==
He was born on 20 March 1725 in Constantinople, a younger son of Sultan [[Ahmed III]] (reigned 1703&amp;ndash;1730) and his consort [[Şermi Kadın]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicmanuscripts.info/reference/books/Derman-2002-Sabanci/Derman-2002-Sabanci-145-160.pdf|title=27. Osmanlı padişahı Sultan I. Abdülhamid'in eserleri|author=Derman Sabancı|date=2002|publisher=Islamic Manuscripts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed III abdicated in favor of his nephew [[Mahmud I]], who was succeeded by his brother [[Osman III]], and Osman&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; by Ahmed's elder son [[Mustafa III]]. As a potential heir to the throne, Abdul Hamid was imprisoned in comfort by his cousins and older brother, as was customary. This lasted until 1767. During this period, he received his early education from his mother Rabia Şermi, who taught him history and [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt;

==Reign==
===Accession===
On the day of Mustafa's death on 21 January 1774 , Abdul Hamid ascended to the throne with a ceremony held in the palace.  The next day  Mustafa III's funeral procession was held. The new sultan sent a letter to the Grand Vizier and Serdar-ı Ekrem Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha on the front and informed him to continue his duty.  On 27 January 1774, the sword was armed in Eyup Sultan.  At the time, the Ottoman-Russian front wars continued, the army was at once, and there was a shortage of food in Istanbul. {{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=349}}

===Rule===
Abdul Hamid's long imprisonment had left him indifferent to state affairs and malleable to the designs of his advisors.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Yet he was also very religious and a [[pacifism|pacifist]] by nature. At his accession the financial straits of the treasury were such that the usual donative could not be given to the [[Janissary]] Corps. The new Sultan told the Janissaries &quot;There are no longer gratuities in our treasury, as all of our soldier sons should learn.&quot;

[[File:TurkischeHauptArmeeHochenleitterBGHistory.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ottoman Army]] advances from [[Sofia]], its largest garrison in [[Rumelia]], in the year 1788.]]

Abdul Hamid now sought to reform the Empire's armed forces. He enumerated the Janissary corps and tried to renovate it, and also the navy. He established a new artillery corps. He was also credited with the creation of the Imperial Naval Engineering School.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Abdul Hamid tried to strengthen Ottoman rule over [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]], [[Eyalet of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Ottoman Iraq|Iraq]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; However, slight successes against rebellions in Syria and the [[Morea]] could not compensate for the loss of the [[Crimean Peninsula]], which had become nominally independent in 1774, but was in practice now controlled by Russia.

Russia repeatedly exploited its position as protector of Eastern Christians to interfere in the Ottoman Empire, and explicitly. Finally the Ottomans declared [[Russo-Turkish War (1787–92)|war against Russia in 1787]]. [[Austro-Turkish War (1787–91)|Austria soon joined Russia]]. Turkey held its own in the conflict, at first, but on 6 December 1788, [[Siege of Ochakov (1788)|Ochakov fell to Russia]] (all of its inhabitants being massacred). It is said that this sad defeat broke Abdul Hamid's spirit, as he died four months later.

In spite of his failures, Abdul Hamid was regarded as the most gracious Ottoman Sultan.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} He personally directed the [[fire brigade]] during the Constantinople fire of 1782. He was admired by the people for his religious devotion, and was even called a ''Veli'' (&quot;saint&quot;). He also outlined a reform policy, supervised the government closely, and worked with statesmen.

==Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca==
Despite his pacific inclinations, the Ottoman Empire was forced to renew [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)|the ongoing war]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]] almost immediately. This led to [[Battle of Kozludzha|complete Turkish defeat at Kozludzha]] and the humiliating [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]], signed on 21 July 1774. The Ottomans ceded territory to Russia, and also the right to intervene on behalf of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]s in the Empire.

With the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, the territory left, as well as Russia's ambassador at Istanbul level and an authorized representative, this ambassador's participation in other ceremonies at the state ceremonies, the right to pass through the Straits to Russia, as the envoys of the Russian envoy were given immunity.  Marketing opportunities for all kinds of commodities in Istanbul and other ports, as well as the full commercial rights of England and France were given.  It was also in the treaty that the Russian state had a church built in Ga lata.  Under the circumstances, this church would be open to the public, referred to as the Russo-Greek Church, and forever under the protection of Russian ambassadors in Istanbul. {{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=350}}

===Relations with Tipu Sultan===
In 1789, [[Tipu Sultan]], ruler of the [[Sultanate of Mysore]] sent an embassy to Abdul Hamid, urgently requesting assistance against the [[British East India Company]], and proposed an offensive and defensive alliance. Abdul Hamid informed the Mysori ambassadors that the Ottomans were still entangled and exhausted from the ongoing war with Russia and Austria.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}


==Personal life==
He wrote down the troubles he saw before, to the grand vizier or to the governor of his empire.  He accepted the invitations of the  and his grand vizier and went to his mansions, followed by the reading of Quran.  He was humble and a religious Sultan.{{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=353}} 

It is known that Abdul Hamid I was fond of his children, was interested in family life, spent the summer months in Karaağaç, Beşiktaş with his consorts, daughters and sons.  His daughter Esma Sultan's dressing styles, her passion for entertainment, her journey to the objects with her journeymen and concubines have set an example for Istanbul ladies. {{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=357}}

===Architecture===
Among the works brought in Istanbul by Abdul Hamid I the Hamidiye İrem. Again, in the Hamidiye Tomb, which is named after him, some of the dynasty members of his descendants are visual.  The fountain, which complemented the complex, was moved to Sogukcesrne.

The reconstruction, madrasa and library have been constructed.  Around 1500 manuscripts in his library are still in the Süleymaniye Library.  In Beylerbeyi, on behalf of his mother Şermi Kadın, he built a mosque with a mosque and a sanctuary on the plot of the Cardigan-i Şerif room of the former Beylerbeyi Palace, as well as a fountain in Çınarönü, Havuzbaşı, Araba Meydam and Kısıklı, and a mosque in Ernirgan.  hamarn and shops have established a fountain in İstinye and Dolrnabahçe on the Rumeli side of the Bosphorus. {{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=356}}

In 1784, the School of Employment was put into operation, and in these schools, Gelbevi İsmail, Kasapzade İbrahim gave lectures besides their masters and French experts and la Fayette. {{sfn|Sakaoğlu|2015|p=356}}

==Death==
[[File:MausoleumAbdulHamid I.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tomb of Abdul Hamid I]] in [[Eminönü]] quarter of [[Fatih|Fatih, Istanbul]].]]
Abdul Hamid died on 7 April 1789, at the age of sixty-four, in Constantinople. He was buried in Bahcekapi, a [[Tomb of Abdul Hamid I|tomb he had built for himself]].

He bred [[Arabian horse]]s with great passion. One breed of Küheylan Arabians was named &quot;Küheylan Abdülhamid&quot; after him.
