==Etymology==
The name '''Afyon Kara Hisar''' (literally ''opium black castle'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), since [[opium]] was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Afyonkarahisar|title=Afyonkarahisar {{!}} Turkey|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known simply as '''Afyon'''. Older spellings include '''Karahisar-i Sahip''', '''Afium-Kara-hissar''' and '''Afyon Karahisar'''. The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the [[Turkish Parliament]] in 2004.

==History==
[[File:15th century map of Turkey region.jpg|thumb|Photo of a 15th-century map showing region containing Nicopolis]]

The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time. It was known to the [[Hittites]] as '''Hapanuwa''', and was later occupied by [[Phrygians]], [[Lydians]] and [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persians]] until it was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. After the death of Alexander the city (now known as  '''Akroinοn''' (Ακροϊνόν) or '''Nikopolis''' (Νικόπολις) in [[Ancient Greek]]), was ruled by the [[Seleucids]] and the kings of [[Pergamon]], then [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. The [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] after his [[Battle of Akroinon|victory]] over [[Arab]] besiegers in 740 renamed the city '''Nicopolis''' (Greek for &quot;city of victory&quot;). The [[Seljuq Turks]] then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to '''Kara Hissar''' (&quot;black castle&quot;) after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201&amp;nbsp;meters above the town. Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the [[Sâhib Ata]] and then the [[Germiyanids]].

The castle was much fought over during the [[Crusades]] and was finally conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Beyazid I]] in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of [[Timur Lenk]] in 1402. It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.

The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city. In 1902, a fire burning for 32 hours destroyed parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - Turkish town burnt |day_of_week=Monday |date=1 September 1902 |page_number=4 |issue=36861| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock. During the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] campaign (part of the [[Turkish War of Independence]])  Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by Greek forces. However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region. After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.

The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name ''Afyon'') until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the US in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased.  Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime.  They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the [[poppy straw]] method of extraction.&lt;ref&gt;https://fco-stage.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/pdf20/fco_adidu_licitcultivation{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afyon was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927-1938.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=2009-06-03 }}.

==Economy==
The economy of Afyonkarahisar is based on agriculture, industries and thermal tourism. 
Especially its agriculture is strongly developed from the fact, a large part of its population living in the countrysides. Which stimulated agricultural activities greatly.

===Marble===
Afyonkarahisar produces an important chunk of Turkish processed marbles, it ranks second on processed marble exports and fourth on travertine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Belkıs ÖZKAR|title=mermer sektöründe katma degerin ve ihracatin artirilmasi|url=http://www.zafer.org.tr/jdownloads/Raporlar%20%20Strateji%20Belgeleri/mermer-sektorunde-katma-degerin-ve-ihracatin-artirilmasi.pdf|page=29|access-date=2016-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810175332/http://www.zafer.org.tr/jdownloads/Raporlar%20%20Strateji%20Belgeleri/mermer-sektorunde-katma-degerin-ve-ihracatin-artirilmasi.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dilsad Erkek |title=Mermer ve Traverten Sektörüne Küresel ve Bölgesel Yaklaşım |url=http://geka.gov.tr/Dosyalar/o_19v5e0ki7134g6no139s7pj10658.pdf|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afyon holds an important share of Turkish marble reserves, with some 12,2% of total Turkish reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sevgi Gürcan|title=Türkiye ve Afyon'da mermer sektörünün gelisim trendi, Kocatepe University|url=http://www.maden.org.tr/resimler/ekler/24d21019de5e59d_ek.pdf|page=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nuran Tasligil|title=Die Analyse der als Baumaterial genutzten, Marmara University|url=http://e-dergi.marmara.edu.tr/marucog/article/viewFile/5000172507/5000155571|page=619|access-date=2016-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919041022/http://e-dergi.marmara.edu.tr/marucog/article/viewFile/5000172507/5000155571|archive-date=2016-09-19|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afyon has unique marble types and colors, which were historically very renown and are unique to Afyon. Like &quot;Afyon white&quot;, historically known as &quot;Synnadic white&quot;. &quot;Afyon Menekse&quot;, historically known as &quot;Pavonazzetto&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara E. Borg|title=A Companion to Roman Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DS-PCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=bath-gymnasium+pavonazzetto&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=157|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Afyon kaplan postu&quot;, this type was not popular.
Historically marble from Afyon was generally referred to as &quot;Docimeaen marble&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strabo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo|title=Geography|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D5%3Asection%3D16}} &quot;Book 9, chapter 5, section 16&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
Docimian marble was highly admired and valued for its unique colors and fine grained quality, by ancients such as Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donato Attanasio |title=Ancient White Marbles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08gOUB2qRcQC&amp;dq=docimian+marble+church&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=154|year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Romans took control over Docimian quarries, they were blown away about the beautiful color combinations of Docimian Pavonazzetto, which is a type of white marble with purple veins. A trend started about it right away. Emperors Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian, all made extensive use of Docimian marble to all their major building projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donato Attanasio |title=Ancient White Marbles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08gOUB2qRcQC&amp;dq=ancient+white+marbles&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|page=157|year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Strabo|title=Geography|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0198%3Abook%3D12%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D14}} Book 12, 8, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Docimian Pavonazzetto was extensively used in major building projects in the very heart of Rome aka Forum Romanum and all over the empire. Pavonazzetto was used on the most eye catching places such as, columns, wall and floor veneer and wall reliefs. Other marbles from all corners of the empire were used in combination, whenever Pavonazzetto was used as floor cover, it was usually in combination with other decorative marbles. But, the Pavonazzetto being a white marble was mostly the dominant color and gave the buildings a freshening white color.    
[[File:Pantheon11111.jpg|thumb|right|Pantheon, Rome. White Docimian marble is used on the floor and some of the columns such as the two protruding columns of the main apse. The white Docimian color on the floor is very dominant.]]
