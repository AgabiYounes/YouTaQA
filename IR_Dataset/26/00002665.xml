In many legal jurisdictions related to [[English law#Common law|English common law]], '''affray''' is a [[public order]] offence consisting of the fighting of one or more persons in a public place to the terror (in {{lang-fr|à l'effroi}}) of ordinary people.  Depending on their actions, and the laws of the prevailing jurisdiction, those engaged in an affray may also render themselves liable to prosecution for [[assault]], [[riot act|unlawful assembly]], or [[riot]]; if so, it is for one of these offences that they are usually charged.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;&quot;Affray&quot;, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===
The [[common law offence]] of affray was abolished&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/9 section 9(1)]&lt;/ref&gt; for [[England and Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], section 42&lt;/ref&gt; on 1 April 1987.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986 (Commencement No. 2) Order 1987]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/198/article/2/made article 2] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1987/198/schedule/made Schedule] (1987/198 (C. 4))&lt;/ref&gt;  Affray is now a statutory offence that is [[triable either way]]. It is created by section 3 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] which provides:
{{Blockquote|{{unbulleted list
|(1) A person is guilty of affray if he uses or threatens unlawful violence towards another and his conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety.
|(2) Where 2 or more persons use or threaten the unlawful violence, it is the conduct of them taken together that must be considered for the purposes of subsection (1).
|(3) For the purposes of this section a threat cannot be made by the use of words alone.
|(4) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.
|(5) Affray may be committed in private as well as in public places.
|(6) ... [Repealed]
|(7) A person guilty of affray is liable on [[conviction]] on [[indictment]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or a fine or both, or on [[summary conviction]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]] or both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/3 Digitised copy] of section 3 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]] from [[Legislation.gov.uk]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

The term &quot;violence&quot; is defined by section 8.{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

Section 3(6) once provided that a constable could arrest without warrant anyone he reasonably suspected to be committing affray, but that subsection was repealed by paragraph 26(2) of Schedule 7 to, and Schedule 17 to, the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]], which includes more general provisions for police to make arrests without warrant.

The ''[[mens rea]]'' of affray is that person is guilty of affray only if he intends to use or threaten violence or is aware that his conduct may be violent or threaten violence.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/6 section 6(2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence of affray has been used by [[HM Government]] to address the problem of drunken or violent individuals who cause serious trouble on [[airliner]]s.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

In ''[[Common purpose#Controversy|R v Childs &amp; Price]]'' (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/gerard-childs-stephen-price-cleared-8721065|title=Gerard Childs and Stephen Price cleared of Prescot retail park murder of Jonathan Fitchett on appeal|last=Pattinson|first=Rob|date=25 February 2015|work=Liverpool Echo|publisher=Trinity Mirror Merseyside|access-date=18 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R v Childs &amp; Price 2015: as yet unreported&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal quashed a murder verdict and replaced it with affray, having dismissed an allegation of common purpose.

===Northern Ireland===
Affray is a serious offence for the purposes of Chapter 3 of the [[Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2008/1216/article/12 article 12(2)] and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2008/1216/schedule/1 Schedule 1], paragraph 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In [[New South Wales]], section 93C of the Crimes Act of 1900 defines that a person will be guilty of affray if he or she threatens unlawful violence towards another and his or her conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety.&lt;ref&gt;See also Colosimo and Ors v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2005] NSWSC 854 (25 August 2005) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/2005/854.html AustLII]&lt;/ref&gt; A person will only be guilty of affray if the person intends to use or threaten violence or is aware that his or her conduct may be violent or threaten violence.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 93D(2) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s93d.html AustLII]&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for an offence of affray contrary to section 93C is a period of imprisonment of 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 93C(1) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s93c.html AustLII]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Queensland]], section 72 of the Criminal Code of 1899&lt;ref&gt;Schedule 1 to the [[Criminal Code Act 1899]] (Qld)&lt;/ref&gt; defines affray as taking part in a fight in a public [[highway]] or taking part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access.  This definition is taken from that in the English [[Criminal Code]] Bill of 1880, cl. 96.  Section 72 says &quot;Any person who takes part in a fight in a public place, or takes part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access, commits a misdemeanour. Maximum penalty—1 year’s imprisonment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf &quot;Criminal Code Act 1899&quot;], retrieved 22 July 2009 from the website of the Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
The [[Indian Penal Code]] (sect. 159) adopts the old English common law definition of affray, with the substitution of &quot;actual disturbance of the [[Queen's peace|peace]] for causing terror to the ''[[wikt:liege|lieges]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] affray has been codified as &quot;fighting in a public place&quot; by section 7 of the  [[Summary Offences Act 1981]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0113/latest/DLM53522.html Section 7. Fighting in public place] in ''Summary Offences Act 1981''. legislation.govt.nz13 January 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
Under the [[Roman-Dutch law]] in force in [[South Africa]] affray falls within the definition of ''[[vis publica]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;

==United States &amp; Canada==
In the United States &amp; Canada the English common law as to affray applies, subject to certain modifications by the [[statute]]s of particular states/provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bishop&quot;&gt;Bishop, ''American Criminal Law'' 8th ed., 1892, vol. i. sec.  535&lt;/ref&gt;
