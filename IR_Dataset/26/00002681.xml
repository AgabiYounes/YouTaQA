'''Abdülaziz''' ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: عبد العزيز / ''ʻAbdü'l-ʻAzīz'', {{lang-tr|Abdülaziz}}; 8 February 1830{{snd}}4 June 1876) was the 32nd [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and reigned between 25 June 1861 and 30 May 1876.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; He was the son of Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and succeeded his brother [[Abdulmejid I]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Born at Eyüp Palace, Constantinople (present-day [[Istanbul]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]: ''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''&lt;/ref&gt; on 8 February 1830, Abdülaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West. He was the first Ottoman Sultan who travelled to [[Western Europe]], visiting a number of important European capitals including [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Vienna]] in the summer of 1867.

Apart from his passion for the [[Ottoman Navy]], which had the world's third largest fleet in 1875 (after the British and French navies), the Sultan took an interest in documenting the Ottoman Empire. He was also interested in literature and was a talented [[classical music]] composer. Some of his compositions, together with those of the other members of the [[Ottoman dynasty]], have been collected in the album ''European Music at the Ottoman Court'' by the London Academy of Ottoman Court Music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/European-Music-at-Ottoman-Court/dp/B0000542KD ''European Music at the Ottoman Court'', London Academy of Ottoman Court Music.] CD album released on 6 November 2000. ASIN: B0000542KD.&lt;/ref&gt; He was deposed on grounds of mismanaging the Ottoman economy on 30 May 1876, and was found dead six days later under unnatural and mysterious circumstances.

==Early life==
[[File:Sultan Abdulaziz I.JPG|thumb|185px|left|A portrait of Abdülaziz]]

His parents were [[Mahmud II]] and [[Pertevniyal Sultan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dantrogers/pafg1639.htm Daniel T. Rogers, &quot;All my relatives: Valide Sultana Partav-Nihal&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[:tr:Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]]--&gt; (1812–1883), originally named Besime, a [[Circassians|Circassian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osmanli700.gen.tr/english/sultans/32index.html His profile in the Ottoman Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 Pertevniyal was residing at [[Dolmabahçe Palace]]. That year Abdülaziz took the visiting [[Eugénie de Montijo]], Empress of France, to see his mother. Pertevniyal considered the presence of a foreign woman within her private quarters of the [[seraglio]] to be an insult. She reportedly [[Slapping (strike)|slapped]] Eugénie across the face, which almost caused an international incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1840.htm &quot;Women in Power&quot; 1840-1870, entry:  &quot;1861-76 Pertevniyal Valide Sultan of The Ottoman Empire&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to another account, Pertevniyal was outraged by the forwardness of Eugénie in taking the arm of one of her sons while he gave a tour of the palace garden, and she gave the Empress a slap on the stomach as a possibly more subtly intended reminder that they were not in France.{{sfn|Duff|1978|page=191}} 

The [[Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque]] was built under the patronage of his mother. The construction work began in November 1869 and the mosque was finished in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=monument;ISL;tr;Mon01;30;en|title=Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque Complex|publisher=Discover Islamic Art|access-date=26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His paternal grandparents were Sultan [[Abdul Hamid I]] and Sultana [[Nakşidil Sultan]]. Several accounts identify his paternal grandmother with [[Aimée du Buc de Rivéry]], a cousin of [[Empress Joséphine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jwh/17.2/isomverhaaren.html Christine Isom-Verhaaren, &quot;Royal French Women in the Ottoman Sultans' Harem: The Political Uses of Fabricated Accounts from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-first Century&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025090840/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jwh/17.2/isomverhaaren.html |date=25 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pertevniyal was a sister of Khushiyar Qadin, third wife of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]].

==Reign==
[[File:Territorial changes of the Ottoman Empire 1862.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1862]]

Between 1861 and 1871, the [[Tanzimat]] reforms which began during the reign of his brother [[Abdulmejid I]] were continued under the leadership of his chief ministers, [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha]] and [[Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha|Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha]]. [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire#Administrative reform, 1864|New administrative districts (''vilayets'')]] were set up in 1864 and a [[Council of State]] was established in 1868.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Public education was organized on the [[Education in France|French model]] and [[Istanbul University]] was reorganised as a modern institution in 1861.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; He was also integral in establishing the first Ottoman civil code.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Abdülaziz cultivated good relations with the [[Second French Empire]] and the [[British Empire]]. In 1867 he was the first Ottoman sultan to visit [[Western Europe]];&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; his trip included a visit to the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)]] in Paris and a trip to the United Kingdom, where he was made a [[List of Knights and Ladies of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] by [[Queen Victoria]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abd-ul-Aziz|volume=1|page=35|noicon=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shown a [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#Queen Victoria|Royal Navy Fleet Review]] with [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]]. He travelled by a private rail car, which today can be found in the [[Rahmi M. Koç Museum]] in Istanbul. His fellow Knights of the Garter created in 1867 were [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond]], [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland]], [[Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort]], [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] (a son of Queen Victoria), [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] and [[Alexander II of Russia]].

Also in 1867, Abdülaziz became the first Ottoman [[Sultan]] to formally recognize the title of [[Khedive]] (Viceroy) to be used by the [[Wāli|Vali]] (Governor) of the [[Egypt Eyalet|Ottoman Eyalet of Egypt and Sudan]] (1517–1867), which thus became the autonomous [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt and Sudan]] (1867–1914). [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] and his descendants had been the governors (Vali) of Ottoman Egypt and Sudan since 1805, but were willing to use the higher title of Khedive, which was unrecognized by the Ottoman government until 1867. In return, the first Khedive, [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]], had agreed a year earlier (in 1866) to increase the annual tax revenues which Egypt and Sudan would provide for the Ottoman treasury.&lt;ref name=OttomanDebt&gt;[http://www.mevzuatdergisi.com/2006/04a/03.htm Mevzuat Dergisi, Yıl: 9, Sayı: 100, Nisan 2006: &quot;Osmanlı İmparatorluğu'nda ve Türkiye Cumhuriyeti'nde Borçlanma Politikaları ve Sonuçları&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1854 and 1894,&lt;ref name=OttomanDebt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lausanne18&gt;[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Article 18 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]&lt;/ref&gt; the revenues from Egypt and Sudan were often declared as a [[surety]] by the Ottoman government for borrowing loans from British and French banks.&lt;ref name=OttomanDebt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lausanne18/&gt; After the Ottoman government declared a [[sovereign default]] on its foreign debt repayments on 30 October 1875,&lt;ref name=OttomanDebt/&gt; which triggered the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] in the empire's Balkan provinces that led to the devastating [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] and the establishment of the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] in 1881,&lt;ref name=OttomanDebt/&gt; the importance for Britain of the sureties regarding the Ottoman revenues from Egypt and Sudan increased.&lt;ref name=Lausanne18/&gt; Combined with the much more important [[Suez Canal]] which was opened in 1869, these sureties were influential in the British government's decision to [[History of Egypt under the British|occupy Egypt and Sudan]] in 1882, with the pretext of helping the Ottoman-Egyptian government to put down the [[ʻUrabi Revolt]] (1879–1882). Egypt and Sudan (together with [[Cyprus Convention|Cyprus]]) nominally remained Ottoman territories until 5 November 1914,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lausanne17-21&quot;&gt;[http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne Articles 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]&lt;/ref&gt; when the British Empire declared war against the Ottoman Empire during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lausanne17-21&quot;/&gt;

In 1869,  Abdülaziz received visits from [[Eugénie de Montijo]], Empress consort of [[Napoleon III of France]] and other foreign monarchs on their way to the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. The [[Prince of Wales]], the future [[Edward VII]], twice visited Istanbul.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Sultan tombs Divan Yolu March 2008.JPG|thumb|left|The ''[[türbe]]'' (mausoleum) of Sultan [[Mahmud II]] (his father) on Divan Yolu street, where Abdülaziz is also buried.]]

By 1871 both [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha]] and [[Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha|Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha]] were dead.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; The Second French Empire, his Western European model, had been defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] by the [[North German Confederation]] under the leadership of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Abdülaziz turned to the [[Russian Empire]] for friendship, as unrest in the Balkan provinces continued. In 1875, the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]] was the beginning of further unrest in the Balkan provinces. In 1876, the [[April Uprising]] saw insurrection spreading among the [[Bulgarians]]. Ill feeling mounted against Russia for its encouragement of the rebellions.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

While no one event led to his being deposed, the crop failure of 1873 and his lavish expenditures on the [[Ottoman Navy]] and on new palaces which he had built, along with mounting public debt, helped to create an atmosphere conducive to his being overthrown. Abdülaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 May 1876.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

== Death ==

Abdülaziz's death at [[Çırağan Palace]] in Istanbul a few days later was documented as a suicide at the time,&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Palace of Topkapi in Istanbul| url=https://archive.org/details/palaceoftopkapii00davi| url-access=registration| last=Davis| first=Claire| year=1970| pages=[https://archive.org/details/palaceoftopkapii00davi/page/222 222]| publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons| location=New York| id=ASIN B000NP64Z2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but suspicions of [[murder]] promptly erupted.

[[File:Victor Masson, Mort d'Abdülaziz, 1876.jpg|left|thumb|Abdülaziz's death in 1876 by Victor Masson |205x205px]]
On the morning of June 5, Abdülaziz asked for a pair of scissors with which to trim his beard.  Shortly after this he was found dead in a pool of blood flowing from two wounds in his arms. His body was examined by 17 physicians (&quot;Dr. Marco, Nouri, A. Sotto, Physician attached to the Imperial and Royal Embassy of Austria‐Hungary; Dr. Spagnolo, Marc Markel, Jatropoulo, Abdinour, Servet, J. de Castro, A. Marroin, Julius Millingen, C. Caratheodori; E. D. Dickson, Physician of the British Embassy; Dr. O. Vitalis, Physician of the Sanitary Board; Dr. E. Spadare, J. Nouridjian, Miltiadi Bey, Mustafa, Mehmed&quot;) who certified that the death had been “caused by the loss of blood produced by the wounds of the blood‐vessels at the joints of the arms” and that “the direction and nature of the wounds, together with the instrument which is said to have produced them, lead us to conclude that suicide had been committed.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Ali Haydar Midhat Bey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ali Haydar Midhat Bey|title=The Life Of Midhat Pasha|date=1903|publisher=JOHN MURRAY|location=London|pages=89–90|url=https://archive.org/stream/lifemidhatpasha00mithgoog/lifemidhatpasha00mithgoog_djvu.txt|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of those physicians also stated that “His skin was very pale, and entirely free from bruises, marks or spots of any kind whatever. There was no lividity of the lips indicating suffocation nor any sign of pressure having been applied to the throat.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Dicskon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dickson|first1=E.

In [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdulhamid II]]'s recently surfaced memoirs, the event is described as an assassination by the order of [[Hüseyin Avni Pasha]] and [[Midhat Pasha]]. According to this source, when [[Murad V|Sultan Murad V]] began to show signs of paranoia, madness and continuous fainting and vomiting even on the day of his coronation and threw himself into a pool yelling at his guards to protect his life, they were afraid the public would become outraged and revolt to bring the former Sultan back. Within a few days, on 4 June 1876, they arranged for Sultan Abdülaziz to kill himself with scissors, cutting his wrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sultan Abdülhamid'in Hatıra Defteri| last=Bozdağ| first=İsmet| year=2000| pages=223| publisher=Pınar Yayınları| location=İstanbul| ISBN=9753520344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==

Steam Navigation Company]].]]
[[File:Hasan Rami Pasha.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Admiral [[Hasan Rami Pasha]] supported the sultan's modernizing efforts.]]
* Abdülaziz gave special emphasis on modernizing the [[Ottoman Navy]]. In 1875, the Ottoman Navy had 21 battleships and 173 warships of other types, ranking as the third largest navy in the world after the British and French navies. His passion for the Navy, ships and sea can be observed in the wall paintings and pictures of the [[Beylerbeyi Palace]] on the [[Bosphorus]] [[strait]] in [[Istanbul]], which was constructed during his reign. However, the large budget for modernizing and expanding the Navy (combined with a severe drought in 1873 and incidents of flooding in 1874 which damaged Ottoman agriculture and reduced the government's tax revenues) contributed to the financial difficulties which caused the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] to declare a [[sovereign default]] with the &quot;Ramazan Kanunnamesi&quot; on 30 October 1875. The subsequent decision to increase agricultural taxes for paying the [[Ottoman public debt]] to foreign creditors (mainly British and French banks) triggered the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] in the empire's Balkan provinces, which culminated in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] that devastated the already struggling Ottoman economy, and the establishment of the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]] in 1881, during the early years of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdülhamid II]]'s reign.
* The first Ottoman railroads were opened between [[İzmir]]–[[Aydın]] and [[Alexandria]]–[[Cairo]] in 1856, during the reign of Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]]. The first large railway terminal within present-day Turkey, the [[İzmir Alsancak Terminal|Alsancak Terminal]] in [[Izmir]], was opened in 1858. However, these were individual, unconnected railroads, without a railway network. Sultan Abdülaziz established the first Ottoman railway networks. On 17 April 1869, the concession for the [[Chemins de fer Orientaux|Rumelia Railway]] (i.e. Balkan Railways, [[Rumelia|''Rumeli'' (Rumelia)]] meaning the [[Balkans|Balkan peninsula]] in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]) which connected [[Istanbul]] to [[Vienna]] was awarded to Baron [[Maurice de Hirsch]] (Moritz Freiherr Hirsch auf Gereuth), a Bavaria-born banker from Belgium. The project foresaw a railway route from [[Istanbul]] via [[Edirne]], [[Plovdiv]] and [[Sarajevo]] to the shore of the [[Sava|Sava River]]. In 1873, the first [[İstanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci Terminal]] in Istanbul was opened. The temporary Sirkeci terminal building was later replaced with the current one which was built between 1888 and 1890 (during the reign of [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdülhamid II]]) and became the final destination terminus of the [[Orient Express]]. In 1871, Sultan Abdülaziz established the [[Chemins de Fer Ottomans d'Anatolie#Ottoman Government Railways (1871-1888)|Anatolia Railway]]. Construction works of the {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}} on the Asian side of Istanbul, from [[Haydarpaşa]] to [[Pendik]], began in 1871. The line was opened on 22 September 1872.&lt;ref name=CFOA&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/History/CFOA CFOA History] - Trains and Railways of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt; The railway was extended to [[Gebze]], which opened on 1 January 1873. In August 1873 the railway reached [[Izmit]]. [[Chemin de Fer Moudania Brousse|Another railway extension]] was built in 1871 to serve a populated area along [[Bursa]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Anatolia Railway was then extended to [[Ankara]] and eventually to [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]] and [[Arabia]] during the reign of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdülhamid II]], with the completion of the [[Baghdad Railway]] and [[Hejaz Railway]].
* Under his reign, [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey#Tughra issue|Turkey's first postage stamps]] were issued in 1863, and the Ottoman Empire joined the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1875 as a founding member.
* He also was responsible for the first [[civil code]] for the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;
* He was the first Ottoman sultan who travelled to [[Western Europe]]. His voyage in visiting order (from 21 June 1867 to 7 August 1867): [[Istanbul]] – [[Messina]] – [[Naples]] – [[Toulon]] – [[Marseille]] – [[Paris]] – [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] – [[Dover]] – [[London]] – [[Dover]] – [[Calais]] – [[Brussels]] – [[Koblenz]] – [[Vienna]] – [[Budapest]] – [[Orșova]] – [[Vidin]] – [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] – [[Varna]] – [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=AbdulazizVoyage&gt;[http://blog.milliyet.com.tr/sultan-abdulaziz---avrupa-seyahati/Blog/?BlogNo=367847 Voyage of Sultan Abdülaziz to Europe (21 June 1867{{snd}}7 August 1867)]&lt;/ref&gt;
