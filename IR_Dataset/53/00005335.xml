Transport infrastructure within [[Chad]] is generally poor, especially in the north and east of the country.  River transport is limited to the south-west corner. As of 2011 Chad had no railways though two lines are planned - from the capital to the Sudanese and Cameroonian borders.during the [[wet season]], especially in the southern half of the country.  In the north, roads are merely tracks across the [[desert]] and [[land mine]]s continue to present a danger.  Draft animals ([[horse]]s, [[donkey]]s and [[camel]]s) remain important in much of the country.

Fuel supplies can be erratic, even in the south-west of the country, and are expensive. Elsewhere they are practically non-existent.

== Railways ==
{{main|Rail transport in Chad}}
As of 2011 Chad had no railways. Two lines were planned to Sudan and Cameroon from the capital, with construction expected to start in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Highways ==
As at 2018 Chad had a total of 44,000&amp;nbsp;km of roads of which approximately 260&amp;nbsp;km are paved.&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt; Some, but not all of the roads in the capital [[N'Djamena]] are paved. Outside of N'Djamena there is one paved road which runs from [[Massakory]] in the north, through N'Djamena and then south, through the cities of [[Guélengdeng]], [[Bongor]], [[Kélo, Chad|Kélo]] and [[Moundou]], with a short spur leading in the direction of [[Kousseri]], Cameroon, near N'Djamena.  Expansion of the road towards Cameroon through [[Pala, Chad|Pala]] and [[Léré, Chad|Léré]] is reportedly in the preparatory stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Logistics Assesments Reports Handbook: Strategic Transportation and Customs Information for Selected Countries |date=Feb 15, 2008 |publisher=Internatioin Business Pubns USA |pages=125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0x3TrjmWAsMC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=Cameroon+through+Pala+and+L%C3%A9r%C3%A9+road+expansion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lVrDoE-teF&amp;sig=ACfU3U0yX6-xPypJdGHSTrC5J5HODefZZQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjn9YSWwKnmAhXKMd8KHeAaBXEQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cameroon%20through%20Pala%20and%20L%C3%A9r%C3%A9%20road%20expansion&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waterways ==
Most rivers flow but intermittently. On the [[Chari River|Chari]], between N’Djamena and [[Lake Chad]], transportation is possible all year round. In September and October, the [[Logone River|Logone]] is navigable between N’Djamena and [[Moundou]], and the [[Chari River|Chari]] between N’Djamena and Sarh. Total waterways cover 4,800&amp;nbsp;km (3,000&amp;nbsp;mi), of which 2,000&amp;nbsp;km (1,250&amp;nbsp;mi) are navigable all year.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

As at  2012, Chari and Logone Rivers were navigable only in wet season (2002).  Both flow northwards, from the south of Chad, into [[Lake Chad]].&lt;ref name=CIA /&gt;

==Pipelines==
Since 2003, a 1,070&amp;nbsp;km pipeline has been used to export [[crude oil]] from the [[oil field]]s around [[Doba, Chad|Doba]] to offshore oil-loading facilities on [[Cameroon]]'s [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast at [[Kribi]].&lt;ref&gt;

The [[CIA World Factbook]] however cites only 582km of pipeline in Chad itself as at 2013.&lt;ref name=CIA /&gt;

== Seaports and harbors ==
None ([[landlocked]]).

Chad's main routes to the sea are:{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* From [[N'Djamena]] and the south west of Chad:
** By road to [[Ngaoundéré]], in Cameroon, and then by rail to [[Douala]]
** By road to [[Maiduguri]], in [[Nigeria]], and then by rail to [[Port Harcourt]]
* From the north and east of Chad:
** By road across the [[Sahara]] desert to [[Libya]]

In colonial times, the main access was by road to [[Bangui]], in the [[Central African Republic]], then by river boat to [[Brazzaville]], and onwards by rail from Brazzaville to [[Pointe Noire]], on [[Republic of Congo|Congo's]] [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. This route is now little used.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

There is also a route across [[Sudan]], to the [[Red Sea]], but very little trade goes this way.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Links with [[Niger]], north of Lake Chad, are practically nonexistent; it is easier to reach Niger via Cameroon and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0x3TrjmWAsMC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=Links+with+Niger,+north+of+Lake+Chad,+are+practically+nonexistent;+it+is+easier+to+reach+Niger+via+Cameroon+and+Nigeria&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lVlFiC-niD&amp;sig=ZCoajyeGYcaD9f7DZQTFgGA3vS0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO17vHtf_YAhXGv48KHbeDCXsQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Links%20with%20Niger,%20north%20of%20Lake%20Chad,%20are%20practically%20nonexistent;%20it%20is%20easier%20to%20reach%20Niger%20via%20Cameroon%20and%20Nigeria&amp;f=false|title=Global Logistics Assessments Reports Handbook: Strategic Transportation and Customs Information for Selected Countries|last=USA|first=Internatioin Business Pubns|date=2008-02-15|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9780739766033|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} {{dead link|date=February 2018}}

== Airports ==
{{See also|List of airports in Chad}}
{{As of|2012}} Chad had an estimated 58 airports, only 9 of which had paved runways.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA-WFB&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air Tchad]] (60 percent state owned) provides internal service to 12 locations but suffers from lack of fuel and equipment. The international airport at N’Djamena was damaged in fighting in 1981, but is now served by several international carriers including [[Air Afrique]], which is partly owned by Chad. Another major airport, developed as a military staging area, is located at [[Sarh]]. In 2015, scheduled airlines in Chad carried approximately 28,332 passengers on domestic and international flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chad Transportation |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cd.html |website=CIA World Factbook |accessdate=14 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
