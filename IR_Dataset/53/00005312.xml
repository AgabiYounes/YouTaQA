'''''The Consolation of Philosophy''''' ({{lang-la|De consolatione philosophiae}}) is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by the Roman statesman [[Boethius]], written around the year 524. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West on [[Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] [[Christianity]], as well as the last great Western work of the Classical Period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Consolation of Philosophy (Oxford World's Classics)'', Introduction (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dante Divine&quot;&gt;[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] placed Boethius the “last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics” among the doctors in his Paradise (see ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'') (see also below).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{quote|A golden volume not unworthy of the leisure of [[Plato]] or [[Cicero|Tully]] — &lt;small&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Consolation of Philosophy'' was written in AD 523 during a one-year imprisonment Boethius served while awaiting trial – and eventual execution – for the alleged crime of [[treason]] under the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] King [[Theodoric the Great]]. Boethius was at the very heights of power in [[Ostrogothic Italy|Rome]], holding the prestigious office of ''[[magister officiorum]]'', and was brought down by treachery. This experience inspired the text, which reflects on how evil can exist in a world governed by God (the problem of [[theodicy]]), and how happiness is still attainable amidst fickle fortune, while also considering the nature of happiness and God. It has been described as &quot;by far the most interesting example of [[prison literature]] the world has ever seen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02610b.htm ''Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius'']. The quote is commonly seen in a number of sources, but without attribution; the Catholic Encyclopedia article (by William Turner, 1907) is the oldest “known” citation found. In fact the phrase is originally from [[iarchive:boethiusanessay00stewuoft|''Boethius, an essay'']] (1891), by [[H. F. Stewart]], [https://archive.org/stream/boethiusanessay00stewuoft#page/107/mode/1up page 107] (last paragraph).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethius writes the book as a conversation between himself and Lady Philosophy. Lady Philosophy consoles Boethius by discussing the transitory nature of fame and wealth (&quot;no man can ever truly be secure until he has been forsaken by Fortune&quot;), and the ultimate superiority of things of the mind, which she calls the &quot;one true good&quot;. She contends that happiness comes from within, and that virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperilled by the vicissitudes of fortune.

Boethius engages questions such as the nature of [[predestination]] and [[free will]], why [[Problem of evil|evil men often prosper and good men fall into ruin]], [[human nature]], [[virtue]], and [[justice]]. He speaks about the nature of free will and [[determinism]] when he asks if God knows and sees all, or does man have free will. On human nature, Boethius says that humans are essentially good and only when they give in to “wickedness” do they “sink to the level of being an animal.” On justice, he says criminals are not to be abused, rather treated with sympathy and respect, using the analogy of doctor and patient to illustrate the ideal relationship between prosecutor and criminal.

In the ''Consolation'', Boethius answered religious questions without reference to Christianity, relying solely on natural philosophy and the Classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] tradition. He believed in the correspondence between faith and reason. The truths found in Christianity would be no different from the truths found in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Chadwick |first=Henry |editor=Edward Craig |encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Boethius, Anicius Manlius Severinus (c.480-525/6) |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |quote=The ''Opuscula sacra'' regard faith and reason as independent but parallel and compatible ways of attaining to higher metaphysical truths, and the independent validity of logical reasoning is also an underlying presupposition throughout ''De consolatione''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Henry Chadwick, &quot;If the ''Consolation'' contains nothing distinctively Christian, it is also relevant that it contains nothing specifically pagan either...[it] is a work written by a Platonist who is also a Christian.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chadwick, ''Boethius: The Consolations of Music, Logic, Theology and Philosophy'', 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-826549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethius repeats the [[Macrobius]]' model of the [[Earth]] in the center of a spherical cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;S.C. McCluskey, ''Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1998), pp. 114, 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is through Boethius that much of the thought of the Classical period was made available to the Western Medieval world. It has often been said Boethius was the “[[last of the Romans]] and the first of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dante Divine&quot; /&gt;

The philosophical message of the book fits well with the religious piety of the Middle Ages. Readers were encouraged not to seek worldly goods such as money and power, but to seek internalized virtues. Evil had a purpose, to provide a lesson to help change for good; while suffering from evil was seen as virtuous. Because God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beck&quot;&gt;Sanderson Beck (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Ages, with their vivid sense of an overruling fate, found in Boethius an interpretation of life closely akin to the spirit of Christianity. ''The Consolation of Philosophy'' stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the pagan philosophy of [[Seneca the Younger]] and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by [[Thomas à Kempis]].&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', [http://www.bartleby.com/211/0605.html Volume I Ch.6.5: ''De Consolatione Philosophiae''], 1907–1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is heavily influenced by [[Plato]] and his [[Socratic dialogue|dialogues]] (as was Boethius himself).&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt; Its popularity can in part be explained by its [[Neoplatonic]] and Christian ethical messages, although current scholarly research is still far from clear exactly why and how the work became so vastly popular in the Middle Ages.

Translations into the [[vernacular]] were done by famous notables, including [[King Alfred]] ([[Old English language|Old English]]), [[Jean de Meun]] ([[Old French]]), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[Middle English]]), [[Queen Elizabeth I]] ([[Early Modern English]]), and [[Notker Labeo]] ([[Old High German]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cropp|first=Glynnis M.|date=2012-01-01|title=Boethius in Medieval France: Translations of the De consolatione philosophiae and Literary Influence|url=https://brill.com/view/book/edcoll/9789004225381/B9789004225381_010.xml|journal=A Companion to Boethius in the Middle Ages|pages=319–355|doi=10.1163/9789004225381_010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Relihan|first=Joel C.|date=January 2000|title=Review of: Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2000/2000-01-16.html|journal=Bryn Mawr Classical Review|issn=1055-7660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/elizabeth-monarchy/elizabeths-translation-of-the-consolation-of-philosophy/|title=The National Archives - Homepage|last=Archives|first=The National|access-date=2019-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=April 1991|title=The Fate of Fortune in the Early Middle Ages: The Boethian Tradition.

Found within the ''Consolation'' are themes that have echoed throughout the Western canon: the female figure of wisdom that informs Dante, the ascent through the layered universe that is shared with Milton, the reconciliation of opposing forces that find their way into Chaucer in The Knight's Tale, and the Wheel of Fortune so popular throughout the Middle Ages.

Citations from it occur frequently in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. Of Boethius, Dante remarked ''“The blessed soul who exposes the deceptive world to anyone who gives ear to him.”&lt;ref&gt;''Dante ''The Divine Comedy''. “blessed souls” inhabit Dante's Paradise, and appear as flames. (see note above).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethian influence can be found nearly everywhere in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s poetry, e.g. in ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'', ''[[The Franklin's Tale]]'', ''[[The Parson's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', in the character of Lady Nature in ''[[The Parliament of Fowls]]'' and some of the shorter poems, such as ''Truth'', ''The Former Age'' and ''Lak of Stedfastnesse''. Chaucer translated the work in his ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''.

The [[Italians|Italian]] composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] used some of the text in his choral work ''[[Canti di prigionia]]'' (1938).  The [[Australia]]n composer [[Peter Sculthorpe]] quoted parts of it in his opera or music theatre work ''[[Rites of Passage (Sculthorpe)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1972–73), which was commissioned for the opening of the [[Sydney Opera House]] but was not ready in time.

[[Tom Shippey]] in ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' says how “Boethian” much of the treatment of evil is in [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Shippey says that Tolkien knew well the translation of Boethius that was made by King Alfred and he quotes some “Boethian” remarks from [[Frodo]], [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''The Road to Middle-earth'', pg. 140, {{ISBN|0-395-33973-1}}, (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethius and ''Consolatio Philosophiae'' are cited frequently by the main character Ignatius J. Reilly in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' (1980).

It is a [[prosimetrum|prosimetrical]] text, meaning that it is written in alternating sections of [[prose]] and metered [[Meter (poetry)|verse]]. In the course of the text, Boethius displays a virtuosic command of the forms of [[Latin poetry]]. It is classified as a [[Menippean satire]], a fusion of [[allegory|allegorical]] tale, [[platonic dialogue]], and lyrical poetry.

In the 20th century there were close to four hundred manuscripts still surviving, a testament to its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orpheus in the Middle Ages|last=Friedman|first=John|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2000|isbn=0815628250|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction of the Lost Songs from ''The Consolation of Philosophy''===
Hundreds of Latin songs were recorded in [[neume]]s from the ninth century through to the thirteenth century, including settings of the poetic passages from Boethius's ''The Consolation of Philosophy''. The music of this song repertory had long been considered irretrievably lost because the notational signs indicated only melodic outlines, relying on now-lapsed oral traditions to fill in the missing details. However, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-tALWHHUaE&amp;t=146s research conducted] by [https://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/sam-barrett Dr Sam Barrett] at the [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Melodic Tradition of Boethius' &quot;De consolatine philosophiae&quot; in the Middle Ages|last=Barrett|first=Sam|publisher=Bärenreiter|year=2013|isbn=|location=Kassel|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended in collaboration with medieval music ensemble [[Sequentia (music group)|Sequentia]], has shown that principles of musical setting for this period can be identified, providing crucial information to enable modern realisations.&lt;ref&gt;University of Cambridge, [http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/first-performance-in-1000-years-lost-songs-from-the-middle-ages-are-brought-back-to-life-0 ''First performance in 1000 years: lost songs are brought back to life by Cambridge researchers'']&lt;/ref&gt; Sequentia performed the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwAKPIUKAyM world premiere] of the reconstructed songs from Boethius's ''The Consolation of Philosophy'' at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], in April 2016, bringing to life music not heard in over 1,000 years; a number of the songs were subsequently recorded on the CD ''[http://www.glossamusic.com/glossa/reference.aspx?id=465 Boethius: Songs of Consolation.
