{{Condensed matter physics}}

'''Condensed matter physics''' is the field of [[physics]] that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of [[matter]]. In particular it is concerned with the &quot;condensed&quot; phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong. The most familiar examples of condensed phases are [[solid]]s and [[liquid]]s, which arise from the [[electromagnetic]] forces between [[atom]]s. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using [[physical law]]s. In particular, they include the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] and [[statistical mechanics]].

More exotic condensed phases include the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by certain materials at low [[temperature]], the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice]]s of atoms, and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] found in [[ultracold atom]]ic systems. The study of condensed matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of [[theoretical physics]] to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.

The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics: one third of all [[People of the United States|American]] physicists self-identify as condensed matter physicists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327141400/http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-date= 2009-03-27 |website=Physics Today Jobs|title= Condensed Matter Physics Jobs: Careers in Condensed Matter Physics| access-date= 2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Division of Condensed Matter Physics is the largest division at the [[American Physical Society]].&lt;ref name=aps-history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Condensed Matter Physics|url=http://www.aps.org/units/dcmp/history.cfm|publisher=American Physical Society|access-date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field overlaps with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], and [[nanotechnology]], and relates closely to [[atomic physics]] and [[biophysics]]. The [[theoretical physics]] of condensed matter shares important concepts and methods with that of [[particle physics]] and [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Marvin L.|title=Essay: Fifty Years of Condensed Matter Physics|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2008|volume=101|issue=25|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.250001|url=http://prl.aps.org/edannounce/PhysRevLett.101.250001|access-date=31 March 2012|bibcode= 2008PhRvL.101y0001C|pmid=19113681|page=250001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of topics in physics such as [[crystallography]], [[metallurgy]], [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[magnetism]], etc., were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s, when they were grouped together as ''[[solid state physics]]''. Around the 1960s, the study of physical properties of [[liquid]]s was added to this list, forming the basis for the new, related specialty of condensed matter physics.&lt;ref name=rmp /&gt; According to physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson]], the term was coined by him and [[Volker Heine]], when they changed the name of their group at the [[Cavendish Laboratories]], [[Cambridge]] from ''Solid state theory'' to ''Theory of Condensed Matter'' in 1967,&lt;ref name=pwa-princeton&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip Anderson|url=http://www.princeton.edu/physics/people/display_person.xml?netid=pwa&amp;display=faculty |website=Department of Physics|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids, [[nuclear matter]], and so on.&lt;ref name=wsn&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Focus: More and Different|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/newsletter/newsletter/nov11n33p02.shtml|journal=World Scientific Newsletter|date=November 2011|volume=33 |page=2|last = Anderson|first = Philip W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Anderson and Heine helped popularize the name &quot;condensed matter&quot;, it had been present in Europe for some years, most prominently in the form of a journal published in English, French, and German by [[Springer Science+Business Media |Springer-Verlag]] titled ''Physics of Condensed Matter'', which was launched in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTsgAAAAIAAJ|title=''Physics of Condensed Matter''|volume=1|access-date=20 April 2015|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding environment and Cold War politics of the 1960s and 1970s were also factors that lead some physicists to prefer the name &quot;condensed matter physics&quot;, which emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids, liquids, plasmas, and other complex matter, over &quot;solid state physics&quot;, which was often associated with the industrial applications of metals and semiconductors.&lt;ref name=martin-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change?

References to &quot;condensed&quot; state can be traced to earlier sources. For example, in the introduction to his 1947 book ''Kinetic Theory of Liquids'',&lt;ref name=Frenkel&gt;{{cite book|last=Frenkel|first=J.|title=Kinetic Theory of Liquids|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yakov Frenkel]] proposed that &quot;The kinetic theory of liquids must accordingly be developed as a generalization and extension of the kinetic theory of solid bodies. As a matter of fact, it would be more correct to unify them under the title of 'condensed bodies'&quot;.

One of the first studies of condensed states of matter was by [[People of England|English]] [[chemist]] [[Humphry Davy]], in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Davy observed that of the forty [[chemical element]]s known at the time, twenty-six had [[metal]]lic properties such as [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], [[ductility]] and high electrical and thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodstein|first=David|author1-link=David Goodstein|last2=Goodstein|first2=Judith|author2-link=Judith R.

Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases, such as [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] could be liquefied under the right conditions and would then behave as metals.&lt;ref name=davy-1839&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Davy |editor-first = John |title=The collected works of Sir Humphry Davy: Vol. II |year=1839|publisher=Smith Elder &amp; Co., Cornhill |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6WNKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{NoteTag|Both hydrogen and nitrogen have since been liquified; however, ordinary liquid nitrogen and hydrogen do not possess metallic properties.

In 1823, [[Michael Faraday]], then an assistant in Davy's lab, successfully liquefied [[chlorine]] and went on to liquefy all known gaseous elements, except for nitrogen, hydrogen, and [[oxygen]].&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt; Shortly after, in 1869, [[People of Ireland|Irish]] chemist [[Thomas Andrews (scientist)|Thomas Andrews]] studied the [[phase transition]] from a liquid to a gas and coined the term [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] to describe the condition where a gas and a liquid were indistinguishable as phases,&lt;ref name=thomasandrews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowlinson|first=J.

[[Paul Drude]] in 1900 proposed the first theoretical model for a [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[electron]] moving through a metallic solid.&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008 /&gt; Drude's model described properties of metals in terms of a gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kittel 1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kittel|first=Charles|title=Introduction to Solid State Physics|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-471-11181-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoddeson-1992&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoddeson|first=Lillian|title=Out of the Crystal Maze: Chapters from The History of Solid State Physics|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-505329-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCpPPHhMdRcC&amp;pg=PA29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27–29}} However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the [[specific heat]] and magnetic properties of metals, and the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.&lt;ref name=Kragh2002&gt;{{cite book |last= Kragh |first= Helge |title= Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century |publisher= Princeton University Press |edition= Reprint |date= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-691-09552-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|366–368}}

In 1911, three years after helium was first liquefied, Onnes working at [[University of Leiden]] discovered [[superconductivity]] in [[mercury (element)|mercury]], when he observed the electrical resistivity of mercury to vanish at temperatures below a certain value.&lt;ref name=vanDelft2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Delft|first=Dirk|author2=Kes, Peter |title=The discovery of superconductivity|journal=Physics Today|date=September 2010|volume=63|issue=9|doi=10.1063/1.3490499|url=http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/cold/DelftKes_HKO_PT.pdf|access-date=7 April 2012|bibcode= 2010PhT....63i..38V|pages=38–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon completely surprised the best theoretical physicists of the time, and it remained unexplained for several decades.&lt;ref name=Slichter-AIP-supercond&gt;{{cite web|last=Slichter|first=Charles|title=Introduction to the History of Superconductivity|url=http://www.aip.org/history/mod/superconductivity/01.html|website=Moments of Discovery|publisher=American Institute of Physics|access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]], in 1922, said regarding contemporary theories of superconductivity that &quot;with our far-reaching ignorance of the quantum mechanics of composite systems we are very far from being able to compose a theory out of these vague ideas.&quot;&lt;ref name=Schmalian-2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmalian|first=Joerg|title=Failed theories of superconductivity|year=2010|arxiv=1008.0447|bibcode= 2010MPLB...24.2679S |doi= 10.1142/S0217984910025280|journal=Modern Physics Letters B|volume=24|issue=27|pages=2679–2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advent of quantum mechanics===
Drude's classical model was augmented by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], [[Felix Bloch]] and other physicists.  Pauli realized that the free electrons in metal must obey the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].  Using this idea, he developed the theory of [[paramagnetism]] in 1926.  Shortly after, Sommerfeld incorporated the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] into the free electron model and made it better to explain the heat capacity.  Two years later, Bloch used [[quantum mechanics]] to describe the motion of an electron in a periodic lattice.&lt;ref name=Kragh2002/&gt;{{rp|366–368}} The mathematics of crystal structures developed by [[Auguste Bravais]], [[Yevgraf Fyodorov]] and others was used to classify crystals by their [[symmetry group]], and tables of crystal structures were the basis for the series ''International Tables of Crystallography'', first published in 1935.&lt;ref name=Aroyo-2006&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aroyo|first=Mois, I. |author2=Müller, Ulrich |author3=Wondratschek, Hans |title=Historical introduction|year=2006|volume=A|pages=2–5|doi=10.1107/97809553602060000537|series=International Tables for Crystallography|isbn=978-1-4020-2355-2|url=http://www.european-arachnology.org/proceedings/19th/Lourenco.PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.4170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Band theory|Band structure calculations]] was first used in 1930 to predict the properties of new materials, and in 1947 [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]] and [[William Shockley]] developed the first [[semiconductor]]-based [[transistor]], heralding a revolution in electronics.&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008 /&gt;

In 1879, [[Edwin Herbert Hall]] working at the [[Johns Hopkins University]] discovered a voltage developed across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric Currents|author=Hall, Edwin|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|volume=2|year=1879|pages=287–92|url=http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|access-date=2008-02-28|doi=10.2307/2369245|issue=3|jstor=2369245|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208040346/http://www.stenomuseet.dk/skoletj/elmag/kilde9.html|archivedate=2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon arising due to the nature of charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the [[Hall effect]], but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was not experimentally discovered until 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, [[Lev Landau]] in 1930 developed the theory of [[Landau quantization]] and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the [[quantum Hall effect]] discovered half a century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=L.

Further research such as by Bloch on [[spin wave]]s and [[Néel]] on [[antiferromagnetism]] led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to [[magnetic storage]] devices.&lt;ref name=mattis-magnetism-2006/&gt;{{rp|36–38,g48}}

The Sommerfeld model and spin models for ferromagnetism illustrated the successful application of quantum mechanics to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of [[superconductivity]] and the [[Kondo effect]].&lt;ref name=Coleman-2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=Piers|title=Many-Body Physics: Unfinished Revolution|journal=Annales Henri Poincaré|year=2003|volume=4|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s00023-003-0943-9|arxiv=cond-mat/0307004|bibcode= 2003AnHP....4..559C|pages=559–580|citeseerx=10.1.1.242.6214}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of [[collective excitation]] modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist [[Lev Landau]] used the idea for the [[Fermi liquid theory]] wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles.&lt;ref name=Coleman-2003/&gt; Landau also developed a [[mean field theory]] for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneous breakdown of symmetry]].

These ideas were unified by [[Kenneth G. Wilson]] in 1972, under the formalism of the [[renormalization group]] in the context of quantum field theory.&lt;ref name=Fisher-rmp-1998/&gt;

The [[quantum Hall effect]] was discovered by [[Klaus von Klitzing]] in 1980 when he observed the Hall conductance to be integer multiples of a fundamental constant &lt;math&gt;e^2/h&lt;/math&gt;.(see figure) The effect was observed to be independent of parameters such as system size and impurities.&lt;ref name=&quot;von Klitzing&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1985/klitzing-lecture.pdf |title= The Quantized Hall Effect |last= von Klitzing |first= Klaus |date= 9 Dec 1985 |website= Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1981, theorist [[Robert Laughlin]] proposed a theory explaining the unanticipated precision of the integral plateau.

A major revolution came in the field of [[crystallography]] with the discovery of [[quasicrystal]]s by [[Daniel Shechtman]]. In 1982 Shechtman observed that certain metallic [[alloy]]s produce unusual diffractograms that indicated that their crystalline structures are ordered, but lack [[translational symmetry]]. The discovery led the [[International Union of Crystallography]] to change its definition of a crystal to account for aperiodic structures.&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-05/technion-s-shechtman-wins-chemistry-nobel-for-discovery-of-quasicrystals.html |title=Tecnion's Shechtman Wins Nobel in Chemistry for Quasicrystals Discovery |last = Gerlin |first = Andrea |date= 5 October 2011|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second half of the twentieth century was also important for the development of [[soft condensed matter]], in particular the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] of several soft-matter systems such as polymers and liquid crystals due to [[Paul Flory|Flory]], [[Pierre de Gennes|de Gennes]] and others.&lt;ref name=Cates-2004-soft&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cates |first=M.

In 1986, [[Karl Alexander Müller|Karl Müller]] and [[Johannes Bednorz]] discovered the first [[high temperature superconductor]], a material which was superconducting at temperatures as high as 50 [[kelvin]]s.

In 2009, [[David Field (astrophysicist)|David Field]] and researchers at [[Aarhus University]] discovered spontaneous electric fields when creating [[prosaic film]]s{{clarify|date=April 2016}} of various gases. This has more recently expanded to form the research area of [[spontelectrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Field|first=David|author2=Plekan, O. |author3=Cassidy, A. |author4=Balog, R. |author5= Jones, N.C. and Dunger, J. |title=Spontaneous electric fields in solid films: spontelectrics|journal=Int.Rev.Phys.Chem.|date=12 Mar 2013|doi=10.1080/0144235X.2013.767109|volume=32|issue=3|pages=345–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical==
Theoretical condensed matter physics involves the use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the [[Drude model]], the [[Electronic band structure|band structure]] and the [[density functional theory]]. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of [[phase transition]]s, such as the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], [[critical exponent]]s and the use of mathematical methods of [[quantum field theory]] and the [[renormalization group]]. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of [[numerical computation]] of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as [[high-temperature superconductivity]], [[topological phase]]s, and [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]].

===Emergence===
{{Main|Emergence}}

Theoretical understanding of condensed matter physics is closely related to the notion of [[emergence]], wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents.&lt;ref name=coleman&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman |first=Piers |title=Introduction to Many Body Physics |year=2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86488-6|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/condensed-matter-physics-nanoscience-and-mesoscopic-physics/introduction-many-body-physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known.&lt;ref name=nsf-emergence&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Emergence|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/overviews/physics/physics_q01.jsp|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where [[collective excitation]]s behave like [[photon]]s and [[electron]]s, thereby describing [[electromagnetism]] as an emergent phenomenon.&lt;ref name=levin-rmp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Michael|author2=Wen, Xiao-Gang |title=Colloquium: Photons and electrons as emergent phenomena|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|year=2005|volume=77|issue=3|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.77.871|arxiv= cond-mat/0407140 |bibcode= 2005RvMP...77..871L |pages=871–879 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the [[lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface]], where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, [[superconductivity]], and [[ferromagnetism]].

===Electronic theory of solids===
{{Main|Electronic band structure}}

The metallic state has historically been an important building block for studying properties of solids.&lt;ref name=&quot;AshcroftMermin1976&quot;/&gt; The first theoretical description of metals was given by [[Paul Drude]] in 1900 with the [[Drude model]], which explained electrical and thermal properties by describing a metal as an [[ideal gas]] of then-newly discovered [[electron]]s.  He was able to derive the empirical [[Wiedemann-Franz law]] and get results in close agreement with the experiments.&lt;ref name=Hoddeson-1992/&gt;{{rp|90–91}}  This classical model was then improved by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] who incorporated the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] of electrons and was able to explain the anomalous behavior of the [[specific heat]] of metals in the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]].&lt;ref name=Hoddeson-1992/&gt;{{rp|101–103}}  In 1912, The structure of crystalline solids was studied by [[Max von Laue]] and Paul Knipping, when they observed the [[X-ray diffraction]] pattern of crystals, and concluded that crystals get their structure from periodic [[lattice model (physics)|lattices]] of atoms.&lt;ref name=Hoddeson-1992/&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eckert|first=Michael|title=Disputed discovery: the beginnings of X-ray diffraction in crystals in 1912 and its repercussions|journal=Acta Crystallographica A|year=2011|volume=68|issue=1|doi=10.1107/S0108767311039985|pmid=22186281|url=http://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2012/01/00/wx0005/index.html|bibcode= 2012AcCrA..68...30E|pages=30–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928, Swiss physicist [[Felix Bloch]] provided a wave function solution to the [[Schrödinger equation]] with a [[Periodic function|periodic]] potential, called the [[Bloch wave]].&lt;ref name=han-2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Han|first=Jung Hoon|title=Solid State Physics|year=2010|publisher=Sung Kyun Kwan University|url=http://manybody.skku.edu/Lecture%20notes/Solid%20State%20Physics.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520224858/http://manybody.skku.edu/Lecture%20notes/Solid%20State%20Physics.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculating electronic properties of metals by solving the many-body wavefunction is often computationally hard, and hence, approximation methods are needed to obtain meaningful predictions.&lt;ref name=perdew-2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perdew|first=John P.|author2=Ruzsinszky, Adrienn |title=Fourteen Easy Lessons in Density Functional Theory|journal=International Journal of Quantum Chemistry|year=2010|volume=110|pages=2801–2807|url=http://www.if.pwr.wroc.pl/~scharoch/Abinitio/14lessons.pdf|access-date=13 May 2012|doi=10.1002/qua.22829|issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thomas–Fermi model|Thomas–Fermi theory]], developed in the 1920s, was used to estimate system energy and electronic density by treating the local electron density as a [[Variational method|variational parameter]].

Slater|John Slater]] developed the so-called [[Hartree–Fock method|Hartree–Fock wavefunction]] as an improvement over the Thomas–Fermi model. The Hartree–Fock method accounted for [[Exchange symmetry|exchange statistics]] of single particle electron wavefunctions.  In general, it's very difficult to solve the Hartree–Fock equation.  Only the free electron gas case can be solved exactly.&lt;ref name=&quot;AshcroftMermin1976&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neil W. Ashcroft|author2=N.

The density functional theory (DFT) has been widely used since the 1970s for band structure calculations of variety of solids.&lt;ref name=perdew-2010 /&gt;

=== Symmetry breaking ===
{{Main|Symmetry breaking}}

Some states of matter exhibit ''symmetry breaking'', where the relevant laws of physics possess some form of [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] that is broken. A common example is [[crystal|crystalline solid]]s, which break continuous [[translational symmetry]]. Other examples include magnetized [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], which break [[rotational symmetry]], and more exotic states such as the ground state of a [[BCS theory|BCS]] [[superconductor]], that breaks [[U(1)]] phase rotational symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/nambu-lecture.html |title= Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Particle Physics: a Case of Cross Fertilization |last= Nambu |first= Yoichiro |date= 8 December 2008 |website= Nobelprize.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greiter |first=Martin |arxiv=cond-mat/0503400 |title=Is electromagnetic gauge invariance spontaneously violated in superconductors? |date=16 March 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2005.03.008 |volume=319 |issue=2005 |journal=Annals of Physics |pages=217–249 |bibcode=2005AnPhy.319..217G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goldstone's theorem]] in [[quantum field theory]] states that in a system with broken continuous symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone [[boson]]s. For example, in crystalline solids, these correspond to [[phonon]]s, which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations.&lt;ref name=goldstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leutwyler|first=H.|title=Phonons as Goldstone bosons|journal= Helv. Phys. Acta  |volume=70|issue=1997|year=1997|arxiv=hep-ph/9609466|bibcode= 1996hep.ph....9466L|pages=275–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase transition ===
{{Main|Phase transition}}

Phase transition refers to the change of phase of a system, which is brought about by change in an external parameter such as [[temperature]].  Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when the order of the system was destroyed.  For example, when ice melts and becomes water, the ordered crystal structure is destroyed.  

In [[quantum phase transition]]s,  the temperature is set to [[absolute zero]], and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field,  causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by [[quantum fluctuation]]s originating from the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct [[ground state]]s of the [[Hamiltonian matrix]].  Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.&lt;ref name=Vojta2003/&gt;

Two classes of phase transitions occur: ''first-order transitions'' and ''second-order'' or ''continuous transitions''. For the latter, the two phases involved do not co-exist at the transition temperature, also called the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].  Near the critical point, systems undergo critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as [[correlation length]], [[specific heat]], and [[magnetic susceptibility]] diverge exponentially.&lt;ref name=Vojta2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vojta |first=Matthias |arxiv= cond-mat/0309604 |title=Quantum phase transitions |year=2003 |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/66/12/R01 |volume=66 |issue=12 |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |pages=2069–2110|bibcode= 2003RPPh...66.2069V |citeseerx=10.1.1.305.3880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These critical phenomena present serious challenges to physicists because normal [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] laws are no longer valid in the region, and novel ideas and methods must be invented to find the new laws that can describe the system.&lt;ref name=NRC1986&gt;{{cite book |title = Condensed-Matter Physics, Physics Through the 1990s |publisher=National Research Council|year=1986 |url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/626/an-overview-physics-through-the-1990s |isbn=978-0-309-03577-4 |doi=10.17226/626}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75ff}}

The simplest theory that can describe continuous phase transitions is the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], which works in the so-called [[mean field approximation]].  However, it can only roughly explain continuous phase transition for ferroelectrics and type I superconductors which involves long range microscopic interactions.  For other types of systems that involves short range interactions near the critical point, a better theory is needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;University1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm F. Collins Professor of Physics McMaster University|title=Magnetic Critical Scattering|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-536440-8|date=1989-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8–11}}

Near the critical point, the fluctuations happen over broad range of size scales while the feature of the whole system is scale invariant.  [[Renormalization group]] methods successively average out the shortest wavelength fluctuations in stages while retaining their effects into the next stage.  Thus, the changes of a physical system as viewed at different size scales can be investigated systematically.  The methods, together with powerful computer simulation, contribute greatly to the explanation of the critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transition.&lt;ref name=NRC1986/&gt;{{rp|11}}

==Experimental==
Experimental condensed matter physics involves the use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Such probes include effects of electric and [[magnetic field]]s, measuring [[response function]]s, [[transport theory (statistical physics)|transport properties]] and [[thermometry]].&lt;ref name=exptcm&gt;{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Robert C.|title=Experimental methods in Condensed Matter Physics at Low Temperatures|year=1988|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-201-15002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly used experimental methods include [[spectroscopy]], with probes such as [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-rays]], [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared light]] and [[inelastic neutron scattering]]; study of thermal response, such as [[specific heat]] and measuring transport via thermal and heat [[conduction (heat)|conduction]].

===Scattering===
{{Further|Scattering}}

Several condensed matter experiments involve scattering of an experimental probe, such as [[X-ray]], optical [[photon]]s, [[neutron]]s, etc., on constituents of a material. The choice of scattering probe depends on the observation energy scale of interest. [[Visible light]] has energy on the scale of 1 [[electron volt]] (eV) and is used as a scattering probe to measure variations in material properties such as [[dielectric constant]] and [[refractive index]]. X-rays have energies of the order of 10 [[electron volt|keV]] and hence are able to probe atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density.&lt;ref name=chaikin-lubensky&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaikin|first=P.

[[Neutron]]s can also probe atomic length scales and are used to study scattering off nuclei and electron [[Spin (physics)|spins]] and magnetization (as neutrons have spin but no charge).

===External magnetic fields===
In experimental condensed matter physics, external [[magnetic field]]s act as [[thermodynamic variable]]s that control the state, phase transitions and properties of material systems.&lt;ref name=iupap-report&gt;{{cite web|last=Committee on Facilities for Condensed Matter Physics |title=Report of the IUPAP working group on Facilities for Condensed Matter Physics : High Magnetic Fields |url = http://archive.iupap.org/wg/wg3/hmff/file_50963.pdf |publisher=International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|year= 2004 |quote = The magnetic field is not simply a spectroscopic tool but is a thermodynamic variable which, along with temperature and pressure, controls the state, the phase transitions and the properties of materials.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) is a method by which external magnetic fields are used to find resonance modes of individual electrons, thus giving information about the atomic, molecular, and bond structure of their neighborhood.

===Nuclear spectroscopy===
The [[local structure]], the structure of the nearest neighbour atoms, of condensed matter can be investigated with methods of [[nuclear spectroscopy]], which are very sensitive to small changes. Using specific and radioactive [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], the nucleus becomes the probe that interacts with its sourrounding electric and magnetic fields ([[hyperfine structure|hyperfine interactions]]). The methods are suitable to study defects, diffusion, phase change, magnetism. Common methods are e.g. [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]], [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]], or [[perturbed angular correlation]] (PAC). Especially PAC is ideal for the study of phase changes at extreme temperature above 2000°C due to no temperature dependence of the method.

[[Ultracold atom]] trapping in optical lattices is an experimental tool commonly used in condensed matter physics, and in [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]. The method involves using optical lasers to form an [[interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]], which acts as a ''lattice'', in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures. Cold atoms in optical lattices are used as ''quantum simulators'', that is, they act as controllable systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems, such as [[Geometrical frustration|frustrated magnets]].&lt;ref name=buluta-science2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buluta|first=Iulia|author2=Nori, Franco |title=Quantum Simulators|journal=Science|year=2009|volume=326|issue=5949|doi=10.1126/science.1177838|bibcode= 2009Sci...326..108B|pages=108–11|pmid=19797653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they are used to engineer one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices for a [[Hubbard model]] with pre-specified parameters, and to study phase transitions for [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] and [[spin liquid]] ordering.&lt;ref name=greiner-nature2008&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greiner |first=Markus |author2=Fölling, Simon |title=Condensed-matter physics: Optical lattices |journal=Nature|year=2008|volume=453|pages=736–738|doi=10.1038/453736a|bibcode= 2008Natur.453..736G|issue=7196|pmid=18528388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jaksch-aop2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaksch|first=D.|author2=Zoller, P. |title=The cold atom Hubbard toolbox|journal=Annals of Physics|year=2005|volume=315|issue=1|pages=52–79|doi=10.1016/j.aop.2004.09.010|arxiv= cond-mat/0410614 |bibcode= 2005AnPhy.315...52J|citeseerx=10.1.1.305.9031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in condensed matter physics has given rise to several device applications, such as the development of the [[semiconductor]] [[transistor]],&lt;ref name=marvincohen2008 /&gt; [[laser]] technology,&lt;ref name=NRC1986 /&gt; and several phenomena studied in the context of [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010Committee2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Committee on CMMP 2010; Solid State Sciences Committee; Board on Physics and Astronomy; Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, National Research Council|title=Condensed-Matter and Materials Physics: The Science of the World Around Us|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11967/condensed-matter-and-materials-physics-the-science-of-the-world|date=21 December 2007|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-13409-5|doi=10.17226/11967}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111ff}} Methods such as [[Scanning tunneling microscope|scanning-tunneling microscopy]] can be used to control processes at the [[nanometer]] scale, and have given rise to the study of nanofabrication.&lt;ref name=yeh-perspective&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yeh|first=Nai-Chang |title=A Perspective of Frontiers in Modern Condensed Matter Physics |journal=AAPPS Bulletin|year=2008|volume=18|issue=2 |url = https://yehgroup.caltech.edu/files/2016/08/AAPPS_v18_no2_pg11.pdf |access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[quantum computation]], information is represented by quantum bits, or [[qubit]]s. The qubits may [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] quickly before useful computation is completed. This serious problem must be solved before quantum computing may be realized. To solve this problem, several promising approaches are proposed in condensed matter physics, including [[Josephson junction]] qubits, [[spintronic]] qubits using the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] orientation of magnetic materials, or the topological non-Abelian [[anyon]]s from [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] states.&lt;ref name=yeh-perspective /&gt;

Condensed matter physics also has important uses for [[biophysics]], for example, the experimental method of [[magnetic resonance imaging]], which is widely used in medical diagnosis.&lt;ref name=yeh-perspective /&gt;
