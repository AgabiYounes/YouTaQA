'''Creationism''' is the [[religious belief]] that [[nature]], and aspects such as the [[universe]], [[Earth]], [[life]], and [[human]]s, originated with [[supernatural]] acts of [[Creation myth|divine creation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunn2004&quot;&gt;[[Creationism#Gunn 2004|Gunn 2004]], p. 9, &quot;The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' says that creationism is 'the belief that the universe and living organisms originated from specific acts of divine creation.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=46aUBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA789&amp;dq=Handbook+of+Evolutionary+Thinking+in+the+Sciences#v=onepage&amp;q=881&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Evolutionary Thinking in the Sciences|last1=Brosseau|first1=Olivier|last2=Silberstein|first2=Marc|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9789401790147|editor-last1=Heams|editor-first1=Thomas|place=Dordrecht|pages=881–96|contribution=Evolutionism(s) and Creationism(s)|ref=harv|editor-last2=Huneman|editor-first2=Philippe|editor-last3=Lecointre|editor-first3=Guillaume|editor-last4=Silberstein.|editor-first4=Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In its broadest sense, creationism includes a [[wikt:continuum|continuum]] of religious views,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=46aUBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA789&amp;dq=Handbook+of+Evolutionary+Thinking+in+the+Sciences#v=onepage&amp;q=881&amp;f=false|title=Handbook of Evolutionary Thinking in the Sciences|last1=Brosseau|first1=Olivier|last2=Silberstein|first2=Marc|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9789401790147|editor-last1=Heams|editor-first1=Thomas|place=Dordrecht|pages=881, 884|contribution=Evolutionism(s) and Creationism(s)|ref=harv|editor-last2=Huneman|editor-first2=Philippe|editor-last3=Lecointre|editor-first3=Guillaume|editor-last4=Silberstein.|editor-first4=Marc|quote=Creationism is not a single homogenous doctrine ... Evolution, as a process, is a tool God uses to continually create the world. Here we have arrived at another sub-category of creationism called 'evolutionist creationism'  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart2009&quot;&gt;[[Creationism#Stewart 2010|Haarsma 2010]], p. 168, &quot;Some Christians, often called 'Young Earth creationists,' reject evolution in order to maintain a semi-literal interpretation of certain biblical passages. Other Christians, called 'progressive creationists,' accept the scientific evidence for some evolution over a long history of the earth, but also insist that God must have performed some miracles during that history to create new life-forms. [[Intelligent design]], as it is promoted in North America is a form of progressive creation. Still other Christians, called 'theistic evolutionists' or 'evolutionary creationists,' assert that the scientific theory of evolution and the religious beliefs of Christianity can both be true.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 
which vary in their acceptance or rejection of [[science|scientific explanations]] such as [[evolution]] that describe the origin and development of natural phenomena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott quote&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OD_creationism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/creationism?q=creationism|title=creationism: definition of creationism in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|website=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|type=Definition|oclc=656668849|accessdate=2014-03-05|quote=The belief that the universe and living organisms originate from specific acts of divine creation, as in the biblical account, rather than by natural processes such as evolution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''creationism'' most often refers to belief in [[special creation]]; the claim that the universe and lifeforms were created as they exist today by divine action, and that the only true explanations are those which are compatible with a [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalist]] [[Biblical literalism|literal]] interpretation of the [[creation myth]]s found in the [[Bible]]'s [[Genesis creation narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Scott|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FAAlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57, 97–98]|quote=The term creationism to many people connotes the theological doctrine of special creationism: that God created the universe essentially as we see it today, and that this universe has not changed appreciably since that creation event. Special creationism includes the idea that God created living things in their present forms, and it reflects a literalist view of the Bible. It is most closely associated with the endeavour of &quot;creation science,&quot; which includes the view that the universe is only 10,000 years old. But the most important aspect of special creation is the idea that things are created in their present forms.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, the commonest form of this has been [[young Earth creationism]] which posits special creation of the universe and lifeforms within the last 10,000 years on the basis of [[Flood geology]], and promotes [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[creation science]]. From the 18th century onwards, [[old Earth creationism]] accepted [[geological time]] harmonized with Genesis through [[gap creationism|gap]] or [[day-age creationism|day-age theory]], while supporting anti-evolution. Modern old-Earth creationists support [[progressive creationism]] and continue to reject evolutionary explanations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Eugenie Scott | title=The Creation/Evolution Continuum | website=[[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] | date=13 February 2018 | url=https://ncse.com/library-resource/creationevolution-continuum | access-date=29 April 2019| author-link=Eugenie Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Creation–evolution controversy|political controversy]], creation science was reformulated as [[intelligent design]] and [[neo-creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ncse.com/creationism/general/what-is-intelligent-design-creationism|title=What is &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; Creationism?|date=2008-10-17|website=NCSE|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/21/religion.highereducation|title=Academics fight rise of creationism at universities|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|date=February 20, 2006|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2010-04-07|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less prominently, there are also members of the [[Islamic creationism|Islamic]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/science/03islam.html?_r=0|title=Creationism, Without a Young Earth, Emerges in the Islamic World|last1=Chang|first1=Kenneth|date=November 2, 2009|work=The New York Times|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffpo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/usaama-alazami/muslims-and-evolution-in-the-21st-century-a-galileo-moment_b_2688895.html|title=Muslims and Evolution in the 21st Century: A Galileo Moment?|last=al-Azami|first=Usaama|date=2013-02-14|work=Huffington Post Religion Blog|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu creationism|Hindu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mom/groves.html|title=Creationism: The Hindu View|website=www.talkorigins.org|access-date=2019-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; faiths who are creationists.

Use of the term &quot;creationist&quot; in this context dates back to [[Charles Darwin]]'s unpublished 1842 sketch draft for what became ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;CD usage&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Numbers|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=drk3zykoEy4C&amp;pg=PA50 50]}} &quot;Since at least the early 1840s Darwin had occasionally referred to 'creationists' in his unpublished writings, but the epithet acquired little public currency.&quot; – [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=61&amp;itemID=F1555&amp;viewtype=text sketch written in 1842] – &quot;if this had happened on an island, whence could the new forms have come,—here the geologist calls in creationists.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the term later in letters to colleagues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Darwin_letters_1856_1863&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-1919 |title=Darwin, C.

==Biblical basis==
The basis for many creationists' beliefs is a literal or quasi-literal interpretation of the [[Old Testament]], especially from stories from the [[book of Genesis]]:

* The [[Genesis creation narrative]] (Genesis 1–2) describes how [[God]] brings the Universe into being in a series of creative acts over six days and places the first man and woman ([[Adam and Eve]]) in a divine garden (the [[Garden of Eden]]). This story is the basis of creationist cosmology and biology.
* The [[Genesis flood narrative]] (Genesis 6–9) tells how God destroys the world and all life through a great flood, saving representatives of each form of life by means of [[Noah's ark]]. This forms the basis of creationist geology, better known as [[flood geology]].

A further important element is the interpretation of the [[Biblical chronology]], the elaborate system of life-spans, &quot;generations,&quot; and other means by which the Bible measures the passage of events from the creation (Genesis 1:1) to the [[Book of Daniel]], the last biblical book in which it appears. Recent decades have seen attempts to de-link creationism from the Bible and recast it as science; these include [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard F. Carlson, Tremper Longman III, Science, Creation and the Bible: Reconciling Rival Theories of Origins, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; There are also non-Christian forms of creationism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/creationism_1.shtml |title=Creationism and intelligent design |date=2 June 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; notably [[Islamic creationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/science/03islam.html |title=Creationism, Minus a Young Earth, Emerges in the Islamic World |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=2 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[NY Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu creationism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/16/darwin-evolution-china-politics |title=Darwinism, through a Chinese lens |first=Riazat |last=Butt |date=16 November 2009 |access-date=2 October 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
To counter the common misunderstanding that the [[creation–evolution controversy]] was a simple dichotomy of views, with &quot;creationists&quot; set against &quot;evolutionists&quot;, [[Eugenie Scott]] of the [[National Center for Science Education]] produced a diagram and description of a [[wikt:continuum|continuum]] of religious views as a spectrum ranging from extreme literal Biblical creationism to materialist evolution, grouped under main headings. This was used in public presentations, then published in 1999 in ''Reports of the NCSE''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott orig. continuum&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Eugenie C.|authorlink=Eugenie Scott|date=7 December 2000|title=The Creation/Evolution Continuum|url=http://www.natcenscied.org/resources/articles/1593_the_creationevolution_continu_12_7_2000.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509170526/http://www.natcenscied.org/resources/articles/1593_the_creationevolution_continu_12_7_2000.asp|journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education, July–August 1999|volume=19|issue=4|pages=16–17, 23–25|issn=2158-818X|archivedate=2008-05-09}} (original online version, with link to ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070708193630/http://www.natcenscied.org/graphics/Continu.jpg the Creation/Evolution Continuum graphic]''&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions of a &quot;[[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]&quot; of creationists were produced,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wise-p30&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wise |first=Donald U. |date=January 2001 |title=Creationism's Propaganda Assault on Deep Time and Evolution |url=http://nagt.org/nagt/jge/abstracts/jan01.html |journal=Journal of Geoscience Education |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=30–35 |issn=1089-9995 |accessdate=2014-03-09|bibcode=2001JGeEd..49...30W |doi=10.5408/1089-9995-49.1.30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comparisons made between the different groupings.&lt;ref name=&quot;nagt-pdf-Ross&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Marcus R. |authorlink=Marcus R.

The revised diagram is labelled to shows a spectrum relating to positions on the [[age of the Earth]], and the part played by [[special creation]] as against evolution. This was published in the book ''Evolution Vs. Creationism: An Introduction'',{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FAAlDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 63–75]}} and the NCSE website rewritten on the basis of the book version.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott1999&quot; /&gt;

===Young Earth creationism===
{{Main|Young Earth creationism}}
[[File:AIG museum.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Creation Museum]] is a young Earth creationism museum run by [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG) in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]].]]
[[File:ICR building.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) is a young-Earth creationist organization.]]
Young Earth creationists such as [[Ken Ham]] and [[Doug Phillips]] believe that God created the Earth within the last ten thousand years, literally as described in the Genesis creation narrative, within the approximate time-frame of biblical genealogies (detailed for example in the [[Ussher chronology]]). Most young Earth creationists believe that the universe has a similar age as the Earth. A few assign a much older age to the universe than to Earth. [[Creationist cosmologies]] give the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other young Earth time frames. Other young Earth creationists believe that the Earth and the universe were created with the appearance of age, so that the world appears to be much older than it is, and that this appearance is what gives the geological findings and other methods of dating the Earth and the universe their much longer [[timeline]]s.

The Christian organizations [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) and the [[Creation Research Society]] (CRS) both promote young Earth creationism in the US. Another organization with similar views, [[Answers in Genesis]] (AiG)—based in both the U.S. and the [[United Kingdom]]—has opened the [[Creation Museum]] in [[Petersburg, Boone County, Kentucky|Petersburg, Kentucky]], to promote young Earth creationism. [[Creation Ministries International]] promotes young Earth views in Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, the US, and the UK. Among [[Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], the [[List of Catholic creationist organisations|Kolbe Center]] for the Study of Creation promotes similar ideas. In 2007, Ken Ham founded the [[Creation Museum]] and [[Ark Encounter]] in northern [[Kentucky]].

===Old Earth creationism===
{{Main|Old Earth creationism}}
Old Earth creationism holds that the physical universe was created by God, but that the creation event described in the Book of Genesis is to be taken figuratively. This group generally believes that the [[age of the universe]] and the age of the Earth are as described by [[astronomer]]s and [[geologist]]s, but that details of [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary theory]] are questionable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott1999&quot; /&gt;

Old Earth creationism itself comes in at least three types:&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott1999&quot; /&gt;

====Gap creationism====
{{Main|Gap creationism}}
Gap creationism, also called &quot;restoration creationism,&quot; holds that life was recently created on a pre-existing old Earth. This version of creationism relies on a particular interpretation of {{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1–2|KJV}}. It is considered that the words [[Tohu wa-bohu|''formless'' and ''void'']] in fact denote waste and ruin, taking into account the original Hebrew and other places these words are used in the [[Old Testament]]. Genesis 1:1–2 is consequently translated:

: &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&quot; (Original act of creation.)
: &quot;And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&quot;

Thus, the six days of creation (verse 3 onwards) start sometime after the Earth was &quot;without form and void.&quot; This allows an indefinite &quot;gap&quot; of time to be inserted after the original creation of the universe, but prior to the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation according to Genesis]], (when present biological species and [[human]]ity were created). Gap theorists can therefore agree with the [[scientific consensus]] regarding the age of the Earth and universe, while maintaining a literal interpretation of the biblical text.

Some{{which|date=November 2013}} gap creationists expand the basic version of creationism by proposing a &quot;primordial creation&quot; of biological life within the &quot;gap&quot; of time. This is thought to be &quot;the world that then was&quot; mentioned in [[2 Peter]] 3:3–7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|2 Peter|3|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries of fossils and archaeological ruins older than 10,000 years are generally ascribed to this &quot;world that then was,&quot; which may also be associated with [[Lucifer]]'s rebellion. These views became popular with publications of Hebrew Lexicons such as ''[[Strong's Concordance]]'', and Bible commentaries such as the ''[[Scofield Reference Bible]]'' and [[E. W. Bullinger|''The Companion Bible'']].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

====Day-age creationism====
{{Main|Day-age creationism}}
Day-age creationism states that the &quot;six days&quot; of the Book of Genesis are not ordinary 24-hour days, but rather much longer periods (for instance, each &quot;day&quot; could be the equivalent of millions, or billions of years of human time). The physicist [[Gerald Schroeder]] is one such proponent of this view. This version of creationism often states that the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word &quot;yôm,&quot; in the context of Genesis 1, can be properly interpreted as &quot;age.&quot;

Strictly speaking, day-age creationism is not so much a version of creationism as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] option which may be combined with other versions of creationism such as progressive creationism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Progressive creationism====
{{Main|Progressive creationism}}
Progressive creationism holds that species have changed or evolved in a process continuously guided by God, with various ideas as to how the process operated—though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including the age of the Earth, but rejects much of modern [[evolutionary biology]] or looks to it for evidence that evolution by [[natural selection]] alone is incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Organizations such as [[Reasons To Believe]], founded by [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], promote this version of creationism.

Progressive creationism can be held in conjunction with [[hermeneutic]] approaches to the Genesis creation narrative such as the [[day-age creationism]] or [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|framework]]/metaphoric/poetic views.

===Philosophic and scientific creationism===
====Creation science====
{{Main|Creation science}}
Creation science, or initially scientific creationism, is a [[pseudoscience]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2267227 | pmid=18059309 | doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7401131 | volume=8 | issue=12 | title=Taking on creationism.

Okasha's full statement is that &quot;virtually all professional biologists regard creation science as a sham{{snd}}a dishonest and misguided attempt to promote religious beliefs under the guise of science, with extremely harmful educational consequences.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; that emerged in the 1960s with proponents aiming to have young Earth creationist beliefs taught in school science classes as a counter to teaching of evolution. Common features of creation science argument include: creationist cosmologies which accommodate a universe on the order of thousands of years old, criticism of [[radiometric dating]] through a technical argument about [[radiohalo]]s, explanations for the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] as a record of the [[Genesis flood narrative]] (see [[flood geology]]), and explanations for the present diversity as a result of pre-designed genetic variability and partially due to the rapid degradation of the perfect [[genome]]s God placed in &quot;created kinds&quot; or &quot;[[Baraminology|Baramin]]&quot; (see [[Creation science#Creationist biology|creationist biology]]) due to [[mutation]]s.

====Neo-creationism====
{{Main|Neo-creationism}}
Neo-creationism is a [[pseudoscientific]] movement which aims to restate creationism in terms more likely to be well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the [[scientific community]]. It aims to [[Framing (social sciences)|re-frame]] the debate over the [[Creation myth|origins of life]] in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public-school curricula violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=morris_neo&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icr.org/index.php?module=articles&amp;action=view&amp;ID=425 |title=Neocreationism |last=Morris |first=Henry M. |authorlink=Henry M.

One of the principal claims of neo-creationism propounds that ostensibly [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] orthodox science, with a foundation in [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], is actually a dogmatically [[atheism|atheistic]] [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.darwinreconsidered.org/media/MaterialistMythology.pdf |title= Darwinism is Materialist Mythology, Not Science |last= Johnson |first= Phillip E. |date= October 2004 |website= DarwinReconsidered.org |accessdate= Sep 29, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220342/http://www.darwinreconsidered.org/media/MaterialistMythology.pdf |archive-date= July 25, 2011 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents argue that the [[scientific method]] excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards [[supernatural]] elements, thus effectively excluding religious insight from contributing to understanding the [[universe]]. This leads to an open and often hostile opposition to what neo-creationists term &quot;[[Darwinism]]&quot;, which they generally mean to refer to [[evolution]], but which they may extend to include such concepts as [[abiogenesis]], [[stellar evolution]] and the [[Big Bang]] theory.

Unlike their philosophical forebears, neo-creationists largely do not believe in many of the traditional cornerstones of creationism such as a young Earth, or in a dogmatically [[Biblical inerrancy|literal interpretation of the Bible]].

ID originated as a re-branding of creation science in an attempt to avoid a series of court decisions ruling out the teaching of creationism in American public schools, and the Discovery Institute has run [[Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns|a series of campaigns]] to change school curricula.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flank_April2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |title=Creationism/ID: A Short Legal History |last=Flank |first=Lenny |website=Talk Reason |date=April 24, 2006 |accessdate=2014-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063247/http://www.talkreason.org/articles/HistoryID.cfm |archivedate=August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, where curricula are under the control of state governments rather than local school boards, there was a public outcry when the notion of ID being taught in science classes was raised by the Federal Education Minister [[Brendan Nelson]]; the minister quickly conceded that the correct forum for ID, if it were to be taught, is in religious or philosophy classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Deborah |date=October 21, 2005 |title=Intelligent design not science: experts |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/intelligent-design-not-science-experts/2005/10/20/1129775902661.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=Sydney |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, teaching of intelligent design in public schools has been decisively ruled by a [[United States district court|federal district court]] to be in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District|Kitzmiller v. Dover]], the court found that intelligent design is not science and &quot;cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Kitzmiller v.

This sets a [[Precedent#Persuasive precedent|persuasive precedent]], based on previous US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions in ''Edwards v. Aguillard'' and ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' (1968), and by the application of the [[Lemon v.

===Geocentrism===
{{Main|Geocentric model}}
In [[astronomy]], the geocentric model (also known as geocentrism, or the Ptolemaic system), is a description of the [[Cosmos]] where Earth is at the orbital center of all celestial bodies. This model served as the predominant cosmological system in many ancient civilizations such as [[ancient Greece]]. As such, they assumed that the Sun, Moon, stars, and [[Classical planet|naked eye planets]] circled Earth, including the noteworthy systems of [[Aristotle]] (see [[Aristotelian physics]]) and [[Ptolemy]].

Articles arguing that geocentrism was the biblical perspective appeared in some early creation science newsletters associated with the Creation Research Society pointing to some passages in the Bible, which, when taken literally, indicate that the daily apparent motions of the Sun and the Moon are due to their actual motions around the Earth rather than due to the rotation of the Earth about its axis for example, [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 10:12 where the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and [[Psalms]] 93:1 where the world is described as immobile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Numbers1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Numbers |first=Ronald L. |year=1993 |origyear=Originally published 1992; New York: [[Alfred A.

Most contemporary creationist organizations reject such perspectives.{{refn|group=&quot;note&quot;|Donald B. DeYoung, for example, states that &quot;Similar terminology is often used today when we speak of the sun's rising and setting, even though the earth, not the sun, is doing the moving.

When the Bible touches on scientific subjects, it is entirely accurate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/1997/11/05/astronomy-bible |title=Astronomy and the Bible: Selected questions and answers excerpted from the book |last=DeYoung |first=Donald B. |date=November 5, 1997 |website=[[Answers in Genesis]] |publisher=Answers in Genesis Ministries International |location=Hebron, KY |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Omphalos hypothesis ===
{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}
The Omphalos hypothesis argues that in order for the world to be functional, God must have created a mature Earth with mountains and canyons, rock strata, trees with growth rings, and so on; therefore ''no'' evidence that we can see of the presumed age of the Earth and age of the universe can be taken as reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gosse 1857|Gosse 1857]]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has seen some revival in the 20th century by some modern creationists, who have extended the argument to address the [[Creationist cosmologies#Starlight problem|&quot;starlight problem&quot;]]. The idea has been criticised as [[Last Thursdayism]], and on the grounds that it requires a deliberately deceptive creator.

==Theistic evolution==
{{Main|Theistic evolution}}
Theistic evolution, or evolutionary creation, is a belief that &quot;the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sweet &amp; Feist 2007|Sweet &amp; Feist 2007]], [https://books.google.com/?id=qwaRUNj6S34C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=theistic+evolution+evolutionary+creation#v=onepage&amp;q=theistic%20evolution%20evolutionary%20creation&amp;f=false p. 48], &quot;''Evolutionary Creation'' (or Theistic Evolution) asserts that the personal God of the Bible created the universe and life through evolutionary processes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Scientific Affiliation:

{{quote|A theory of theistic evolution (TE){{snd}}also called evolutionary creation{{snd}}proposes that God's method of creation was to cleverly design a universe in which everything would naturally evolve.

Through the 19th century the term ''creationism'' most commonly referred to [[Creationism (soul)|direct creation of individual souls]], in contrast to [[traducianism]]. Following the publication of ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', there was interest in ideas of Creation by [[divine law]]. In particular, the [[liberal Christianity|liberal theologian]] [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] argued that this illustrated the Creator's power better than the idea of miraculous creation, which he thought ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; When ''On the Origin of Species'' was published, the cleric [[Charles Kingsley]] wrote of evolution as &quot;just as noble a conception of Deity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Darwinanddesign&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |title=Darwin and design: historical essay |year=2007 |website=Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=Cambridge University Library |location=Cambridge, UK |accessdate=2012-04-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021101910/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-design-article |archivedate=2014-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2534 |title=Kingsley, Charles to Darwin, C.

Eventually it was realised that supernatural intervention could not be a scientific explanation, and naturalistic mechanisms such as [[Lamarckism#Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckism]] were favoured as being more compatible with purpose than natural selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;bowl202&quot;&gt;[[#Bowler 2003|Bowler 2003]], pp. 202–08&lt;/ref&gt;

Some theists took the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] and creation are compatible with some or all of modern scientific theory, including specifically evolution; it is also known as &quot;evolutionary creation.&quot; In Evolution versus Creationism, [[Eugenie Scott]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] state that it is in fact a type of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 2005|Scott 2005]], pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

It generally views evolution as a tool used by God, who is both the [[Unmoved mover#First cause|first cause]] and [[Immanence|immanent]] sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well accepted by people of strong [[theism|theistic]] (as opposed to [[deism|deistic]]) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the day-age creationist interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative; however most adherents consider that the first chapters of the Book of Genesis should not be interpreted as a &quot;literal&quot; description, but rather as a [[framework view|literary framework]] or allegory.

From a theistic viewpoint, the underlying laws of nature were designed by God for a purpose, and are so self-sufficient that the complexity of the entire physical universe evolved from fundamental particles in processes such as [[stellar evolution]], life forms developed in biological evolution, and in the same way the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life by natural causes]] has resulted from these laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Origin of Life&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/abioprob/originoflife.html#intro |title=The Origin of Life |last=Moritz |first=Albrecht |date=October 31, 2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one form or another, theistic evolution is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline [[Protestantism|Protestant]] seminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott 1999|Scott 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; For Roman Catholics, human evolution is not a matter of religious teaching, and must stand or fall on its own scientific merits. [[Catholic Church and evolution|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church]] are not in conflict. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] comments positively on the theory of evolution, which is neither precluded nor required by the sources of faith, stating that scientific studies &quot;have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Akin |first=Jimmy |date=January 2004 |title=Evolution and the Magisterium |url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |journal=[[Catholic Answers|This Rock]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |issn=1049-4561 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804102139/http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2004/0401bt.asp |archivedate=2007-08-04 |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] schools teach evolution without controversy on the basis that scientific knowledge does not extend beyond the physical, and scientific truth and religious truth cannot be in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Guntzel |first=Jeff Severns |url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005a/032505/032505ssn.htm |date=March 25, 2005 |title=Catholic schools steer clear of anti-evolution bias |newspaper=[[National Catholic Reporter]] |location=Kansas City, MO |publisher=The National Catholic Reporter Publishing Company |issn=0027-8939 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theistic evolution can be described as &quot;creationism&quot; in holding that [[Miracle|divine intervention]] brought about the origin of life or that divine laws govern formation of species, though many creationists (in the strict sense) would deny that the position is creationism at all.

[[George Coyne]], (the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]'s chief astronomer between 1978 and 2006):&lt;blockquote&gt;...in America, creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis.

==Religious views==

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{main|Bahai Faith and science#Creation}}
In the creation myth taught by [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Bahá'í Faith]] founder, the universe has &quot;neither beginning nor ending,&quot; and that the component elements of the material world have always existed and will always exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[#`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982|`Abdu'l-Bahá 1982]], [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-79.html#gr8 p. 220]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to evolution and the origin of human beings, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] gave extensive comments on the subject when he addressed western audiences in the beginning of the 20th century. Transcripts of these comments can be found in ''[[Some Answered Questions]]'', ''[[Paris Talks]]'' and ''The Promulgation of Universal Peace''. `Abdu'l-Bahá described the human species as having evolved from a primitive form to modern man, but that the capacity to form human intelligence was always in existence.

===Christianity===
{{Further|Genesis creation narrative|creation–evolution controversy}}
{{As of|2006}}, most [[Christians]] around the world accepted evolution as the most likely explanation for the origins of species, and did not take a [[Biblical literalism|literal view]] of the [[Genesis creation myth]]. The United States is an exception where belief in religious [[fundamentalism]] is much more likely to affect attitudes towards evolution than it is for believers elsewhere. Political partisanship affecting religious belief may be a factor because political partisanship in the US is highly correlated with fundamentalist thinking, unlike in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Science survey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Jon D. |last2=Scott |first2=Eugenie C. |authorlink2=Eugenie Scott |last3=Okamoto |first3=Shinji |date=August 2006 |title=Public acceptance of evolution |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=313 |issue=5788 |pages=765–66 |doi=10.1126/science.1126746 |pmid=16902112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; churches have made statements in favor of evolutionary theory, as have scholars such as the physicist [[John Polkinghorne]], who argues that evolution is one of the principles through which God created living beings. Earlier supporters of evolutionary theory include [[Frederick Temple]], Asa Gray and Charles Kingsley who were enthusiastic supporters of Darwin's theories upon their publication,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polkinghorne 1998|Polkinghorne 1998]], pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the French Jesuit priest and geologist [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] saw evolution as confirmation of his Christian beliefs, despite condemnation from Church authorities for his more speculative theories. Another example is that of [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal theology]], not providing any creation models, but instead focusing on the [[symbol]]ism in beliefs of the time of authoring Genesis and the cultural environment.

Many Christians and Jews had been considering the idea of the creation history as an allegory (instead of historical) long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution. For example, Philo, whose works were taken up by early Church writers, wrote that it would be a mistake to think that creation happened in six days, or in any set amount of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philo_Chapter2&quot;&gt;[[#Philo|Philo]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.earlychurch.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/philo.php |title=Philo of Alexandria (c. 20&amp;nbsp;BC{{snd}}c. AD&amp;nbsp;50) |last=Bradshaw |first=Rob |website=Early Church.org.uk |publisher=Steve Bradshaw |location=West Wickham, England |accessdate=December 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine of the late fourth century who was also a former neoplatonist argued that everything in the universe was created by God at the same moment in time (and not in six days as a literal reading of the Book of Genesis would seem to require);&lt;ref name=&quot;Augustine&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Young |first=Davis A. |date=March 1988 |title=The Contemporary Relevance of Augustine's View of Creation |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html |journal=[[American Scientific Affiliation|Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]] |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=42–45 |issn=0892-2675 |accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that both Philo and Augustine felt uncomfortable with the idea of a seven-day creation because it detracted from the notion of God's omnipotence. In 1950, [[Pope Pius XII]] stated limited support for the idea in his [[Encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] ''[[Humani generis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |author=Pope Pius XII |authorlink=Pope Pius XII |title=Humani Generis |website=Vatican: the Holy See |publisher=[[Holy See]] |location=St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City |type=[[Encyclical#Catholic usage|Papal encyclical]] |date=August 12, 1950 |accessdate=2011-11-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419021937/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html |archivedate=April 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Pope John Paul II]] stated that &quot;new knowledge has led to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than a hypothesis,&quot; but, referring to previous papal writings, he concluded that &quot;if the human body takes its origin from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual [[soul]] is immediately created by God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Pope John Paul II |authorlink=Pope John Paul II |date=October 30, 1996 |title=Magisterium is concerned with question of evolution, for it involves conception of man |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~nmcenter/sci-cp/evolution.html |newspaper=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] |type=Message to the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] |edition=Weekly English |location=Tipografia Vaticana, Vatican City |publisher=Holy See |number=44 |pages=3, 7 |accessdate=2014-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321064939/http://www.its.caltech.edu/%7Enmcenter/sci-cp/evolution.html |archive-date=March 21, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, Evangelical Christians have continued to believe in a literal Genesis. Members of evangelical Protestant (70%), [[Mormons|Mormon]] (76%) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (90%) denominations are the most likely to reject the evolutionary interpretation of the origins of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |year=2008 |title=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey |url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2religious-landscape-study-chapter-2.pdf |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]] |location=Washington, D.C. |chapter=Social and Political Views |page=95 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-03-19}} Report 2: Religious Beliefs &amp; Practices, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jehovah's Witnesses adhere to a combination of [[gap creationism]] and [[day-age creationism]], asserting that scientific evidence about the age of the universe is compatible with the Bible, but that the 'days' after Genesis 1:1 were each thousands of years in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|title=Historical Dictionary of Jehovah's Witnesses|date=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810862692|page=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx6nUwZzeCsC&amp;pg=PA37|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historic Christian literal interpretation of creation requires the harmonization of the two creation stories, Genesis 1:1–2:3 and Genesis 2:4–25, for there to be a consistent interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apologeticspress.org/articles/2194 |title=Are There Two Creation Accounts in Genesis? |last=Jackson |first=Wayne |website=Apologetics Press |location=Montgomery, Al |accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |last=Tobin |first=Paul N. |year=2000 |title=The Creation Myths: Internal Difficulties |website=The Rejection of Pascal's Wager: A Skeptic's Guide to Christianity |publisher=Paul Tobin |location=Singapore |accessdate=2014-03-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008175621/http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/creationint.html |archivedate=2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes seek to ensure that their belief is taught in science classes, mainly in American schools. Opponents reject the claim that the literalistic biblical view meets the criteria required to be considered scientific. Many religious groups teach that God created the Cosmos. From the days of the early Christian Church Fathers there were allegorical interpretations of the Book of Genesis as well as literal aspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsf&quot;&gt;[[#Forster &amp; Marston 1999|Forster &amp; Marston 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]], a system of thought and practice derived from the writings of [[Mary Baker Eddy]], interprets the Book of Genesis figuratively rather than literally. It holds that the material world is an illusion, and consequently not created by God: the only real creation is the spiritual realm, of which the material world is a distorted version. Christian Scientists regard the story of the creation in the Book of Genesis as having symbolic rather than literal meaning. According to Christian Science,  both creationism and evolution are false from an absolute or &quot;spiritual&quot; point of view, as they both proceed from a (false) belief in the reality of a material universe. However, Christian Scientists do not oppose the teaching of evolution in schools, nor do they demand that alternative accounts be taught: they believe that both material science and literalist theology are concerned with the illusory, mortal and material, rather than the real, immortal and spiritual. With regard to material theories of creation, Eddy showed a preference for Darwin's theory of evolution over others.&lt;ref name=S&amp;Hp547&gt;[[#Eddy 1934|Eddy 1934]], p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hindu views on evolution}}
Hindu creationists claim that species of [[plants]] and [[animals]] are material forms adopted by pure consciousness which live an endless cycle of births and rebirths.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McGrath 2010|McGrath 2010]], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Numbers]] says that: &quot;Hindu Creationists have insisted on the antiquity of humans, who they believe appeared fully formed as long, perhaps, as trillions of years ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Numbers 2006|Numbers 2006]], p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu creationism is a form of old Earth creationism, according to Hindu creationists the universe may even be older than billions of years. These views are based on the [[Vedas]], the creation myths of which depict an extreme antiquity of the universe and history of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carper &amp; Hunt 2009|Carper &amp; Hunt 2009]], p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dasgupta 1922|Dasgupta 1922]], p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic views on evolution}}
[[Islamic views on evolution|Islamic creationism]] is the belief that the universe (including humanity) was directly created by [[God in Islam|God]] as explained in the [[Quran|Qur'an]]. It usually views the Book of Genesis as a corrupted version of God's message. The creation myths in the Qur'an are vaguer and allow for a wider range of interpretations similar to those in other Abrahamic religions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

Islam also has its own school of theistic evolutionism, which holds that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Some [[Muslims]] believe in evolutionary creation, especially among [[liberal movements within Islam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffpo&quot;/&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Drake Bennett noted: &quot;Without a Book of Genesis to account for ... Muslim creationists have little interest in proving that the age of the Earth is measured in the thousands rather than the billions of years, nor do they show much interest in the problem of the dinosaurs. And the idea that animals might evolve into other animals also tends to be less controversial, in part because there are passages of the Koran that seem to support it. But the issue of whether human beings are the product of evolution is just as fraught among Muslims.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bennett 4&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Bennett |first=Drake |date=October 25, 2009 |title=Islam's Darwin problem |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |location=Boston, MA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030044754/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/10/25/in_the_muslim_world_creationism_is_on_the_rise/?page=full |archivedate=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some Muslims, such as [[Adnan Oktar]] (also known as Harun Yahya), do not agree that one species can develop from another.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrizeforFossil&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/3102103/Creationist-Adnan-Oktar-offers-trillion-pound-prize-for-fossil-proof-of-evolution.html |last=Irvine |first=Chris |date=September 29, 2008 |title=Creationist Adnan Oktar offers trillion-pound prize for fossil proof of evolution |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian0104&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=January 7, 2004 |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/conferences/story/0,,1117752,00.html |title=Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools |newspaper=The Guardian |type=Conferences |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish views on evolution}}
For [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] who seek to reconcile discrepancies between science and the creation myths in the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the [[Torah]] and if there seems to be a problem, [[Epistemology|epistemological]] limits are to blame for apparently irreconcilable points. They point to discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They note that even the root word for &quot;world&quot; in the [[Hebrew language]]—עולם (Olam)—means hidden—נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they know from the Torah that God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their observed state, so too can they know that the world was created in its over the six days of Creation that reflects progression to its currently-observed state, with the understanding that physical ways to verify this may eventually be identified. This knowledge has been advanced by Rabbi [[Dovid Gottlieb]], former philosophy professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Also, relatively old [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the first-century [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]]. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the [[Sefer HaTemunah]], including the medieval Jewish scholar [[Nahmanides]], his close student [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]], and [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]]. Other parallels are derived, among other sources, from Nahmanides, who expounds that there was a [[Neanderthal]]-like species with which Adam mated (he did this long before Neanderthals had even been discovered scientifically).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aviezer 1990|Aviezer 1990]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Carmell &amp; Domb 1976|Carmell &amp; Domb 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schroeder 1998|Schroeder 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tigay |first=Jeffrey H. |date=Winter 1987–1988 |title=Genesis, Science, and 'Scientific Creationism' |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jtigay/sci.htm |journal=[[Conservative Judaism (journal)|Conservative Judaism]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=20–27 |issn=0010-6542 |accessdate=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reform Judaism]] does not take the Torah as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic or open-ended work.

Some contemporary writers such as Rabbi Gedalyah Nadel have sought to reconcile the discrepancy between the account in the Torah, and scientific findings by arguing that each day referred to in the Bible was not 24 hours, but billions of years long.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the Earth was created a few thousand years ago, but was deliberately made to look as if it was five billion years old, e.g. by being created with ready made fossils. The best known exponent of this approach being Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;   Others state that although the world was physically created in six 24 hour days, the Torah accounts can be interpreted to mean that there was a period of billions of years before the six days of creation.&lt;ref&gt;The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution, Natan Slifkin, Zoo Torah, 2006, pp. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, literalist creationism is more widely rejected, though regular opinion polls are not available. Most people accept that evolution is the most widely accepted scientific theory as taught in most schools. In countries with a Roman Catholic majority, [[Catholic Church and evolution|papal acceptance of evolutionary creationism]] as worthy of study has essentially ended debate on the matter for many people.

According to a 2011 Fox News poll, 45% of Americans believe in Creationism, down from 50% in a similar poll in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox Creationism Poll&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 7, 2011 |title=Fox News Poll: Creationism |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/09/07/fox-news-poll-creationism/ |work=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] |publisher=[[News Corporation (1980–2013)|News Corporation]] |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21% believe in 'the theory of evolution as outlined by Darwin and other scientists' (up from 15% in 1999), and 27% answered that both are true (up from 26% in 1999).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox Creationism Poll&quot; /&gt;

In September 2012, educator and television personality Bill Nye spoke with the [[Associated Press]] and aired his fears about acceptance of creationism, believing that teaching children that creationism is the only true answer without letting them understand the way science works will prevent any future innovation in the world of science.&lt;ref name=&quot;APNews-20120924&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Luvan |first=Dylan |date=September 24, 2012 |title=Bill Nye Warns: Creation Views Threaten US Science |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bill-nye-warns-creation-views-threaten-us-science |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Youtube-20120823&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Fowler |first=Jonathan |last2=Rodd |first2=Elizabeth |title=Bill Nye: Creationism Is Not Appropriate For Children |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHbYJfwFgOU |date=August 23, 2012 |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=[[Big Think]] |location=New York |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20141103-JD&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Deiviscio |first=Jeffrey |title=A Fight for the Young Creationist Mind: In 'Undeniable,' Bill Nye Speaks Evolution Directly to Creationists |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/science/in-undeniable-bill-nye-speaks-evolution-directly-to-creationists.html |date=November 3, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=November 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, Nye defended [[creation–evolution controversy|evolution in the classroom]] in a [[Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate|debate]] with creationist Ken Ham on the topic of whether creation is a viable model of origins in today's modern, [[History of science#Modern science|scientific era]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NBC-20140204&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Boyle |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Boyle |date=February 5, 2014 |title=Bill Nye Wins Over the Science Crowd at Evolution Debate |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bill-nye-wins-over-science-crowd-evolution-debate-n22836 |work=[[NBCNews.com]] |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TG-20140204&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Kopplin |first=Zack |authorlink=Zack Kopplin |date=February 4, 2014 |title=Why Bill Nye the Science Guy is trying to reason with America's creationists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/04/bill-nye-science-guy-evolution-debate-creationists |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Debate-20140204&quot;&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6kgvhG3AkI |title=Bill Nye Debates Ken Ham |last=Foreman |first=Tom (Moderator) |authorlink=Tom Foreman |date=February 4, 2014 |website=YouTube |publisher=Answers in Genesis |location=Hebron, KY |accessdate=2014-02-05}} (program begins at 13:14).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education controversies===

{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}

====Brazil====
In 2004, [[Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics|IBOPE]] conducted a poll in Brazil that asked questions about creationism and the teaching of creationism in schools. When asked if creationism should be taught in schools, 89% of people said that creationism should be taught in schools. When asked if the teaching of creationism should replace the teaching of evolution in schools, 75% of people said that the teaching of creationism should replace the teaching of evolution in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PESQUISA DE OPINIÃO PÚBLICA SOBRE O CRIACIONISMO |url=https://www.ibopeinteligencia.com/arquivos/Opp992-Revista%20Época.pdf |accessdate=28 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Massarani |first1=Luisa |title=Few in Brazil accept scientific view of human evolution |url=https://www.scidev.net/global/news/few-in-brazil-accept-scientific-view-of-human-evol.html?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=3db80bde134aad76fe4285cfaeed6e354fd97c72-1582882114-0-ASBOFk14ZDxkJ4xjN6P6BtFxadYy2cWGqdIKUz6Giah5WRWFmdjzVzGPK_xPEA3y89pte312oqQQoAo-oVeS-vac704J9xxM8_BTFtMCmaIgjaz0SqvO07ptSolYQInRu5fL355V22b2HYMMBnlobBOOKD7ICmzuMG2K_tP03DtRkQ4GQYTZClIAVq6YpjKaXanoOEXLfgd9fd1dqNhBdnOg9EaWwqF32dj-FxPdYNkYTEbs0shQdl7oRTdPOKJuVtkwdZ54itUK-JNc5_lVladlkYV0XyanWeBArkEGE9tlLWMNl8Ll9Hv5_aoGhPC1q91ilVoTVMZySjLNEAJKJhZLqtLW4o3do3UZr8AnkpUM |accessdate=28 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
In 2019, a Research Co. poll asked people in Canada if creationism “should be part of the school curriculum in their province“. 38% of Canadians said that creationism should be part of the school curriculum, 39% of Canadians said that it should not be part of the school curriculum, and 23% of Canadians were undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Canseco |first1=Mario |title=Most Canadians Believe Human Beings on Earth Evolved |url=https://researchco.ca/2019/12/04/creationism-evolution-canada/ |accessdate=28 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
In the US, creationism has become centered in the political controversy over [[Creation and evolution in public education#United States|creation and evolution in public education]], and whether teaching creationism in science classes conflicts with the separation of church and state. Currently, the controversy comes in the form of whether advocates of the intelligent design movement who wish to &quot;[[Teach the Controversy]]&quot; in science classes have conflated [[Relationship between religion and science|science with religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kitz&quot; /&gt;

[[People for the American Way]] polled 1500 North Americans about the teaching of evolution and creationism in November and December 1999. They found that most North Americans were not familiar with Creationism, and most North Americans had heard of evolution, but many did not fully understand the basics of the theory. The main findings were:

In such political contexts, creationists argue that their particular religiously based origin belief is superior to those of other [[belief system]]s, in particular those made through secular or scientific rationale. Political creationists are opposed by many individuals and organizations who have made detailed critiques and given testimony in various court cases that the [[objections to evolution|alternatives to scientific reasoning offered by creationists]] are opposed by the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] of the scientific community.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|title=Statement on the Teaching of Evolution|date=February 16, 2006|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]|location=Washington, D.C.|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221125539/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2006/pdf/0219boardstatement.pdf|archivedate=2006-02-21|accessdate=2014-03-09}}

==Criticism==
===Christian criticism===
Most Christians disagree with the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Exploring and Proclaiming the Apostles' Creed |first1=Roger |last1=van Harn |first2=David F. |last2=Ford |first3=Colin E. |last3=Gunton |publisher=A&amp;C Black |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8192-8116-6 |page=44 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GCXUAwAAQBAJ Extract of page 44]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism |first1=Aron |last1=Ra |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-63431-079-6 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=F-rvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182 Extract of page 182]&lt;/ref&gt; Several religious organizations, among them the [[Catholic Church]], hold that their faith does not conflict with the scientific consensus regarding evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/media/voices/religion |title=Statements from Religious Organizations |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2011-03-10|date=2008-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clergy Letter Project]], which has collected more than 13,000 signatures, is an &quot;endeavor designed to demonstrate that religion and science can be compatible.&quot;

In his 2002 article &quot;Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem,&quot; George Murphy argues against the view that life on Earth, in all its forms, is direct evidence of God's act of creation (Murphy quotes [[Phillip E. Johnson]]'s claim that he is speaking &quot;of a God who acted openly and left his fingerprints on all the evidence.&quot;). Murphy argues that this view of God is incompatible with the Christian understanding of God as &quot;the one revealed in the cross and resurrection of Christ.&quot; The basis of this theology is [[Isaiah]] 45:15, &quot;Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour.&quot;

Murphy observes that the execution of a Jewish carpenter by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities is in and of itself an ordinary event and did not require [[Miracle|divine action]]. On the contrary, for the crucifixion to occur, God had to limit or &quot;empty&quot; himself. It was for this reason that [[Paul the Apostle]] wrote, in [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:5-8:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murphy concludes that,&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as the Son of God limited himself by taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine action in the world to be in accord with rational laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on its own terms, but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a [[Naturalism (philosophy)#Methodological naturalism|''methodological'' naturalism]], meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a [[Metaphysical naturalism|''metaphysical'' naturalism]], which proposes that nature is all that there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=George L. |year=2002 |title=Intelligent Design as a Theological Problem |url=http://puffin.creighton.edu/nrcse/IDTHG.html |journal=Covalence: The Bulletin of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America Alliance for Faith, Science and Technology |volume=IV |issue=2 |oclc=52753579 |accessdate=2014-03-31}} Reprinted with permission.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit priest [[George Coyne]] has stated that is &quot;unfortunate that, especially here in America, creationism has come to mean...some literal interpretation of Genesis.&quot; He argues that &quot;...Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in belief that everything depends on God, or better, all is a gift from God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purcell|first1=Brendan|title=From Big Bang to Big Mystery: Human Origins in the Light of Creation and Evolution|date=2012|publisher=New City Press of the Focolare|isbn=978-1565484337|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching of creationism===
Other Christians have expressed qualms about teaching creationism. In March 2006, then Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams, the leader of the world's Anglicans, stated his discomfort about teaching creationism, saying that creationism was &quot;a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories.&quot; He also said: &quot;My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it.&quot; The views of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]{{snd}}a major American-based branch of the Anglican Communion{{snd}}on teaching creationism resemble those of Williams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archbishop_2006&quot; /&gt;

The National Science Teachers Association is opposed to teaching creationism as a science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NSTA Position Statement: The Teaching of Evolution |publisher=National Science Teachers Association | year=2013 |url=http://www.nsta.org/about/positions/evolution.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the Association for Science Teacher Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= ASTE Position Statement on Teaching Biological Evolution |year=2015 |publisher=Association for Science Teacher Education |url=https://theaste.org/about/aste-position-statement-on-teaching-biological-evolution/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National Association of Biology Teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NABT Position Statement on Teaching Evolution |publisher=National Association of Biology Teachers |year=2011 |url=http://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/?p=92 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916020337/http://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/?p=92 |archivedate=2015-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Anthropological Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statement on Evolution and Creationism |publisher=American Anthropological Association |year=2000 |url=http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2599}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Geosciences Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Geological Institute Position on Teaching Evolution |publisher=American Geoscience Institute |year=2000 |url=http://www.agiweb.org/gapac/evolution_statement.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Geological Society of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2012 |title=Position Statement: Teaching Evolution |publisher=Geological Society of America |url=https://www.geosociety.org/positions/position1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; the American Geophysical Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AGU Position Statement on Teaching Creationism as Science |publisher=American Geophysical Institute |year=1998 |url=http://www.rbsp.info/rbs/CLONE/debate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other professional teaching and scientific societies.

In April 2010, the [[American Academy of Religion]] issued ''Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K‐12 Public Schools in the United States'', which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes, as &quot;Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as (and limited to) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.&quot; However, they, as well as other &quot;worldviews that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses. Such study, however, must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/news/2010/07/american-academy-religion-teaching-creationism-005712 |title=American Academy of Religion on teaching creationism |date=July 23, 2010 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randy Moore and Sehoya Cotner, from the biology program at the [[University of Minnesota]], reflect on the relevance of teaching creationism in the article &quot;The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism?&quot; They conclude that &quot;Despite decades of science education reform, numerous legal decisions declaring the teaching of creationism in public-school science classes to be unconstitutional, overwhelming evidence supporting evolution, and the many denunciations of creationism as nonscientific by professional scientific societies, creationism remains popular throughout the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Randy |last2=Cotner |first2=Sehoya |date=May 2009 |title=The Creationist Down the Hall: Does It Matter When Teachers Teach Creationism? |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=59 |issue=5 |pages=429–35 |doi=10.1525/bio.2009.59.5.10 |issn=0006-3568 |jstor=25502451|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific criticism===
{{Main|Creation–evolution controversy}}
Science is a system of knowledge based on observation, empirical evidence, and the development of theories that yield testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is often based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=12 p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEaC&quot;&gt;[[#NAS 2008|NAS 2008]], [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=10 p. 10], &quot;In science, explanations must be based on naturally occurring phenomena. Natural causes are, in principle, reproducible and therefore can be checked independently by others. If explanations are based on purported forces that are outside of nature, scientists have no way of either confirming or disproving those explanations.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, many creationist beliefs can be framed as testable predictions about phenomena such as the age of the Earth, its [[geological history of Earth|geological history]] and the origins, [[biogeography|distributions]] and [[Phylogenetics|relationships]] of living organisms found on it. [[History of science|Early science]] incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually [[Falsifiability|falsified]] and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html |title=An Index to Creationist Claims |editor-last=Isaak |editor-first=Mark |year=2006 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Futuyma 2005|Futuyma 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RoA&quot;&gt;[[#Gould 1999|Gould 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; consider science and religion to be two compatible and complementary fields, with authorities in distinct areas of human experience, so-called [[non-overlapping magisteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=March 1997 |title=Nonoverlapping Magisteria |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |volume=106 |pages=16–22 |issue=3 |issn=0028-0712 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is also held by many theologians, who believe that [[Unmoved mover|ultimate origins]] and [[meaning of life|meaning]] are addressed by religion, but favor verifiable scientific explanations of natural phenomena over those of creationist beliefs. Other scientists, such as [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dawkins 2006|Dawkins 2006]], p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; reject the non-overlapping magisteria and argue that, in disproving literal interpretations of creationists, the scientific method also undermines religious texts as a source of truth. Irrespective of this diversity in viewpoints, since creationist beliefs are not supported by empirical evidence, the scientific consensus is that any attempt to teach creationism as science should be rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;RoyalSociety_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|title=Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design|date=April 11, 2006|website=[[Royal Society]]|publisher=Royal Society|location=London|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602213726/http://royalsociety.org/news.asp?year=&amp;id=4298|archivedate=2008-06-02|accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/taking-action/ten-major-court-cases-evolution-creationism |title=Ten Major Court Cases about Evolution and Creationism |last1=Matsumura |first1=Molleen |last2=Mead |first2=Louise |date=February 14, 2001 |website=National Center for Science Education |publisher=National Center for Science Education |location=Berkeley, CA |accessdate=2008-11-04}} Updated 2007-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |title=Ann Coulter: No evidence for evolution? |last=Myers |first=PZ |authorlink=PZ Myers |date=June 18, 2006 |website=[[Pharyngula (blog)|Pharyngula]] |publisher=[[ScienceBlogs|ScienceBlogs LLC]] |type=Blog |accessdate=2007-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809011055/http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/06/ann_coulter_no_evidence_for_ev.php |archivedate=August 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
