'''Concrete''' is a [[composite material]] composed of fine and coarse [[construction aggregate|aggregate]] bonded together with a fluid [[cement]] (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. In the past [[Lime (material)|lime]]based cement binders were often used, such as lime putty, but sometimes with other [[hydraulic cement]]s, such as a [[calcium aluminate cements|calcium aluminate cement]] or with [[Portland cement]] to form '''Portland cement concrete''' (for its visual resemblance to [[Portland stone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.industrialresourcescouncil.org/Applications/PortlandCementConcrete/tabid/381/Default.aspx|title=Portland Cement Concrete|last=Industrial Resources Council|date=2008|website=www.industrialresourcescouncil.org|language=en-US|access-date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/pubs/013683.pdf|title=Portland Cement Concrete Materials|last=National Highway Institute|website=|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other non-cementitious [[types of concrete]] exist with different methods of binding aggregate together, including [[asphalt concrete]] with a [[bitumen]] binder, which is frequently used for [[road surface]]s, and [[polymer concrete]]s that use polymers as a binder.

When aggregate is mixed with dry Portland cement and [[water]], the mixture forms a fluid [[slurry]] that is easily poured and molded into shape. The cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone-like material that has many uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Zongjin|last= Li|title = Advanced concrete technology|year= 2011|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn = 9780470902431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, additives (such as [[pozzolan]]s or [[superplasticizer]]s) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material. Most concrete is poured with reinforcing materials (such as [[rebar]]) embedded to provide [[tensile strength]], yielding [[reinforced concrete]].

Because concrete cures (which is not the same as drying such as with paint) how concrete is handled after it is poured is just as important as before. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bobvila.com/articles/curing-concrete/&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete is one of the most frequently used building materials. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cement Trust&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the development impact of concrete?|url=http://cementtrust.wordpress.com/a-concrete-plan/ |publisher=Cement Trust |access-date=10 January 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917144159/http://cementtrust.wordpress.com/a-concrete-plan/ |archivedate=17 September 2012|date=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the ready-mix concrete industry, the largest segment of the concrete market, is projected to exceed $600 billion in revenue by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/4087041 |title = Global Ready-mix Concrete (RMC) Market worth over USD US$ 624.82 Bn by 2025: QY Research, Inc. |work=Digital Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete is distinct from [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. Whereas concrete is itself a building material, mortar is a bonding agent that typically holds [[Brick|bricks]], [[Tile|tiles]] and other masonry units together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of building construction : materials and methods|last=Allen|first=Edward|last2=Iano|first2=Joseph|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2013|isbn=978-1-118-42086-7|edition=Sixth|location=Hoboken|pages=314|oclc=835621943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word concrete comes from the Latin word &quot;''concretus''&quot; (meaning compact or condensed),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=concretus|url=http://latinlookup.com/word/12124/concretus|publisher=Latin Lookup|accessdate=1 October 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512013931/http://latinlookup.com/word/12124/concretus%7Carchivedate%3D12|archive-date=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the perfect passive participle of &quot;''concrescere''&quot;, from &quot;''con''-&quot; (together) and &quot;''crescere''&quot; (to grow).

==History==
===Ancient times===
Mayan concrete at the ruins of Uxmal is referenced in Incidents of Travel in the Yucatan by [[John Lloyd Stephens|John L. Stephens]]. &quot;The roof is flat and had been covered with cement&quot;. &quot;The floors were cement, in some places hard, but, by long exposure, broken, and now crumbling under the feet.&quot; &quot;But throughout the wall was solid, and consisting of large stones imbedded in mortar, almost as hard as rock.&quot;

Small-scale production of concrete-like materials was pioneered by the [[Nabataea|Nabatean]] traders who occupied and controlled a series of oases and developed a small empire in the regions of southern Syria and northern Jordan from the 4th century BC. They discovered the advantages of [[hydraulic lime]], with some self-cementing properties, by 700 BC. They built [[kiln]]s to supply mortar for the construction of [[rubble masonry]] houses, concrete floors, and underground waterproof [[cistern]]s. They kept the cisterns secret as these enabled the Nabataeans to thrive in the desert.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm#ixzz31V47Zuuj|title=The History of Concrete|last=Gromicko|first=Nick|last2=Shepard|first2=Kenton|date=2016|website=International Association of Certified Home Inspectors, Inc.|access-date=27 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these structures survive to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

===Classical era===
In the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian and later [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras, builders discovered that adding [[Pozzolan|volcanic ash]] to the mix allowed it to set underwater.

Concrete floors were found in the royal palace of [[Tiryns]], Greece, which dates roughly to 1400–1200 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Heinrich Schliemann|author2=Wilhelm Dörpfeld|author3=Felix Adler|title=Tiryns: The Prehistoric Palace of the Kings of Tiryns, the Results of the Latest Excavations|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_pw4BAAAAMAAJ|year=1885|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_pw4BAAAAMAAJ/page/n266 190], 203–04, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|first =Amelia Carolina|last = Sparavigna|title = Ancient concrete works|eprint= 1110.5230|class = physics.pop-ph|year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lime mortars were used in Greece, Crete, and Cyprus in 800 BC.

The Romans used concrete extensively from 300 BC to 476 AD.&lt;ref name=MAST&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Concrete|url=http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/hist.html|publisher=Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=8 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127052951/http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/hist.html|archivedate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Roman Empire, [[Roman concrete]] (or ''[[opus caementicium]]'') was made from [[quicklime]], [[pozzolana]] and an aggregate of [[pumice]]. Its widespread use in many [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman structures]], a key event in the [[history of architecture]] termed the [[Roman architectural revolution]], freed [[Roman engineering|Roman construction]] from the restrictions of stone and brick materials. It enabled revolutionary new designs in terms of both structural complexity and dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lancaster| first = Lynne| title = Concrete Vaulted Construction in Imperial Rome. Innovations in Context| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date = 2005| isbn = 978-0-511-16068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Colosseum]] in Rome was built largely of concrete, and the concrete dome of the Pantheon is the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/chapt01/chapt01.htm |title=The Pantheon |first=David |last=Moore |work=romanconcrete.com |date=1999 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001052926/http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/chapt01/chapt01.htm |archivedate=1 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concrete, as the Romans knew it, was a new and revolutionary material. Laid in the shape of [[arch]]es, [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] and [[List of Roman domes|domes]], it quickly hardened into a rigid mass, free from many of the internal thrusts and strains that troubled the builders of similar structures in stone or brick.&lt;ref&gt;D.S. Robertson (1969). ''Greek and Roman Architecture'', Cambridge, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern tests show that ''opus caementicium'' had as much compressive strength as modern Portland-cement concrete (ca. {{convert|200|kg/cm2|MPa psi|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Cowan (1977). ''The Masterbuilders'', New York, p. 56, {{ISBN|978-0-471-02740-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the absence of reinforcement, its [[Ultimate tensile strength|tensile strength]] was far lower than modern [[reinforced concrete]], and its mode of application was also different:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1101/notes/concrete/section_2_history.html History of Concrete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227213256/http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1101/notes/concrete/section_2_history.html |date=27 February 2017 |publisher=University of Memphis| access-date= 19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Modern structural concrete differs from Roman concrete in two important details. First, its mix consistency is fluid and homogeneous, allowing it to be poured into forms rather than requiring hand-layering together with the placement of aggregate, which, in Roman practice, often consisted of [[rubble]]. Second, integral reinforcing steel gives modern concrete assemblies great strength in tension, whereas Roman concrete could depend only upon the strength of the concrete bonding to resist tension.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mark, Paul Hutchinson: &quot;On the Structure of the Roman Pantheon&quot;, ''Art Bulletin'', Vol. 68, No. 1 (1986), p. 26, fn. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The long-term durability of Roman concrete structures has been found to be due to its use of [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] (volcanic) rock and ash, whereby crystallization of strätlingite (a specific and complex calcium aluminosilicate hydrate)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1151-2916.1995.tb08910.x|title = 29Si and27Al MASNMR Study of Stratlingite|journal = Journal of the American Ceramic Society |volume = 78|issue = 7|pages = 1921–1926|year = 1995|last1 = Kwan|first1 = Stephen|last2 = Larosa|first2 = Judith |last3=Grutzeck |first3= Michael W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the coalescence of this and similar calcium–aluminum-silicate–hydrate cementing binders helped give the concrete a greater degree of fracture resistance even in seismically active environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mechanical resilience and cementitious processes in Imperial Roman architectural mortar|first1=Marie D.|last1=Jackson|first2=Eric N.|last2=Landis|first3=Philip F.|last3=Brune|first4=Massimo|last4=Vitti|first5=Heng|last5=Chen|first6=Qinfei|last6=Li|first7=Martin|last7=Kunz|first8=Hans-Rudolf|last8=Wenk|first9=Paulo J.

The widespread use of concrete in many Roman structures ensured that many survive to the present day. The [[Baths of Caracalla]] in Rome are just one example. Many [[Roman aqueduct]]s and bridges, such as the magnificent [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France, have masonry cladding on a concrete core, as does the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]].

After the Roman Empire collapsed, use of concrete became rare until the technology was redeveloped in the mid-18th century. Worldwide, concrete has overtaken steel in tonnage of material used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9suuDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=concrete+usage+Vaclav+Smil#v=onepage&amp;q=concrete&amp;f=false|title=Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization|last=Smil|first=Vaclav|date=2016|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|isbn=978-1365581908|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
After the Roman Empire, the use of burned lime and pozzolana was greatly reduced. Low kiln temperatures in the burning of lime, lack of pozzolana and poor mixing all contributed to a decline in the quality of concrete and mortar. From the 11th century, the increased use of stone in church and [[castle]] construction led to an increased demand for mortar. Quality began to improve in the 12th century through better grinding and sieving. Medieval lime mortars and concretes were non-hydraulic and were used for binding masonry, &quot;hearting&quot; (binding [[rubble masonry]] cores) and foundations. [[Bartholomaeus Anglicus]] in his ''De proprietatibus rerum'' (1240) describes the making of mortar. In an English translation of 1397, it reads &quot;lyme ... is a stone brent; by medlynge thereof with sonde and water sement is made&quot;. From the 14th century the quality of mortar is again excellent, but only from the 17th century is pozzolana commonly added.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hewlett and Martin Liska (eds.), ''Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete'', 5th ed. (Butterworth-Heinemann, 2019), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the greatest step forward in the modern use of concrete was [[Smeaton's Tower]], built by British engineer [[John Smeaton]] in Devon, England, between 1756 and 1759. This third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] pioneered the use of [[hydraulic lime]] in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate.&lt;ref name=InterNACHI&gt;{{cite web|title=the History of Concrete|url=http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm|publisher=The International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI)|author=Nick Gromicko|author2=Kenton Shepard|last-author-amp=yes|accessdate=8 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115151648/http://www.nachi.org/history-of-concrete.htm|archivedate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Concrete is a composite material, comprising a matrix of [[#Aggregates|aggregate]] (typically a rocky material) and a binder (typically [[Portland cement]] or [[asphalt]]), which holds the matrix together. Many [[types of concrete]] are available, determined by the formulations of binders and the types of aggregate used to suit the application for the material. These variables determine strength, density, as well as chemical and thermal resistance of the finished product.

Aggregate consists of large chunks of material in a concrete mix, generally a coarse [[gravel]] or crushed rocks such as [[limestone]], or [[granite]], along with finer materials such as [[sand]].

[[#Cement|A cement]], most commonly Portland cement, is the most prevalent kind of concrete binder. For cementitious binders, [[water]] is mixed with the dry powder and aggregate, which produces a semi-liquid slurry that can be shaped, typically by pouring it into a form. The concrete solidifies and hardens through a [[Chemical reaction|chemical process]] called [[mineral hydration|hydration]]. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together, creating a robust stone-like material. Other cementitious materials, such as [[fly ash]] and [[slag cement]], are sometimes added—either pre-blended with the cement or directly as a concrete component—and become a part of the binder for the aggregate. Admixtures are added to modify the cure rate or properties of the material.

[[#Mineral admixtures and blended cements|Mineral admixtures]] use recycled materials as concrete ingredients. Conspicuous materials include [[fly ash]], a by-product of [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plants]]; [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]], a byproduct of [[steelmaking]]; and [[silica fume]], a byproduct of industrial [[electric arc furnace]]s.

Structures employing Portland cement concrete usually include [[#Reinforcement|steel reinforcement]] because this type of concrete can be formulated with high [[compressive strength]], but always has lower [[tensile strength]]. Therefore, it is usually reinforced with materials that are strong in tension, typically [[steel]] [[rebar]].

Other materials can also be used as a concrete binder, the most prevalent alternative is [[asphalt]], which is used as the binder in [[asphalt concrete]].

The ''[[types of concrete#Mix design|mix design]]'' depends on the type of structure being built, how the concrete is mixed and delivered, and how it is placed to form the structure.

===Cement===
{{main|Cement}}
[[File:Stockage de ciments.JPG|thumb|Several tons of bagged cement, about two minutes of output from a 10,000 ton per day [[cement kiln]]]]

Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete, [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and many [[plaster]]s. British masonry worker [[Joseph Aspdin]] patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the similarity of its color to [[Portland stone|Portland limestone]], quarried from the English [[Isle of Portland]] and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a mixture of calcium silicates ([[alite]], [[belite]]), [[tricalcium aluminate|aluminates]] and [[calcium aluminoferrite|ferrites]]—compounds which combine calcium, silicon, aluminum and iron in forms which will react with water. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating [[limestone]] (a source of calcium) with clay or shale (a source of silicon, aluminum and iron) and grinding this product (called ''[[clinker (cement)|clinker]]'') with a source of [[sulfate]] (most commonly [[gypsum]]).

In modern [[cement kiln]]s many advanced features are used to lower the fuel consumption per ton of clinker produced. Cement kilns are extremely large, complex, and inherently dusty industrial installations, and have emissions which must be controlled. Of the various ingredients used to produce a given quantity of concrete, the cement is the most energetically expensive. Even complex and efficient kilns require 3.3 to 3.6 gigajoules of energy to produce a ton of clinker and then [[Cement mill|grind it into cement]]. Many kilns can be fueled with difficult-to-dispose-of wastes, the most common being used tires. The extremely high temperatures and long periods of time at those temperatures allows cement kilns to efficiently and completely burn even difficult-to-use fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cement Production|url=http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf|publisher=IEA ETSAP- Energy Technology Systems Analysis Programme|accessdate=9 January 2013|author=Evelien Cochez|author2=Wouter Nijs|last-author-amp=yes|author3=Giorgio Simbolotti|author4=Giancarlo Tosato|location=IEA ETSAP, Technology Brief I03, June 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124004654/http://www.iea-etsap.org/web/E-TechDS/PDF/I03_cement_June%202010_GS-gct.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Combining [[water]] with a cementitious material forms a cement paste by the process of hydration. The cement paste glues the aggregate together, fills voids within it, and makes it flow more freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibbons|first=Jack|title=Measuring Water in Concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-construction/measuring-water-in-concrete.aspx|publisher=Concrete Construction|accessdate=1 October 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511192721/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/concrete-construction/measuring-water-in-concrete.aspx|archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated by [[Abrams' law]], a lower water-to-cement ratio yields a stronger, more [[Reinforced concrete structures durability|durable]] concrete, whereas more water gives a freer-flowing concrete with a higher [[Workability|slump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 9: Designing and Proportioning Normal Concrete Mixtures|url=http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf|work=PCA manual|publisher=Portland Concrete Association|accessdate=1 October 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526015347/http://www.ce.memphis.edu/1112/notes/project_2/PCA_manual/Chap09.pdf|archivedate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impure water used to make concrete can cause problems when setting or in causing premature failure of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taha|first=Ramzi A.|title=Use of Production and Brackish Water in Concrete Mixtures|url=http://www.iasks.org/sites/default/files/swes20100102039043.pdf|work=International Journal of Sustainable Water and Environmental System|accessdate=1 October 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=KAP03 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydration involves many different reactions, often occurring at the same time. As the reactions proceed, the products of the cement hydration process gradually bond together the individual sand and gravel particles and other components of the concrete to form a solid mass.&lt;ref name=Hydration&gt;{{cite web|title=Cement hydration|url=http://www.understanding-cement.com/hydration.html|publisher=Understanding Cement|accessdate=1 October 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017144613/http://www.understanding-cement.com/hydration.html|archivedate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggregates===
{{main|Construction aggregate}}
[[File:Gravel 03375C.JPG|thumbnail|Crushed stone aggregate]]

Fine and coarse aggregates make up the bulk of a concrete mixture. [[Sand]], natural gravel, and [[crushed stone]] are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition, and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled [[blast furnace]] slag and [[bottom ash]] are also permitted.

The size distribution of the aggregate determines how much binder is required. Aggregate with a very even size distribution has the biggest gaps whereas adding aggregate with smaller particles tends to fill these gaps. The binder must fill the gaps between the aggregate as well as paste the surfaces of the aggregate together, and is typically the most expensive component. Thus, variation in sizes of the aggregate reduces the cost of concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/materials/Aggregate/Aggregatesmain.htm The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225184337/http://www.engr.psu.edu/ce/courses/ce584/concrete/library/materials/Aggregate/Aggregatesmain.htm |date=25 December 2012 }}. Engr.psu.edu. Retrieved 19 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The aggregate is nearly always stronger than the binder, so its use does not negatively affect the strength of the concrete.

Redistribution of aggregates after compaction often creates inhomogeneity due to the influence of vibration. This can lead to strength gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| first = Vitaliy I.| last = Veretennykov| first2 = Anatoliy M.| last2 = Yugov| first3 = Andriy O.| last3 = Dolmatov| first4 = Maksym S.| last4 = Bulavytskyi| first5 = Dmytro I.| last5 = Kukharev| first6 = Artem S.| last6 = Bulavytskyi| editor = Mohammed Ettouney| isbn = 978-0-7844-1002-8| title = Concrete Inhomogeneity of Vertical Cast-in-Place Elements in Skeleton-Type Buildings| booktitle = AEI 2008: Building Integration Solutions| publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers| date = 2008| location = Reston, VA| url = http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf| doi = 10.1061/41002(328)17| accessdate = 25 December 2010| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132318/http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf| archivedate = 3 April 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorative stones such as [[quartzite]], small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative &quot;exposed aggregate&quot; finish, popular among landscape designers.

===Reinforcement===
{{main|Reinforced concrete}}
[[File:Fotothek df ps 0000276 Montage von Bewehrungselementen aus Rundstahl.jpg|thumb|upright|Constructing a [[rebar]] cage that will be permanently embedded in a finished [[reinforced concrete]] structure]]

Concrete is strong in [[compression (physical)|compression]], as the aggregate efficiently carries the compression load. However, it is weak in [[Tension (physics)|tension]] as the cement holding the aggregate in place can crack, allowing the structure to fail. [[Reinforced concrete]] adds either [[rebar|steel reinforcing bars]], [[Fiber-reinforced concrete|steel fibers]], [[aramid]] fibers, [[carbon fibers]], [[glass fiber]]s, or plastic fibers to carry [[tension (physics)|tensile loads]].

===Admixtures===
Admixtures are materials in the form of powder or fluids that are added to the concrete to give it certain characteristics not obtainable with plain concrete mixes. Admixtures are defined as additions &quot;made as the concrete mix is being prepared&quot;.&lt;ref name=text&gt;{{cite chapter|isbn=978-0-7277-3611-6 |doi=10.1680/pc.36116.185 |chapter=Admixtures and Special Cements |title=Portland Cement: Third edition |author1=Gerry Bye |author2=Paul Livesey |author3=Leslie Struble |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common admixtures are retarders and accelerators. In normal use, admixture dosages are less than 5% by mass of cement and are added to the concrete at the time of batching/mixing.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHWA Admixtures&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=U.S. Federal Highway Administration |authorlink=Federal Highway Administration |title=Admixtures |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html |accessdate=25 January 2007 |date=14 June 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127132641/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/admixture.html |archivedate=27 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See {{section link||Production}} below.) The common types of admixtures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cement Admixture Association |url=http://www.admixtures.org.uk/types.asp |title=Admixture Types |accessdate=25 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903081932/http://www.admixtures.org.uk/types.asp |archivedate=3 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are as follows:
* [[Accelerant|Accelerators]] speed up the hydration (hardening) of the concrete. Typical materials used are [[calcium chloride]], [[calcium nitrate]] and [[sodium nitrate]]. However, use of chlorides may cause corrosion in steel reinforcing and is prohibited in some countries, so that nitrates may be favored, even though they are less effective than the chloride salt. Accelerating admixtures are especially useful for modifying the properties of concrete in cold weather.
* [[Air entrainment|Air entraining agents]] add and entrain tiny air bubbles in the concrete, which reduces damage during [[Weathering|freeze-thaw]] cycles, increasing [[Reinforced concrete structures durability|durability]]. However, entrained air entails a tradeoff with strength, as each 1% of air may decrease compressive strength by 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconstructor.org/concrete/air-entrained-concrete-strength-effects/8427/ |title=Effect of Air Entrained Concrete on Strength of Concrete |accessdate=15 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201090223/http://theconstructor.org/concrete/air-entrained-concrete-strength-effects/8427/ |archivedate=1 December 2016  |date=14 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If too much air becomes trapped in the concrete as a result of the mixing process, [[defoamer]]s can be used to encourage the air bubble to agglomerate, rise to the surface of the wet concrete and then disperse.
* Bonding agents are used to create a bond between old and new concrete (typically a type of polymer) with wide temperature tolerance and corrosion resistance.
* [[Corrosion inhibitor]]s are used to minimize the corrosion of steel and steel bars in concrete.
* Crystalline admixtures are typically added during batching of the concrete to lower permeability. The reaction takes place when exposed to water and un-hydrated cement particles to form insoluble needle-shaped crystals, which fill capillary pores and micro-cracks in the concrete to block pathways for water and waterborne contaminates. Concrete with crystalline admixture can expect to self-seal as constant exposure to water will continuously initiate crystallization to ensure permanent waterproof protection.
* [[Pigment]]s can be used to change the color of concrete, for aesthetics.
* [[Plasticizer]]s increase the workability of plastic, or &quot;fresh&quot;, concrete, allowing it to be placed more easily, with less consolidating effort. A typical plasticizer is lignosulfonate. Plasticizers can be used to reduce the water content of a concrete while maintaining workability and are sometimes called water-reducers due to this use. Such treatment improves its strength and durability characteristics.
* [[Superplasticizer]]s (also called high-range water-reducers) are a class of plasticizers that have fewer deleterious effects and can be used to increase workability more than is practical with traditional plasticizers. Superplasticizers are used to increase compressive strength. It increases the [[Concrete#Workability|workability]] of the concrete and lowers the need for water content by 15–30%. Superplasticizers lead to retarding effects.
* Pumping aids improve pumpability, thicken the paste and reduce separation and bleeding.
* [[Retarder (chemistry)|Retarders]] slow the hydration of concrete and are used in large or difficult pours where partial setting before the pour is complete is undesirable. Typical [[polyol]] retarders are [[sugar]], [[sucrose]], [[sodium gluconate]], [[glucose]], [[citric acid]], and [[tartaric acid]].

===Mineral admixtures and blended cements===
{{Components of Cement, Comparison of Chemical and Physical Characteristics}}
Inorganic materials that have [[pozzolan]]ic or latent hydraulic properties, these very [[Granularity|fine-grained]] materials are added to the concrete mix to improve the properties of concrete (mineral admixtures),&lt;ref name = &quot;FHWA Admixtures&quot;/&gt; or as a replacement for Portland cement (blended cements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kosmatka, S.H. |author2=Panarese, W.C. | title = Design and Control of Concrete Mixtures | publisher=[[Portland Cement Association]] | date = 1988 | location = Skokie, IL | pages = 17, 42, 70, 184 | isbn = 978-0-89312-087-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Products which incorporate limestone, fly ash, blast furnace slag, and other useful materials with pozzolanic properties into the mix, are being tested and used. This development is due to cement production being one of the largest producers (at about 5 to 10%) of global greenhouse gas emissions,&lt;ref name=mit&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/concrete-pavements-0829.html Paving the way to greenhouse gas reductions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031015018/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/concrete-pavements-0829.html |date=31 October 2012 }}.

* [[Fly ash]]: A by-product of coal-fired [[power station|electric generating plants]], it is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass). The properties of fly ash depend on the type of coal burnt. In general, siliceous fly ash is pozzolanic, while [[calcareous]] fly ash has latent hydraulic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=U.S. Federal Highway Administration |authorlink=Federal Highway Administration |title=Fly Ash |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm |accessdate=24 January 2007 |date=14 June 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621161733/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm |archivedate=21 June 2007 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag]] (GGBFS or GGBS): A by-product of steel production is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 80% by mass). It has latent hydraulic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm | accessdate = 24 January 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm | archivedate = 22 January 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Silica fume]]: A byproduct of the production of silicon and [[ferrosilicon]] alloys. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100 times smaller. This results in a higher surface-to-volume ratio and a much faster pozzolanic reaction. Silica fume is used to increase strength and [[Reinforced concrete structures durability|durability]] of concrete, but generally requires the use of superplasticizers for workability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Silica Fume | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | accessdate = 24 January 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070122022403/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | archivedate = 22 January 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* High reactivity [[Metakaolin]] (HRM): Metakaolin produces concrete with strength and durability similar to concrete made with silica fume. While silica fume is usually dark gray or black in color, high-reactivity metakaolin is usually bright white in color, making it the preferred choice for architectural concrete where appearance is important.
* Carbon nanofibers can be added to concrete to enhance compressive strength and gain a higher [[Young’s modulus]], and also to improve the electrical properties required for strain monitoring, damage evaluation and self-health monitoring of concrete. Carbon fiber has many advantages in terms of mechanical and electrical properties (e.g., higher strength) and self-monitoring behavior due to the high tensile strength and high conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Non-destructive evaluation of carbon nanofibre concrete|first1=Taraka Ravi Shankar|last1=Mullapudi|first2=Di|last2=Gao|first3=Ashraf|last3=Ayoub|date=1 September 2013|journal=Magazine of Concrete Research|volume=65|issue=18|pages=1081–91|doi=10.1680/macr.12.00187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

Concrete production is the process of mixing together the various ingredients—water, aggregate, cement, and any additives—to produce concrete. Concrete production is time-sensitive. Once the ingredients are mixed, workers must put the concrete in place before it hardens. In modern usage, most concrete production takes place in a large type of industrial facility called a [[concrete plant]], or often a batch plant.

In general usage, concrete plants come in two main types, ready mix plants and central mix plants. A ready-mix plant mixes all the ingredients except water, while a central mix plant mixes all the ingredients including water. A central-mix plant offers more accurate control of the concrete quality through better measurements of the amount of water added, but must be placed closer to the work site where the concrete will be used, since hydration begins at the plant.

A concrete plant consists of large storage hoppers for various reactive ingredients like cement, storage for bulk ingredients like aggregate and water, mechanisms for the addition of various additives and amendments, machinery to accurately weigh, move, and mix some or all of those ingredients, and facilities to dispense the mixed concrete, often to a [[concrete mixer]] truck.

Modern concrete is usually prepared as a viscous fluid, so that it may be poured into forms, which are containers erected in the field to give the concrete its desired shape. Concrete [[formwork]] can be prepared in several ways, such as [[slip forming]] and [[steel plate construction]]. Alternatively, concrete can be mixed into dryer, non-fluid forms and used in factory settings to manufacture [[precast concrete]] products.

A wide variety of equipment is used for processing concrete, from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery. Whichever equipment builders use, however, the objective is to produce the desired building material; ingredients must be properly mixed, placed, shaped, and retained within time constraints. Any interruption in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to begin to set before the next batch is added on top. This creates a horizontal plane of weakness called a ''cold joint'' between the two batches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concrete.org.uk/fingertips-nuggets.asp?cmd=display&amp;id=372 ''Cold Joints''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074543/http://www.concrete.org.uk/fingertips-nuggets.asp?cmd=display&amp;id=372 |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[The Concrete Society]]. Retrieved 30 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the mix is where it should be, the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product.

===Mixing===
{{See also|Volumetric concrete mixer|Concrete mixer}}
Thorough mixing is essential to produce uniform, high-quality concrete.

{{em|Separate paste mixing}} has shown that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before combining these materials with [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] can increase the [[compressive strength]] of the resulting concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 Premixed cement paste] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928092034/http://www.concreteinternational.com/pages/featured_article.asp?ID=3491 |date=28 September 2007 }}. Concreteinternational.com (1 November 1989). Retrieved 19 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The paste is generally mixed in a {{em|high-speed}}, shear-type mixer at a [[Water-cement ratio|w/cm]] (water to cement ratio) of 0.30 to 0.45 by mass. The cement paste premix may include admixtures such as accelerators or retarders, [[Plasticizer|superplasticizers]], [[pigment]]s, or [[silica fume]]. The premixed paste is then blended with aggregates and any remaining batch water and final mixing is completed in conventional concrete mixing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ACI 304R-00: Guide for Measuring, Mixing, Transporting, and Placing Concrete (Reapproved 2009) | url=https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mix Ratios===
Concrete Mixes are primarily divided into two types, ''nominal mix'' and ''design mix'':

'''Nominal Mix''' ratios are given in volume of &lt;math&gt;\text{Cement : Sand : Aggregate}&lt;/math&gt;. Nominal mixes are a simple, fast way of getting a basic idea of the properties of the finished concrete without having to perform testing in advance.

Various governing bodies (such as [[British Standards]]) define nominal mix ratios into a number of grades, usually ranging from lower compressive strength to higher compressive strength. The grades usually indicate the 28-day cube strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilology.com/grades-of-concrete/ |title=Grades of Concrete with Proportion (Mix Ratio)| date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, in Indian standards, the mixes of grades M10, M15, M20 and M25 correspond approximately to the mix proportions (1:3:6), (1:2:4), (1:1.5:3) and (1:1:2) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconstructor.org/concrete/types-of-concrete-mix-design/5984/ |title=Types of Concrete Mix Ratio Design and their Strengths|date=15 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design mix''' ratios are decided by an engineer after analyzing the properties of the specific ingredients being used. Instead of using a 'nominal mix' of 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 4 parts aggregate (the second example from above), a civil engineer will custom-design a concrete mix to exactly meet the requirements of the site and conditions, setting material ratios and often designing an admixture package to fine-tune the properties or increase the performance envelope of the mix. Design-mix concrete can have very broad specifications that cannot be met with more basic nominal mixes, but the involvement of the engineer often increases the cost of the concrete mix.

===Workability===
{{Main|Concrete slump test}}
[[File:Cannon Renewal Project - October 2016 (30662609012).jpg|thumb|Concrete floor of a [[parking garage]] being placed]]
[[File:Concreteathruz.jpg|thumb|Pouring and smoothing out concrete at Palisades Park in Washington, DC]]

Workability is the ability of a fresh (plastic) concrete mix to fill the form/mold properly with the desired work (pouring, pumping, spreading, tamping, vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of [[hydration reaction|hydration]]) and can be modified by adding chemical admixtures, like superplasticizer. Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures increases concrete workability. Excessive water leads to increased bleeding or [[Segregation in concrete|segregation of aggregates]] (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate blend with an undesirable gradation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconstructor.org/concrete/properties-of-fresh-concrete/6490/ |title=Different Properties of Fresh Concrete for Construction Works |accessdate=15 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116165251/http://theconstructor.org/concrete/properties-of-fresh-concrete/6490/ |archivedate=16 January 2017  |date=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot readily be made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water. An undesirable gradation can mean using a large aggregate that is too large for the size of the formwork, or which has too few smaller aggregate grades to serve to fill the gaps between the larger grades, or using too little or too much sand for the same reason, or using too little water, or too much cement, or even using jagged crushed stone instead of smoother round aggregate such as pebbles. Any combination of these factors and others may result in a mix which is too harsh, i.e., which does not flow or spread out smoothly, is difficult to get into the formwork, and which is difficult to surface finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.concretenetwork.com/aggregate/ |title=Aggregate in Concrete – the Concrete Network |accessdate=15 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202232307/https://www.concretenetwork.com/aggregate/ |archivedate=2 February 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workability can be measured by the [[concrete slump test]], a simple measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the [[ASTM]] C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an &quot;[[Duff Abrams|Abrams cone]]&quot; with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. It is then filled in three layers of equal volume, with each layer being tamped with a steel rod to consolidate the layer. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material slumps a certain amount, owing to gravity. A relatively dry sample slumps very little, having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50&amp;nbsp;mm) out of one foot (305&amp;nbsp;mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as eight inches. Workability can also be measured by the [[flow table test]].

Slump can be increased by addition of chemical admixtures such as plasticizer or [[superplasticizer]] without changing the [[water-cement ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrari|first1=L|last2=Kaufmann|first2=J|last3=Winnefeld|first3=F|last4=Plank|first4=J|title=Multi-method approach to study influence of superplasticizers on cement suspensions|journal=Cement and Concrete Research|volume=41|page=1058|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2011.06.010|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other admixtures, especially air-entraining admixture, can increase the slump of a mix.

High-flow concrete, like [[self-consolidating concrete]], is tested by other flow-measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted.

After mixing, concrete is a fluid and can be pumped to the location where needed.

Over 90% of a mix's final strength is typically reached within four weeks, with the remaining 10% achieved over years or even decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Concrete Testing | url=http://technology.calumet.purdue.edu/cnt/rbennet/concrete%20lab.htm | accessdate=10 November 2008 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024193802/http://technology.calumet.purdue.edu/cnt/rbennet/concrete%20lab.htm | archivedate=24 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion of [[calcium hydroxide]] in the concrete into [[calcium carbonate]] from absorption of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] over several decades further strengthens the concrete and makes it more resistant to damage. This [[carbonation]] reaction, however, lowers the pH of the cement pore solution and can corrode the reinforcement bars.

Hydration and hardening of concrete during the first three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses at a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Resulting strength distribution in vertical elements researched and presented at the article [http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf &quot;Concrete inhomogeneity of vertical cast-in-place elements in skeleton-type buildings&quot;.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403132318/http://www.concreteresearch.org/PDFsandsoon/Inhomog%20Denver.pdf |date=3 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minifibers.com/documents/ADMIXUS-Admixtures-for-Cementitious-Applications.pdf &quot;Admixtures for Cementitious Applications.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017073633/http://www.minifibers.com/documents/ADMIXUS-Admixtures-for-Cementitious-Applications.pdf |date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly curing concrete leads to increased strength and lower permeability and avoids cracking where the surface dries out prematurely. Care must also be taken to avoid freezing or overheating due to the [[exothermic]] setting of cement. Improper curing can cause [[Spalling#Spalling in mechanical weathering|scaling]], reduced strength, poor [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance and [[fracture|cracking]].

====Techniques====
During the curing period, concrete is ideally maintained at controlled temperature and humidity. To ensure full hydration during curing, concrete slabs are often sprayed with &quot;curing compounds&quot; that create a water-retaining film over the concrete. Typical films are made of wax or related hydrophobic compounds. After the concrete is sufficiently cured, the film is allowed to abrade from the concrete through normal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daytonsuperior.com/docs/default-source/tech-data-sheets/section-05---curing-compounds.pdf?sfvrsn=3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 November 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208184425/http://www.daytonsuperior.com/docs/default-source/tech-data-sheets/section-05---curing-compounds.pdf?sfvrsn=3 |archivedate=8 December 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional conditions for curing involve by spraying or ponding the concrete surface with water. The adjacent picture shows one of many ways to achieve this, ponding—submerging setting concrete in water and wrapping in plastic to prevent dehydration. Additional common curing methods include wet burlap and plastic sheeting covering the fresh concrete.

For higher-strength applications, [[accelerated curing]] techniques may be applied to the concrete. A common technique involves heating the poured concrete with steam, which serves to both keep it damp and raise the temperature, so that the hydration process proceeds more quickly and more thoroughly.

===Asphalt===
{{main|asphalt concrete}}
''Asphalt concrete'' (commonly called ''asphalt'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2011 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-547-04101-8 |page=106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''blacktop'', or ''pavement'' in North America, and ''tarmac'', ''bitumen macadam'', or ''rolled asphalt'' in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]) is a [[composite material]] commonly used to surface [[road surface|roads]], [[parking lot]]s, [[airport]]s, as well as the core of [[embankment dam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=472 |title=Asphalt concrete cores for embankment dams |publisher=International Water Power and Dam Construction |accessdate=3 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707001414/http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/story.asp?storyCode=472 |archivedate=7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asphalt mixtures have been used in pavement construction since the beginning of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polaczyk|first=Pawel|last2=Huang|first2=Baoshan|last3=Shu|first3=Xiang|last4=Gong|first4=Hongren|date=2019|title=Investigation into Locking Point of Asphalt Mixtures Utilizing Superpave and Marshall Compactors|journal=Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering|language=en|volume=31|issue=9|pages=04019188|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0002839|issn=0899-1561}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of [[Construction aggregate|mineral aggregate]] [[Binder (material)|bound]] together with [[asphalt]], laid in layers, and compacted. The process was refined and enhanced by Belgian inventor and U.S. immigrant [[Edward De Smedt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iS8BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120|title=Roads Were Not Built for Cars: How Cyclists Were the First to Push for Good Roads &amp; Became the Pioneers of Motoring |last=Reid |first=Carlton |date=2015 |publisher=Island Press |isbn=978-1-61091-689-9|page=120|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''asphalt'' (or ''asphaltic'') ''concrete'', ''bituminous asphalt concrete'', and ''bituminous mixture'' are typically used only in [[engineering]] and construction documents, which define concrete as any composite material composed of mineral aggregate adhered with a binder. The abbreviation, ''AC'', is sometimes used for ''asphalt concrete'' but can also denote ''asphalt content'' or ''asphalt cement'', referring to the liquid asphalt portion of the composite material.

===Pervious===
{{Main|Pervious concrete}}
Pervious concrete is a mix of specially graded coarse aggregate, cement, water and little-to-no fine aggregates. This concrete is also known as &quot;no-fines&quot; or porous concrete. Mixing the ingredients in a carefully controlled process creates a paste that coats and bonds the aggregate particles. The hardened concrete contains interconnected air voids totaling approximately 15 to 25 percent. Water runs through the voids in the pavement to the soil underneath. Air entrainment admixtures are often used in freeze–thaw climates to minimize
the possibility of frost damage. Pervious concrete also permits rainwater to filter through roads and parking lots, to recharge aquifers, instead of contributing to runoff and flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Akshay Tejankar |author2=Aditya Lakhe |author3=Manish Harwani |author4=Prem Gupta |date=September 2016|title=The Use of Permeable Concrete For Ground Water Recharge |url=https://www.ijera.com/papers/Vol6_issue9/Part-3/H0609036063.pdf |journal=Journal of Engineering Research and Application |volume=6 |issue=9, pt 3 |pages=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=STUDY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTIES OF NANO-CONCRETE |url=http://scholar.google.com.ec/scholar_url?url=http://bayanbox.ir/download/3322753378973510188/1439812969-a.pdf#page=167&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;scisig=AAGBfm09-6eSssTuT2f-ZXyQdxFErJ3ZOg&amp;nossl=1&amp;oi=scholarr|website=scholar.google.com.ec|accessdate=8 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymer===
{{main|Polymer concrete}}
Polymer concretes are mixtures of aggregate and any of various polymers and may be reinforced. The cement is costlier than lime-based cements, but polymer concretes nevertheless have advantages; they have significant tensile strength even without reinforcement, and they are largely impervious to water. Polymer concretes are frequently used for repair and construction of other applications, such as drains.

==Safety==
Grinding of concrete can produce [[hazardous dust]]. Exposure to cement dust can lead to issues such as [[silicosis]], kidney disease, skin irritation and similar effects. The U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] in the United States recommends attaching local exhaust ventilation shrouds to electric concrete grinders to control the spread of this dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2009-115/|title=CDC–NIOSH Publications and Products – Control of Hazardous Dust When Grinding Concrete (2009–115)|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=13 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820025433/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/wp-solutions/2009-115/|archivedate=20 August 2016|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2009115|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has placed more stringent regulations on companies whose workers regularly come into contact with silica dust. An updated silica rule,&lt;ref&gt;OSHA Fact Sheet. [https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3682.pdf &quot;OSHA’s Respirable Crystalline Silica Standard for General Industry and Maritime&quot;], Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Retrieved 5 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; which OSHA put into effect 23 September 2017 for construction companies, restricted the amount of respirable crystalline silica workers could legally come into contact with to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air per 8-hour workday. That same rule went into effect 23 June 2018 for general industry, hydraulic fracturing and maritime. That the deadline was extended to 23 June 2021 for engineering controls in the hydraulic fracturing industry. Companies which fail to meet the tightened safety regulations can face financial charges and extensive penalties.

==Properties==
{{Main|Properties of concrete}}
Concrete has relatively high [[compressive strength]], but much lower [[tensile strength]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.civil-engg-world.com/2009/04/relation-between-compressive-and.html | title=Relation Between Compressive and Tensile Strength of Concrete | access-date=6 January 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106104521/https://www.civil-engg-world.com/2009/04/relation-between-compressive-and.html | archive-date=6 January 2019 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is usually [[reinforced concrete|reinforced]] with materials that are strong in tension (often steel). The elasticity of concrete is relatively constant at low stress levels but starts decreasing at higher stress levels as matrix cracking develops. Concrete has a very low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] and shrinks as it matures. All concrete structures crack to some extent, due to shrinkage and tension. Concrete that is subjected to long-duration forces is prone to [[Creep (deformation)|creep]].

Tests can be performed to ensure that the properties of concrete correspond to specifications for the application.
[[File:Concrete Compression Testing.jpg|thumb|upright|Compression testing of a concrete cylinder]]

Different mixes of concrete ingredients produce different strengths. Concrete strength values are usually specified as the lower-bound compressive strength of either a cylindrical or cubic specimen as determined by standard test procedures.

Different strengths of concrete are used for different purposes. Very low-strength—{{convert|14|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} or less—concrete may be used when the concrete must be lightweight.&lt;ref name=lightweight&gt;{{cite web|title=Structural lightweight concrete|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|work=Concrete Construction|publisher=The Aberdeen Group|date=March 1981|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511221842/http://www.concreteconstruction.net/Images/Structural%20Lightweight%20Concrete_tcm45-345994.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightweight concrete is often achieved by adding air, foams, or lightweight aggregates, with the side effect that the strength is reduced. For most routine uses, {{convert|20|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} to {{convert|32|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} concrete is often used. {{convert|40|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} concrete is readily commercially available as a more durable, although more expensive, option. Higher-strength concrete is often used for larger civil projects.&lt;ref name=American&gt;{{cite web|title=Ordering Concrete by PSI|url=http://www.americanconcreteofiowa.com/aspx/diy.aspx?id=30|publisher=American Concrete|accessdate=10 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511142813/http://www.americanconcreteofiowa.com/aspx/diy.aspx?id=30|archivedate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strengths above {{convert|40|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} are often used for specific building elements. For example, the lower floor columns of high-rise concrete buildings may use concrete of {{convert|80|MPa|psi|-2|abbr=on}} or more, to keep the size of the columns small. Bridges may use long beams of high-strength concrete to lower the number of spans required.&lt;ref name=Russel /&gt;&lt;ref name=NRMCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Concrete in Practice: What, Why, and How?|url=http://www.nrmca.org/aboutconcrete/cips/33p.pdf|publisher=NRMCA-National Ready Mixed Concrete Association|accessdate=10 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804024341/http://www.nrmca.org/aboutconcrete/cips/33p.pdf|archivedate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, other structural needs may require high-strength concrete. If a structure must be very rigid, concrete of very high strength may be specified, even much stronger than is required to bear the service loads.

Concrete is one of the most durable building materials. It provides superior fire resistance compared with wooden construction and gains strength over time. Structures made of concrete can have a long service life. Concrete is used more than any other artificial material in the world.&lt;ref name=Lomborg&gt;{{cite book|title=The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World|authorlink=Bjørn Lomborg|last=Lomborg|first=Bjørn|date=2001|isbn=978-0-521-80447-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/skepticalenviron00lomb_0/page/138 138]|url=https://archive.org/details/skepticalenviron00lomb_0/page/138|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006, about 7.5 billion cubic meters of concrete are made each year, more than one cubic meter for every person on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minerals commodity summary – cement – 2007|publisher=US [[United States Geological Survey]]|date=1 June 2007|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/index.html|accessdate=16 January 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213052530/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/index.html|archivedate=13 December 2007}}&lt;!--Computed by taking 2007 figure for world concrete production and the mix at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#Regular_concrete and computing the volume--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to cement's [[exothermic]] chemical reaction while setting up, large concrete structures such as [[dam]]s, [[navigation lock]]s, large mat foundations, and large [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] generate excessive heat during hydration and associated expansion. To mitigate these effects, ''post-cooling''&lt;ref name=&quot;BerkCE&quot;&gt;[http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf Mass Concrete] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073606/http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/165/Mass_concrete2.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}. Retrieved 19 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly applied during construction. An early example at Hoover Dam used a network of pipes between vertical concrete placements to circulate cooling water during the curing process to avoid damaging overheating. Similar systems are still used; depending on volume of the pour, the concrete mix used, and ambient air temperature, the cooling process may last for many months after the concrete is placed. Various methods also are used to pre-cool the concrete mix in mass concrete structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;BerkCE&quot;/&gt;

Another approach to mass concrete structures that minimizes cement's thermal byproduct is the use of [[roller-compacted concrete]], which uses a dry mix which has a much lower cooling requirement than conventional wet placement. It is deposited in thick layers as a semi-dry material then roller [[compactor|compacted]] into a dense, strong mass.

===Surface finishes===
{{main|Decorative concrete}}[https://web.archive.org/web/20190504100410/https://www.constructiontest.org/concrete-meaning-properties-strength-advantages-construction/ Advantage and Disadvantage of Concrete]
&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Smpolishedconcrete2.jpg|thumb|Black basalt polished concrete floor]]
Raw concrete surfaces tend to be porous and have a relatively uninteresting appearance. Many different finishes can be applied to improve the appearance and preserve the surface against staining, water penetration, and freezing.

Examples of improved appearance include [[stamped concrete]] where the wet concrete has a pattern impressed on the surface, to give a paved, cobbled or brick-like effect, and may be accompanied with coloration. Another popular effect for flooring and table tops is [[polished concrete]] where the concrete is polished optically flat with diamond abrasives and sealed with polymers or other sealants.

Other finishes can be achieved with chiseling, or more conventional techniques such as painting or covering it with other materials.

The proper treatment of the surface of concrete, and therefore its characteristics, is an important stage in the construction and renovation of architectural structures.&lt;ref&gt;^ Sadowski, Łukasz; Mathia, Thomas. &quot;Multi-scale Metrology of Concrete Surface Morphology: Fundamentals and specificity&quot;. Construction and Building Materials 113: 613–21. {{doi|10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2016.03.099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prestressed structures===
{{Main|Prestressed concrete}}
[[File:Scott System cacti.jpg|thumb|Stylized cacti decorate a sound/retaining wall in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]]]]

[[Prestressed concrete]] is a form of reinforced concrete that builds in [[compressive stress]]es during construction to oppose tensile stresses experienced in use. This can greatly reduce the weight of beams or slabs, by
better distributing the stresses in the structure to make optimal use of the reinforcement. For example, a horizontal beam tends to sag. Prestressed reinforcement along the bottom of the beam counteracts this.
In pre-tensioned concrete, the prestressing is achieved by using steel or polymer tendons or bars that are subjected to a tensile force prior to casting, or for post-tensioned concrete, after casting.

More than {{convert|55000|mi|km}} of highways in the United States are paved with this material. [[Reinforced concrete]], [[prestressed concrete]] and [[precast concrete]] are the most widely used [[types of concrete]] functional extensions in modern days. See [[Brutalism]].

===Cold weather placement===
[[Extreme weather]] conditions (extreme heat or cold; windy condition, and humidity variations) can significantly alter the quality of concrete. Many precautions are observed in cold weather placement.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fprimec.com/cold-weather-concreting|title=Winter is Coming! Precautions for Cold Weather Concreting |date=14 November 2016|newspaper=FPrimeC Solutions|language=en-US|access-date=11 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113155033/http://www.fprimec.com/cold-weather-concreting|archivedate=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low temperatures significantly slow the chemical reactions involved in hydration of cement, thus affecting the strength development. Preventing freezing is the most important precaution, as formation of ice crystals can cause damage to the crystalline structure of the hydrated cement paste. If the surface of the concrete pour is insulated from the outside temperatures, the heat of hydration will prevent freezing.

The [[American Concrete Institute]] (ACI) definition of cold weather placement, ACI 306,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=306R-16 Guide to Cold Weather Concreting|url=https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30616|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915204757/https://www.concrete.org/store/productdetail.aspx?ItemID=30616|archivedate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is:
* A period when for more than three successive days the average daily air temperature drops below 40 ˚F (~ 4.5&amp;nbsp;°C), and
* Temperature stays below 50 ˚F (10&amp;nbsp;°C) for more than one-half of any 24-hour period.
In Canada, where temperatures tend to be much lower during the cold season, the following criteria are used by [[Canadian Standards Agency|CSA]] A23.1:
* When the air temperature is ≤ 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and
* When there is a probability that the temperature may fall below 5&amp;nbsp;°C within 24 hours of placing the concrete.

The minimum strength before exposing concrete to extreme cold is 500 psi (3.5 MPa). CSA A 23.1 specified a compressive strength of 7.0 MPa to be considered safe for exposure to freezing.

===Roads===
[[Road surface#Concrete|Concrete roads]] are more fuel efficient to drive on,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mapping of Excess Fuel Consumption|url=https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102190351/https://cshub.mit.edu/news/lca-research-brief-mapping-excess-fuel-consumption|archivedate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, yet have a much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that [[pervious concrete]] can be used, which eliminates the need to place [[storm drain]]s near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.

===Energy efficiency===
Energy requirements for transportation of concrete are low because it is produced locally from local resources, typically manufactured within 100 kilometers of the job site. Similarly, relatively little energy is used in producing and combining the raw materials (although large amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are produced by the chemical reactions in [[Cement#CO2 emissions|cement manufacture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubenstein|first1=Madeleine|title=Emissions from the Cement Industry|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/|website=State of the Planet|publisher=Earth Institute, Columbia University|accessdate=13 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222053719/http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/05/09/emissions-from-the-cement-industry/|archivedate=22 December 2016|date=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall [[embodied energy]] of concrete at roughly 1 to 1.5 megajoules per kilogram is therefore lower than for most structural and construction materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://strineenvironments.com.au/factsheets/concrete-and-embodied-energy-can-using-concrete-be-carbon-neutral/ |title=Concrete and Embodied Energy – Can using concrete be carbon neutral |accessdate=15 January 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174733/http://strineenvironments.com.au/factsheets/concrete-and-embodied-energy-can-using-concrete-be-carbon-neutral/ |archivedate=16 January 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in place, concrete offers great energy efficiency over the lifetime of a building.&lt;ref&gt;John Gajda (2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110916080530/http://www.arxx.com/Assets/CMS/WYSIWYGBase/file/5825%20PCA%20CD026.pdf Energy Use of Single Family Houses with Various Exterior Walls], Construction Technology Laboratories Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Green Building with Concrete|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-1-4987-0411-3|date=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air leakage accounts for a large percentage of energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Features and Usage of Foam Concrete&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Features and Usage of Foam Concrete|url=http://www.chinaconcretepump.com/Foam-Concrete-Machine.html/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121129122814/http://www.chinaconcretepump.com/Foam-Concrete-Machine.html/|archivedate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or [[rastra]] that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

===Fire safety===
[[File:Boston City Hall - Boston, MA - DSC04704 (cropped).JPG|thumb|[[Boston City Hall]] (1968) is a [[Brutalist]] design constructed largely of precast and poured in place concrete. It was voted &quot;The World's Ugliest Building&quot; in 2008]]

Concrete buildings are more resistant to fire than those constructed using steel frames, since concrete has lower heat conductivity than steel and can thus last longer under the same fire conditions. Concrete is sometimes used as a fire protection for steel frames, for the same effect as above. Concrete as a fire shield, for example [[Fondu fyre]], can also be used in extreme environments like a missile launch pad.

Options for non-combustible construction include floors, ceilings and roofs made of cast-in-place and hollow-core precast concrete. For walls, concrete masonry technology and [[Insulating concrete forms|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs) are additional options. ICFs are hollow blocks or panels made of fireproof insulating foam that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.

Concrete also provides good resistance against externally applied forces such as high winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes owing to its lateral stiffness, which results in minimal horizontal movement. However, this stiffness can work against certain types of concrete structures, particularly where a relatively higher flexing structure is required to resist more extreme forces.

===Earthquake safety===
As discussed above, concrete is very strong in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes can generate very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute one of the largest earthquake risks globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 Unreinforced Masonry Buildings and Earthquakes: Developing Successful Risk Reduction Programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912163041/http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=4067 |date=12 September 2011}}, FEMA P-774 / October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf Seismic Retrofit Design Of Historic Century-Old School Buildings In Istanbul, Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111151034/http://www.curee.org/architecture/docs/S08-034.pdf |date=11 January 2012}}, C.C. Simsir, A. Jain, G.C. Hart, and M.P. Levy, The 14th World Conference on Earthquake Engineering, 12–17 October 2008, Beijing, China&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Degradation==
{{Main|Concrete degradation}}
[[File:Betonrot Hippodroom.JPG|thumb|Concrete [[spalling]] caused by the [[corrosion]] of [[rebar]]]]

Concrete can be damaged by many processes, such as the expansion of [[corrosion]] products of the steel [[rebar|reinforcement bars]], freezing of trapped water, fire or radiant heat, aggregate expansion, sea water effects, bacterial corrosion, leaching, erosion by fast-flowing water, physical damage and chemical damage (from [[carbonatation]], chlorides, sulfates and distillate water).&lt;ref name=&quot;MironKoleva2017&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Luis Emilio Rendon Diaz Miron|author2=Dessi A.

==Environmental and health==
{{main|Environmental impact of concrete}}
The manufacture and use of concrete produce a wide range of environmental and social consequences. Some are harmful, some welcome, and some both, depending on circumstances.

A major component of concrete is [[cement]], which similarly exerts [[Cement#Environmental impacts|environmental and social effects]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation attributable to predatory publisher}} The cement industry is one of the three primary producers of [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]] (the other two being the energy production and transportation industries).

Concrete is used to create hard surfaces that contribute to [[surface runoff]], which can cause heavy soil erosion, water pollution, and flooding, but conversely can be used to divert, dam, and control flooding. Concrete dust released by building demolition and natural disasters can be a major source of dangerous air pollution.

Concrete is a contributor to the [[urban heat island]] effect, though less so than asphalt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reducing Urban Heat Islands|url=http://www.epa.gov/heatisld/resources/pdf/CoolPavesCompendium.pdf|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers who cut, grind or polish concrete are at risk of inhaling airborne silica, which can lead to [[silicosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shepherd|author2=Woskie|last-author-amp=yes|title=Controlling Dust from Concrete Saw Cutting|url=http://www.cpwr.com/sites/default/files/publications/shepherdwoskieconcretecuttingkf.pdf|work=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|accessdate=14 June 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212644/http://www.cpwr.com/sites/default/files/publications/shepherdwoskieconcretecuttingkf.pdf|archivedate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes crew members who work in [[concrete chipping]]. 
The presence of some substances in concrete, including useful and unwanted additives, can cause health concerns due to toxicity and radioactivity.
Fresh concrete (before curing is complete) is highly alkaline and must be handled with proper protective equipment.

===Recycling===
{{Main|Concrete recycling}}

Concrete recycling is an increasingly common method for disposing of concrete structures. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to [[landfill]]s for disposal, but recycling is increasing due to improved environmental awareness, governmental laws and economic benefits.

==World records==
The world record for the largest concrete pour in a single project is the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in Hubei Province, China by the Three Gorges Corporation. The amount of concrete used in the construction of the dam is estimated at 16 million cubic meters over 17 years. The previous record was 12.3 million cubic meters held by [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu hydropower station]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
