'''Chervil''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɜr|,|v|ɪ|l}}; '''''Anthriscus cerefolium'''''), sometimes called '''French parsley''' or '''garden chervil''' (to distinguish it from similar plants also called chervil), is a delicate [[annual plant|annual]] [[herb]] related to [[parsley]]. It is commonly used to season mild-flavoured dishes and is a constituent of the French herb mixture {{lang|fr|[[fines herbes]]}}.

==Name==

The name ''chervil'' is from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|chaerephylla}} or {{lang|la|choerephyllum}}, ultimately from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|χαιρέφυλλον}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|chairephyllon}}), meaning &quot;leaves of joy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=YehbAAAAcAAJ |title=O new greek and english lexicon |first=James |last=Donnegan |date=3 August 2018 |publisher=Cowie |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://artofeating.com/chervil/ |title=Chervil, One of the Best &amp; Least Appreciated Herbs |work=The Art of Eating |date=1 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
A member of the [[Apiaceae]], chervil is native to the [[Caucasus]] but was spread by the Romans through most of Europe, where it is now naturalised.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBFP&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Vaughan |first=J.G. |last2=Geissler |first2=C.A. |title=The New Oxford Book of Food Plants |url=https://archive.org/details/newoxfordbookoff00vaug_0 |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also grown frequently in the United States, where it sometimes escapes cultivation. Such escape can be recognized, however, as garden chervil is distinguished from all other Anthriscus species growing in North America (i.e., A. caucalis and A. sylvestris) by its having lanceolate-linear bracteoles and a fruit with a relatively long beak.  

The plants grow to {{convert|40|-|70|cm|abbr=on}}, with tripinnate leaves that may be curly. The small white flowers form small umbels, {{convert|2.5|-|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} across. The fruit is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm long, oblong-ovoid with a slender, ridged beak.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBFP&quot;/&gt;

==Uses and impact==
===Culinary arts===
[[Image:Chervil.JPG|thumb|Chervil garnishing a salad]]

Chervil is used, particularly in France, to season [[poultry]], [[seafood]], young spring [[vegetable]]s (such as carrots), soups, and sauces. More delicate than parsley, it has a faint taste of [[liquorice]] or [[aniseed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;S&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Simon &amp; Schuster's Guide to Herbs and Spices |editor=Stanley Schuler |isbn=978-0-671-73489-3 |author=Gualtiero Simonetti |year=1990 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/simonschustersgu0000simo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chervil is one of the four traditional French {{lang|fr|fines herbes}}, along with [[tarragon]], [[chive]]s, and [[parsley]], which are essential to French cooking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Child]], ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking'' vol. I p 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the more pungent, robust herbs such as [[thyme]] and [[rosemary]], which can take prolonged cooking, the {{lang|fr|fines herbes}} are added at the last minute, to salads, omelettes, and soups.

===Horticulture===
According to some, [[slug]]s are attracted to chervil and the plant is sometimes used to bait them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcWQQKJX1xEC&amp;pg=PA375 |author1=Fern Marshall Bradley |author2=Barbara W. Ellis |author3=Deborah L. Martin |chapter=Chervil is irresistible to slugs |title=The Organic Gardener's Handbook of Natural Pest and Disease |page=363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Chervil has had various uses in folk medicine. It was claimed to be useful as a [[digestion|digestive]] aid, for lowering [[high blood pressure]], and, infused with [[vinegar]], for curing [[hiccups]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Rose Marie Nichols |last2=Stuckey |first2=Maggie |title=The Bountiful Container |publisher=Workman Publishing |year=2002 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides its digestive properties, it is used as a mild stimulant.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;S&quot; /&gt;

Chervil has also been implicated in &quot;strimmer [[dermatitis]]&quot;, another name for [[phytophotodermatitis]], due to spray from weed trimmers and similar forms of contact.  Other plants in the family [[Apiaceae]] can have similar effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovern-Barkley&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=The Electronic Textbook of Dermatology |url=http://telemedicine.org/botanica/bot1.htm |title=Botanical Dermatology |last1=McGovern |first1=Thomas W |last2=Barkley |first2=Theodore M |at=Section&amp;nbsp;Phytophotodermatitis |publisher=Internet Dermatology Society |access-date=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
Transplanting chervil can be difficult, due to the long [[taproot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt; It prefers a cool and moist location; otherwise, it rapidly goes to seed (also known as [[bolting (horticulture)|bolting]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt; It is usually grown as a cool-season crop, like [[lettuce]], and should be planted in early spring and late fall or in a winter greenhouse. Regular harvesting of leaves also helps to prevent bolting.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt; If plants bolt despite precautions, the plant can be periodically re-sown throughout the growing season, thus producing fresh plants as older plants bolt and go out of production.

Chervil grows to a height of {{convert|12|to|24|in}}, and a width of {{convert|6|to|12|in}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;TBC&quot;/&gt;
