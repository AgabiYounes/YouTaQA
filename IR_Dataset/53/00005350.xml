[[File:Indians Attacking a Stage-Coach BAH-p243.png|thumb|200px|Riding shotgun. The driver is holding the whip with the shotgun messenger on his left.]]

'''Riding shotgun''' was used to describe the guard who rode alongside a [[stagecoach]] driver, ready to use his [[shotgun]] to ward off bandits or hostile [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. In modern use, it refers to the practice of sitting alongside the [[driver (person)|driver]] in a moving [[vehicle]]. The phrase has been used to mean giving actual or figurative support or aid to someone in a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=dictionary.reference.com|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shotgun|title= Define Shotgun at Dictionary.com|publisher =Dictionary.com|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coining of this phrase dates to 1905 at latest.&lt;ref name=sunsettrail/&gt;

==Etymology==
The expression &quot;riding shotgun&quot; is derived from &quot;[[shotgun messenger]]&quot;, a colloquial term for &quot;express messenger&quot;, when [[stagecoach]] travel was popular during the American [[American frontier|Wild West]] and the [[Colonialism|Colonial]] period in [[Australia]]. The person rode alongside the driver. The first known use of the phrase &quot;riding shotgun&quot; was in the 1905 novel ''The Sunset Trail'' by Alfred Henry Lewis. 

{{quote|Wyatt and Morgan Earp were in the service of The Express Company. They went often as guards-- &quot;riding shotgun,&quot; it was called-- when the stage bore unusual treasure.&lt;ref name=sunsettrail&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/sunsettrail00lewigoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/sunsettrail00lewigoog/page/n373 349]|quote=riding shotgun.|title=The Sunset Trail|publisher=A.L. Burt Company|last=Lewis|first=Alfred Henry|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was later used in print and especially film depiction of stagecoaches and wagons in the [[Old West]] in danger of being robbed or attacked by [[bandit]]s. A special armed employee of the express service using the stage for transportation of bullion or cash would sit beside the driver, carrying a short [[shotgun]] (or alternatively a [[rifle]]),[https://books.google.com/books?id=QILdMe7lYXgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=.gov%3Ariding%20shotgun%20wild%20west%20stagecoach&amp;pg=PR6#v=onepage&amp;q=shotgun&amp;f=false] to provide an armed response in case of threat to the cargo, which was usually a strongbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Old West in Fact and Film: History Versus Hollywood|last=Agnew|first=Jeremy|publisher=McFarland|year=2012|isbn=0786468882|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absence of an armed person in that position often signaled that the stage was not carrying a strongbox, but only passengers.&lt;ref name=phrases&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/riding-shotgun.html|title=Riding shotgun|work=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tombstone, Arizona Territory===
On the evening of March 15, 1881, a Kinnear &amp; Company [[stagecoach]] carrying US$26,000 in [[silver bullion]] ({{inflation|US|26000|1881|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) was en route from the boom town of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory]] to [[Benson, Arizona]], the nearest freight terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=O'Neal|first1=Bill|title=Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters|year=1979|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, OK|isbn=978-0-8061-2335-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5KLrfdOrI78C&amp;pg=PA180&amp;lpg=PA180|accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180|date=November 2012}} [[Robert H. Paul|Bob Paul]], who had run for [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]] Sheriff and was contesting the election he lost due to [[ballot-stuffing]], was temporarily working once again as the Wells Fargo shotgun messenger. He had taken the reins and driver's seat in Contention City because the usual driver, a well-known and popular man named Eli &quot;Budd&quot; Philpot, was ill. Philpot was riding shotgun.

Near [[Edward Landers Drew#Biography|Drew's Station]], just outside [[Contention City, Arizona|Contention City]], a man stepped into the road and commanded them to &quot;Hold!&quot; Three Cowboys attempted to rob the stage. Paul, in the driver's seat, fired his [[shotgun]] and emptied his [[revolver]] at the robbers, wounding a Cowboy later identified as Bill Leonard in the groin. Philpot, riding shotgun, and passenger Peter Roerig, riding in the rear [[rumble seat|dickey seat]], were both shot and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tombstone, AZ|url=http://silverstateghosttowns.com/tombstone-az.html|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horses spooked and Paul wasn't able to bring the stage under control for almost a mile, leaving the robbers with nothing. Paul, who normally rode shotgun, later said he thought the first shot killing Philpot had been meant for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;robbery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/2653/Wyatt-Earp-Trial-1881-Mysterious-Stage-Coach-Robbery.html|title= Wyatt Earp Trial: 1881—A Mysterious Stage Coach Robbery—Clanton, Holliday, Told, Leonard, Doc, and Ike|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historyraider.com/|title=History Raiders|accessdate=February 11, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208143417/http://historyraider.com/|archivedate=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When [[Wyatt Earp]] first arrived in Tombstone in December 1879, he initially took a job as a stagecoach [[shotgun messenger]] for [[Wells Fargo]], guarding shipments of silver bullion. When Wyatt Earp was appointed Pima County Deputy Sheriff on July 27, 1881, his brother [[Morgan Earp]] took over his job.&lt;ref name=wgbh&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/wyatt-transcript/|title=WGBH American Experience: Wyatt Earp, Complete Program Transcript|date=January 25, 2010|season=22|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical weapon===
When [[Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.]] began regular stagecoach service from [[Tipton, Missouri]] to [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in 1858, they issued shotguns to its drivers and guards for defense along the perilous 2,800 mile route.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmo&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Jones|first=Spencer|title=Revival Of The Coach Gun|magazine=Popular Mechanics|date=June 1, 2004|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/sports/1277346.html?page=1|accessdate=March 18, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024328/http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/sports/1277346.html?page=1|archivedate=September 30, 2007|df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guard was called a [[shotgun messenger]] and they were issued a [[Coach gun]], typically a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peacemakers&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=RL|title=The Peacemakers: Arms and Adventure in the American West|year= 1992|publisher= NAL|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7858-1892-2|pages=121, 197, 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
More recently, the term has been applied to a [[game]], usually played by groups of friends to determine who rides beside the driver in a car. Typically, this involves claiming the right to ride shotgun by being the first person to call out &quot;shotgun&quot;. The [[game]] creates an environment that is fair by forgetting and leaving out most [[seniority]] except that mothers and significant others automatically get shotgun, and this meanwhile leaves out any conflicts that may have previously occurred when deciding who gets to ride shotgun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shotgunrules.com/|title=Official Rules for Calling Shotgun {{!}} Riding Shotgun {{!}} Shotgun Rules|website=www.shotgunrules.com|language=en-US|access-date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
