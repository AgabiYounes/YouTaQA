The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of [[contraception]], can be assessed two ways. ''Perfect use'' or ''method'' effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently. ''Actual use'', or ''typical use'' effectiveness rates are of all condom users, including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;hatcher&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=RA |last=Hatcher |author2=Trussel, J |author3=Nelson, AL |year=2007 |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th |publisher=Ardent Media | location=New York | isbn=978-1-59708-001-9 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |accessdate=2009-07-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531095926/http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008|url-status=dead|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;kippley&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley |author2=Kippley, Sheila | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th addition | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=978-0-926412-13-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|141}}

Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). They have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women. While not perfect, the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of organisms that cause [[AIDS]], [[genital herpes]], [[cervical cancer]], [[genital wart]]s, [[syphilis]], [[chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and other diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;planned parenthood&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Condom |publisher=Planned Parenthood | year=2008 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/condom-10187.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired.&lt;ref name=DualProtection&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11875378 |title=Dual Protection Against Unintended Pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Infections: What is the Best Contraceptive Approach? |journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=168–174 |date=March 2002 |last1=Cates |first1=Willard |last2=Steiner |first2=Markus J. |doi=10.1097/00007435-200203000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2000 report by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] transmission by approximately 85% relative to risk when unprotected, putting the seroconversion rate (infection rate) at 0.9 per 100 person-years with condom, down from 6.7 per 100 person-years.&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite conference|last=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |authorlink=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |title=Workshop Summary: Scientific Evidence on Condom Effectiveness for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention |pages=13–15 |date=2001-07-20 |location=Hyatt Dulles Airport, Herndon, Virginia |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |accessdate=2010-09-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009022150/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis published in 2007 from the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003255 |title=Condom effectiveness in reducing heterosexual HIV transmission |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2002 |last1=Weller |first1=Susan C. |last2=Davis-Beaty |first2=Karen }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=World Health Organization Department of Reproductive Health and Research (WHO/RHR) &amp; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Communication Programs (CCP), INFO Project|year=2007|title=Family Planning: A Global Handbook for Providers|publisher=INFO Project at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|url=http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|page=200|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827081805/http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|archivedate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; found similar risk reductions of 80–95%.

The 2000 NIH review concluded that condom use significantly reduces the risk of [[gonorrhea]] for men.&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot; /&gt; A 2006 study reports that proper condom use decreases the risk of transmission of [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) to women by approximately 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053284 |pmid=16790697 |title=Condom Use and the Risk of Genital Human Papillomavirus Infection in Young Women |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=25 |pages=2645–2654 |year=2006 |last1=Winer |first1=Rachel L. |last2=Hughes |first2=James P. |last3=Feng |first3=Qinghua |last4=O'Reilly |first4=Sandra |last5=Kiviat |first5=Nancy B. |last6=Holmes |first6=King K. |last7=Koutsky |first7=Laura A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in the same year found consistent condom use was effective at reducing transmission of [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus-2]] also known as genital herpes, in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-143-10-200511150-00007 |pmid=16287791 |title=The Relationship between Condom Use and Herpes Simplex Virus Acquisition |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=143 |issue=10 |pages=707–713 |year=2005 |last1=Wald |first1=Anna |last2=Langenberg |first2=Andria G.M. |last3=Krantz |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Douglas |first4=John M. |last5=Handsfield |first5=H.

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom. Infectious areas of the genitals, especially when symptoms are present, may not be covered by a condom, and as a result, some diseases like HPV and herpes may be transmitted by direct contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314084306/http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |archivedate=2010-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent STDs, however, is inconsistent use.&lt;ref name=&quot;badnews&quot; /&gt;

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially [[cervical cancer|precancerous cervical changes]]. Exposure to human papillomavirus, even in individuals already infected with the virus, appears to increase the risk of precancerous changes. The use of condoms helps promote regression of these changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogewoning2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ijc.11474 |pmid=14566832 |title=Condom use promotes regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and clearance of human papillomavirus: A randomized clinical trial |journal=International Journal of Cancer |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=811–816 |year=2003 |last1=Hogewoning |first1=Cornelis J.A. |last2=Bleeker |first2=Maaike C.G. |last3=Van Den Brule |first3=Adriaan J.C. |last4=Voorhorst |first4=Feja J. |last5=Snijders |first5=Peter J.F. |last6=Berkhof |first6=Johannes |last7=Westenend |first7=Pieter J. |last8=Meijer |first8=Chris J.L.M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, researchers in the UK suggest that a hormone in semen can aggravate existing cervical cancer, condom use during sex can prevent exposure to the hormone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Semen can worsen cervical cancer |publisher=[[Medical Research Council (UK)]] |url=http://www.mrc.ac.uk/NewsViewsAndEvents/News/MRC002621 |accessdate=2007-12-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804173650/http://www.mrc.ac.uk/NewsViewsAndEvents/News/MRC002621 |archivedate=2008-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom. The person may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to &quot;take a chance&quot;. This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure (as opposed to method or perfect use failure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00007435-199909000-00007 |pmid=10494937 |title=The Real Problem with Male Condoms is Nonuse |journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=459–462 |year=1999 |last1=Steiner |first1=Markus J. |last2=Cates |first2=Willard |last3=Warner |first3=Lee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
[[File:CondomUse2 alternative.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing how to put on a condom]]
Male condoms are usually packaged inside a foil or plastic wrapper, in a rolled-up form, and are designed to be applied to the tip of the penis and then unrolled over the [[erection|erect]] penis. It is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect; otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device. Most condoms have a teat end for this purpose. After use, it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot, then disposed of in a trash receptacle.&lt;ref name=&quot;AliceDisposal&quot; /&gt; Condoms are used to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy during intercourse and to reduce the likelihood of contracting sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are also used during fellatio to reduce the likelihood of contracting STIs.

Some couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation; disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement.&lt;ref name=&quot;planned parenthood&quot; /&gt; Advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;planned parenthood&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fwhc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Condom |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121011004/http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex education ===
Condoms are often used in [[sex education]] programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying &quot;''comprehensive sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms''&quot;, and &quot;''promote condom use for those who are sexually active''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Based on the research, comprehensive sex education is more effective at stopping the spread of HIV infection, says APA committee |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=February 23, 2005 |url=http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |accessdate=2006-08-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811000127/http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |archivedate=August 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infertility treatment {{anchor|Infertility treatment}} ===
&lt;!-- [[Conception device]] links to anchor Infertility treatment --&gt;
Common procedures in [[infertility]] treatment such as [[semen analysis]] and [[Artificial insemination|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained through [[masturbation]], but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special ''collection condom'' to collect semen during sexual intercourse.

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine [[Artificial insemination|insemination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8288490 |year=1993 |last1=Sofikitis |first1=Nikolaos V. |title=Endocrinological, biophysical, and biochemical parameters of semen collected via masturbation versus sexual intercourse |journal=Journal of Andrology |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=366–373 |last2=Miyagawa |first2=Ikuo |doi=10.1002/j.1939-4640.1993.tb00402.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4054324 |year=1985 |last1=Zavos |first1=P.

For fertility treatments, a collection condom may be used to collect semen during [[sexual intercourse]] where the semen is provided by the woman's partner. Private [[sperm donors]] may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by sexual intercourse with a partner and will transfer the ejaculate from the collection condom to a specially designed container. The sperm is transported in such containers, in the case of a donor, to a recipient woman to be used for insemination, and in the case of a woman's partner, to a fertility clinic for processing and use. However, transportation may reduce the fecundity of the sperm. Collection condoms may also be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of [[antisperm antibodies]]. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0272.1979.tb02229.x |pmid=532982 |title=Experimental Findings with Spermantibodies: Condom Therapy (A Case Report) |journal=Andrologia |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=413–416 |year=2009 |last1=Franken |first1=D.R. |last2=Slabber |first2=C.F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7060795 |year=1982 |last1=Greentree |first1=L.

=== Other uses ===
&lt;!--

IMPORTANT: When adding a new listing, please include a reliable source that discusses the use. Many condom uses belong to larger categories of use (e.g., smuggling drugs vs. specifically smuggling alcohol; storing water in emergency situations vs. storage in general); consider referring to general use instead of specific use.

--&gt;
Condoms excel as multipurpose containers and barriers because they are waterproof, elastic, durable, and (for military and espionage uses) will not arouse suspicion if found.

Ongoing military utilization began during World War II, and includes covering the muzzles of rifle barrels to prevent fouling,&lt;ref name=&quot;dday&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Ambrose, Stephen E |title=D-Day, June 6, 1944: the climactic battle of World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/ddayjune6194400ambr |url-access=registration |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=978-0-671-71359-1}}{{page needed|date=January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the waterproofing of firing assemblies in underwater demolitions,&lt;ref&gt;Couch, D (2001).

Condoms have also been used to [[drug smuggling|smuggle]] [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and other drugs across borders and into prisons by filling the condom with drugs, tying it in a knot and then either swallowing it or inserting it into the [[rectum]]. These methods are very dangerous and potentially lethal; if the condom breaks, the drugs inside become absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause an overdose.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A 41-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being stopped on Saturday by customs officials at the Norwegian border at Svinesund.

=== Female condom ===
{{Main|Female condom}}
[[File:Préservatif féminin.jpg|thumb|right|A female condom]]

Male condoms have a tight ring to form a seal around the penis while female condoms usually have a large stiff ring to prevent them from slipping into the [[body orifice]]. The Female Health Company produced a female condom that was initially made of polyurethane, but newer versions are made of [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]]. Medtech Products produces a female condom made of latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm |title=The Female Condom |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228152904/http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm |archivedate=2013-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials ===

==== Natural latex ====
[[File:Condom unrolled durex.jpg|thumb|375px|An unrolled latex condom]]

Latex has outstanding elastic properties: Its [[tensile strength]] exceeds 30&amp;nbsp;MPa, and latex condoms may be stretched in excess of 800% before breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Relationship of condom strength to failure during use | journal = PIACT Prod News | volume = 2 | issue = 2 |pages=1–2 |year=1980 | pmid = 12264044 |author1=Program for the Introduction and Adaptation of Contraceptive Technology PIACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] set standards for condom production (ISO 4074, Natural latex rubber condoms), and the [[European Union|EU]] followed suit with its [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standard (Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices). Every latex condom is tested for holes with an electric current. If the condom passes, it is rolled and packaged. In addition, a portion of each batch of condoms is subject to water leak and air burst testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;badnews&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nordenberg |first=Tamar |title=Condoms: Barriers to Bad News |journal=FDA Consumer Magazine |date=March–April 1998 |url=https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm126370.htm |accessdate=2007-06-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308051921/https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm126370.htm |archivedate=2010-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], such as [[petroleum jelly]], [[cooking oil]], [[baby oil]], [[mineral oil]], [[skin lotion]]s, [[Sunscreen|suntan lotions]], [[cold cream]]s, [[butter]] or [[margarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42331/1/1885960018_eng.pdf Essentials of Contraceptive Technology &gt; Chapter 11 Condoms] From the Knowledge for Health Project, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

In May 2009 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] granted approval for the production of condoms composed of [[Vytex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=FDA Clearance for Envy Natural Rubber Latex Condom Made with Vytex NRL |publisher=Vystar |date=2009-05-06 |url=http://www.vytex.com/BizDocs/R-EnvyFDA_Clearance.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007172424/http://www.vytex.com/BizDocs/R-EnvyFDA_Clearance.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; latex that has been treated to remove 90% of the [[antibody generator|proteins responsible for allergic reactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Vytex Works |publisher=Vystar |year=2009 |url=http://www.vytex.com/Consumers/howvytexworks.aspx?pageid=C8 |accessdate=2009-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530223349/http://www.vytex.com/Consumers/howvytexworks.aspx?pageid=C8 |archivedate=2010-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An allergen-free condom made of synthetic latex (polyisoprene) is also available.&lt;ref name=&quot;isoprenepr&quot; /&gt;

==== Synthetic ====
The most common non-latex condoms are made from [[polyurethane]]. Condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials, such as [[AT-10 resin]], and most [[polyisoprene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isoprenepr&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Lifestyles Condoms Introduces Polyisoprene Non-latex |publisher=HealthNewsDigest.com |date=2008-07-31 |url=http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |accessdate=2008-08-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823054656/http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms, with most polyurethane condoms between 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condoms |work=Condom Statistics and Sizes |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |accessdate=2012-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525205018/http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |archivedate=2013-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways: it conducts heat better than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], is less allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor.&lt;ref name=&quot;nonlatex&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nonlatex vs Latex Condoms: An Update | journal = The Contraception Report | volume = 14 | issue = 2 |date=September 2003|url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243|accessdate=2006-08-14 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060926035226/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |archivedate = September 26, 2006|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyurethane condoms have gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for sale in the United States as an effective method of contraception and HIV prevention, and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex for these purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlicePolyLatex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Are polyurethane condoms as effective as latex ones? |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=February 22, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530000038/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |archivedate=May 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyisoprene is a synthetic version of natural rubber latex. While significantly more expensive,&lt;ref name=&quot;isopreneglove&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Polyisoprene Surgical Gloves | publisher = SurgicalGlove.net | year = 2008 | url = http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html | accessdate = 2008-08-24 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080918193917/http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html | archivedate = 2008-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has the advantages of latex (such as being softer and more elastic than polyurethane condoms)&lt;ref name=&quot;isoprenepr&quot; /&gt; without the protein which is responsible for latex allergies.&lt;ref name=&quot;isopreneglove&quot; /&gt; Unlike polyurethane condoms, they cannot be used with an oil-based lubricant.&lt;ref name=&quot;PPAA&quot; /&gt;

==== Lambskin ====
Condoms made from [[sheep]] [[intestine]]s, labeled &quot;lambskin&quot;, are also available. Although they are generally effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm, it is presumed that they are likely less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of [[Sexually transmitted infections]], because of pores in the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York, NY |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7432-5611-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ourbodiesoursel00bost/page/333 333] |url=https://archive.org/details/ourbodiesoursel00bost/page/333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the idea that intestines, by their nature, are porous, permeable membranes, and while sperm are too large to pass through the pores, viruses—such as [[HIV]], [[herpes]], and [[genital warts]]—are small enough to pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;PPAA&quot; /&gt; However, there are to date no clinical data confirming or denying this theory. 

As a result of laboratory data on condom porosity, in 1989 the US Food and Drug Administration began requiring lambskin condom manufacturers to indicate that the products were not to be used for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=FDA Consumer Investigative Reports - Condoms Relabeled for Accuracy |date=January 1992 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LIct5Kf9iHcC&amp;pg=SA1992-PA42&amp;lpg=SA1992-PA42 |accessdate=2019-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on the presumption that lambskin condoms would be less effective than latex in preventing HIV transmission, rather than a conclusion that lambskin condoms lack efficacy in STI prevention altogether. An FDA publication in 1992 states that lambskin condoms &quot;...provide good birth control and a varying degree of protection against some, but not all, sexually transmitted diseases,&quot; and that the labelling requirement was decided upon because the FDA &quot;...cannot expect people to know which STDs they need to be protected against,&quot; and since &quot;the reality is that you don't know what your partner has, we wanted natural-membrane condoms to have labels that don't allow the user to assume they're effective against the small viral STDs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=FDA Consumer Investigative Reports - Condoms Relabeled for Accuracy |date=January 1992 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LIct5Kf9iHcC&amp;pg=SA1992-PA42&amp;lpg=SA1992-PA42 |accessdate=2019-09-23 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that lambskin condoms provide a more &quot;natural&quot; sensation, and they lack the allergens that are inherent to latex, but because of their lesser protection against infection, other hypoallergenic materials such as [[polyurethane]] are recommended for latex-allergic users and/or partners. Lambskin condoms are also significantly more expensive than other types and as slaughter by-products they are also not [[vegetarian]].

=== Spermicide ===
Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of a [[nonoxynol-9]], a [[spermicide|spermicidal chemical]]. According to [[Consumer Reports]], condoms lubricated with spermicide have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause [[urinary tract infection|urinary-tract infections]] in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condoms: Extra protection |work=ConsumerReports.org |date=February 2005 |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=1&amp;searchTerm=condom |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, application of separately packaged spermicide ''is'' believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;simultaneous&quot; /&gt;

Nonoxynol-9 was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV) but recent studies have shown that, with frequent use, nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonoxynol-9 and the Risk of HIV Transmission |work=HIV/AIDS Epi Update |publisher=Health Canada, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |accessdate=2006-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929172125/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |archivedate=2009-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted. However, it recommends using a [[nonoxynol-9]] lubricated condom over no condom at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nonoxynol-9 ineffective in preventing HIV infection |work=World Health Organization |year=2006 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/release55/en/index.html |accessdate=2009-07-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321074537/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/release55/en/index.html |archivedate=2011-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2005}}, nine condom manufacturers have stopped manufacturing condoms with nonoxynol-9 and [[Planned Parenthood]] has discontinued the distribution of condoms so lubricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boonstra |first=Heather |title=Condoms, Contraceptives and Nonoxynol-9: Complex Issues Obscured by Ideology |journal=The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy |volume=8 |issue=2 |date=May 2005 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/08/2/gr080204.html |accessdate=2007-04-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420165133/http://guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/08/2/gr080204.html |archivedate=2007-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ribbed and studded ===
[[File:Kondom - abgerollt - hängend.jpg|thumb|75px|A ribbed condom]]
Textured condoms include studded and ribbed condoms which can provide extra sensations to both partners. The studs or ribs can be located on the inside, outside, or both; alternatively, they are located in specific sections to provide directed stimulation to either the [[g-spot]] or [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]]. Many textured condoms which advertise &quot;mutual pleasure&quot; also are bulb-shaped at the top, to provide extra stimulation to the penis.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Condom Types: A look at different condom styles|url=http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|accessdate=2008-12-08|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219035952/http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm|archivedate=2008-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women experience irritation during vaginal intercourse with studded condoms.

=== Other ===
The [[anti-rape condom]] is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape-aXe: Questions and answers |publisher=Rape-aXe |year=2006 |url=http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503104839/http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |archivedate=2009-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[#Infertility treatment|collection condom]] is used to collect semen for fertility treatments or sperm analysis. These condoms are designed to maximize sperm life.

Some condom-like devices are intended for entertainment only, such as glow-in-the dark condoms. These [[novelties|novelty]] condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and STDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;planned parenthood&quot; /&gt;

== Prevalence ==
The prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries. Most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women, or women in informal unions. Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in that country, condoms account for almost 80% of contraceptive use by married women. On average, in developed countries, condoms are the most popular method of birth control: 28% of married contraceptive users rely on condoms. In the average less-developed country, condoms are less common: only 6–8% of married contraceptive users choose condoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Family Planning Worldwide: 2008 Data Sheet |publisher=Population Reference Bureau |year=2008 |url=http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911033118/http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 }} Data from surveys 1997–2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

=== Before the 19th century ===
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 |title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}} In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman's responsibility, and the only well documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|17,23}} In Asia before the 15th century, some use of [[glans]] condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded. Condoms seem to have been used for contraception, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|60–1}}

In 16th-century Italy, anatomist and physician [[Gabriele Falloppio]] wrote a treatise on [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}} The earliest documented strain of syphilis, first appearing in Europe in a 1490s outbreak, caused severe symptoms and often death within a few months of contracting the disease.&lt;ref name=Scars_of_Venus&gt;{{cite book | author=Oriel, JD |title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=978-0-387-19844-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diamond1&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans of the penis]], and were held on with a ribbon.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}}&lt;ref name=pai&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Topic: History of Condom Use |publisher=Population Action International |year=2002 |url=http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714101959/http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |archivedate=14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Falloppio claimed that an experimental trial of the linen sheath demonstrated protection against syphilis.&lt;ref name=&quot;youssef&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Youssef |first=H |date=1 April 1993|title=The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86|pages=226–228 | pmid = 7802734|issue=4|pmc=1293956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication that these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]], who condemned them as immoral.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|56}} In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of &quot;condons&quot;, the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|66–8}} (Other early spellings include &quot;condam&quot; and &quot;quondam&quot;, from which the Italian derivation &quot;guantone&quot; has been suggested, from &quot;guanto&quot;, &quot;a glove.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=condom |title=Condom &amp;#124; Search Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2017-01-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118222011/http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=condom |archivedate=2017-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Condom 1900.jpg|left|thumb|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900]]
In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. In the late 16th century, Dutch traders introduced condoms made from &quot;fine leather&quot; to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|61}}

[[File:Condoomgebruik in de 19e eeuw.png|right|thumb|170px|[[Giacomo Casanova]] tests his condom for holes by inflating it]]
[[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] in the 18th century was one of the first reported using &quot;assurance caps&quot; to prevent impregnating his mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer P. (1965) 'the Birth controllers', London: Secker and Warburg and Dingwall EJ. (1953) 'Early contraceptive sheaths' BMJ, Jan 1: 40–1 in Lewis M. 'A Brief history of condoms' in Mindel A. (2000) 'Condoms', BMJ books&lt;/ref&gt;

From at least the 18th century, condom use was opposed in some legal, religious, and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today: condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation; they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections, while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity; and, they are not used consistently due to inconvenience, expense, or loss of sensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|73,86–8,92}}

Despite some opposition, the condom market grew rapidly. In the 18th century, condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or &quot;skin&quot; (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulfur]] and [[lye]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|94–5}} They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|90–2,97,104}} They later spread to America, although in every place there were generally used only by the middle and upper classes, due to both expense and lack of sex education.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|116–21}}

=== 1800 through 1920s ===
[[File:El Paral·lel 1894-1939- exhibit at CCCB in Barcelona (78).JPG|thumb|An old-fashioned condom package]]
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control to the condom. By the late 19th century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|152–3}} Other writers cited both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|88,90,125,129–30}}

Many countries passed laws impeding the manufacture and promotion of contraceptives.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|144,163–4,168–71,193}} In spite of these restrictions, condoms were promoted by traveling lecturers and in newspaper advertisements, using euphemisms in places where such ads were illegal.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|127,130–2,138,146–7}} Instructions on how to make condoms at home were distributed in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|126,136}} Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|173–4}}

[[File:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|left|thumb|200px|During World War I, the U.S. military was the only one that did not promote condom use. Posters such as these were intended to promote abstinence.]]
Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the [[American Civil War]], and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|137–8,159}} To fight the growing epidemic, sex education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted. They generally taught that abstinence was the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|179–80}} Condoms were not promoted for disease prevention because the medical community and moral watchdogs considered STDs to be punishment for sexual misbehavior. The stigma against victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|176}}

[[File:Condom with manual from 1813.jpg|thumb|400px|Condom (and manual) from 1813]]
The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the later 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|169,181}} Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|180–3}} During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|187–90}}

In the decades after World War I, there remained social and legal obstacles to condom use throughout the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|208–10}} Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because he thought it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all &quot;unnatural means of conception avoidance&quot;. London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the huge number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|211–2}}

However, European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|213–4}} Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|197}} Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|204,206,221–2}} Worldwide, condom sales doubled in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|210}}

=== Rubber and manufacturing advances ===
In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] discovered a way of processing natural [[rubber]], which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm, in such a way as to make it elastic. This proved to have advantages for the manufacture of condoms; unlike the sheep's gut condoms, they could stretch and did not tear quickly when used. The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was patented by Goodyear in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' |title=CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber |journal=Scientific American Supplement |issue=787 |date=1891-01-31 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 |accessdate=2008-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Charles Goodyear Story: The Strange Story of Rubber |journal=Reader's Digest |date=January 1958 |url=http://www.goodyear.com/corporate/history/history_story.html |accessdate=2008-06-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509075421/http://www.goodyear.com/corporate/history/history_story.html |archivedate=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first rubber condom was produced in 1855.&lt;ref name=billy&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubbers haven't always been made of rubber |work=Billy Boy: The excitingly different condom |url=http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |accessdate=2006-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721104435/http://www.billy-boy.com/english/info/ |archivedate=2006-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest rubber condoms had a seam and were as thick as a bicycle inner tube. Besides this type, small rubber condoms covering only the [[glans]] were often used in England and the United States. There was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight, it would constrict the penis. This type of condom was the original &quot;capote&quot; (French for condom), perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman's bonnet worn at that time, also called a [[Bonnet (headgear)|capote]].

For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|148}} In 1912, Polish-born inventor [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;billy&quot; /&gt; Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|200}} [[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of [[gasoline]] and [[benzene]] eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|199–200}}

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semi-skilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made. The first fully automated line was patented in 1930. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|201–3}} The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|220}}

=== 1930 to present ===
In 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|227}} The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|228–9}} In the 1930s, legal restrictions on condoms began to be relaxed.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|216,226,234}}&lt;ref name=&quot;note&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Biographical Note |work=The Margaret Sanger Papers |publisher=Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. |year=1995 |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |accessdate=2006-10-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912180741/http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |archivedate=2006-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But during this period [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] increased restrictions on condoms (limited sales as disease preventatives were still allowed).&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|252,254–5}} During the Depression, condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity. Schmid still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture which had two advantages over the latex variety. Firstly, cement-dipped condoms could be safely used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]]. Secondly, while less comfortable, these older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|217–9}} More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] began to regulate the quality of condoms sold in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|223–5}}

Throughout [[World War II]], condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but also heavily promoted with films, posters, and lectures.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|236–8,259}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|252–4,257–8}} In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to this day. After the war, condom sales continued to grow. From 1955–1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950–1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 début, but condoms remained a strong second. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the &quot;world population crises&quot;: by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}}(This number has grown in recent decades: in 2004, the government of India purchased 1.9 billion condoms for distribution at family planning clinics.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=AP |last=Sharma |title=Annual Report of the Tariff Commission |page=9 |publisher=India government |year=2006 |url=http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619062117/http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology and other terms ===
The term ''condom'' first appears in the early 18th century. Its etymology is unknown.
In popular tradition, the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], one &quot;Dr. Condom&quot; or &quot;Earl of Condom&quot;. There is however no evidence of the existence of such a person, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|54,68}}

Other terms are also commonly used to describe condoms. In North America condoms are also commonly known as ''[[prophylactics]]'', or ''rubbers''. In Britain they may be called ''French letters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=French letter |work=[[Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/french%20letter |accessdate=2009-07-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424023036/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/french%20letter |archivedate=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, condoms may be referred to using the manufacturer's name.

== Society and culture ==

Some [[moral]] and [[scientific]] criticism of condoms exists despite the many benefits of condoms agreed on by [[scientific consensus]] and sexual health experts.

Condom usage is typically recommended for new couples who have yet to develop full trust in their partner with regard to STDs. Established couples on the other hand have few concerns about STDs, and can use other methods of birth control such as [[birth control pill|the pill]], which does not act as a barrier to intimate sexual contact. Note that the polar debate with regard to condom usage is attenuated by the target group the argument is directed. Notably the age category and stable partner question are factors, as well as the distinction between heterosexual and homosexuals, who have different kinds of sex and have different risk consequences and factors.

Among the prime objections to condom usage is the blocking of erotic sensation, or the intimacy that barrier-free sex provides. As the condom is held tightly to the skin of the penis, it diminishes the delivery of stimulation through rubbing and friction. Condom proponents claim this has the benefit of making sex last longer, by diminishing sensation and delaying male ejaculation. Those who promote condom-free heterosexual sex (slang: &quot;[[Bareback (sex)|bareback]]&quot;) claim that the condom puts a barrier between partners, diminishing what is normally a highly sensual, intimate, and spiritual connection between partners.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by [[direct and intentional]] acts (for example, [[Human sterilization|surgery to prevent conception]]) or foreign objects (for example, condoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanæ Vitæ |author=Pope Paul VI |date=1968-07-25 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |accessdate=2009-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303114045/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |archivedate=2011-03-03 |author-link=Pope Paul VI }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of condoms to prevent [[Sexually Transmitted Infections|STI]] transmission is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high-ranking Catholic authorities. A few, such as Belgian Cardinal [[Godfried Danneels]], believe the Catholic Church should actively support condoms used to prevent disease, especially serious diseases such as [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hooper |first1=John |last2=Osborn |first2=Andrew |title=Cardinal backs use of condoms |work=The Guardian |date=2004-01-13 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/13/religion.catholicism |accessdate=2009-08-26 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827223205/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/13/religion.catholicism |archivedate=2013-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority view—including all statements from the Vatican—is that condom-promotion programs encourage promiscuity, thereby actually increasing STI transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;catholicafrica&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alsan |first=Marcella |title=The Church &amp; AIDS in Africa: Condoms &amp; the Culture of Life |journal=Commonweal: A Review of Religion, Politics, and Culture |volume=133 |issue=8 |date=April 2006 |url=http://www.aids.net.au/us-catholic-20060421.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821143901/http://www.aids.net.au/us-catholic-20060421.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-08-21 |accessdate=2006-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vatican&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Trujillo | first = Alfonso Cardinal López | title = Family Values Versus Safe Sex | publisher = Pontifical Council for the Family | date = 2003-12-01 | url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_20031201_family-values-safe-sex-trujillo_en.html#Pregnancy | accessdate = 2009-07-18 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090728003316/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/family/documents/rc_pc_family_doc_20031201_family-values-safe-sex-trujillo_en.html#Pregnancy | archivedate = 2009-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was most recently reiterated in 2009 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Condoms 'not the answer to AIDS': Pope | work = World News Australia | publisher = SBS | date = 2009-03-17 | url = http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-'not-the-answer-to-AIDS':-Pope | accessdate = 2009-07-26 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130618074844/http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-%27not-the-answer-to-AIDS%27%3A-Pope | archivedate = 2013-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2011 interview, Pope Benedict XVI discussed for the first time the use of condoms to prevent STI transmission. He said that the use of a condom can be justified in a few individual cases if the purpose is to reduce the risk of an HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jonathan Wynne-Jones |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/8148944/The-Pope-drops-Catholic-ban-on-condoms-in-historic-shift.html |title=The Pope drops Catholic ban on condoms in historic shift |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2010 |location=London |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122052824/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/8148944/The-Pope-drops-Catholic-ban-on-condoms-in-historic-shift.html |archivedate=22 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave as an example male prostitutes. There was some confusion at first whether the statement applied only to homosexual prostitutes and thus not to heterosexual intercourse at all. However, [[Federico Lombardi]], spokesman for the Vatican, clarified that it applied to heterosexual and transsexual prostitutes, whether male or female, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/world/europe/24pope.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Rachel | last1=Donadio | first2=Laurie | last2=Goodstein | title=Vatican Confirms Shift on Condoms as AIDS Prevention | date=2010-11-23 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221084914/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/world/europe/24pope.html | archivedate=2017-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, also clarify that the Vatican's principles on sexuality and contraception had not been changed.

=== Scientific and environmental ===
More generally, some scientific researchers have expressed objective concern over certain ingredients sometimes added to condoms, notably [[talc]] and [[nitrosamine]]s. Dry dusting powders are applied to latex condoms before packaging to prevent the condom from sticking to itself when rolled up. Previously, talc was used by most manufacturers, but [[cornstarch]] is currently the most popular dusting powder.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhi4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Caroline E |title=Chapter 4: Recent Advances in the Research, Development and Manufacture of Latex Rubber Condoms |journal=The Latex Condom: Recent Advances, Future Directions |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/booksReports/latexcondom/recentadvances.htm |accessdate=2007-04-08 |year=1998 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405095036/http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/booksReports/latexcondom/recentadvances.htm |archivedate=2007-04-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Talc is known to be toxic if it enters the abdominal cavity (i.e., via the [[vagina]]). Cornstarch is generally believed to be safe; however, some researchers have raised concerns over its use as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;fhi4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wright, H |author2=Wheeler, J |author3=Woods, J |author4=Hesford, J |author5=Taylor, P |author6=Edlich, R |title=Potential toxicity of retrograde uterine passage of particulate matter |journal=J Long Term Eff Med Implants |volume=6 |issue=3–4 |pages=199–206 |year=1996 |pmid=10167361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Used condom.jpg|right|thumb|Used condom on a street]]
In addition, the large-scale use of disposable condoms has resulted in concerns over their environmental impact via [[littering]] and in [[landfills]], where they can eventually wind up in [[wildlife]] environments if not [[incinerated]] or otherwise permanently disposed of first. Polyurethane condoms in particular, given they are a form of [[plastic]], are not [[biodegradable]], and latex condoms take a very long time to break down. Experts, such as [[AVERT]], recommend condoms be disposed of in a garbage receptacle, as flushing them down the toilet (which some people do) may cause plumbing blockages and other problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;AliceDisposal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentally-friendly condom disposal |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=December 20, 2002 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |accessdate=2007-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020050953/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |title=Using Condoms, Condom Types &amp; Condom Sizes |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621222629/http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |archivedate=2009-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plastic and foil wrappers condoms are packaged in are also not biodegradable. However, the benefits condoms offer are widely considered to offset their small landfill mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;AliceDisposal&quot; /&gt; Frequent condom or wrapper disposal in public areas such as a parks have been seen as a persistent litter problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;power&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7175.48 |pmid=9872892 |pmc=1114541 |title=Narrative based medicine: Why study narrative? |journal=BMJ |volume=318 |issue=7175 |pages=48–50 |year=1999 |last1=Greenhalgh |first1=T. |last2=Hurwitz |first2=B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While biodegradable,&lt;ref name=&quot;AliceDisposal&quot; /&gt; latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly. According to the Ocean Conservancy, condoms, along with [[marine debris|certain other types of trash]], cover the [[coral reef]]s and smother [[sea grass]] and other bottom dwellers. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hightower |first1=Eve |last2=Hall |first2=Phoebe |title=Clean sex, wasteful computers and dangerous mascara&amp;nbsp;– Ask E |journal=[[E–The Environmental Magazine]] |date=March–April 2003 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |accessdate=2007-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227050429/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |archivedate=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural barriers to use ===
In much of the [[Western world]], the introduction of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}} In [[Japan]], oral contraceptives were not approved for use until September 1999, and even then access was more restricted than in other industrialized nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Hayashi, Aiko |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2006-06-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629074107/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |archivedate=2006-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because of this restricted access to hormonal contraception, Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in 2008, 80% of contraceptive users relied on condoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot; /&gt;

Cultural attitudes toward [[gender roles]], [[contraception]], and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] vary greatly around the world, and range from extremely conservative to extremely liberal. But in places where condoms are misunderstood, mischaracterised, demonised, or looked upon with overall cultural disapproval, the prevalence of condom use is directly affected. In less-developed countries and among less-educated populations, misperceptions about how disease transmission and conception work negatively affect the use of condoms; additionally, in cultures with more traditional gender roles, women may feel uncomfortable demanding that their partners use condoms.

As an example, [[Latino]] immigrants in the United States often face cultural barriers to condom use. A study on female HIV prevention published in the ''Journal of Sex Health Research'' asserts that Latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender-role norms in the Latino community, and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners. Women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general [[machismo]] subtly encouraged in Latino culture, their male partners would be angry or possibly [[domestic violence|violent]] at the woman's suggestion that they use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gomez |first=Cynthia A |year=1996 |title=Gender, Culture, and Power: Barriers to HIV-Prevention Strategies for Women |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=355–362 |author2=Marín |doi=10.1080/00224499609551853 |jstor=3813287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low-income [[African-American|American black]] women; the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kalichman |first1=Seth C. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Ernestine A. | last3 = Cherry | first3 = Charsey | last4 = Belcher | first4 = Lisa | last5 = Nachimson | first5 = Dena | title = Sexual coercion, domestic violence, and negotiating condom use among low-income African American women | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–378 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.371 |pmid=9580917 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A telephone survey conducted by [[Rand Corporation]] and [[Oregon State University]], and published in the ''[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]]'' showed that belief in [[AIDS conspiracy theories]] among United States black men is linked to rates of condom use. As conspiracy beliefs about AIDS grow in a given sector of these black men, consistent condom use drops in that same sector. Female use of condoms was not similarly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594 |title=AIDS Conspiracy Theory Belief Linked to Less Condom Use |last=Dotinga |first=Randy |publisher=SexualHealth.com |accessdate=2009-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702133205/http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594 |archivedate=2010-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the African continent, condom promotion in some areas has been impeded by anti-condom campaigns by some Muslim&lt;ref name=&quot;northeast kenya&quot; /&gt; and Catholic clerics.&lt;ref name=&quot;catholicafrica&quot; /&gt; Among the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Tanzania]], condom use is hampered by an aversion to &quot;wasting&quot; sperm, which is given sociocultural importance beyond reproduction. Sperm is believed to be an &quot;elixir&quot; to women and to have beneficial health effects. Maasai women believe that, after conceiving a child, they must have sexual intercourse repeatedly so that the additional sperm aids the child's development. Frequent condom use is also considered by some Maasai to cause impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13691050701208474 |pmid=17612958 |title=Wasting semen: Context and condom use among the Maasai |journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=387–401 |year=2007 |last1=Coast |first1=Ernestina |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai%28LSERO%29.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women in Africa believe that condoms are &quot;for prostitutes&quot; and that respectable women should not use them.&lt;ref name=&quot;northeast kenya&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336 |title=Muslim opposition to condoms limits distribution |date=Sep 17, 2007 |publisher=PlusNews |accessdate=2009-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003165407/http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336 |archivedate=2007-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few clerics even promote the lie that condoms are deliberately laced with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |title=Islam, Condoms and AIDS |last=Kamau |first=Pius |date=August 24, 2008 |work=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2009-03-26 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115211414/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |archivedate=November 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, possession of many condoms has been used by police to accuse women of engaging in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guza |first1=Megan |title=Condoms criminalized in Allegheny County prostitution cases |url=http://triblive.com/local/allegheny/13690556-74/condoms-criminalized-in-allegheny-county-prostitution-cases |accessdate=6 June 2018 |publisher=Trib Live |date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Big2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |title=NY bill would bar condoms as proof of prostitution |last1=KLEPPER |first1=DAVID |date=27 April 2014 |work=Associated Press |accessdate=27 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427210304/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |archivedate=27 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]] has condemned this practice and there are efforts to end it.&lt;ref name=Big2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wurth|first=MH|author2=Schleifer, R |author3=McLemore, M |author4=Todrys, KW |author5= Amon, JJ |title=Condoms as evidence of prostitution in the United States and the criminalization of sex work.|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|date=May 24, 2013|volume=16|page=18626|pmid=23706178 |pmc=3664300 |doi=10.7448/ias.16.1.18626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |title=City to cease using condoms as evidence in prostitution cases |last1=Chanoff |first1=Yael |date=7 October 2014 |website=www.sfbg.com |publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian |accessdate=27 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428022226/http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |archivedate=28 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, technology mogul [[Bill Gates]] offered a US$100,000 grant through his foundation for a condom design that &quot;significantly preserves or enhances pleasure&quot; to encourage more males to adopt the use of condoms for safer sex. The grant information states: &quot;The primary drawback from the male perspective is that condoms decrease pleasure as compared to no condom, creating a trade-off that many men find unacceptable, particularly given that the decisions about use must be made just prior to intercourse. Is it possible to develop a product without this stigma, or better, one that is felt to enhance pleasure?&quot;. The project has been named the &quot;Next Generation Condom&quot; and anyone who can provide a &quot;testable hypothesis&quot; is eligible to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Gates offers $100,000 grant for improved condoms|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=24 March 2013|author=Jessica Chasmar|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504144403/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|archivedate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle-Eastern couples who have not had children, because of the strong desire and social pressure to establish fertility as soon as possible within marriage, rarely use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 3649633|title= The Sociocultural Context of Condom Use Within Marriage in Rural Lebanon|last1= Kulczycki|first1= Andrzej|date= 4 December 2004 |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=246–260 |doi= 10.1111/j.0039-3665.2004.00029.x|pmid= 15628783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, India restricted TV advertisements for condoms to between the hours of 10PM to 6AM. Family planning advocates were against this, saying it was liable to &quot;undo decades of progress on sexual and reproductive health&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/12/india-bans-condom-adverts-during-primetime-tv India bans condom adverts during primetime TV ] The Guardian, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|322,328}} Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations. Most large manufacturers have ties to the business that reach back to the end of the 19th century.

A [[spray-on condom]] made of latex is intended to be easier to apply and more successful in preventing the transmission of diseases. {{as of|2009}}, the spray-on condom was not going to market because the drying time could not be reduced below two to three minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Lefevre | first = Callie | title = Spray-On Condoms: Still a Hard Sell | work = TIME Magazine | date = 2008-08-13 | url = http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1832445,00.html | accessdate = 2009-07-26 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090523103504/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1832445,00.html | archivedate = 2009-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spraytv&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2F10vor10%2F2006%2F10vor10_29112006.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A23%3A35.732%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A27%3A02.140 |title=Spray-On-Condom |accessdate=2006-12-03 |publisher=Schweizer Fernsehen News |date=November 29, 2006 |format=streaming video [Real format] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206171909/http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2F10vor10%2F2006%2F10vor10_29112006.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A23%3A35.732%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A27%3A02.140 |archivedate=December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spray&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spraykondom.de/spraycondom/index.php? |title=Spray-On-Condom |accessdate=2006-12-03 |publisher=Institut für Kondom-Beratung |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211204724/http://www.spraykondom.de/spraycondom/index.php |archivedate=2006-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Invisible Condom, developed at [[Université Laval]] in Quebec, Canada, is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours. {{as of|2005}}, the invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has not yet been approved for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safety, Tolerance and Acceptability Trial of the Invisible Condom in Healthy Women |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |accessdate=2006-08-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829080802/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |archivedate=2006-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also developed in 2005 is a condom treated with an erectogenic compound. The drug-treated condom is intended to help the wearer maintain his erection, which should also help reduce slippage. If approved, the condom would be marketed under the Durex brand. {{as of|2007}}, it was still in [[clinical trials]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|345}} In 2009, Ansell Healthcare, the makers of Lifestyle condoms, introduced the X2 condom lubricated with &quot;Excite Gel&quot; which contains the amino acid l-arginine and is intended to improve the strength of the erectile response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifestyles.com/condoms.php |title=Condoms: Lifestyles Condoms |publisher=Lifestyles.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109010100/http://www.lifestyles.com/condoms.php |archivedate=2011-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
