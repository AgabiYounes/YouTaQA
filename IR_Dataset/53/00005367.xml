The Cambrian marked a profound change in [[life|life on Earth]]; prior to the Cambrian, the majority of living organisms on the whole were small, [[unicellular organism|unicellular]] and simple; the [[Precambrian]] ''[[Charnia]]'' being exceptional.  Complex, [[multicellular organism]]s gradually became more common in the millions of years immediately preceding the Cambrian, but it was not until this period that mineralized—hence readily fossilized—organisms became common.&lt;ref name=Butterfield2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butterfield |first1=N.

Although diverse life forms prospered in the oceans, the land is thought to have been comparatively barren—with nothing more complex than a microbial [[cryptobiotic soil|soil crust]]&lt;ref name = schieber&gt;Schieber, 2007, pp. 53–71.&lt;/ref&gt; and a few molluscs that emerged to browse on the microbial biofilm.&lt;ref name=Seilacher&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Seilacher |first1=A. |last2=Hagadorn |first2=J.W. |year=2010 |title=Early Molluscan evolution: evidence from the trace fossil record |journal=PALAIOS |volume=25 |issue=9 |pages=565–575 |doi=10.2110/palo.2009.p09-079r |bibcode=2010Palai..25..565S |url=http://palaeo-electronica.org/2007_1/marine/marine.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[continent]]s were probably dry and rocky due to a lack of vegetation. Shallow seas flanked the margins of several continents created during the breakup of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pannotia]]. The seas were relatively warm, and polar ice was absent for much of the period.

{{Further|Stratigraphy of the Cambrian}}
The base of the Cambrian lies atop a complex assemblage of [[trace fossil]]s known as the ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' assemblage.&lt;ref name=Knoll2004a&gt;A. Knoll, M. Walter, G. Narbonne, and N. Christie-Blick (2004) &quot;[http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/ediacaran/Knoll_et_al_2004a.pdf The Ediacaran Period: A New Addition to the Geologic Time Scale.]&quot; Submitted on Behalf of the Terminal Proterozoic Subcommission of the International Commission on Stratigraphy.&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of ''Treptichnus pedum'', a reference [[Trace fossil|ichnofossil]] to mark the lower boundary of the Cambrian, is difficult since the occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the Treptichnids group are found well below the ''T. pedum'' in [[Namibia]], [[Spain]] and [[Newfoundland]], and possibly in the western USA. The stratigraphic range of ''T. pedum'' overlaps the range of the [[Ediacaran]] fossils in Namibia, and probably in Spain.&lt;ref name=Fedonkin2007&gt;M.A. Fedonkin, B.S.

=== Subdivisions {{anchor|Subdivisions}} ===
The Cambrian Period followed the [[Ediacaran]] Period and was followed by the [[Ordovician]] Period. The Cambrian is divided into four [[epoch (geology)|epochs]] ([[series (stratigraphy)|series]]) and ten [[age (geology)|ages]] ([[stage (stratigraphy)|stages]]). Currently only three series and six stages are named and have a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|GSSP]] (an internationally agreed-upon stratigraphic reference point).

Because the international stratigraphic subdivision is not yet complete, many local subdivisions are still widely used. In some of these subdivisions the Cambrian is divided into three series (epochs) with locally differing names&amp;nbsp;– the Early Cambrian (Caerfai or Waucoban, {{period span|early cambrian}} mya), [[Middle Cambrian]] (St Davids or Albertan, {{period span|middle cambrian}} mya) and [[Furongian]] ({{period span|late Cambrian}} mya; also known as Late Cambrian, Merioneth or Croixan). Rocks of these epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle, or Upper Cambrian.

[[Trilobite zone]]s allow biostratigraphic correlation in the Cambrian.

Each of the local series is divided into several stages. The Cambrian is divided into several regional [[faunal stages]] of which the Russian-Kazakhian system is most used in international parlance:

=== Dating the Cambrian ===
[[Image:Archeocyathids.JPG|thumb|[[Archeocyathid]]s from the [[Poleta formation]] in the [[Death Valley]] area]]
The International Commission on Stratigraphy list the Cambrian period as beginning at {{Ma|Cambrian}} and ending at {{Ma|Ordovician}}.

The lower boundary of the Cambrian was originally held to represent the first appearance of complex life, represented by [[trilobite]]s.  The recognition of [[small shelly fossils]] before the first trilobites, and [[Ediacara biota]] substantially earlier, led to calls for a more precisely defined base to the Cambrian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1144/SP448.10|title=The Precambrian–Phanerozoic and Ediacaran–Cambrian boundaries: A historical approach to a dilemma|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|volume=448|issue=1|pages=311–349|year=2016|last1=Geyer|first1=Gerd|last2=Landing|first2=Ed|bibcode=2017GSLSP.448..311G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the long recognition of its distinction from younger [[Ordovician]] rocks and older [[Precambrian]] rocks, it was not until 1994 that the Cambrian system/period was internationally ratified. After decades of careful consideration, a continuous sedimentary sequence at Fortune Head, [[Newfoundland]] was settled upon as a formal base of the Cambrian period, which was to be correlated worldwide by the earliest appearance of ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;  Discovery of this fossil a few metres below the GSSP led to the refinement of this statement, and it is the ''T. pedum'' ichnofossil assemblage that is now formally used to correlate the base of the Cambrian.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2013.03.008|title=Cambrian Evolutionary Radiation: Context, correlation, and chronostratigraphy—Overcoming deficiencies of the first appearance datum (FAD) concept|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=123|pages=133–172|year=2013|last1=Landing|first1=Ed|last2=Geyer|first2=Gerd|last3=Brasier|first3=Martin D.|last4=Bowring|first4=Samuel A.|bibcode=2013ESRv..123..133L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This formal designation allowed radiometric dates to be obtained from samples across the globe that corresponded to the base of the Cambrian.  Early dates of {{Ma|570}} quickly gained favour,&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt; though the methods used to obtain this number are now considered to be unsuitable and inaccurate.  A more precise date using modern radiometric dating yield a date of {{Ma|541|error=0.3}}.&lt;ref name=Gradstein2004&gt;{{cite book

Nevertheless, there are arguments that the dated horizon in Oman does not correspond to the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, but represents a facies change from marine to evaporite-dominated strata — which would mean that dates from other sections, ranging from 544 or 542 Ma, are more suitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

== Climate ==
The Earth was generally cold during the early Cambrian, probably due to the ancient continent of Gondwana covering the [[South Pole]] and cutting off polar ocean currents. However, average temperatures were 7 degrees Celsius higher than today.  There were likely polar ice caps and a series of glaciations, as the planet was still recovering from an earlier [[Snowball Earth]]. It became warmer towards the end of the period; the glaciers receded and eventually disappeared, and sea levels rose dramatically. This trend would continue into the [[Ordovician]] period.

== Flora ==
Although there were a variety of macroscopic marine plants{{which|date=September 2016}}{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} no [[land plant]] ([[embryophyte]]) fossils are known from the Cambrian. However, biofilms and microbial mats were well developed on Cambrian tidal flats and beaches 500 mya.,&lt;ref name = schieber/&gt; and microbes forming microbial Earth ecosystems, comparable with modern [[cryptobiotic soil|soil crust]] of desert regions, contributing to soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Retallack | first1 = G.J. | year = 2008 | title = Cambrian palaeosols and landscapes of South Australia | url = | journal = Alcheringa | volume = 55 | issue = 8| pages = 1083–1106 | doi=10.1080/08120090802266568|bibcode = 2008AuJES..55.1083R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-07-greening-earth.html|title=Greening of the Earth pushed way back in time|publisher=Phys.org|date = 22 July 2013|author = University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most animal life during the Cambrian was aquatic. [[Trilobite]]s were once assumed to be the dominant life form at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humboldt.edu/natmus/lifeThroughTime/Cambrian.web/index.html|title=Cambrian |date = 28 October 2012|last = Paselk|first = Richard|publisher=Humboldt State University|work = Natural History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has proven to be incorrect. [[Arthropod]]s were by far the most dominant animals in the ocean, but trilobites were only a minor part of the total arthropod diversity. What made them so apparently abundant was their heavy armor reinforced by calcium carbonate (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which fossilized far more easily than the fragile [[chitin]]ous exoskeletons of other arthropods, leaving numerous preserved remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=3 Evolving Respiratory Systems as a Cause of the Cambrian Explosion - Out of Thin Air: Dinosaurs, Birds, and Earth's Ancient Atmosphere - The National Academies Press|doi=10.17226/11630|year=2006|isbn=978-0-309-10061-8|last1=Ward|first1=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period marked a steep change in the diversity and composition of Earth's biosphere. The [[Ediacaran biota]] suffered a mass extinction at the start of the Cambrian Period, which corresponded to an increase in the abundance and complexity of burrowing behaviour. This behaviour had a [[Cambrian substrate revolution|profound and irreversible effect on the substrate]] which transformed the [[seabed]] [[ecosystem]]s. Before the Cambrian, the sea floor was covered by [[microbial mat]]s. By the end of the Cambrian, burrowing animals had destroyed the mats in many areas through [[bioturbation]], and gradually turned the seabeds into what they are today.{{clarify|reason=What are they today??|date=September 2016}} As a consequence, many of those organisms that were dependent on the mats became extinct, while the other species adapted to the changed environment that now offered new ecological niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/48630/title/As_the_worms_churn|title=As the worms churn|first=Sid|last=Perkins|date=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around the same time there was a seemingly rapid appearance of representatives of all the  mineralized [[phylum|phyla]] except the [[Bryozoa]], which appeared in the Lower [[Ordovician]].&lt;ref name=Taylor2013&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1666/13-029|title=Reinterpretation of the Cambrian 'bryozoan' ''Pywackia'' as an octocoral|year=2013|last1=Taylor|first1=P.D.|last2=Berning|first2=B.|last3=Wilson|first3=M.A.|journal=Journal of Paleontology|volume=87|issue=6|pages=984–990|url=https://zenodo.org/record/907861}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of those phyla were represented only by stem-group forms; and since mineralized phyla generally have a benthic origin, they may not be a good proxy for (more abundant) non-mineralized phyla.&lt;ref name=Budd2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Budd |first1=G.

While the early Cambrian showed such diversification that it has been named the Cambrian Explosion, this changed later in the period, when there occurred a sharp drop in biodiversity. About 515 million years ago, the number of species going extinct exceeded the number of new species appearing. Five million years later, the number of genera had dropped from an earlier peak of about 600 to just 450. Also, the [[speciation]] rate in many groups was reduced to between a fifth and a third of previous levels. 500 million years ago, oxygen levels fell dramatically in the oceans, leading to [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], while the level of poisonous [[hydrogen sulfide]] simultaneously increased, causing another extinction. The later half of Cambrian was surprisingly barren and showed evidence of several rapid extinction events; the [[stromatolite]]s which had been replaced by reef building sponges known as [[Archaeocyatha]], returned once more as the archaeocyathids became extinct. This declining trend did not change until the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/the-ordovician-explosion-651.doc The Ordovician: Life's second big bang]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19916-oxygen-crash-led-to-cambrian-mass-extinction.html#.UxUDwmeYacw|title=Oxygen crash led to Cambrian mass extinction|first=Michael|last=Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Cambrian organisms ventured onto land, producing the trace fossils ''[[Protichnites]]'' and ''[[Climactichnites]]''. Fossil evidence suggests that [[euthycarcinoid]]s, an extinct group of arthropods, produced at least some of the ''Protichnites''.{{sfnm|1a1=Collette|1a2=Hagadorn|1y=2010|2a1=Collette|2a2=Gass|2a3=Hagadorn|2y=2012}} Fossils of the track-maker of ''Climactichnites'' have not been found; however, fossil trackways and resting traces suggest a large, [[slug]]-like [[mollusc]].{{sfnm|1a1=Yochelson|1a2=Fedonkin|1y=1993|2a1=Getty|2a2=Hagadorn|2y=2008}}

In contrast to later periods, the Cambrian fauna was somewhat restricted; free-floating organisms were rare, with the majority living on or close to the sea floor;&lt;ref name=Munnecke2010&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Munnecke | first1 = A.| last2 = Calner | first2 = M.| last3 = Harper | first3 = D.

Many modes of preservation are unique to the Cambrian, and some preserve soft body parts, resulting in an abundance of {{lang|de|[[Lagerstätte]]n}}.
