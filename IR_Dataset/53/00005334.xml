Radio is the most important medium of mass communication. State-run [[Radiodiffusion Nationale Tchadienne]] operates national and regional radio stations. Around a dozen private radio stations are on the air, despite high licensing fees, some run by religious or other non-profit groups. The [[BBC World Service]] (FM 90.6) and [[Radio France Internationale]] (RFI) broadcast in the capital, [[N'Djamena]]. The only television station, [[Tele Tchad]], is state-owned.&lt;ref name=BBCNews-ChadProfile-2012&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13164689 &quot;Chad profile: Media&quot;], ''BBC News'', 14 August 2012. Retrieved 9 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Chad-2012/&gt;

State control of many broadcasting outlets allows few dissenting views.&lt;ref name=BBCNews-ChadProfile-2012/&gt; Journalists are harassed and attacked. On rare occasions journalists are warned in writing by the High Council for Communication to produce more &quot;responsible&quot; journalism or face fines. Some journalists and publishers practice [[self-censorship]]. On 10 October 2012, the High Council on Communications issued a formal warning to La Voix du Paysan, claiming that the station's live broadcast on 30 September incited the public to &quot;insurrection against the government.&quot; The station had broadcast a sermon by a bishop who criticized the government for allegedly failing to use oil wealth to benefit the region.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Chad-2012/&gt;

===Internet censorship and surveillance===
{{See also|Media of Chad|Human rights in Chad}}

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors [[e-mail]] or Internet [[chat rooms]].&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Chad-2012&gt;[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204103 &quot;Chad&quot;], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 26 March 2013. Retrieved 10 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution provides for [[freedom of opinion]], [[freedom of expression|expression]], and [[freedom of the press|press]], but the government does not always respect these rights. Private individuals are generally free to criticize the government without reprisal, but reporters and publishers risk harassment from authorities when publishing critical articles. The 2010 media law abolished prison sentences for defamation and insult, but prohibits &quot;inciting racial, ethnic, or religious hatred,&quot; which is punishable by one to two years in prison and a fine of one to three million CFA francs ($2,000 to $6,000).&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Chad-2012/&gt;
