[[File:Pong (28684491143).jpg|300px|thumb|People playing a large scale version of the iconic ''[[Pong]]'' video game at the [[National Videogame Museum]]|alt=Two children are seen playing a game of Pong on a large-scale monitor.]]{{Video Games|all}}
A '''video game''' is an [[electronic game]] that involves interaction with a [[user interface]] to generate visual feedback on a two- or three-dimensional [[video]] [[display device]] such as a [[touchscreen]], [[virtual reality headset]] or [[computer monitor|monitor]]/[[TV set]]. Since the 1980s, video games have become an increasingly important part of the [[entertainment industry]], and whether [[video games as an art form|they are also a form of art]] is a matter of dispute.

The electronic systems used to play video games are called [[computing platform|platforms]]. Video games are developed and released for one or several platforms and may not be available on others. Specialized platforms such as [[arcade game]]s, which present the game in a large, typically [[currency detector|coin-operated]] chassis, were common in the 1980s in [[amusement arcade|video arcades]], but declined in popularity as other, more affordable platforms became available. These include dedicated devices such as [[video game console]]s, as well as general-purpose computers like a [[laptop]], [[Desktop computer|desktop]] or [[mobile device|handheld computing devices]].

The [[input device]] used for games, the [[game controller]], varies across platforms. Common controllers include [[gamepad]]s, [[joystick]]s, [[mouse (computing)|mouse devices]], [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], the [[touchscreen]]s of [[mobile device]]s, or even a person's body, using a [[Kinect]] sensor. Players view the game on a [[display device]] such as a [[television]] or [[computer monitor]] or sometimes on [[virtual reality]] [[head-mounted display]] goggles. There are often game [[sound effect]]s, music and voice actor lines which come from [[loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]]. Some games in the 2000s include [[haptic technology|haptic]], vibration-creating effects, [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] [[peripheral]]s and [[virtual reality]] headsets.

Since the 2010s, the commercial importance of the [[video game industry]] has been increasing. The emerging Asian markets and [[mobile game]]s on [[smartphone]]s in particular are driving the growth of the industry. As of 2018, video games generated sales of US$134.9 billion annually worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Newzoo Key Numbers |url=https://newzoo.com/key-numbers/ |website=Newzoo |accessdate=20 May 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509014637/https://newzoo.com/key-numbers/ |archivedate=9 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.

[[File:Tennis for Two - Modern recreation.jpg|thumb|A modern recreation of a controller for ''Tennis for Two''|alt=A replica of a Tennis for Two controller.]]
Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats. The earliest example is from 1947—a &quot;[[Cathode ray tube]] Amusement Device&quot; was filed for a patent on 25 January 1947, by [[Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr.]] and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|2455992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by [[radar]] display technology, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;PongStory&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm| title = Welcome to Pong-Story – Introduction| publisher = PONG-Story.com| accessdate = 24 October 2007| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100827183321/http://www.pong-story.com/intro.htm| archivedate = 27 August 2010| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples include: The [[Nimrod (computer)|Nimrod]] computer at the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]]; ''[[OXO]]'' a [[tic-tac-toe]] Computer game by [[A.S.

In 1971, ''[[Computer Space]]'', created by [[Nolan Bushnell]] and [[Ted Dabney]], was the first commercially sold, coin-operated video game. It used a black-and-white television for its display, and the computer system was made of [[7400 series|74 series]] [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] [[integrated circuit|chips]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marvin3m.com/arcade/cspace.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228061939/http://www.marvin3m.com/arcade/cspace.htm |archivedate=28 December 2008 |author=Marvin Yagoda |title=1972 Nutting Associates Computer Space |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was featured in the 1973 [[science fiction film]] ''[[Soylent Green]]''. ''Computer Space'' was followed in 1972 by the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first home console. Modeled after a late 1960s prototype console developed by [[Ralph H. Baer]] called the &quot;Brown Box&quot;, it also used a standard television.&lt;ref name=&quot;PongStory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title = Console Portraits: A 40-Year Pictorial History of Gaming| date = 15 May 2007| author = Orlando, Greg| url = https://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history| magazine = [[Wired News]]| accessdate = 24 October 2007| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080516011520/http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/05/gallery_game_history| archivedate = 16 May 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were followed by two versions of [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]]'s ''[[Pong]]''; an [[Arcade game|arcade]] version in 1972 and a home version in 1975 that dramatically increased video game popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS-GameRev-Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = History of Gaming – Interactive Timeline of Game History| url = https://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/history/timeline_flash.html| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| accessdate = 25 October 2007| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060218080821/http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/history/timeline_flash.html| archivedate = 18 February 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial success of ''Pong'' led numerous other companies to develop ''Pong'' clones and their own systems, spawning the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;InformIT&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Miller, Michael| url = http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=378141| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012152258/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=378141| archivedate = 12 October 2007| title = A History of Home Video Game Consoles| publisher = [[InformIT (publisher)|InformIT]]| date = 1 April 2005| accessdate = 25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

===Platforms===
{{See also|History of video games}}
[[File:Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.jpg|link=File:Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.jpg|thumb|right|After ''[[Pong]]'', the [[Atari 2600]] was the first game console to achieve widespread success and awareness.]]
The term &quot;platform&quot; refers to the specific combination of [[electronic component]]s or computer hardware which, in conjunction with software, allows a video game to operate.&lt;ref name=&quot;platformdef&quot;&gt;{{cite dictionary | title =platform – Definitions from Dictionary.com | dictionary =Dictionary.com | url =http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/platform | accessdate =3 November 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071107070648/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/platform | archivedate =7 November 2007 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;system&quot; is also commonly used. The distinctions below are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms. In addition to [[laptop]]/[[desktop computer]]s and [[mobile device]]s, there are other devices which have the ability to play games but are not primarily video game machines, such as [[PDA]]s and [[graphing calculator]]s.

====PC====
In common use a &quot;[[PC game]]&quot; refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a personal computer connected to a [[video monitor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Olle |first2=Jean Riescher |last2=Westcott |title=Video Game Addiction |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=w-pJDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT16 |publisher=Stylus Publishing, LLC |year=2018 |page=16 |isbn=978-1-937585-84-6 |access-date=9 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809090716/https://books.google.es/books?id=w-pJDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT16 |archive-date=9 August 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal computers are not dedicated game platforms, so there may be differences running the same game on different hardware. Also, the openness allows some features to developers like reduced software cost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/13/is-pc-gaming-really-more-expensive-than-consoles|title=Is PC Gaming Really More Expensive Than Consoles?|first=Rick|last=Lane|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=9 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813150831/http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/12/13/is-pc-gaming-really-more-expensive-than-consoles|archivedate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased flexibility, increased innovation, emulation, creation of modifications (&quot;[[mod (video gaming)|mods]]&quot;), open hosting for [[online game|online gaming]] (in which a person plays a video game with people who are in a different household) and others. A [[Gaming computer]] is a PC or laptop intended specifically for gaming.

====Home console====
[[File:Xbox-360-Pro-wController.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|An [[Xbox 360]] console and controller|alt=A white Xbox 360 console and controller.]]
A &quot;[[console game]]&quot; is played on a specialized electronic device (&quot;[[home video game console]]&quot;) that connects to a common [[television set]] or [[Composite monitor|composite video monitor]], unlike [[personal computer|PCs]], which can run all sorts of computer programs, a console is a dedicated video game platform manufactured by a specific company. Usually consoles only run games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same company, but never games developed by its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on different platforms. It often comes with a specific [[game controller]]. Major console platforms include [[Xbox]], [[PlayStation]], and [[Nintendo]].

====Handheld====
[[File:Game-Boy-FL.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Game Boy|Nintendo Game Boy]] was the first successful handheld console, selling over 100 million systems.|alt=A white Nintendo Game Boy.]]
A &quot;[[Handheld game console|handheld]]&quot; gaming device is a small, self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. It features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons, [[joystick]] or other [[game controller]]s in a single unit. Like consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less powerful than PC or console hardware. Some handheld games from the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one game. In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of handheld games used cartridges, which enabled them to be used to play many different games.

====Arcade====
[[File:Light gun survival horror arcade game.jpg|thumb|right|A police-themed arcade game in which players use a [[light gun]]]]
&quot;[[Arcade game]]&quot; generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special, large coin-operated [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]] which has one built-in console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a [[CRT screen]], and audio amplifier and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game. While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In the 1980s, [[video arcade]]s were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games. In the 2010s, there are far fewer video arcades, but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them.

====Web browser====
The [[web browser]] has also established itself as platform in its own right in the 2000s, while providing a [[cross-platform]] environment for video games designed to be played on a wide spectrum of platforms. In turn, this has generated new terms to qualify classes of web browser-based games. These games may be identified based on the website that they appear, such as with &quot;[[Miniclip]]&quot; games. Others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] games.

====Mobile====
With the advent of standard operating systems for mobile devices such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and devices with greater hardware performance, [[mobile gaming]] has become a significant platform. These games may utilize unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms, such as [[GPS|global positing information]] and camera devices to support [[augmented reality]] gameplay. Mobile games also led into the development of [[microtransactions]] as a valid revenue model for casual games.

====Virtual reality====
[[Virtual reality]] (VR) games generally require players to use a special [[Head-mounted display|head-mounted unit]] that provides [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic screens]] and [[positional tracking|motion tracking]] to immerse a player within virtual environment that responds to their head movements. Some VR systems include control units for the player's hands as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world. VR systems generally require a separate computer, console, or other processing device that couples with the head-mounted unit.

====Blockchain====
A new platform of video games emerged in late 2017 in which users could take ownership of game assets ([[digital asset]]s) using [[Blockchain]] technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|title=CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum|date=12 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112143517/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|archivedate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is [[Cryptokitties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.com&quot;/&gt;

===Genres===
{{Main|Video game genre|Gameplay}}

A video game, like most other forms of media, may be categorized into [[genres]]. Video game genres are used to categorize video games based on their gameplay interaction rather than [[Computer graphics|visual]] or narrative differences.&lt;ref name=Apperley&gt;{{cite journal |accessdate=19 April 2013 |title=Genre and game studies |journal=Simulation &amp; Gaming |author=Apperley, Thomas H. |year=2006 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=6–23 |url=http://trac.assembla.com/CommanderAssembler/export/32/docs/Genre%20and%20game%20studies%20-%20tom-apperley.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005003753/http://trac.assembla.com/CommanderAssembler/export/32/docs/Genre%20and%20game%20studies%20-%20tom-apperley.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 October 2013 |doi=10.1177/1046878105282278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gamasutra&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Background: The Origins of Game Genres| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4074/the_designers_notebook_sorting_.php| author=Adams, Ernest| date=9 July 2009| website=[[Gamasutra]]| accessdate=3 December 2014| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217155232/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4074/the_designers_notebook_sorting_.php| archivedate=17 December 2014| df=dmy-all| author-link=Ernest W. Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt; A video game genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges and are classified independent of their [[setting (fiction)|setting]] or game-world content, unlike other works of fiction such as films or books. For example, a [[shooter game]] is still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space.&lt;ref name=&quot;fundamentals&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Ernest|author2=Andrew Rollings |title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm1jAgAAQBAJ|page=67|isbn=978-0-13-343571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harteveld|first1=Casper|year= 2011|title=Triadic Game Design: Balancing Reality, Meaning and Play|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sIcQYKcoH7IC&amp;dq=lives+game+design|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|page= 71|isbn=978-1-84996-157-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because genres are dependent on content for definition, genres have changed and evolved as newer styles of video games have come into existence. Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more lifelike and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play (such as that seen with games specifically designed for devices like Sony's [[PlayStation Eye|EyeToy]]). Some genres represent combinations of others, such as [[multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA), and [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPG). It is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action, music/rhythm or horror-themed video games.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Classifications===

====Casual games====
{{Main|Casual game}}

Casual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. Examples of [[Video game genre|genres]] within this category are [[match three]], [[hidden object]], [[Time Management (video game genre)|time management]], [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] or many of the [[tower defense]] style games. Casual games are generally available through [[app store]]s and online retailers such as [[PopCap Games|PopCap]] and [[GameHouse]] or provided for free play through [[web portal]]s such as [[Newgrounds]]. While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers, phones or tablets, they can also be found on many of the on-line console system download services (e.g., the [[PlayStation Network]], [[WiiWare]] or [[Xbox Live]]).

====Serious games====
{{Main|Serious game}}

Serious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., [[touch typing]] tutors, language learning programs, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the game's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule. Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as [[exergaming|exercise games]], [[educational game]]s, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.

One of the longest-running serious games franchises is ''[[Microsoft Flight Simulator]]'', first published in 1982 under that name. The United States military uses [[virtual reality]]-based simulations, such as VBS1 for training exercises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/virtual-military.htm |title= How Virtual Reality Military Applications Work |accessdate= 24 November 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100107090741/http://science.howstuffworks.com/virtual-military.htm |archivedate= 7 January 2010 |df= dmy-all |date= 27 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as do a growing number of first responder roles (e.g., police, firefighters, EMTs).&lt;ref&gt;*Anne Derryberry, [https://www.adobe.com/resources/elearning/pdfs/serious_games_wp.pdf &quot;Definition of Serious games] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105154035/http://www.adobe.com/resources/elearning/pdfs/serious_games_wp.pdf |date=5 November 2015 }} ''Adobe.com'' August 2007 &lt;!-- Retrieved 23 August 2009 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a non-game environment utilized as a platform for serious game development would be the virtual world of ''[[Second Life]]'', which is currently used by several United States governmental departments (e.g., [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], [[NASA]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]]), Universities (e.g., [[Ohio University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) for educational and remote learning programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/4163 |title= Serious Games in Virtual Worlds: The Future of Enterprise Business Intelligence |accessdate= 24 November 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081116101818/http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/4163 |archivedate= 16 November 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and businesses (e.g., [[IBM]], [[Cisco Systems]]) for meetings and training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/04/using_second_li_2.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090512205946/http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/04/using_second_li_2.html |archivedate= 12 May 2009 |title= Using Second Life As A Business-To-Business Tool

[[Tactical media]] in video games plays a crucial role in making a statement or conveying a message on important relevant issues. This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be [[newsgame]]s. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiGRA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wingchunsantacruz.com/gamesandart/research/newsgames-DiGRA2009.pdf |title=&quot;Newsgames: Procedural Rhetoric meets Political Cartoons&quot; by Mike Treanor and Michael Mateas |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304111623/http://www.wingchunsantacruz.com/gamesandart/research/newsgames-DiGRA2009.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games. Some of these games include ''[[Darfur is Dying]]'', ''Finding Zoe'', and ''In The Balance''. All of these games bring awareness to important issues and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://takeactiongames.com/TAG/HOME.html|title=TAKE ACTION games|accessdate=9 August 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526033602/http://takeactiongames.com/TAG/HOME.html|archivedate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama launched a campaign called &quot;Educate to Innovate&quot; aimed at improving the technological, mathematical, scientific and engineering abilities of American students. This campaign states that it plans to harness the power of interactive games to help achieve the goal of students excelling in these departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate |title=Educate to Innovate &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504162519/https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/educate-innovate |archivedate=4 May 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en |title=President Obama Launches &quot;Educate to Innovate&quot; Campaign for Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Math (Stem) Education &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=23 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308185543/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-launches-educate-innovate-campaign-excellence-science-technology-en |archivedate=8 March 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign has stemmed into many new opportunities for the video game realm and has contributed to many new competitions. Some of these competitions include the Stem National Video Game Competition and the [[Imagine Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-game-competitions-to-expand-stem-learning-in-the-united-states-71656557.html |title=Video Game Competitions to Expand Stem Learning in the United States |location=District of Columbia |publisher=Prnewswire.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126055729/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-game-competitions-to-expand-stem-learning-in-the-united-states-71656557.html |archivedate=26 November 2009 |access-date=5 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imaginecup.com/support/faq.aspx#Question1.1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822015626/http://imaginecup.com/support/faq.aspx#Question1.1 |archivedate=22 August 2008 |title=Imagine Cup Student Competition – Support FAQ's |date=22 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these bring a focus to relevant and important current issues through gaming. www.NobelPrize.org entices the user to learn about information pertaining to the Nobel prize achievements while engaging in a fun video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/educational/ |title=Educational Games |publisher=Nobelprize.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805094356/http://nobelprize.org/educational/ |archivedate=5 August 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types and styles of educational games, including counting to spelling to games for kids, to games for adults. Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.

===Controllers===
{{Main|Game controller}}
[[File:Nintendo-Super-NES-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|A North American [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] game controller from the early 1990s]]
Video game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game, the most common game controllers are keyboard and mouse for &quot;[[personal computer game|PC games]], consoles usually come with specific [[gamepad]]s, handheld consoles have built in buttons. Other game controllers are commonly used for specific games like [[racing wheel]]s, [[light gun]]s or [[dance pad]]s. [[Digital camera]]s can also be used as game controllers capturing movements of the body of the player.

As technology continues to advance, more can be added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. There are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. Along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. On keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. Most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking. The companies that design the controllers are trying to make the controller visually appealing and also feel comfortable in the hands of the consumer.

An example of a technology that was incorporated into the controller was the [[Tablet computer|touchscreen]]. It allows the player to be able to interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the player's path. Another example is [[Motion controller|motion sensor]] where a person's movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it, and the actions are repeated by a game character.

==Development==
{{Main|Game development}}
{{See also|Video game industry practices}}
[[File:Virtual-camera-system.png|thumb|Developers use various tools to create video games. Here an editor is fine-tuning the [[virtual camera system]].]]

Video game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. [[Video game developer]]s, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include [[game programmer|programmers]] and [[graphic design]]ers. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including [[sound design]]ers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the [[game designer]]. All of these are managed by [[game producer|producers]].

In the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game. As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the age of the &quot;one-man shop&quot; is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets,&lt;ref name=&quot;numberofdevs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =The Edge of Reason? | publisher =eurogamer.net | url =http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-edge-of-reason | accessdate =16 November 2009 | url-status=live | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091119022451/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-edge-of-reason | archivedate =19 November 2009 | df =dmy-all | date =3 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited [[RAM]] or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some [[PDAs]]).{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

With the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowgamer.com/news/513/assassins-creed-ii-triples-size-of-dev-team &quot;Assassin's Creed II dev team triples in size&quot;], Christopher Reynolds, 18 May 2009, NOW Gamer. {{webarchive |url=https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515200949/http://www.nowgamer.com/assassins-creed-ii-dev-team-triples-in-size/ |date=15 May 2016 }}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731|title=The Messy, True Story Behind The Making of Destiny|last=Schreier|first=Jason|newspaper=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=15 November 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115203558/http://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731|archivedate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downloadable content===
{{Main|Downloadable content}}

A phenomenon of additional game content at a later date, often for additional funds, began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content (DLC). Developers can use [[digital distribution]] to issue new storylines after the main game is released, such as [[Rockstar Games]] with ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' (''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost and Damned]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony|The Ballad of Gay Tony]]''), or Bethesda with ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and [[Fallout 3 downloadable content|its expansions]]. New gameplay modes can also become available, for instance, ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and its zombie modes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/downloadable-content/92-329/ |title=Downloadable Content (Concept) |accessdate=23 July 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110801215134/http://www.giantbomb.com/downloadable-content/92-329/ |archivedate=1 August 2011  }}, Giant Bomb.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://orders.bethsoft.com/dlc/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 July 2011 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105153819/https://orders.bethsoft.com/dlc/ |archivedate=5 January 2011 }}, Bethesda.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-escalation-dlc-xbox-release-date/|title=Call of Duty: Black Ops 'Escalation' DLC drops on Xbox 360 May 3|author=Gilbert, Ben|date=11 April 2011|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|accessdate=21 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201063037/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-escalation-dlc-xbox-release-date/|archivedate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a multiplayer mode for ''[[Mushroom Wars]]'' or a higher difficulty level for ''[[Metro: Last Light]]''. Smaller packages of DLC are also common, ranging from better in-game weapons (''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'', ''[[Just Cause 2]]''), character outfits (''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'', ''[[Minecraft]]''), or new songs to perform (''[[SingStar]]'', ''[[Rock Band]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero]]'').

====Expansion packs====
{{Main|Expansion pack}}
A variation of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section to the game that either already exists in the game's code or is developed after the game is released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, and other things that weren't previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is [[Bungie]]'s ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', which had the ''[[Destiny: Rise of Iron|Rise of Iron]]'' expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, and higher levels, and remade old missions.

Expansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game altogether. Developers may plan out their game's life and already have the code for the expansion in the game, but inaccessible by players, who later unlock these expansions, sometimes for free and sometimes at an extra cost. Some developers make games and add expansions later, so that they could see what additions the players would like to have. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, such as [[Ubisoft]]'s expansion ''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]] Freedom's Cry'', which features a different character than the original game.

===Modifications===
{{Main|Mod (computer gaming)}}

Many games produced for the PC are designed such that technically oriented consumers can modify the game. These [[mod (computer gaming)|mods]] can add an extra dimension of replayability and interest. Developers such as [[id Software]], [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], [[Crytek]], [[Bethesda Softworks|Bethesda]], [[Epic Games]] and [[Blizzard Entertainment]] ship their games with some of the development tools used to make the game, along with documentation to assist mod developers. The Internet provides an inexpensive medium to promote and distribute mods, and they may be a factor in the commercial success of some games.&lt;ref name=&quot;lombardi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000484956 |title=Hollywood Reporter interviewing Doug Lombardi, Quote: &quot;Mods absolutely helped us drive huge sales to 'Half-Life'&quot; |accessdate=10 August 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506004712/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000484956 |archivedate=6 May 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for the kind of success seen by popular mods such as the ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]''.

===Cheating===
{{Main|Cheating (video games)}}

Cheating in computer games may involve [[cheat codes]] and hidden spots implemented by the game developers,&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = In Game World, Cheaters Proudly Prosper| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082701059.html| work = Washington Post| author = Vargas, Jose Antonio| date = 28 August 2006| accessdate = 24 October 2007| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110820080450/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082701059.html| archivedate = 20 August 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KonamiCode&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.1up.com/features/cracking-code-konami-code| title = Cracking the Code: The Konami Code| website = [[1UP.com]]| author = 1UP Staff| accessdate = 24 October 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522201923/http://www.1up.com/features/cracking-code-konami-code| archivedate = 22 May 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; modification of game code by third parties,&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCheatCodes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Video Game Cheats and Codes – What Are Cheat Codes?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/WhatAreCheats.htm| publisher = [[About.com]]| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 24 October 2007| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015083207/http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/WhatAreCheats.htm| archivedate = 15 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Why Use Cheats and Codes for Console and PC Games?| url = http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/basicgamingtipstricks/a/whyusecheats.htm| publisher = About.com| author = Rybka, Jason| accessdate = 24 October 2007| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017101254/http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/basicgamingtipstricks/a/whyusecheats.htm| archivedate = 17 October 2007| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or players exploiting a software glitch.

===Glitches===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:UMK3 Fighter Glitch.png|thumb|Example of a color glitch from the video game ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]''  {{deletable image-caption|Thursday, 21 February 2013}}]] --&gt;
{{Main|Glitch}}

Software errors not detected by software testers during development can find their way into released versions of computer and video games. This may happen because the glitch only occurs under unusual circumstances in the game, was deemed too minor to correct, or because the game development was hurried to meet a publication deadline. Glitches can range from minor graphical errors to serious bugs that can delete saved data or cause the game to malfunction. In some cases publishers will release updates (referred to as ''patches'') to repair glitches. Sometimes a glitch may be beneficial to the player; these are often referred to as [[Exploit (online gaming)|exploits]].

===Easter eggs===

The results can vary from a simple printed message or image, to a page of programmer credits or a small videogame hidden inside an otherwise serious piece of software.

==Theory==
{{Main|Game studies}}

Although departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years, theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities. The two most visible schools in this emerging field are [[ludology]] and [[narratology]]. Narrativists approach video games in the context of what [[Janet Murray]] calls &quot;Cyberdrama&quot;. That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of [[interactive fiction]]. Murray puts video games in the context of the [[Holodeck]], a fictional piece of technology from ''[[Star Trek]]'', arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is allowed to become another person, and to act out in another world.{{sfn|Murray|1998}} This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as ''[[Tron]]'', ''[[eXistenZ]]'' and ''[[The Last Starfighter]]''.

Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. [[Espen J. Aarseth]] argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game ''[[Tomb Raider]]'', saying that &quot;the dimensions of [[Lara Croft]]'s body, already analyzed to death by [[film theory|film theorists]], are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Aarseth| first = Espen J.| authorlink = Espen J. Aarseth| date = 21 May 2004| url = http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/vigilant| title = Genre Trouble| publisher = Electronic Book Review| accessdate = 14 June 2006| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619063237/http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/firstperson/vigilant| archivedate = 19 June 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.

While many games rely on [[Emergence|emergent principles]], video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game. The term &quot;emergent narrative&quot; has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by &quot;what happens to the player.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html |title=IGN: GDC 2004: Warren Spector Talks Games Narrative |publisher=Xbox.ign.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411094042/http://xbox.ign.com/articles/502/502409p1.html |archivedate=11 April 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.

==Emulation==
{{Main|Video game console emulator}}
[[File:StarFox64 Emulated with Project64.png|thumb|right|[[Project64]], a [[Nintendo 64]] emulator, running ''[[Star Fox 64]]''  on a [[Windows 8]] platform]]

An emulator is a program that replicates the behavior of a [[video game console]], allowing games to run on a different platform from the original hardware. Emulators exist for [[personal computer|PCs]], [[smartphone]]s and [[video game console|consoles]] other than the original. Emulators are generally used to play old games, [[ROM hacking|hack existing games]], [[Fan translation of video games|translate unreleased games in a specific region]], or add enhanced features to games like improved graphics, speed up or down, bypass regional lockouts, or online multiplayer support.

Some manufacturers have released official emulators for their own consoles. For example, [[Nintendo|Nintendo's]] [[Virtual Console]] allows users to play games for old Nintendo consoles on the [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], and [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]]. Virtual Console is part of Nintendo's strategy for deterring video game piracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.nintendo.com/faq/|title=Nintendo Anti-Piracy – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|accessdate=9 August 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019194216/https://ap.nintendo.com/faq/|archivedate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, [[Microsoft]] launched backwards compatibility of [[Xbox 360]] games on [[Xbox One]] console via emulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xbox-one-backwards-compatible-december-2015/|title=Here are the 'new' backwards-compatible Xbox 360 games on Xbox One|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=9 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721064700/http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xbox-one-backwards-compatible-december-2015/|archivedate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Sony]] announced relaunching [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] games on [[PlayStation 4|PS4]] via emulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamerant.com/sony-wants-fan-input-on-ps2-emulation-games-ps4/|title=Sony Wants Your Input on PS2 Emulation Games for PS4|date=16 December 2015|accessdate=9 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721064728/http://gamerant.com/sony-wants-fan-input-on-ps2-emulation-games-ps4/|archivedate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Bleem!|Sony Computer Entertainment America v.

===Demographics===
{{See also|Gamer#Demographics}}
{{Globalize|date=September 2017}}
The November 2005 Nielsen Active Gamer Study, taking a survey of 2,000 regular [[gamer]]s, found that the U.S. games market is diversifying. The age group among male players has expanded significantly in the 25–40 age group. For casual online puzzle-style and simple mobile cell phone games, the gender divide is more or less equal between men and women. More recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres (e.g., [[first-person shooter]]s). According to the ESRB, almost 41% of PC gamers are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Guy, Hannah |year=2007 | url = http://www.pcworld.ca/news/column/a7fe9b8a0a010408019ac931643ebf2c/pg0.htm | title = Women video gamers: Not just solitaire |archiveurl= http://www.asiancanadian.net/2007/03/women-video-gamers-not-just-solitaire.html |archivedate= 12 March 2007 |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation among African-Americans is lower.

When comparing today's industry climate with that of 20 years ago, women and many adults are more inclined to be using products in the industry. While the market for teen and young adult men is still a strong market, it is the other demographics which are posting significant growth. The [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA) provides the following summary for 2011 based on a study of almost 1,200 American households carried out by Ipsos MediaCT:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ESA | title = Game Player Data | url = http://www.theesa.com/facts/gameplayer.asp | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110626001046/http://www.theesa.com/facts/gameplayer.asp | archivedate = 26 June 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The average gamer is 30 years old and has been playing for 12 years. Eighty-two percent of gamers are 18 years of age or older.
* Forty-two percent of all players are women and women over 18 years of age are one of the industry's fastest growing demographics.
* Twenty-nine percent of game players are over the age of 50, an increase from nine percent in 1999.
* Sixty-five percent of gamers play games with other gamers in person.
* Fifty-five percent of gamers play games on their phones or handheld device.

===Culture===
{{main|Video game culture}}
Video game culture is a worldwide [[new media]] subculture formed around video games and game playing. As computer and video games have increased in popularity over time, they have had a significant influence on popular culture. Video game culture has also evolved over time hand in hand with [[internet culture]] as well as the increasing popularity of [[mobile game]]s. Many people who play video games identify as [[gamer]]s, which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to someone who is passionate about it. As video games become more social with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] and [[Online game|online capability]], gamers find themselves in growing [[social network]]s. Gaming can both be entertainment as well as competition, as a new trend known as [[Esports|electronic sports]] is becoming more widely accepted. In the 2010s, video games and discussions of video game trends and topics can be seen in [[social media]], politics, television, film and music.

===Multiplayer===
{{Main|Multiplayer video game}}

[[Multiplayer video games]] are those that can be played either competitively, sometimes in [[Electronic Sports]], or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices, or by [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseating]]. ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', arguably the first video game, was a two player game, as was its successor ''[[Pong]]''. The first commercially available game console, the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], had two controller inputs. Since then, most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs. Some have had the ability to expand to four, eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters, such as the [[Multitap]]. Multiplayer [[arcade game]]s typically feature play for two to four players, sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another.

Many early computer games for non-PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support. Personal computer systems from [[Atari]] and [[Commodore International|Commodore]] both regularly featured at least two game ports. PC-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations. PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all. Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or [[MUD]]s that were played remotely on a dedicated server. This was due both to the slow speed of modems (300-1200-bit/s), and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it. However, with the advent of widespread [[local area network]]ing technologies and Internet based online capabilities, the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher, sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat. [[Massively multiplayer online game]] (MMOs) can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players; ''[[Eve Online]]'' set a record with 65,303 players on a single server in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;MassivelyEVEPCU&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/05/06/eve-online-smashes-pcu-record-during-anniversary-celebrations/ |title=EVE Online smashes PCU record during anniversary celebrations |publisher=massively.joystiq.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128020244/http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/05/06/eve-online-smashes-pcu-record-during-anniversary-celebrations/ |archivedate=28 January 2015  |access-date=1 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral effects==
{{Main|Video game behavioral effects}}

It has been shown that action video game players have better [[hand–eye coordination]] and [[Motor coordination|visuo-motor skills]], such as their resistance to [[distraction]], their sensitivity to information in the [[peripheral vision]] and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal| authorlink = Shawn Green (game designer)| title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention| journal = Nature| volume = 423| pages = 534–537| year = 2003| id = Green &amp; Bavelier| doi = 10.1038/nature01647| author = Green, C. Shawn| pmid = 12774121| last2 = Bavelier| first2 = Daphne| issue = 6939| bibcode = 2003Natur.423..534G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that switch attention between different locations, but not with games requiring concentration on single objects.

In [[Steven Berlin Johnson|Steven Johnson]]'s book, ''[[Everything Bad Is Good for You]]'', he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]''. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and [[HUD (computer gaming)|HUDs]]. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books |title=Brain Candy |journal=The New Yorker |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509225914/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/05/16/050516crbo_books |archivedate=9 May 2009  |date=9 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Daphne Bavelier| year = 2003 | url = http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf | title = Action video game modifies visual selective attention | publisher = Nature/University of Rochester | accessdate = 29 April 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060329174957/http://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/daphne/GreenandBavelier.pdf |archivedate = 29 March 2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] has deployed machines such as the [[PackBot]] and [[UAV]] vehicles, which make use of a game-style [[Game controller|hand controller]] to make it more familiar for young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2007 | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/iRobot_Receives_New_Military_Orders_14_PackBot_Robots_999.html | title=iRobot Receives New Military Orders 14 PackBot Robots | accessdate=25 July 2007 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215315/http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/iRobot_Receives_New_Military_Orders_14_PackBot_Robots_999.html | archivedate=26 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' [[dexterity]] as well as their ability to do problem solving. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/543366/ Playing Video Games Offers Learning Across Life Span] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916185151/http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/543366/ |date=16 September 2008 }} Newswise.

An experiment carried out by Richard De Lisi and Jennifer Woldorf demonstrates the positive effect that video games may have on spatial skills. De Lisi and Woldorf took two groups of third graders, one control group and one experiment group. Both groups took a paper-and-pencil test of mental rotation skills. After this test, the experiment group only played 11 sessions of the game ''[[Tetris]]''. This game was chosen as it requires mental rotation. After this game, both groups took the test again. The result showed that the scores of the experiment group raised higher than that of the control group, thereby confirming this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woldorf; De Lisi|first=Jennifer; Richard|date=2002|title=Improving Children's Mental Rotation Accuracy With Computer Game Playing|journal=The Journal of Genetic Psychology|volume=163|issue=3|pages=272–282|doi=10.1080/00221320209598683|pmid=12230149|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4b1614e7ec209992f2960bf1cbc37743d71c752c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research showing benefits from action games has been questioned due to methodological shortcomings, such as recruitment strategies and selection bias, potential placebo effects, and lack of baseline improvements in control groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bootetal_2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boot WR, Blakely DP, Simons DJ |title=Do action video games improve perception and cognition? |journal=Front Psychol |volume=2 |pages=226 |year=2011 |pmid=21949513 |pmc=3171788 |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many of the studies are [[cross-sectional]], and of the [[longitudinal study|longitudinal]] interventional trials, not all have found effects.&lt;ref name=Bootetal_2011/&gt; A response to this pointed out that the skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted, such as [[mental rotation]], which is not a common task in action games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Green CS, Bavelier D |title=Learning, attentional control, and action video games |journal=Curr.

===Objections to video games===
{{Main|Video game controversies}}

Like other media, video games have been the subject of objections, controversies, and censorship, for depictions of violence, criminal activities, sexual themes, [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], tobacco and other [[Recreational drug use|drugs]], propaganda, profanity, or [[advergaming|advertisements]]. Critics of video games include parents' groups, politicians, religious groups, scientists and other [[advocacy group]]s. Claims that some video games cause [[video game addiction|addiction]] or violent behavior continue to be made and to be disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christopherjferguson.com/SCOTUSPaper.pdf |title=Video Games and the Supreme Court: Lessons for the scientific community in the wake of Brown v EMA, 2011 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |date=March 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227070340/http://www.christopherjferguson.com/SCOTUSPaper.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of societal and scientific arguments about whether the content of video games change the behavior and attitudes of a player, and whether this is reflected in [[video game culture]] overall. Since the early 1980s, advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an [[games as art|expressive medium]], arguing for their protection under the laws governing [[freedom of speech]] and also [[Video games in education|as an educational tool]]. Detractors argue that video games are [[harm principle|harmful]] and therefore should be [[Free speech limitations|subject to legislative oversight and restrictions]]. The positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study. Results of investigations into links between video games and [[video game addiction|addiction]], [[aggression]], violence, [[psychosocial development|social development]], and a variety of stereotyping and [[sexual morality]] issues are debated.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman J. &quot;Media violence and its effect on aggression: assessing the scientific evidence.&quot; [[University of Toronto Press]], Toronto 2002 {{ISBN|0-8020-8425-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A study was done that claimed that young people who have had a greater exposure to violence in video games ended up behaving more aggressively towards people in a social environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Wendy|last2=Wong|first2=Frank Y.|last3=Chachere|first3=J.

In 2018, the [[World Health Organization]] declared &quot;[[gaming disorder]]&quot; a [[mental disorder]] for people who are addicted to video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Wakefield |first1=Jane |title=Gaming addiction classified as disorder |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42541404 |accessdate=23 June 2018 |date=2 January 2018 |work=[[BBC News]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629220136/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42541404 |archive-date=29 June 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Makuch |first1=Eddie |title=&quot;Gaming Disorder&quot; Is An Actual Disease, World Health Organization Says |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-disorder-is-an-actual-disease-world-health-/1100-6455852/ |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=23 June 2018 |date=2 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620124812/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-disorder-is-an-actual-disease-world-health-/1100-6455852/ |archive-date=20 June 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have claimed video games can negatively affect health and mental state for some players.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabbiadini|first=Alessandro|last2=Riva|first2=Paolo|title=The lone gamer: Social exclusion predicts violent video game preferences and fuels aggressive inclinations in adolescent players|journal=Aggressive Behavior|volume=44|issue=2|pages=113–124|doi=10.1002/ab.21735|pmid=29052252|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible benefits===
In spite of the alleged negative effects of video games, certain studies indicate that they may have value in terms of academic performance, perhaps because of the skills that are developed in the process. &quot;When you play games you’re solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in maths, reading and science that you’ve been taught during the day&quot;, said Alberto Posso an Associate Professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, after analysing data from the results of standardized testing completed by over 12,000 high school students across Australia. As summarized by ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Samuel |date=8 August 2016 |title=Positive link between video games and academic performance, study suggests |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/08/positive-link-between-video-games-and-academic-performance-study-suggests |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=9 August 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808145722/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/08/positive-link-between-video-games-and-academic-performance-study-suggests |archivedate=8 August 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the study (published in the ''[[International Journal of Communication]]'') &quot;found that students who played online games almost every day scored 15 points above average in maths and reading tests and 17 points above average in science.&quot; However, the reporter added an important comment that was not provided by some of the numerous websites that published a brief summary of the Australian study: &quot;[the] methodology cannot prove that playing video games were the cause of the improvement.&quot; ''The Guardian'' also reported that a Columbia University study indicated that extensive video gaming by students in the 6 to 11 age group provided a greatly increased chance of high intellectual functioning and overall school competence.

In an interview with CNN, [[Edward Castronova]], a professor of Telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington said he was not surprised by the outcome of the Australian study but also discussed the issue of causal connection. &quot;Though there is a link between gaming and higher math and science scores, it doesn't mean playing games caused the higher scores. It could just be that kids who are sharp are looking for a challenge, and they don't find it on social media, and maybe they do find it on board games and video games,&quot; he explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/health/video-games-teens/ |title=Teen gamers do better at math than social media stars, study says |last=Scutti |first=Susan |date=8 August 2016 |website=CNN Health |access-date=9 August 2016 |quote=Video games' bad reputation may be unfair. Teens who were regular gamers scored higher than average in math, reading and science on an international exam, a new study found. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813030944/http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/health/video-games-teens/ |archivedate=13 August 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games have also been proven to raise self-esteem and build confidence. It gives people an opportunity to do things that they cannot do offline, and to discover new things about themselves. There is a social aspect to gaming as well – research has shown that a third of video game players make good friends online. As well as that, video games are also considered to be therapeutic as it helps to relieve stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Mark|year=2010|title=Online video gaming: what should education psychologists know?|journal=Education Psychology in Practice|volume=26|issue=1|pages=35–40|doi=10.1080/02667360903522769}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although short term, studies have shown that children with [[Specific developmental disorder|developmental delays]] gain a temporary physical improvement in health when they interact and play video games on a regular, and consistent basis due to the cognitive benefits and the use of hand eye coordination.&lt;ref&gt;Hsieh R, Lee W and Lin J, 'The Impact of Short-Term Video Games on Performance Among Children With Developmental Delays: A Randomized Controlled Trial' (2016) 11 PLOS ONE&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-determination theory====
[[Self-determination theory]] (SDT) is a macro theory of human motivation based around competence, autonomy, and relatedness to facilitate positive outcomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; SDT provides a framework for understanding the effects of playing video games; well-being, problem solving, group relations, physical activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nebel|first=Steve|last2=Schneider|first2=Sascha|last3=Schledjewski|first3=Janine|last4=Rey|first4=Günter Daniel|title=Goal-Setting in Educational Video Games|journal=Simulation &amp; Gaming|volume=48|issue=1|pages=98–130|doi=10.1177/1046878116680869|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adachi|first=Paul J.C.|last2=Willoughby|first2=Teena|date=1 September 2017|title=The Link Between Playing Video Games and Positive Youth Outcomes|journal=Child Development Perspectives|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=202–206|doi=10.1111/cdep.12232|issn=1750-8606}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors can be measured to determine the effect video games can have on people.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.learning-theories.com/self-determination-theory-deci-and-ryan.html|title=Self-Determination Theory (Deci and Ryan)|date=16 July 2014|work=Learning Theories|access-date=11 April 2018|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124005311/https://www.learning-theories.com/self-determination-theory-deci-and-ryan.html|archivedate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Well-being====
The ability to create an ideal image of one's self and being given multiple options to change that image gives a sense of satisfaction. This topic has much controversy; it is unknown whether this freedom can be beneficial to one's character or detrimental. With increased game usage, a player can become too invested in a fictionally generated character, where the desire to look that way overpowers the enjoyment of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2013/11/the-psychology-of-video-game-avatars/|title=The Psychology of Video Game Avatars|date=29 November 2013|work=The Psychology of Video Games|access-date=11 April 2018|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419053514/http://www.psychologyofgames.com/2013/11/the-psychology-of-video-game-avatars/|archivedate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players see this character creation as entertainment and a release, creating a self-image they could not obtain in reality, bringing comfort outside of the game from lack of investment to the fictional character. Problems that arise based on character design may be link to [[personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mihara|first=Satoko|last2=Higuchi|first2=Susumu|title=Cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiological studies of Internet gaming disorder: A systematic review of the literature|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=71|issue=7|pages=425–444|doi=10.1111/pcn.12532|pmid=28436212|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stockdale|first=Laura|last2=Coyne|first2=Sarah M.|date=1 January 2018|title=Video game addiction in emerging adulthood: Cross-sectional evidence of pathology in video game addicts as compared to matched healthy controls|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|language=English|volume=225|pages=265–272|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2017.08.045|pmid=28841491|issn=0165-0327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problem-solving skills====
[[Cognitive skill]]s can be enhanced through repetition of [[Puzzle video game|puzzles]], memory games, spatial abilities and attention control.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Heesung|last2=Ke|first2=Fengfeng|title=Effects of game-based learning in an OpenSim-supported virtual environment on mathematical performance|journal=Interactive Learning Environments|volume=25|issue=4|pages=543–557|doi=10.1080/10494820.2016.1167744|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most video games present opportunities to use these skills with the ability to try multiple times even after failure. Many of these skills can be translated to reality and problem solving. This allows the player to learn from mistakes and fully understand how and why a solution to a problem may work. Some researchers believe that continual exposure to challenges may lead players to develop greater persistence over time after a study was shown that frequent players spent more time on puzzles in task that did not involve video games.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Although players were shown to spend more time on puzzles, much of that could have been due to the positive effects of problem solving in games, which involve forming strategy and weighing option before testing a solution.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Representatives of Game Academy claim that such games as Civilization, Total War, or X-Com, where strategy and resource management are key, help players to develop skills that are of great use to managers. Also, they found out that IT workers play unusual puzzle games like Portal or tower defense games like Defense Grid more often than specialists from other fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49317440|title=How playing video games could get you a better job|date=30 August 2019|website=BBC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study that followed students through school, students that played video games showed higher levels of problem solving than students who did not.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; This contradicts the previous study in that higher success rate was seen in video game players. Time being a factor for problem solving led to different conclusions in the different studies. See [[video game controversies]] for more.

====Group relations====
[[Online game|Online gaming]] being on the rise allows for video game players to communicate and work together in order to accomplish a certain task. Being able to work as a group in a game translates well to reality and jobs, where people must work together to accomplish a task. Research on players in violent and non-violent games show similar results, where the players' relations improved to improve synergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

====Physical activities====
With the introduction of [[Wii Fit]] and [[Virtual reality|VR]] (virtual reality), ''[[Exergaming|exergame]]'' popularity has been increasing, allowing video game players to experience more active rather than sedentary game play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fogel VA, Miltenberger RG, Graves R, Koehler S | title = The effects of exergaming on physical activity among inactive children in a physical education classroom | journal = Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 591–600 | date = 2010 | pmid = 21541146 | pmc = 2998252 | doi = 10.1901/jaba.2010.43-591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile apps have tried to expand this concept with the introduction of ''[[Pokémon Go]],'' which involves walking to progress in the game. Due to ''exergaming'' being relatively new, there is still much to be researched. No major differences were seen in tests with children that played on the Wii vs. a non-active game after 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanders GJ, Rebold M, Peacock CA, Williamson ML, Santo AS, Barkley JE | title = The Physiologic and Behavioral Implications of Playing Active and Sedentary Video Games in a Seated and Standing Position | journal = International Journal of Exercise Science | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 194–201 | date = 1 July 2014 | pmid = 27182403 | pmc = 4831859 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing a larger range of ages may show better results.

Cognitive remediation therapies using tailored video games to improve cognitive deficits, which are associated with poorer outcomes, have a well established efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suenderhauf2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suenderhauf |first1=C |last2=Walter |first2=A |last3=Lenz |first3=C |last4=Lang |first4=UE |last5=Borgwardt |first5=S |title=Counter striking psychosis: Commercial video games as potential treatment in schizophrenia?

==Ratings and censorship==
{{Main|Video game content rating system}}

Video game laws vary from country to country. Console manufacturers usually exercise tight control over the games that are published on their systems, so unusual or special-interest games are more likely to appear as [[PC games]]. Free, casual, and [[browser-based game]]s are usually played on available computers, mobile phones, tablet computers or [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]].

Various organisations in different regions are responsible for giving [[content rating]]s to video games.

===United States===
[[File:ESRBrating.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A typical ESRB rating label, listing the rating and specific content descriptors for ''[[Rabbids Go Home]]'']]
The [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) gives video games maturity ratings based on their content. For example, a game might be rated &quot;T&quot; for &quot;Teen&quot; if the game contained obscene words or violence. If a game contains explicit violence or sexual themes, it is likely to receive an ''M'' for &quot;Mature&quot; rating, which means that no one under 17 should play it. The rating &quot;A/O&quot;, for &quot;Adults Only&quot;, indicates games with massive violence or nudity. There are no laws that prohibit children from purchasing &quot;M&quot; rated games in the United States.  Laws attempting to prohibit minors from purchasing &quot;M&quot; rated games were established in California, [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Louisiana]], but all were overturned on the grounds that these laws violated the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=&quot;legal results&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McCauley|first=Dennis|title=The Political Game: A Brief History of Video Game Legislation|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/18/the-political-game-a-brief-history-of-video-game-legislation/|work=joystiq.com|publisher=joystiq.com|accessdate=20 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224031138/http://www.joystiq.com/2006/08/18/the-political-game-a-brief-history-of-video-game-legislation|archivedate=24 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many stores have opted to not sell such games to children anyway.  One of the most controversial games of all time, ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' by Rockstar Studios, was given an [[Entertainment Software Rating Board#Restricted ratings|AO rating]] by the ESRB until Rockstar could make the content more suitable for a mature audience.

===Europe===
[[File:PEGI Profanity.svg|thumb|100px|right|PEGI's content descriptor for &quot;Profanity&quot;]]
[[Pan European Game Information]] (PEGI) is a system that was developed to standardize the game ratings in all of Europe (not just [[European Union]], although the majority are EU members), the current members are: all EU members, except Germany and the 10 accession states; [[Norway]]; [[Switzerland]]. Iceland is expected to join soon, as are the 10 EU accession states. For all PEGI members, they use it as their sole system, with the exception of the UK, where if a game contains certain material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification: Guidelines: Introduction|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/guidelines/introduction/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525065730/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/classification/guidelines/introduction/|archivedate=25 May 2011|publisher=British Board of Film Classification|accessdate=23 November 2011|quote=The BBFC classifies video works which are released as video recordings under the Video Recordings Act 1984. (The video games covered by the VRA are those whose exemption is forfeited under section 2(2) because they depict human sexual activity, gross violence or other matters of concern.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; it must be rated by [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]. The PEGI ratings are legally binding in [[Vienna]] and it is a criminal offence to sell a game to someone if it is rated above their age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pan European Game Information|url=http://bupp.at/chancen-amp-risiken/jugendschutz/pegi/|publisher=Bundesstelle für die Positivprädikatisierung von Computer- und Konsolenspielen|accessdate=23 November 2011|language=German|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917183141/http://bupp.at/chancen-amp-risiken/jugendschutz/pegi/ |archivedate=17 September 2013|quote=Eine Kennzeichung mit der PEGI-Altersempfehlung ist in Wien seit April 2008 verpflichtend: Es dürfen nur Spiele verkauft werden, die eine PEGI-Kennzeichnung tragen. Und es dürfen die Spiele nur an Jugendliche verkauft werden, wenn diese zumindest das Alter gemäß PEGI-Kennzeichung erreicht haben. Bis Ende 2009 gilt in der Übergangsfrist alternativ auch die Kennzeichnung der USK.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany: BPjM and USK====
Stricter game rating laws mean that Germany does not operate within the PEGI. Instead, they adopt their own system of certification which is required by law. The [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) checks every game before release and assigns an age rating to it – either none (white), 6 years of age (yellow), 12 years of age (green), 16 years of age (blue) or 18 years of age (red). It is forbidden for anyone, retailers, friends or parents alike, to allow a child access to a game for which he or she is underage. If a game is considered to be harmful to young people (for example because of extremely violent, pornographic or racist content), it may be referred to the [[Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien]] (BPjM) who may opt to place it on the Index upon which the game may not be sold openly or advertised in the open media. It is considered a felony to supply these games to a child.

===Japan===
[[File:CERO C.svg|thumb|100px|right| &quot;C&quot; label for ages 15 and up]]
The [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization]] (CERO) that rates video games and [[personal computer game|PC games]] (except [[dating sim]]s, [[visual novel]]s, and [[eroge]]) in [[Japan]] with levels of rating that informs the customer of the nature of the product and for what age group it is suitable. It was established in July 2002 as a branch of [[Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association]], and became an officially recognized [[non-profit organization]] in 2003. These ratings are:
* '''A''' – All ages
* '''B''' – Ages 12 and over
* '''C''' – Ages 15 and over
* '''D''' – Ages 17 and over
* '''Z''' – Ages 18 and over

In the United States, also according to SuperData, the share of video games in the entertainment market grew from 5% in 1985 to 13% in 2015, becoming the third-largest market segment behind broadcast and cable television. The research firm anticipated that Asia would soon overtake North America as the largest video game market due to the strong growth of free-to-play and mobile games.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuperData 2015&quot; /&gt;

Sales of different types of games vary widely between countries due to local preferences. Japanese consumers tend to purchase much more [[handheld game]]s than [[console game]]s and especially [[PC game]]s, with a strong preference for games catering to local tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ashcraft |first1=Brian |title=Why PC Gaming Is Still Niche in Japan |url=https://kotaku.com/5977001/why-pc-gaming-is-still-niche-in-japan |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=23 June 2018 |date=18 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623222027/https://kotaku.com/5977001/why-pc-gaming-is-still-niche-in-japan |archive-date=23 June 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Byford |first1=Sam |title=Japan used to rule video games, so what happened? |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/20/5522320/final-fight-can-japans-gaming-industry-be-saved |website=[[The Verge]] |accessdate=23 June 2018 |date=20 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623222003/https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/20/5522320/final-fight-can-japans-gaming-industry-be-saved |archive-date=23 June 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another key difference is that, despite the [[Golden age of video arcade games|decline of arcades in the West]], [[arcade game]]s remain an important sector of the [[Video gaming in Japan|Japanese gaming industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Lewis | first=Leo | date=9 February 2017 | title=Game on: why Japan's arcades are still winning | work=[[Financial Times]] | url=https://www.ft.com/japanarcades | access-date=26 December 2017 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227122301/https://www.ft.com/japanarcades | archivedate=27 December 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Video gaming in South Korea|In South Korea]], computer games are generally preferred over console games, especially [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] games and [[real-time strategy]] games.

===Esports===
{{Main|Esports}}
Short for electronic sports, are video game competitions played most by professional players individually or in teams that gained popularity from the late 2000s, the most common genres are [[fighting game|fighting]], [[first-person shooter]] (FPS), [[multiplayer online battle arena]] (MOBA) and [[real-time strategy]]. There are certain games that are made for just competitive multiplayer purposes. With those type of games, players focus entirely on choosing the right character or obtaining the right equipment in the game to help them when facing other players. Tournaments are held so that people in the area or from different regions can play against other players of the same game and see who is the best. [[Major League Gaming]] (MLG) is a company that reports tournaments that are held across the country. The players that compete in these tournaments are given a rank depending on their skill level in the game that they choose to play in and face other players that play that game. The players that also compete are mostly called professional players for the fact that they have played the game they are competing in for many, long hours. Those players have been able to come up with different strategies for facing different characters. The professional players are able to pick a character to their liking and be able to master how to use that character very effectively. With [[Strategy games (computer games)|strategy games]], players tend to know how to get resources quick and are able to make quick decisions about where their troops are to be deployed and what kind of troops to create.

===Copyright of video games===
{{Main|Copyright and video games}}
Creators will nearly always copyright their games. Laws that define copyright, and the rights that are conveyed over a video game vary from country to country. Usually a [[fair use]] copyright clause allows consumers some ancillary rights, such as for a player of the game to stream a game online. This is a vague area in copyright law, as these laws predate the advent of video games. This means that rightsholders often must define what they will allow a consumer to do with the video game.
