'''William McGuire &quot;Bill&quot; Bryson''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|HonFRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|aɪ|s|ən}}; born 8 December 1951) is an American-British author of books on travel, the English language, science, and other non-fiction topics. Born in the United States, he has been a resident of Britain for most of his adult life, returning to the United States between 1995 and 2003, and holds dual American and British citizenship. He served as the chancellor of [[Durham University]] from 2005 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dur.ac.uk/bill.bryson/|title=Bill Bryson|publisher=Durham University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{IMDb name| 0117445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Guardian topic|books/data/author/bill-bryson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{NYTtopic|people/b/bill_bryson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryson came to prominence in the United Kingdom with the publication of ''[[Notes from a Small Island]]'' (1995), an exploration of Britain, and its accompanying television series. He received widespread recognition again with the publication of ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]'' (2003), a book widely acclaimed for its accessible communication of science.

== Early life ==
Bryson was born and raised in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], the son of [[Bill Bryson Sr.]], a sports journalist who worked for fifty years at the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', and Agnes Mary (née McGuire), the home furnishings editor at the same newspaper.&lt;ref name= Richert&gt;{{cite book| title= Bill Bryson| first= Scott P.| last= Richert| publisher= Marshall Cavendish | year= 2011| page= 6| isbn= 9780761441205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= roots&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.amestrib.com/article/20131028/News/310289852| title= Writer Bill Bryson remembers his Iowa roots| work= [[Ames Tribune]] | date= October 28, 2013| publisher= Gannett Co.| access-date= January 31, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of Irish descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Bryson| first= Bill| title= The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid| page= 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an older brother, [[Michael Bryson|Michael]] (1942–2012), and a sister, Mary Jane Elizabeth. In 2006, Bryson published ''[[The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid]]'', a humorous account of his childhood years in Des Moines.&lt;ref name= roots /&gt;

Bryson attended [[Drake University]] for two years before dropping out in 1972, deciding instead to backpack around Europe for four months. He returned to Europe the following year with a high school friend, Matt Angerer (the pseudonymous Stephen Katz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/09/01/bill-brysons-stephen-katz/71494350/ |title=The real life of Bill Bryson's 'Stephen Katz'| first= Mike |last= Kilen| work= [[The Des Moines Register]]; [[USA Today]]| date= September 1, 2015| accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryson wrote about some of his experiences from this trip in his book ''[[Neither Here nor There: Travels in Europe]]''.

==Move to the United Kingdom==
[[File:BillBryson02.JPG|thumb|Bryson speaking in New York, 2013]]
Bryson first visited Britain in 1973&lt;ref name= utopia /&gt; during his tour of Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/14/bill-bryson-books-interview-follow-up-notes-from-a-small-island|title=Bill Bryson: 'When I came here the UK was poorer but much better looked after'|first=Nicholas|last=Wroe|date=14 March 2015|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and decided to stay after landing a job working in a psychiatric hospital&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephenson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Stephenson |first=Hannah |date=24 October 2015 |title=Bill Bryson: 'I'm American, but I cheer for England now in the World Cup until they get kicked out' |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/books/bill-bryson-im-american-but-i-cheer-for-england-now-in-the-world-cup-until-they-get-kicked-out-34136384.html |newspaper=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |access-date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the now-defunct [[Holloway Sanatorium]] in [[Virginia Water]], Surrey. He met a nurse there named Cynthia Billen, whom he married in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephenson&quot;/&gt; They moved to Bryson's hometown of Des Moines, Iowa, in 1975 so that Bryson could complete his college degree at Drake University.&lt;ref name= roots /&gt; In 1977 they settled in Britain.&lt;ref name= DesMoinesRegister2014&gt;{{cite news| title=Famous Iowans: Bill Bryson |first=Tom| last=Longden| work=Des Moines Register | url= http://data.desmoinesregister.com/famous-iowans/bill-bryson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked as a journalist, firstly for the ''[[Bournemouth Daily Echo|Bournemouth Evening Echo]]'', eventually becoming chief copy editor of the business section of ''[[The Times]]'' and deputy national news editor of the business section of ''[[The Independent]]''.

He has moved around the UK and lived in Virginia Water (Surrey), Purewell (Dorset), [[Burton, Dorset|Burton]] (Dorset), [[Kirkby Malham]] (North Yorkshire, in the 1980s and '90s), and the Old Rectory in [[Wramplingham]], Norfolk (2003–2013).&lt;ref name= Dribbling&gt;{{cite book| last= Bryson| first= Bill| year= 2016| title= The Road to Little Dribbling| place= London| publisher= Black Swan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in rural [[Hampshire]] and maintains a small flat in South Kensington, London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephenson&quot;/&gt; From 1995 to 2003 he lived in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first= Bill| last= Bryson| url= https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/bryson-stranger.html |title=I'm a Stranger Here Myself| website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although able to apply for [[British nationality law|British citizenship]], Bryson said in 2010 that he had declined a citizenship test, declaring himself &quot;too cowardly&quot; to take it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/29/bill-bryson-england-citizenship-test | location=London | work=The Guardian | first= Patrick | last=Barkham | title=Bill Bryson: I'll cheer for England, but I won't risk citizenship test | date=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, he said that he was preparing to take it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Bill| last= Bryson| url= http://www.nursinginpractice.com/article/interview-bill-bryson|title=Interview: Bill Bryson| interviewer= Jenny Chou| date= July 3, 2014 | publisher= Cogora Ltd |website= nursinginpractice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the prologue to his 2015 book ''[[The Road to Little Dribbling: More Notes From a Small Island]]''  he describes doing so, in Eastleigh. His citizenship ceremony took place in Winchester and he now holds dual citizenship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephenson&quot;/&gt;

==Writings==
While living in the US in the 1990s Bryson wrote a [[column (periodical)|column]] for a British newspaper for several years, reflecting on humorous aspects of his repatriation in the United States. These columns were selected and adapted to become his book ''[[Notes from a Big Country|I'm a Stranger Here Myself]]'', alternatively titled ''Notes from a Big Country'' in Britain, Canada, and Australia. During his time in the United States, Bryson decided to walk the [[Appalachian Trail]] with his friend Stephen Katz (a pseudonym), about which he wrote the book ''[[A Walk in the Woods (book)|A Walk in the Woods]]''. In the 2015 film adaptation of ''[[A Walk in the Woods (film)|A Walk in the Woods]]'', Bryson is portrayed by [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner [[Robert Redford]] and Katz is portrayed by [[Nick Nolte]] (Bryson is portrayed as being much older than he was at the time of his actual walk).&lt;ref name=NYT1999&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/books/notes-from-a-huge-landmass.html |title=Notes from a huge landmass|first=Elizabeth |last=Gleick|newspaper=The New York Times |date=30 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, in conjunction with [[World Book Day]], British voters chose Bryson's book ''[[Notes from a Small Island]]'' as that which best sums up British identity and the state of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Bryson tops 'England' poll |date=6 March 2003| publisher = [[BBC News]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2824715.stm| accessdate = 5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he was appointed a Commissioner for [[English Heritage]].

His [[popular science]] book, ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]'' is 500 pages long and explores not only the histories and current statuses of the sciences, but also reveals their humble and often humorous beginnings. Although one &quot;top scientist&quot; is alleged to have jokingly described the book as &quot;annoyingly free of mistakes&quot;,&lt;ref name=chancellor&gt;{{Cite news| title = Bill Bryson: The accidental chancellor| newspaper = The Guardian| date = 15 November 2005| url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/profile/story/0,11109,1642405,00.html| location = London| first = John| last = Crace| accessdate = 26 April 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080210010336/http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/profile/story/0%2C11109%2C1642405%2C00.html| archivedate = 10 February 2008| url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryson himself makes no such claim and a list of some reported errors in the book is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://errata.wikidot.com/0767908171|title= Errata and corrigenda: 'A Short History of Nearly Everything' by Bill Bryson| website= errata.wikidot.com| date= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Bryson interviewed the then British prime minister, [[Tony Blair]], on the state of science and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://number10.gov.uk/output/Page10500.asp| title = PM in conversation with Bill Bryson| accessdate = 10 April 2009| date = 29 November 2006| publication-date = 30 November 2006| website = number10.gov.uk| publisher= UK Prime Minister's Office| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071027173204/http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page10500.asp| archivedate = 27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryson has also written two popular works on the history of the English language—''[[The Mother Tongue]]'' and ''[[Made in America (book)|Made in America]]''—and, more recently, an update of his guide to usage, ''[[Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words]]'' (published in its first edition as ''The Penguin Dictionary of Troublesome Words'' in 1983).

== Litigation ==
In 2012 Bryson sued his agent, Jed Mattes Inc., in New York County Supreme Court, claiming it had &quot;failed to perform some of the most fundamental duties of an agent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/12/04/52794.htm |title=Author Bill Bryson Takes Agent to Court |date= 2012-12-04 |website=Courthouse News Service |location=Pasadena, California |url-status= unfit| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130216073840/http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/12/04/52794.htm| archivedate= 2013-02-16 |access-date= 2020-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled out of court, with part of the settlement being that Bryson may not discuss it.&lt;ref name= Dribbling /&gt;

In 2013 Bryson claimed [[copyright]] on an interview he had given nearly 20 years previously, after the interviewer republished it as an 8000-word e-book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Techdirt-2013-10-21&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Author Claims Copyright Over Interview He Gave 20 Years Ago |author=Mike Masnick |website=[[Techdirt]] |date=21 October 2013 |access-date=31 January 2020 |url= https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131019/03042524937/author-claims-copyright-over-interview-he-gave-20-years-ago.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMHerald-2013-10-18&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Bill Bryson's copyright stoush with Mike Gerrard has wider implications |last=Galvin |first=Nick |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=18 October 2013 |access-date=31 January 2020 |url= https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/bill-brysons-copyright-stoush-with-mike-gerrard-has-wider-implications-20131018-2vs4n.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon removed the e-book from publication, but the claim was controversial as interviews are generally considered to be the [[creative work]] of the interviewer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Techdirt-2013-10-21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMHerald-2013-10-18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards, positions and honours==
[[File:Bill Bryson Chancellor crop.JPG|thumb|upright|Bryson in the regalia of Chancellor of Durham University, with [[Durham Cathedral]] in the background]]

In 2005 Bryson was appointed [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of [[Durham University]],&lt;ref name=chancellor/&gt; succeeding the late Sir [[Peter Ustinov]], and became more active with student activities than is common for holders of that post, even appearing in a Durham student film and promoting litter picks in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Bill Bryson Litter Pick| date= 1 March 2008| work = [[durham21]]| url = http://www.durham21.co.uk/2008/03/bill-bryson-litter-pick| accessdate = 17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had praised Durham as &quot;a perfect little city&quot; in ''Notes from a Small Island''. In October 2010, it was announced that Bryson would step down at the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Bill Bryson stepping down as Chancellor| date=20 September 2010| publisher = [[Durham University]]| url = http://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=10922&amp;rehref=%2Fnews%2Farchive%2F&amp;resubj=%20Headlines| accessdate = 4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, he became the president of the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Bryson to head litterbug campaign | date=2 May 2007 | publisher = [[BBC News]]| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6614295.stm| accessdate = 5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpre.org.uk/news/view/382|title= Contact Us |publisher= Campaign to Protect Rural England| website= cpre.org.uk| date= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first area of focus in this role was the establishment of an anti-littering campaign across England. He discussed the future of the countryside with [[Richard Mabey]], [[Sue Clifford]], [[Nicholas Crane]] and [[Richard Girling]] at CPRE's Volunteer Conference in November 2007.&lt;ref name= NYT1999 /&gt;

Bryson has received numerous awards for his ability to communicate science with passion and enthusiasm. In 2004, he won the prestigious [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books|Aventis Prize]] for best general science book that year, with ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]''.&lt;ref name=descartes&gt;{{Cite news| first = Michelle | last = Pauli| title = Bryson wins Descartes prize for his guide to science| newspaper = The Guardian| date = 7 December 2005| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/07/scienceprizes.billbryson | location=London| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the book won the EU [[Descartes Prize]] for science communication.&lt;ref name=descartes/&gt; In 2005 he received the President's Award from the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] for advancing the cause of the chemical sciences. In 2007, he won the Bradford Washburn Award from the Museum of Science in Boston, MA for contributions to the popularization of science. In 2012, he received the Kenneth B. Myer Award from the [[Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health|Florey Institute of Neuroscience]] in Melbourne, Australia.

With the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] the Bill Bryson prize for Science Communication was established in 2005.

He was awarded an honorary [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for his contribution to literature on 13 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bill Bryson made an honorary OBE |date=13 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6176363.stm |accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he was awarded the [[James Joyce Award]] by the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]] of [[University College Dublin]]. After he received British citizenship his OBE was made substantive.

In 2011 he won the Golden Eagle Award from the [[Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= owpg.org.uk| url= http://www.owpg.org.uk/2011/08/bill-bryson-wins-prestigious-golden-eagle-award/|title= Bill Bryson Wins Prestigious Golden Eagle Award |date=26 August 2011| publisher= Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild| access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the [[Durham University Library|Main Library]] the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th chancellor (2005–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Main Library is being renamed 'The Bill Bryson Library'!|date=25 September 2012|publisher=[[Durham University]] |url= https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/news/?itemno=15355|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Bryson Library renaming event, Tuesday 27 November 2012 |date=22 November 2012| publisher= Durham University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
