{{Paranormal}}
'''Inedia''' (Latin for '[[fasting]]') or '''breatharianism''' {{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|θ|ˈ|ɛər|i|ə|n|ɪ|z|əm}} is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming [[food]], and in some cases [[water]]. Breatharians claim that food (and sometimes water) is not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by ''[[prana]]'', the vital life force in [[Hinduism]]. According to [[Ayurveda]], [[sunlight]] is one of the main sources of prana, and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms ''breatharianism'' or ''inedia'' may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] in place of a usual [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].

Breatharianism is considered a deadly [[pseudoscience]] by scientists and medical professionals, and several adherents of these practices have died from starvation or dehydration.&lt;ref name=&quot;BDA2014&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; It is an established fact that humans require food and water ([[nutrient]]s) to survive.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Scientific assessment==
Documented studies on the physiological effects of food restriction clearly show that [[fasting]] for extended periods leads to [[starvation]], [[dehydration]], and eventual death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnstone|first=A. M.|date=2007|title=Fasting – the ultimate diet?|journal=Obesity Reviews|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=211–222|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2006.00266.x|pmid=17444963|issn=1467-789X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of food intake, the body normally burns its own reserves of [[glycogen]], body fat, and muscle. Breatharians claim that their bodies do not consume these reserves while fasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |title=Can humans survive on air alone? | publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc. |accessdate=30 July 2009 |first=Katie|last=Lambert|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226084504/http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/edible-innovations/breatharian1.htm |archivedate=26 February 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practitioners==

===Rosicrucianism===
The 1670 [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] text ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'' attributed the practice to the physician and occultist [[Paracelsus]] (1493–1541) who was described as having lived &quot;several years by taking only one half scrupule of Solar Quintessence&quot;. In this book, it is also stated that &quot;Paracelsus affirms that He has seen many of the Sages fast twenty years without eating anything whatsoever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=abbé de Nicolas-Pierre-Henri|first1=Villars|title=Comte de Gabalis|publisher=The Brothers|pages=63–64|edition=1914|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028957467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ram Bahadur Bomjon (&quot;Bakji&quot;)===
[[Ram Bahadur Bomjon]] is a young Nepalese Buddhist monk who lives as an ascetic in a remote area of Nepal.  Bomjon appears to go for long periods of time without ingesting either food or water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 20 March 2006 |title = Nepalese Buddha Boy 'reappears' |work = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paldendorje.com/en/ |title=paldendorje.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917203905/http://paldendorje.com/en/ |archivedate=17 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such period was chronicled in a 2006 Discovery Channel documentary titled ''The Boy With Divine Powers'', which reported that Bomjon neither moved, ate, nor drank anything during 96 hours of filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/TheBoyWithDivinePowers | title=The Boy With Divine Powers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prahlad Jani (&quot;Mataji&quot;)===
[[Prahlad Jani]] is an Indian [[sadhu]] who says he has lived without food and water for more than 70 years. His claims were investigated by doctors at Sterling Hospital, [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]] in 2003 and 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dasgupta-Hindu&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article425184.ece |title = The Hindu – DIPAS concludes observational study on 'Mataji' |accessdate =15 June 2010 |author = Manas Dasgupta | date= 9 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231214130/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article425184.ece |archivedate=31 December 2015 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that Prahlad Jani was able to survive under observation for two weeks without either food or water, and had passed no [[urine]] or [[feces|stool]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Khanna-bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3236118.stm |title = Fasting fakir flummoxes physicians |accessdate =7 June 2008 |author = Rajeev Khanna | date=25 November 2003 |work=BBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328154126/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3236118.stm |archivedate=28 March 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; with no need for [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/man-eat-drink/story?id=10787036 |title=Scientists Baffled by Prahlad Jani, Man Who Doesn't Eat or Drink |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173223/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/International/man-eat-drink/story?id=10787036 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with the researchers speak of strict observation and relate that round-the-clock observation was ensured by multiple [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras. Jani was subjected to multiple medical tests,&lt;ref name=DNAIndia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_experts-baffled-as-mataji-s-medical-reports-are-normal_1380169 |title=Experts baffled as Mataji's medical reports are normal |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128132105/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_experts-baffled-as-mataji-s-medical-reports-are-normal_1380169 |archivedate=28 January 2013 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his only contact with any form of fluid was said to be during bathing and gargling, with the fluid spat out measured by the doctors.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail&quot;/&gt; The research team could not comment on his claim of having been able to survive in this way for decades.

The case has attracted criticism, both after the 2003 tests and the 2010 tests. [[Sanal Edamaruku]], president of the [[Indian Rationalist Association]], criticized the 2010 experiment for allowing Jani to move out of a certain CCTV camera's field of view, meet devotees, and leave the sealed test room to sunbathe. Edamaruku stated that the regular gargling and bathing activities were not sufficiently monitored, and accused Jani of having had some &quot;influential protectors&quot; who denied Edamaruku permission to inspect the project during its operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rationalistinternational1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Edamaruku |first=Sanal |url=http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |title=Prahlad Jani and his powerful protectors |publisher=Rationalistinternational.net |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165946/http://www.rationalistinternational.net/article/2010/20100518/en_1.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jasmuheen===
[[Jasmuheen]] (born Ellen Greve) was a prominent advocate of breatharianism in the 1990s. She said &quot;I can go for months and months without having anything at all other than a cup of tea. My body runs on a different kind of nourishment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vegetarian Myth: Food, Justice, and Sustainability|author=Keith, L.|isbn=9781604861822|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=\_KGWcPH41qYC|year=2009|publisher=PM Press}}{{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewers found her house stocked with food; Jasmuheen claimed the food was for her husband and daughter. In 1999, she volunteered to be monitored closely by the [[Australia]]n television program ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' for one week without eating, to demonstrate her methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp|title=Living on air: Breatharian put to the test|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102085047/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/60/stories/1999_10_24/story_57.asp |archivedate=2 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |title = Jasmuheen |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001044/http://www.ratbags.com/rsoles/comment/jasmuheen.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen stated that she found it difficult on the third day of the test because the hotel room in which she was confined was located near a busy road, causing [[stress (medicine)|stress]] and [[pollution]] that prevented absorption of required nutrients from the air. &quot;I asked for fresh air. Seventy percent of my nutrients come from fresh air. I couldn’t even breathe,&quot; she said. The third day, the test was moved to a mountainside retreat, where her condition continued to deteriorate. After Jasmuheen had fasted for four days, Berris Wink, president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, urged her to stop the test.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.caic.org.au/miscult/breatharians/Fresh-air%20dietician%20fails%20TV%20show%27s%20challenge.htm | title=Fresh-air dietician fails TV show's challenge | publisher=[[Yahoo News]] | date=25 October 1999 | accessdate =7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wink, Jasmuheen's pupils were dilated, her speech was slow, and she was &quot;quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%&quot;. Towards the end of the test, she said, &quot;Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risks if she goes any further are kidney failure. ''60 Minutes'' would be culpable if they encouraged her to continue. She should stop now.&quot; The test was stopped. Wink said, &quot;Unfortunately there are a few people who may believe what she says, and I'm sure it's only a few, but I think it's quite irresponsible for somebody to be trying to encourage others to do something that is so detrimental to their health.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoo 1999&quot;/&gt; Jasmuheen challenged the results of the program, saying, &quot;Look, 6,000 people have done this around the world without any problem.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergman2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergman|first=Gregory|title=Isms: From Autoeroticism to Zoroastrianism – an Irreverent Reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUVuSNM5QUQC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2006|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-4405-1788-6|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Harris | first = Gillian | date = 6 April 2000 | title = Starvation guru given hostile reception | journal = The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |title = Mysticism |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209101343/http://liberatapublishers.com/mysticism.htm |archivedate=9 February 2012 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, she said that she didn't understand the relevance as she was not referring to herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |title = Correx Archives&amp;nbsp;– Jasmuheen | work = Corex | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate =7 June 2008  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980423153006/http://www.abc.net.au/science/correx/archives/jasmuheen.htm |archivedate=23 April 1998 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documentary ''[[No Way to Heaven]]'', the Swiss chemist Michael Werner claims to have followed the directions appearing in Jasmuheen's books, living for several years without food. The documentary also describes two attempts at scientific verification of his claims.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} {{asof|2017}}, five deaths had been directly linked to breatharianism as a result of Jasmuheen's publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;3Deaths&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Tom | last = Walker |author2=Judith O'Reilly | title = Three deaths linked to 'living on air' cult | work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] | publisher = (London) | date = 26 September 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swiss woman starves to death on daylight diet |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/swiss-woman-starved-to-death-on-daylight-diet/story-e6frf7lf-1226339082591 |newspaper=[[Herald Sun]] |date=26 April 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012}} &quot;This was the fourth known death linked to breatharianism and Jasmuheen's books since the practice emerged in the early 90s.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;contactmuziek&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.contactmuziek.nl/lichtvoeding.html | title=Contact &amp; Muziek: Lichtvoeding | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612223030/http://www.contactmuziek.nl/lichtvoeding.html | archive-date=12 June 2017 | accessdate=13 June 2017 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NRC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/06/12/om-onderzoekt-sterfgeval-in-woongroep-die-voeding-afzweert-a1562695 | title=OM onderzoekt sterfgeval in woongroep die voeding afzweert | newspaper = NRC Handelsblad | location = Amsterdam | last = van der Veen | first = Casper | date=12 June 2017 | accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmuheen has denied any responsibility for the deaths.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

He was first introduced to the public in 1980 when he appeared on the TV show ''[[That's Incredible!]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeattleTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931005&amp;slug=1724507 | title = Living on Light, Air – 'Breatharian' Says Food Is Poison But Pops An Occasional Twinkie | newspaper = Seattle Times | last = Broom | first = Jack | date = 5 October 1993 | accessdate =12 February 2009  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181311/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19931005&amp;slug=1724507 |archivedate=3 March 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks stopped teaching recently{{when|date=October 2016}} to &quot;devote 100% of his time on solving the problem as to why he needed to eat some type of food to keep his [[physical body]] alive and allow his [[Subtle body|light body]] to manifest completely&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;altinate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breatharian.com/WileyBrooks-altinate.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211031744/http://www.breatharian.com/WileyBrooks-altinate.htm |archivedate=11 February 2006 |title=Wiley Brooks website through Internet Archive |date=11 February 2006 |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks claims to have found &quot;four major deterrents&quot; which prevented him from living without food: &quot;people pollution&quot;, &quot;food pollution&quot;, &quot;air pollution&quot;, and &quot;electro pollution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;altinate&quot;/&gt;

In 1983 he was reportedly observed leaving a [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] [[7-Eleven]] with a [[Slurpee]], a [[hot dog]], and [[Twinkie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=John Yewell |url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |title = A Year of Nüz|work=MetroActive News &amp; Issues  |accessdate =7 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001003042829/http://metroactive.com/papers/cruz/01.05.00/nuzjunkies-0001.html |archivedate=3 October 2000 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told ''[[Colors (magazine)|Colors]]'' magazine in 2003 that he periodically breaks his fasting with a [[cheeseburger]] and a [[cola]], explaining that when he's surrounded by junk culture and [[junk food]], consuming them adds balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |title=sonoma papers |publisher=Metroactive.com |accessdate=30 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030306103945/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/02.13.03/diets-0307.html |archivedate=6 March 2003 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wiley Brooks later claimed that [[Diet Coke]] and [[McDonald's]] cheeseburgers have special &quot;5D&quot; properties.  The idea of separate but interconnected 5D and 3D worlds is a major part of Wiley Brooks' ideology, and Wiley Brooks encourages his followers to only eat these special 5D foods, as well as to meditate on a set of magical 5D words.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140522195834/http://www.breatharian.com/5wordsqa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hira Ratan Manek===
Hira Ratan Manek (born 12 September 1937) claims that since 18 June 1995, he has lived on water and occasionally [[tea]], [[coffee]], and [[buttermilk]].

===Ray Maor===
In a television documentary produced by the Israeli television [[Investigative journalism|investigative show]] ''The Real Face'' (פנים אמיתיות), hosted by [[Amnon Levy]], [[Israel]]i practitioner of inedia Ray Maor (ריי מאור) appeared to survive without food or water for eight days and eight nights. According to the documentary, he was restricted to a small villa and placed under constant video surveillance, with medical supervision that included daily blood testing. The documentary claimed Maor was in good spirits throughout the experiment; that he lost 17&amp;nbsp;lb after eight days; that blood tests showed no change before, during or after the experiment; and that [[cardiologist]] Ilan Kitsis from [[Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center]] was &quot;baffled&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;panim.nana10.co.il&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;glz.co.il&quot;/&gt;

==Religious traditions==

===Catholicism===
{{see also|Anorexia mirabilis}}

Anorexia mirabilis, also known as holy anorexia or inedia prodigiosa or colloquially as fasting girls, was a common eating disorder, but not restricted to, the Middle Ages in Europe, largely affecting Catholic nuns and religious women. Indeed, documentation exists regarding about two-thirds of the holy women officially regarded by the Roman Catholic Church as saints, blesseds, venerables, or servants of God and who lived after 1200 [[AD]] showing that more than half of these displayed clear signs of [[anorexia]], with extensive and highly reliable documentation being available for about two dozen of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Rudolph M.|title=Holy Anorexia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQWMAwAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-16974-3|page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qQWMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=anorexia x]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
Hindu religious texts contain account of saints and hermits practicing what would be called inedia, breatharianism or Sustenance through Light in modern terms. In Valmiki's [[Ramayana]], Book III, Canto VI, an account of anchorites and holy men is given, who flocked around [[Rama]] when he came to [[Śarabhanga]]'s hermitage. These included, among others, the &quot;...saints who live on rays which moon and daystar give&quot; and &quot;those ... whose food the wave of air supplies&quot;. In Canto XI of the same book a hermit named [[Māṇḍakarṇi]] is mentioned: &quot;For he, great votarist, intent – On strictest rule his stern life spent – ... – Ten thousand years on air he fed...&quot;  (English quotations are from Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation).

[[Paramahansa Yogananda]]'s ''Autobiography of a Yogi'' details two alleged historical examples of breatharianism, Hari [[Giri Bala]] and [[Therese Neumann]].

There are claims that [[Devraha Baba]] lived without food.

===Taoism===
[[Bigu (grain avoidance)]] is a fasting technique with various different interpretations, from simply avoiding eating specific grains, to avoiding all grains, to eating no food at all, and drawing sustenance from gulps of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maspero |first1=Henri |translator-last1=Kierman Jr. |translator-first1=Frank A. |title=Taoism and Chinese Religion |url=https://archive.org/details/taoismchineserel00henr |url-access=registration |date=1981 |publisher=[[University of Massachusetts Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
