A '''Burns supper''' is a celebration of the life and poetry of the poet [[Robert Burns]] (25 January 1759{{spaced ndash}}21 July 1796), the author of many [[Scots language|Scots]] poems. The suppers are normally held on or near the poet's birthday, 25 January, occasionally  known as '''Robert Burns Day''' (or '''Rabbie Burns Day''') but more commonly known as '''Burns Night''' ({{lang-sco|Burns Nicht}}). However, in principle, celebrations may be held at any other time of the year.

==History==
The first supper was held ''in memoriam'' at [[Burns Cottage]] by Burns's friends, on 21 July 1801, the fifth anniversary of his death; it has been a regular occurrence ever since. The first still extant [[Burns Clubs|Burns Club]] was founded in [[Greenock]] in 1801 by merchants who were born in [[Ayrshire]], some of whom had known Burns. They held the first Burns supper on what they thought was his birthday, 29 January 1802, but in 1803, they discovered the [[Ayr]] parish records that noted his date of birth was actually 25 January 1759.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm |title=Congratulation Greenock Burns Club |publisher=The Robert Burns World Federation Limited |accessdate=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126011456/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/newsletter/0107/greenock_burns_club.htm |archivedate=26 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, suppers have been held on or about 25 January.

Burns suppers may be formal or informal. Both typically include [[haggis]] (a traditional Scottish dish celebrated by Burns in ''[[Wikisource:Address to a Haggis|Address to a Haggis]]''), [[Scotch whisky]] and the recitation of Burns's poetry. Formal dinners are hosted by organisations such as Burns clubs, the [[Freemason]]s or [[St. Andrew|St Andrews]] Societies; they occasionally end with dancing when ladies are present. Formal suppers follow a standard order.

== Standard order ==
===Piping in guests===
A piper generally greets the guests, who gather and mix as at any informal party.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; At less formal gatherings, traditional [[Scottish music]] is played.&lt;ref name=vs&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.visitscotland.com/about/famous-scots/robert-burns/burns-night/ |title= About: Celebrating Burns Night |publisher=[[VisitScotland]] |accessdate=25 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Host's welcoming speech ===
The [[Master of ceremonies|host]] says a few words welcoming everyone to the supper and perhaps stating the reason for it.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/robertburns/burns_night_running_order.shtml|title=BBC - Robert Burns - Burns Night - Running Order|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the guests are seated and [[Grace (prayer)|grace]] is said, usually using the ''[[:sco:The Selkirk Grace|Selkirk Grace]]'', a well-known thanksgiving said before meals that uses the [[Modern Scots|Scots]] language. Although attributed to Burns, the Selkirk Grace was already known in the 17th century as the &quot;[[Galloway]] Grace&quot; or the &quot;[[Covenanters]]' Grace&quot;. It came to be called the Selkirk Grace because Burns was said to have delivered it at a dinner given by the [[Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk|Earl of Selkirk]].

:Some hae meat an canna eat,
:And some wad eat that want it;
:But we hae meat, and we can eat,
:And sae the Lord be thankit.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

===Soup course===
The supper starts with the soup course.  Normally, a Scottish soup, such as [[Scotch broth]], potato soup, [[cullen skink]], or [[cock-a-leekie soup|cock-a-leekie]], is served.

===Haggis===
==== Piping in the haggis ====

[[Image:Bringing_in_the_haggis.jpg|thumb|right|Bringing in the [[haggis]]]]
Everyone stands as the [[haggis]] is brought in. It is usually brought in by the cook on a large dish, generally while a [[Great Highland Bagpipe|bagpiper]] leads the way to the host's table, where the haggis is laid down. &quot;[[A Man's A Man for A' That]]&quot;, &quot;Robbie Burns Medley&quot; or &quot;The Star O' Robbie Burns&quot; might be played.&lt;ref&gt;Archie Cairns â€“ Book 1 Pipe Music 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The host, or perhaps a guest, then recites the ''
[[Wikisource:Address to a Haggis|Address to a Haggis]]''.

[[File:Great chieftain o' the puddin-race.JPG|thumb|A haggis, cut open]]
At the line ''His knife see rustic Labour dicht'', the speaker normally draws and sharpens a knife. At the line ''An' cut you up wi' ready slicht'', he plunges it into the haggis and cuts it open from end to end.  When done properly, the &quot;ceremony&quot; is a highlight of the evening.

=== Main course ===
[[File:Haggis.JPG|thumb|Haggis platter at a Burns supper in the US]]
[[File:A haggis serving.JPG|thumb|Haggis served ''wi tatties an neeps'' (with potatoes and swede)]]
At the end of the poem, a whisky toast will be proposed to the haggis, and the company will sit down to the meal. The haggis is traditionally served with mashed potatoes (tatties) and mashed [[rutabaga|swede]] (neeps).&lt;ref name=vs/&gt;

===Other courses===
A dessert course, cheese courses, coffee, etc., may also be part of the meal. The courses normally use traditional Scottish recipes. For instance, dessert may be [[cranachan]] or tipsy laird (whisky trifle), followed by oatcakes and cheese, all washed down with the &quot;water of life&quot; (uisge beatha), [[Scotch whisky]].

===Toasts===
When the meal reaches the coffee stage, various speeches and toasts are given.

==== Immortal memory ====
The main speaker gives a speech remembering some aspect of Burns's life or poetry. It may be either light-hearted or serious and may include the recitation of a poem or a song by Burns. A toast to the Immortal Memory of Robert Burns then follows.&lt;ref name=vs/&gt;

====Address to the Lassies ====
This was originally a short speech given by a male guest in thanks to the women who had prepared the meal. However, it is now much more wide-ranging and generally covers the male speaker's view on women. It is normally amusing and not offensive, particularly since it will be followed by a reply from the &quot;lassies&quot; concerned. The men drink a toast to the women's health.

==== Reply to the Laddies ====
This is occasionally (and humorously) called the &quot;Toast to the Laddies&quot;. Like the previous toast, it is generally now quite wide-ranging. A female guest will give her views on men and reply to any specific points raised by the previous speaker. Like the previous speech, it should be amusing but not offensive. Quite often, the speakers giving this toast and the previous one will collaborate so that the two toasts complement each other.

=== Works by Burns ===
After the speeches there may be singing of songs by Burns (such as ''[[Ae Fond Kiss]]'', ''[[Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation|Parcel o' Rogues]]'' and ''[[A Man's a Man for A' That|A Man's a Man]]'') and more poetry (such as ''[[To a Mouse]]'', ''[[To a Louse]]'', ''[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]'', ''The Twa Dogs'' and ''Holy Willie's Prayer'').

That may be done by the individual guests or by invited experts, and it goes on for as long as the guests wish. It may include other works by poets influenced by Burns, particularly poets writing in Scots. Foreign guests may also be invited to sing or say works from their land.

=== Closing ===
Finally, the host will call on one of the guests to give the vote of thanks. Then, everyone is asked to stand, join hands, and sing '' [[Auld Lang Syne]]'' to bring the evening to an end.
