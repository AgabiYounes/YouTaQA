The '''zebrafish''' (''Danio rerio'') is a [[freshwater fish]] belonging to the minnow [[Family (biology)|family]] ([[Cyprinidae]]) of the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Cypriniformes]]. Native to [[South Asia]], it is a popular [[aquarium|aquarium fish]], frequently sold under the trade name '''zebra danio'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thefishdoctor.co.uk/breeding-zebrafish-zebra-danios/|title=Breeding Zebrafish (Zebra danios)}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and thus often called a &quot;[[tropical fish]]&quot; although both [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]]). 

The zebrafish is an important and widely used [[vertebrate]] [[model organism]] in scientific research, for example in [[drug development]], in particular [[pre-clinical development]].&lt;ref name=vanwijk2016/&gt; It is also notable for its [[regeneration (biology)|regenerative]] abilities,&lt;ref name=Regen2012/&gt; and has been [[genetically modified organism|modified]] by researchers to produce many [[transgenic]] strains.&lt;ref name=ChinaOest/&gt;&lt;ref name=zviv/&gt;&lt;ref name=ithinkz/&gt;

=== Habitat ===
Zebrafish typically inhabit moderately flowing to [[stagnant (water)|stagnant]] clear water of quite shallow depth in streams, canals, ditches, [[oxbow lake]]s, ponds and [[rice paddies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Engeszer2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arunachalam2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;beec&quot;/&gt; There is usually some vegetation, either submerged or overhanging from the banks, and the bottom is sandy, muddy or silty, often mixed with pebbles or gravel. In surveys of zebrafish locations throughout much of its Bangladeshi and Indian distribution, the water had a near-neutral to somewhat basic [[pH]] and mostly ranged from {{cvt|16.5 to(-) 34|C}} in temperature.&lt;ref name=Engeszer2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arunachalam2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spence2006a&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Spence, R. | author2=M.K.

The unusually cold temperature was at one of the highest known zebrafish locations at {{cvt|1576|m}} above sea level, although the species has been recorded to {{cvt|1795|m}}.&lt;ref name=Engeszer2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arunachalam2013/&gt;

== Description ==
The zebrafish is named for the five uniform, pigmented, horizontal, blue stripes on the side of the body, which are reminiscent of a [[zebra]]'s stripes, and which extend to the end of the [[caudal fin]]. Its shape is [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] and laterally compressed, with its mouth directed upwards. The male is [[torpedo]]-shaped, with gold stripes between the blue stripes; the female has a larger, whitish belly and silver stripes instead of gold. Adult females exhibit a small [[Fish anatomy#Reproductive system|genital papilla]] in front of the [[anal fin]] origin. The zebrafish can reach up to {{cvt|4-5|cm}} in length,&lt;ref name=SeriouslyFish/&gt; although they typically are {{cvt|1.8-3.7|cm|1}} in the wild with some variations depending on location.&lt;ref name=Arunachalam2013/&gt; Its lifespan in captivity is around two to three years, although in ideal conditions, this may be extended to over five years.&lt;ref name=beec/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerhard GS, Kauffman EJ, Wang X, Stewart R, Moore JL, Kasales CJ, Demidenko E, Cheng KC | title = Life spans and senescent phenotypes in two strains of Zebrafish (Danio rerio) | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 37 | issue = 8–9 | pages = 1055–68 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12213556 | doi = 10.1016/s0531-5565(02)00088-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wild it is typically an annual species.&lt;ref name = IUCN/&gt;

== Psychology ==
In 2015, a study was published about zebrafishes' capacity for [[episodic memory]]. The individuals showed a capacity to remember context with respect to objects, locations and occasions (what, when, where). Episodic memory is a capacity of explicit memory systems, typically associated with [[Consciousness|conscious experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Trevor J. |last2=Myggland |first2=Allison |last3=Duperreault |first3=Erika |last4=May |first4=Zacnicte |last5=Gallup |first5=Joshua |last6=Powell |first6=Russell A. |last7=Schalomon |first7=Melike |last8=Digweed |first8=Shannon M. |title=Episodic-like memory in zebrafish |journal=Animal Cognition |date=15 July 2016 |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=1071–1079 |doi=10.1007/s10071-016-1014-1 |pmid=27421709 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproduction ==
[[File:Zebrafish Developmental Stages.tiff|thumb|upright=1.2|Stages of zebrafish development. Photos to scale except adult, which is about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} long.]]

The approximate [[generation time]] for ''Danio rerio'' is three months. A male must be present for [[ovulation]] and [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] to occur. Females are able to spawn at intervals of two to three days, laying hundreds of eggs in each [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]]. Upon release, embryonic development begins; absent sperm, growth stops after the first few cell divisions. Fertilized eggs almost immediately become transparent, a characteristic that makes ''D. rerio'' a convenient research [[model species]].&lt;ref name=beec&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spence R, Gerlach G, Lawrence C, Smith C | title = The behaviour and ecology of the zebrafish, Danio rerio | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–34 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18093234 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00030.x | hdl = 2381/27758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zebrafish embryo develops rapidly, with precursors to all major organs appearing within 36 hours of fertilization.  The embryo begins as a yolk with a single enormous cell on top (see image, 0 h panel), which divides into two (0.75 h panel) and continues dividing until there are thousands of small cells (3.25 h panel).  The cells then migrate down the sides of the yolk (8 h panel) and begin forming a head and tail (16 h panel).  The tail then grows and separates from the body (24 h panel).  The yolk shrinks over time because the fish uses it for food as it matures during the first few days (72 h panel).  After a few months, the adult fish reaches reproductive maturity (bottom panel).

To encourage the fish to spawn, some researchers use a fish tank with a sliding bottom insert, which reduces the depth of the pool to simulate the shore of a river. Zebrafish spawn best in the morning due to their [[Circadian rhythms]]. Researchers have been able to collect 10,000 embryos in 10 minutes using this method.&lt;ref name=Spawning2012/&gt; Male zebrafish are furthermore known to respond to more pronounced markings on females, i.e., &quot;good stripes&quot;, but in a group, males will mate with whichever females they can find. What attracts females is not currently understood. The presence of plants, even plastic plants, also apparently encourages spawning.&lt;ref name=Spawning2012&gt;{{Cite news | last=Dockser |first=Amy | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203436904577154962232874998 |title=Birds Do It, Bees Do It, Even Zebrafish Do It—Just Too Little |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of [[diisononyl phthalate]] (DINP), commonly used in a large variety of [[plastic]] items, disrupt the [[endocannabinoid system]] and thereby affect reproduction in a gender specific manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forner-Piquer |first1=Isabel |last2=Santangeli |first2=Stefania |last3=Maradonna |first3=Francesca |last4=Rabbito |first4=Alessandro |last5=Piscitelli |first5=Fabiana |last6=Habibi |first6=Hamid R. |last7=Di Marzo |first7=Vincenzo |last8=Carnevali |first8=Oliana |title=Disruption of the gonadal endocannabinoid system in zebrafish exposed to diisononyl phthalate |journal=Environmental Pollution |date=October 2018 |volume=241 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2018.05.007 |pmid=29793103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feeding ==
Zebrafish are [[omnivorous]], primarily eating [[zooplankton]], [[phytoplankton]], insects and insect [[larva]]e, although they can eat a variety of other foods, such as worms and small [[crustacean]]s, if their preferred food sources are not readily available.&lt;ref name=beec/&gt;

In research, adult zebrafish are often fed with [[brine shrimp]], or [[paramecium|paramecia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Westerfield2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Monte |last=Westerfield | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Zebrafish Book: A Guide for the Laboratory Use of Zebrafish (Danio Rerio)|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Rud1mgEACAAJ}}|year=2007|publisher=University of Oregon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the aquarium==
Zebrafish are hardy fish and considered good for beginner aquarists. Their enduring popularity can be attributed to their playful disposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerhard GS, Cheng KC | title = A call to fins! Zebrafish as a gerontological model | journal = Aging Cell | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 104–11 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12882339 | doi = 10.1046/j.1474-9728.2002.00012.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as their rapid breeding, aesthetics, cheap price and broad availability. They also do well in schools or [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]] of six or more, and interact well with other fish species in the aquarium. However, they are susceptible to ''[[Oodinium]]'' or velvet disease, [[microsporidia]] (''Pseudoloma neurophilia''), and ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' species. Given the opportunity, adults eat hatchlings, which may be protected by separating the two groups with a net, breeding box or separate tank.
In captivity, zebrafish live approximately forty-two months. Some captive zebrafish can develop a curved spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zebrafish - Danio rerio - Details - Encyclopedia of Life|url=http://eol.org/pages/204011/details#life_expectancy|website=Encyclopedia of Life|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zebra danio was also used to make genetically modified fish and were the first species to be sold as [[GloFish]] (fluorescent colored fish).

==Strains==
In late 2003, [[transgenic]] zebrafish that express [[green fluorescent protein|green]], red, and [[yellow fluorescent protein]]s became commercially available in the United States. The fluorescent strains are tradenamed [[GloFish]]; other cultivated varieties include &quot;golden&quot;, &quot;sandy&quot;, &quot;longfin&quot; and &quot;leopard&quot;.

The leopard danio, previously known as ''Danio frankei'', is a spotted colour [[morph (zoology)|morph]] of the zebrafish which arose due to a pigment mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Watanabe M, Iwashita M, Ishii M, Kurachi Y, Kawakami A, Kondo S, Okada N | title = Spot pattern of leopard Danio is caused by mutation in the zebrafish connexin41.8 gene | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 893–7 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16845369 | pmc = 1559663 | doi = 10.1038/sj.embor.7400757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xanthochromism|Xanthistic]] forms of both the zebra and leopard pattern, along with long-finned subspecies, have been obtained via selective breeding programs for the aquarium trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mills |first=Dick | name-list-format = vanc |title=Eyewitness Handbook: Aquarium Fish |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-7322-5012-6 }}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various transgenic and mutant strains of zebrafish were stored at the [[China Zebrafish Resource Center]] (CZRC), a [[non-profit organization]], which was jointly supported by the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of China]] and the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

==Scientific research==
[[Image:Zfishchroma.jpg|thumb|upright|Zebrafish [[chromatophore]]s, shown here mediating [[camouflage|background adaptation]], are widely studied by scientists.]]
[[File:Zebrafish embryos.png|thumb|A zebrafish pigment mutant (bottom) produced by insertional [[mutagenesis]].&lt;ref name=Parichy2006/&gt; A wild-type embryo (top) is shown for comparison.

''D. rerio'' is a common and useful scientific [[model organism]] for studies of [[vertebrate]] development and [[gene]] function. Its use as a laboratory animal was pioneered by the American [[molecular biologist]] [[George Streisinger]] and his colleagues at the [[University of Oregon]] in the 1970s and 1980s; Streisinger's zebrafish [[List of animals that have been cloned|clones]] were among the earliest successful vertebrate clones created.&lt;ref name=StreiClone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neuro.uoregon.edu/k12/george_streisinger.html|title=In Memory of George Streisinger, &quot;Founding Father&quot; of Zebrafish Developmental and Genetic Research|publisher=[[University of Oregon]]|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its importance has been consolidated by successful large-scale forward [[genetic screen]]s (commonly referred to as the Tübingen/Boston screens). The fish has a dedicated online database of genetic, genomic, and developmental information, the [[Zebrafish Information Network]] (ZFIN).  The Zebrafish International Resource Center (ZIRC) is a genetic resource repository with 29,250 [[alleles]] available for distribution to the research community. ''D. rerio'' is also one of the few fish species [[Animals in space|to have been sent into space]].

===Model characteristics===
As a model biological system, the zebrafish possesses numerous advantages for scientists. Its [[genome]] has been [[whole genome sequencing|fully sequenced]], and it has well-understood, easily observable and testable developmental behaviors. Its [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] is very rapid, and its embryos are relatively large, robust, and transparent, and able to develop outside their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Zebrafish Exposed |first1=Ralf |last1=Dahm | name-list-format = vanc |journal=American Scientist |volume=94 |issue=5 |year=2006 |pages=446–53 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-zebrafish-exposed |doi=10.1511/2006.61.446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, well-characterized mutant strains are readily available.

Other advantages include the species' nearly constant size during early development, which enables simple [[staining]] techniques to be used, and the fact that its two-celled embryo can be fused into a single cell to create a [[homozygous]] embryo. The zebrafish is also demonstrably similar to mammalian models and humans in toxicity testing, and exhibits a diurnal sleep cycle with similarities to mammalian sleep behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones R | title = Let sleeping zebrafish lie: a new model for sleep studies | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e281 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 20076649 | pmc = 2020498 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, zebrafish are not a universally ideal research model; there are a number of disadvantages to their scientific use, such as the absence of a standard diet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Penglase S, Moren M, Hamre K | title = Lab animals: Standardize the diet for zebrafish model | journal = Nature | volume = 491 | issue = 7424 | pages = 333 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23151568 | doi = 10.1038/491333a | bibcode = 2012Natur.491..333P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the presence of small but important differences between zebrafish and mammals in the roles of some genes related to human disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jurynec MJ, Xia R, Mackrill JJ, Gunther D, Crawford T, Flanigan KM, Abramson JJ, Howard MT, Grunwald DJ | title = Selenoprotein N is required for ryanodine receptor calcium release channel activity in human and zebrafish muscle | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 34 | pages = 12485–90 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18713863 | pmc = 2527938 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0806015105 | bibcode = 2008PNAS..10512485J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rederstorff M, Castets P, Arbogast S, Lainé J, Vassilopoulos S, Beuvin M, Dubourg O, Vignaud A, Ferry A, Krol A, Allamand V, Guicheney P, Ferreiro A, Lescure A | title = Increased muscle stress-sensitivity induced by selenoprotein N inactivation in mouse: a mammalian model for SEPN1-related myopathy | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = e23094 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21858002 | pmc = 3152547 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0023094 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...623094R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used in modelling and theoretical studies because of its relatively simple geometry, such as a study about the role of [[VEGFC]] in [[lymphangiogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wertheim |first1=Kenneth Y. |last2=Roose |first2=Tiina |title=A Mathematical Model of Lymphangiogenesis in a Zebrafish Embryo |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |date=23 February 2017 |volume=79 |issue=4 |pages=693–737 |doi=10.1007/s11538-017-0248-7 |pmid=28233173 |pmc=5501200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zebrafish have also been found to regenerate [[photoreceptor cells]] and [[retina]]l neurons following injury, which has been shown to be mediated by the dedifferentiation and proliferation of [[Muller glia|Müller glia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernardos RL, Barthel LK, Meyers JR, Raymond PA | title = Late-stage neuronal progenitors in the retina are radial Müller glia that function as retinal stem cells | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 26 | pages = 7028–40 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17596452 | pmc = 6672216 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1624-07.2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers frequently [[amputate]] the dorsal and ventral tail fins and analyze their regrowth to test for mutations.

===Genetics===

====Gene expression====
Due to their fast and short life cycles and relatively large clutch sizes, D. ''rerio'' or zebrafish are a useful model for genetic studies. A common [[reverse genetics]] technique is to [[gene knockdown|reduce gene expression]] or modify [[Splicing (genetics)|splicing]] using [[Morpholino]] [[antisense]] technology. Morpholino [[oligonucleotide]]s (MO) are stable, synthetic [[macromolecule]]s that contain the same [[nucleoside|bases]] as DNA or RNA; by binding to complementary RNA sequences, they can reduce the [[gene expression|expression]] of specific genes or block other processes from occurring on RNA. MO can be injected into one cell of an embryo after the 32-cell stage, reducing gene expression in only cells descended from that cell. However, cells in the early embryo (less than 32 cells) are interpermeable to large molecules,&lt;ref name=blast2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimmel CB, Law RD | title = Cell lineage of zebrafish blastomeres.

A known problem with gene knockdowns is that, because the genome underwent a [[genome#Genome evolution|duplication]] after the divergence of [[ray-finned fish]]es and [[lobe-finned fish]]es, it is not always easy to silence the activity one of the two gene [[paralog]]s reliably due to [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] by the other paralog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Vivo Testing of MicroRNA-Mediated Gene Knockdown in Zebrafish|journal=Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology|volume=2012|pages=1–7|publisher=Hindawi|year=2012|doi=10.1155/2012/350352|pmid=22500088|pmc=3303736|last1=Leong|first1=Ivone Un San|last2=Lan|first2=Chuan-Ching|last3=Skinner|first3=Jonathan R.|last4=Shelling|first4=Andrew N.|last5=Love|first5=Donald R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complications of the zebrafish [[genome]], a number of commercially available global platforms exist for analysis of both gene expression by [[expression profiling|microarrays]] and promoter regulation using [[ChIP-on-chip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tan PK, Downey TJ, Spitznagel EL, Xu P, Fu D, Dimitrov DS, Lempicki RA, Raaka BM, Cam MC | title = Evaluation of gene expression measurements from commercial microarray platforms | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 31 | issue = 19 | pages = 5676–84 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14500831 | pmc = 206463 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkg763  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It contains 13 [[protein]]-coding genes and a noncoding control region containing the [[origin of replication]] for the heavy strand.

In 1999, the ''nacre'' mutation was identified in the zebrafish ortholog of the mammalian ''MITF'' transcription factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lister JA, Robertson CP, Lepage T, Johnson SL, Raible DW | title = nacre encodes a zebrafish microphthalmia-related protein that regulates neural-crest-derived pigment cell fate | journal = Development | volume = 126 | issue = 17 | pages = 3757–67 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10433906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutations in human ''[[MITF]]'' result in eye defects and loss of pigment, a type of [[Waardenburg Syndrome]].  In December 2005, a study of the ''golden'' strain identified the gene responsible for its unusual pigmentation as [[SLC24A5]], a [[Solution|solute]] carrier that appeared to be required for [[melanin]] production, and confirmed its function with a Morpholino knockdown. The [[Orthologue|orthologous]] gene was then characterized in humans and a one base pair difference was found to strongly segregate fair-skinned Europeans and dark-skinned Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamason RL, Mohideen MA, Mest JR, Wong AC, Norton HL, Aros MC, Jurynec MJ, Mao X, Humphreville VR, Humbert JE, Sinha S, Moore JL, Jagadeeswaran P, Zhao W, Ning G, Makalowska I, McKeigue PM, O'donnell D, Kittles R, Parra EJ, Mangini NJ, Grunwald DJ, Shriver MD, Canfield VA, Cheng KC | title = SLC24A5, a putative cation exchanger, affects pigmentation in zebrafish and humans | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = 5755 | pages = 1782–6 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16357253 | doi = 10.1126/science.1116238 | bibcode = 2005Sci...310.1782L | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e0475b76f7a5285c392780e326c767cda077f4d7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- this article is on fish, not on studies...This study featured on the cover of the [[academic journal]] [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] and demonstrates the power of zebrafish as a model organism in the relatively new field of [[comparative genomics]].--&gt; Zebrafish with the ''nacre'' mutation have since been bred with fish with a ''roy orbison (roy)'' mutation to make fish that have no melanophores or iridophores, and are transparent into adulthood.

====Transgenesis====
Transgenesis is a popular approach to study the function of genes in zebrafish. Construction of transgenic zebrafish is rather easy by a method using the Tol2 transposon system. Tol2 element which encodes a gene for a fully functional transposase capable of catalyzing transposition in the zebrafish germ lineage. Tol2 is the only natural DNA transposable element in vertebrates from which an autonomous member has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawakami K, Takeda H, Kawakami N, Kobayashi M, Matsuda N, Mishina M | title = A transposon-mediated gene trap approach identifies developmentally regulated genes in zebrafish.Tol2 element which encodes a gene for a fully functional transposase capable of catalyzing transposition in the zebrafish germ lineage.

====Transparent adult bodies====
In 2008, researchers at [[Boston Children's Hospital]] developed a new strain of zebrafish, named Casper, whose adult bodies had transparent skin.&lt;ref name=zviv/&gt; This allows for detailed visualization of cellular activity, circulation, [[metastasis]] and many other phenomena. Because many gene functions are shared between fish and humans, the Casper strain is expected to yield insights into human diseases such as leukemia and other cancers.&lt;ref name=zviv/&gt;  In 2019 researchers published a crossing of a ''prkdc&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;'' and a ''IL2rga&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;'' strain that produced transparent, immunodeficient offspring, lacking [[natural killer cell]]s as well as [[B cell|B]]- and [[T cell|T-cells]]. This new strain can be adapted to 37&amp;nbsp;°C warm water and the absence of an immune system makes the use of patient derived [[Xenotransplantation|xenografts]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langenau|first=David M.|last2=Rawls|first2=John F.|last3=Haber|first3=Daniel A.|last4=Dyson|first4=Nick J.|last5=Maheswaran|first5=Shyamala|last6=Iafrate|first6=John A.|last7=Sgroi|first7=Dennis C.|last8=Fletcher|first8=Jonathan A.|last9=Karabacak|first9=Murat N.|date=2019-06-13|title=Visualizing Engrafted Human Cancer and Therapy Responses in Immunodeficient Zebrafish|url=https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(19)30390-3|journal=Cell|language=English|volume=177|issue=7|pages=1903–1914.e14|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.004|issn=0092-8674|pmid=31031007|pmc=6570580}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Japanese scientists genetically modified a transparent zebrafish specimen to produce a visible glow during periods of intense brain activity, allowing the fish's &quot;thoughts&quot; to be recorded as specific regions of its brain lit up in response to external stimuli.&lt;ref name=ithinkz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-01/watch-zebrafish-think-about-food|title=Researchers Capture A Zebrafish's Thought Process On Video|website=Popular Science|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Chinese researchers at [[Fudan University]] genetically modified zebrafish to detect [[oestrogen]] pollution in lakes and rivers, which is linked to male infertility. The researchers cloned oestrogen-sensitive genes and injected them into the fertile eggs of zebrafish. The modified fish turned green if placed into water that was polluted by oestrogen.&lt;ref name=ChinaOest&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-01/12/content_5597696.htm &quot;Fudan scientists turn fish into estrogen alerts&quot;]. [[Xinhua]]. January 12, 2007. Retrieved November 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====RNA splicing====
In 2015, researchers at [[Brown University]] discovered that 10% of zebrafish genes do not need to rely on the [[U2AF2]] [[protein]] to initiate [[RNA splicing]]. These genes have the DNA base pairs AC and TG as repeated sequences at the ends of each [[intron]]. On the 3'ss (3' splicing site), the base pairs [[adenine]] and [[cytosine]] alternate and repeat, and on the 5'ss (5' splicing site), their complements [[thymine]] and [[guanine]] alternate and repeat as well. They found that there was less reliance on U2AF2 protein than in humans, in which the protein is required for the splicing process to occur. The pattern of repeating base pairs around introns that alters RNA [[nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary structure]] was found in other [[teleost]]s, but not in [[tetrapod]]s. This indicates that an evolutionary change in tetrapods may have led to humans relying on the U2AF2 protein for RNA splicing while these genes in zebrafish undergo splicing regardless of the presence of the protein.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrownRNA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin CL, Taggart AJ, Lim KH, Cygan KJ, Ferraris L, Creton R, Huang YT, Fairbrother WG | title = RNA structure replaces the need for U2AF2 in splicing | journal = Genome Research | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–23 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26566657 | pmc = 4691745 | doi = 10.1101/gr.181008.114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inbreeding depression===
When close relatives mate, progeny may exhibit the detrimental effects of [[inbreeding depression]].  Inbreeding depression is predominantly caused by the [[Zygosity#homozygous|homozygous]] expression of recessive deleterious alleles.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19834483&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charlesworth D, Willis JH | title = The genetics of inbreeding depression | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 783–96 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19834483 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   For zebra fish, inbreeding depression might be expected to be more severe in stressful environments, including those caused by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic pollution]]. Exposure of zebra fish to environmental stress induced by the chemical clotrimazole, an imidazole fungicide used in agriculture and in veterinary and human medicine, amplified the effects of inbreeding on key reproductive traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid23798977&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickley LK, Brown AR, Hosken DJ, Hamilton PB, Le Page G, Paull GC, Owen SF, Tyler CR | title = Interactive effects of inbreeding and endocrine disruption on reproduction in a model laboratory fish | journal = Evolutionary Applications | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 279–89 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23798977 | pmc = 3689353 | doi = 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00288.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embryo viability was significantly reduced in inbred exposed fish and there was a tendency for inbred males to sire fewer offspring.

==Drug discovery and development==

[[File:Zebrafish Make a Splash in FDA Research (8614532586).jpg|thumb|FDA research used Zebrafish to show the effects of [[ketamine]] on neurological development]]

The zebrafish and zebrafish larva is a suitable model organism for drug discovery and development. As a vertebrate with 70% genetic homology with humans,&lt;ref name=howe2013/&gt; it can be predictive of human health and disease, while its small size and fast development facilitates experiments on a larger and quicker scale than with more traditional [[Animal testing|in vivo]] studies, including the development of higher-throughput, automated investigative tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=W.

===Drug screens===
Drug screens in zebrafish can be used to identify novel classes of compounds with biological effects, or to repurpose existing drugs for novel uses; an example of the latter would be a screen which found that a commonly used statin ([[rosuvastatin]]) can suppress the growth of [[prostate cancer]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rennekamp AJ, Peterson RT | title = 15 years of zebrafish chemical screening | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 58–70 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25461724 | pmc = 4339096 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2014.10.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, 65 small-molecule screens have been carried out and at least one has led to clinical trials.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacRae CA, Peterson RT | title = Zebrafish as tools for drug discovery | journal = Nature Reviews. Drug Discovery | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 721–31 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26361349 | doi = 10.1038/nrd4627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these screens, many technical challenges remain to be resolved, including differing rates of drug absorption resulting in levels of internal exposure that cannot be extrapolated from the water concentration, and high levels of natural variation between individual animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Toxico- or pharmacokinetics===
To understand drug effects, the internal drug exposure is essential, as this drives the pharmacological effect. Translating experimental results from zebrafish to higher vertebrates (like humans) requires concentration-effect relationships, which can be derived from [[pharmacokinetic]] and [[pharmacodynamic]] analysis. 
Because of its small size, it is however very challenging to quantify the internal drug exposure. Traditionally multiple blood samples would be drawn to characterize the drug concentration profile over time, but this technique remains to be developed. To date, only a single pharmacokinetic model for [[paracetamol]] has been developed in zebrafish larvae.&lt;ref name=kantae2016&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kantae V, Krekels EH, Ordas A, González O, van Wijk RC, Harms AC, Racz PI, van der Graaf PH, Spaink HP, Hankemeier T | title = Pharmacokinetic Modeling of Paracetamol Uptake and Clearance in Zebrafish Larvae: Expanding the Allometric Scale in Vertebrates with Five Orders of Magnitude | journal = Zebrafish | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 504–510 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27632065 | pmc = 5124745 | doi = 10.1089/zeb.2016.1313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the potential for pharmacological analyses in this organism is therefore promising.&lt;ref name = vanwijk2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Wijk|first=Rob C|last2=Krekels|first2=Elke HJ|last3=Hankemeier|first3=Thomas|last4=Spaink|first4=Herman P|last5=Van der Graaf|first5=Piet H | name-list-format = vanc |title=Systems pharmacology of hepatic metabolism in zebrafish larvae|journal=Drug Discovery Today: Disease Models|doi=10.1016/j.ddmod.2017.04.003|year=2017|volume=22|pages=27–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational data analysis===
Using smart data analysis methods, pathophysiological and pharmacological processes can be understood and subsequently translated to higher vertebrates, including humans.&lt;ref name = vanwijk2016/&gt;&lt;ref name = schulthess2018&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulthess|first=Pascal|last2=Van Wijk|first2=Rob C|last3=Krekels|first3=Elke HJ|last4=Yates|first4=Thomas WT|last5=Spaink|first5=Herman P|last6=Van der Graaf|first6=Piet H | name-list-format = vanc |title=Outside-in systems pharmacology combines innovative computational methods with high-throughput whole vertebrate studies|journal=CPT: Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology|doi=10.1002/psp4.12297|pmid=29693322|pmc=5980533|year=2018|volume=7|issue=5|pages=285–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example is the use of [[systems pharmacology]], which is the integration of [[systems biology]] and [[pharmacometrics]]. 
Systems biology characterizes (part of) an organism by a mathematical description of all relevant processes. These can be for example different signal transduction pathways that upon a specific signal lead to a certain response. By quantifying these processes, their behaviour in healthy and diseased situation can be understood and predicted. 
Pharmacometrics uses data from preclinical experiments and [[clinical trials]] to characterize the pharmacological processes that are underlying the relation between the drug dose and its response or clinical outcome. These can be for example the drug [[absorption (pharmacology)|absorption]] in or [[clearance (pharmacology)|clearance]] from the body, or its interaction with the target to achieve a certain effect. By quantifying these processes, their behaviour after different doses or in different patients can be understood and predicted to new doses or patients.
By integrating these two fields, systems pharmacology has the potential to improve the understanding of the interaction of the drug with the biological system by mathematical quantification and subsequent prediction to new situations, like new drugs or new organisms or patients.
Using these computational methods, the previously mentioned analysis of paracetamol internal exposure in zebrafish larvae showed reasonable correlation between paracetamol clearance in zebrafish with that of higher vertebrates, including humans.&lt;ref name=kantae2016/&gt;

==Medical research==

===Cancer===
Zebrafish have been used to make several transgenic models of cancer, including [[melanoma]], [[leukemia]], [[pancreatic cancer]] and [[hepatocellular carcinoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu S, Leach SD | title = Zebrafish models for cancer | journal = Annual Review of Pathology | volume = 6 | pages = 71–93 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21261518 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-pathol-011110-130330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110323141852.htm|title=Zebrafish model of human melanoma reveals new cancer gene|website=Science Daily|date=March 23, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zebrafish expressing mutated forms of either the BRAF or NRAS [[oncogene]]s develop melanoma when placed onto a p53 deficient background. [[Histology|Histologically]], these tumors strongly resemble the human disease, are fully transplantable, and exhibit large-scale genomic alterations. The BRAF melanoma model was utilized as a platform for two screens published in March 2011 in the journal ''Nature''. In one study, the model was used as a tool to understand the functional importance of genes known to be amplified and overexpressed in human melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ceol CJ, Houvras Y, Jane-Valbuena J, Bilodeau S, Orlando DA, Battisti V, Fritsch L, Lin WM, Hollmann TJ, Ferré F, Bourque C, Burke CJ, Turner L, Uong A, Johnson LA, Beroukhim R, Mermel CH, Loda M, Ait-Si-Ali S, Garraway LA, Young RA, Zon LI | title = The histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is recurrently amplified in melanoma and accelerates its onset | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7339 | pages = 513–7 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21430779 | pmc = 3348545 | doi = 10.1038/nature09806 | bibcode = 2011Natur.471..513C }}&lt;/ref&gt; One gene, SETDB1, markedly accelerated tumor formation in the zebrafish system, demonstrating its importance as a new melanoma oncogene. This was particularly significant because SETDB1 is known to be involved in the epigenetic regulation that is increasingly appreciated to be central to tumor cell biology.

In another study, an effort was made to therapeutically target the genetic program present in the tumor's origin [[neural crest]] cell using a chemical screening approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White RM, Cech J, Ratanasirintrawoot S, Lin CY, Rahl PB, Burke CJ, Langdon E, Tomlinson ML, Mosher J, Kaufman C, Chen F, Long HK, Kramer M, Datta S, Neuberg D, Granter S, Young RA, Morrison S, Wheeler GN, Zon LI | title = DHODH modulates transcriptional elongation in the neural crest and melanoma | journal = Nature | volume = 471 | issue = 7339 | pages = 518–22 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21430780 | pmc = 3759979 | doi = 10.1038/nature09882 | bibcode = 2011Natur.471..518W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This revealed that an inhibition of the DHODH protein (by a small molecule called leflunomide) prevented development of the neural crest stem cells which ultimately give rise to melanoma via interference with the process of transcriptional elongation. Because this approach would aim to target the &quot;identity&quot; of the melanoma cell rather than a single genetic mutation, leflunomide may have utility in treating human melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110323141838.htm | title = Arthritis Drug Could Help Beat Melanoma Skin Cancer, Study Finds|website=Science Daily|date=March 24, 2011|accessdate= November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immune system===

===Repairing retinal damage===
[[File:Development of the retina.tif|thumb|400px|The development of a single zebrafish retina captured on a light sheet microscope approx. every 12 hours from 1.5 days to 3.5 days after birth of the embryo.]]
Another notable characteristic of the zebrafish is that it possesses four types of [[cone cell]], with [[ultraviolet]]-sensitive cells supplementing the red, green and blue cone cell subtypes found in humans. Zebrafish can thus observe a very wide spectrum of colours. The species is also studied to better understand the development of the retina; in particular, how the cone cells of the retina become arranged into the so-called 'cone mosaic'. Zebrafish, in addition to certain other [[teleost]] fish, are particularly noted for having extreme precision of cone cell arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allison WT, Barthel LK, Skebo KM, Takechi M, Kawamura S, Raymond PA | title = Ontogeny of cone photoreceptor mosaics in zebrafish | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 518 | issue = 20 | pages = 4182–95 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20878782 | pmc = 3376642 | doi = 10.1002/cne.22447 | url = https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/77982/1/22447_ftp.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study of the zebrafish's retinal characteristics has also extrapolated into medical enquiry. In 2007, researchers at [[University College London]] grew a type of zebrafish adult [[stem cell]] found in the eyes of fish and mammals that develops into [[neuron]]s in the retina. These could be injected into the eye to treat diseases that damage retinal neurons—nearly every disease of the eye, including [[macular degeneration]], [[glaucoma]], and [[diabetes]]-related blindness. The researchers studied Müller [[glial cells]] in the eyes of humans aged from 18 months to 91 years, and were able to develop them into all types of retinal neurons. They were also able to grow them easily in the lab. The stem cells successfully migrated into diseased rats' retinas, and took on the characteristics of the surrounding neurons. The team stated that they intended to develop the same approach in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence JM, Singhal S, Bhatia B, Keegan DJ, Reh TA, Luthert PJ, Khaw PT, Limb GA | title = MIO-M1 cells and similar muller glial cell lines derived from adult human retina exhibit neural stem cell characteristics | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 25 | issue = 8 | pages = 2033–43 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17525239 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.2006-0724 | laydate = August 3, 2007 | lay-url = http://www.chinapost.com.tw/health/eye%20health/2007/08/03/116860/Zebra-fish.htm | laysource = [[The China Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muscular dystrophies ===
[[Muscular dystrophy|Muscular dystrophies]] (MD) are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that cause muscle weakness, abnormal contractions and muscle wasting, often leading to premature death. Zebrafish is widely used as model organism to study muscular dystrophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Plantié E, Migocka-Patrzałek M, Daczewska M, Jagla K | title = Model organisms in the fight against muscular dystrophy: lessons from drosophila and Zebrafish | journal = Molecules | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 6237–53 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25859781 | doi = 10.3390/molecules20046237 | pmc = 6272363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''sapje'' (''sap'') mutant is the zebrafish orthologue of human [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]] (DMD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunkel LM, Bachrach E, Bennett RR, Guyon J, Steffen L | title = Diagnosis and cell-based therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy in humans, mice, and zebrafish | language = En | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 397–406 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16583129 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-006-0374-9 | pmc=3518425}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Machuca-Tzili and co-workers applied zebrafish to determine the role of alternative splicing factor, MBNL, in [[Myotonic dystrophy|myotonic dystrophy type 1]] (DM1) pathogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Machuca-Tzili LE, Buxton S, Thorpe A, Timson CM, Wigmore P, Luther PK, Brook JD | title = Zebrafish deficient for Muscleblind-like 2 exhibit features of myotonic dystrophy | journal = Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 381–92 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21303839 | doi = 10.1242/dmm.004150 | pmc=3097459}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Todd et al. described a new zebrafish model designed to explore the impact of CUG repeat expression during early development in DM1 disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Todd PK, Ackall FY, Hur J, Sharma K, Paulson HL, Dowling JJ | title = Transcriptional changes and developmental abnormalities in a zebrafish model of myotonic dystrophy type 1 | journal = Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 143–55 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24092878 | doi = 10.1242/dmm.012427 | pmc=3882056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zebrafish is also an excellent animal model to study congenital muscular dystrophies including CMD Type 1 A (CMD 1A) caused by mutation in the human laminin α2 (LAMA2) gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jones KJ, Morgan G, Johnston H, Tobias V, Ouvrier RA, Wilkinson I, North KN | title = The expanding phenotype of laminin alpha2 chain (merosin) abnormalities: case series and review | journal = Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 649–57 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11584042 | pmc = 1734735 | doi = 10.1136/jmg.38.10.649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zebrafish, because of its advantages discussed above, and in particular the ability of zebrafish embryos to absorb chemicals, has become a model of choice in screening and testing new drugs against muscular distrophies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maves L | title = Recent advances using zebrafish animal models for muscle disease drug discovery | journal = Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = 1033–45 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 24931439 | pmc = 4697731 | doi = 10.1517/17460441.2014.927435 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bone physiology and pathology ===
Zebrafish hasve been used as model organisms for bone metabolism, tissue turnover, and resorbing activity. They have been used to study osteogenesis, evaluating differentiation, matrix deposition activity, and cross-talk of skeletal cells, to create and isolate mutants modeling human bone diseases, and test new chemical compounds for the ability to revert bone defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witten|first1=P.
