'''''Trieste''''' is a Swiss-designed, Italian-built deep-diving research [[bathyscaphe]] which reached a record depth of about  {{convert|10911|m|ft|0}} in the [[Challenger Deep]] of the [[Mariana Trench]] near [[Guam]] in the Pacific. On 23 January 1960, [[Jacques Piccard]] (son of the boat's designer [[Auguste Piccard]]) and US Navy Lieutenant [[Don Walsh]] achieved the goal of [[Project Nekton]]. It was the first manned vessel to reach the bottom of the Challenger Deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Trip to the Deepest Part of the Ocean The Bathyscaphe Trieste carried two hydronauts to the Challenger Deep in 1960|url=http://geology.com/records/bathyscaphe-trieste.shtml|website=Geology.com|publisher=2005-2015 Geology.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
{{refimprove|section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:Trieste nh96807.svg|thumb|300px|left|General arrangement drawing, showing the main features]]
''Trieste'' consisted of a float chamber filled with [[gasoline]] (petrol) for [[buoyancy]], with a separate pressure sphere to hold the crew.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH&quot; /&gt; This configuration (dubbed a &quot;[[bathyscaphe]]&quot; by the Piccards), allowed for a free dive, rather than the previous [[bathysphere]] designs in which a sphere was lowered to depth and raised again to the surface by a cable attached to a ship.

''Trieste'' was designed by the Swiss scientist Auguste Piccard and originally built in Italy. His pressure sphere, composed of two sections, was built by the company Acciaierie [[Terni]]. The upper part was manufactured by the company [[Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico]], in the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] (on the border between Italy and Yugoslavia, now in Italy); hence the name chosen for the bathyscaphe. The installation of the pressure sphere was done in the Cantiere navale di [[Castellammare di Stabia]], near [[Naples]]. ''Trieste'' was launched on 26 August 1953 into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] near the [[Capri|Isle of Capri]]. The design was based on previous experience with the bathyscaphe ''[[FNRS-2]]''. ''Trieste'' was operated by the [[French Navy]]. After several years of operation in the Mediterranean Sea, the ''Trieste'' was purchased by the [[United States Navy]] in 1958 for $250,000 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|.25|1958|r=1|fmt=c}} million today).

At the time of [[Project Nekton]], ''Trieste'' was more than 15&amp;nbsp;m (50&amp;nbsp;ft) long. The majority of this was a series of floats filled with {{convert|85,000|L|USgal}} of [[gasoline]], and water ballast tanks were included at either end of the vessel, as well as releasable iron ballast in two conical hoppers along the bottom, fore and aft of the crew sphere. The crew occupied the 2.16&amp;nbsp;m (7.09&amp;nbsp;ft) pressure sphere, attached to the underside of the float and accessed from the deck of the vessel by a vertical shaft that penetrated the float and continued down to the sphere hatch.

The pressure sphere provided just enough room for two people. It provided completely independent life support, with a closed-circuit [[rebreather]] system similar to that used in modern spacecraft and spacesuits: [[oxygen]] was provided from pressure cylinders, and carbon dioxide was scrubbed from breathing air by being passed through canisters of [[Soda lime|soda-lime]]. Power was provided by batteries.

[[File:Bathyscaphe Trieste Piccard-Walsh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard aboard ''Trieste'']]

''Trieste'' was subsequently fitted with a new pressure sphere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bathyscaphe|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/media/reference/assets/bathyscaphe-1.pdf|website=National Geographic Education|publisher=2015 National Geographic Society|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; manufactured by the [[Krupp]] Steel Works of [[Essen, Germany]], in three finely-machined sections (an equatorial ring and two caps).

To withstand the enormous pressure of 1.25 [[tonne|metric tons]] per cm{{sup|2}} (110 [[MPa]]) at the bottom of Challenger Deep, the sphere's walls were {{convert|12.7|cm|in}} thick (it was [[Factor of safety|overdesigned]] to withstand considerably more than the rated pressure). The sphere weighed {{convert|14.25|MT|lb|abbr=off}} in air and {{convert|8|MT|lb|abbr=off|spell=in}} in water (giving it an average specific gravity of 13/(13âˆ’8) = 2.6 times that of sea water). The float was necessary because of the sphere's density: it was not possible to design a sphere large enough to hold a person that could withstand the necessary pressures, yet also have metal walls thin enough for the sphere to be neutrally buoyant. Gasoline was chosen as the float fluid because it is less dense than water, and also less compressible, thus retaining its buoyant properties and negating the need for thick, heavy walls for the float chamber.
[[File:Bathyscaphe Trieste sphere.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Close-up of pressure sphere, with forward ballast silo at left]]
Observation of the sea outside the craft was conducted directly by eye, via a single, very tapered, cone-shaped block of [[acrylic glass]] (Plexiglas), the only transparent substance identified which would withstand the external pressure. Outside illumination for the craft was provided by quartz [[arc lamp|arc-light]] bulbs, which proved to be able to withstand the over {{convert|1000|atm|psi|abbr=off}} (100 MPa) of pressure without any modification.

{{convert|9|MT|lb|abbr=off|spell=In}} of magnetic [[iron]] pellets were placed on the craft as ballast, both to speed the descent and allow ascent, since the extreme water pressures would not have permitted compressed air ballast-expulsion tanks to be used at great depths. This additional weight was held in place at the throats of two hopper-like ballast silos by electromagnets, so in case of an electrical failure the bathyscaphe would automatically rise to the surface.

Transported to the [[Naval Electronics Laboratory]]'s facility in [[San Diego, California]], ''Trieste'' was modified extensively by the Americans, and then used in a series of deep-submergence tests in the Pacific Ocean during the next few years, culminating in the dive to the bottom of the Challenger Deep during January 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;MH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Trieste Bathyscaphe |url=http://www.machine-history.com/Trieste%20Bathyscaphe |website=Machine-History.Com |publisher=from Time article 12 October 1953 |accessdate=27 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906084947/http://www.machine-history.com/Trieste%20Bathyscaphe |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mariana Trench dives==
''Trieste'' departed San Diego on 5 October 1959 for [[Guam]] aboard the freighter ''Santa Maria'' to participate in ''Project Nekton'', a series of very deep dives in the Mariana Trench.

On 23 January 1960, she reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep (the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench), carrying Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/t8/trieste.htm|title=Trieste|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time a vessel, manned or unmanned, had reached the deepest known point of the Earth's oceans. The onboard systems indicated a depth of {{convert|11521|m|ft|0}}, although this was revised later to {{convert|10916|m|ft|0}}; fairly recently, more accurate measurements have found Challenger Deep to be between {{convert|10911|m|ft|0}} and {{convert|10994|m|ft|0}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oceans' deepest depth re-measured |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15845550 |newspaper=BBC News |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The descent to the ocean floor took 4 hours 47 minutes at a descent rate of {{convert|0.9|m/s|km/h mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;NGC: On the sea floor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocean.udel.edu/extreme2004/geology/trieste.html To the Depths in ''Trieste''], University of Delaware College of Marine Studies&lt;/ref&gt; After passing {{convert|9000|m|ft|}}, one of the outer Plexiglas window panes cracked, shaking the entire vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202144233/http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml |archive-date=2 February 2007 |url-status=dead }}, ''Rolex Deep Sea Special'', Written January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men spent twenty minutes on the ocean floor. The temperature in the cabin was 7&amp;nbsp;Â°C (45&amp;nbsp;Â°F) at the time. While at maximum depth, Piccard and Walsh unexpectedly regained the ability to communicate with the support ship, [[USS Wandank (ATA-204)#Mariana Islands service.2C 1955-1967|USS ''Wandank'' (ATA-204)]], using a [[sonar]]/[[hydrophone]] voice communications system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historycentral.com/navy/Tug/Wanduck%20II.html | title=Wandank (ATA-204) | publisher=historycentral.com | accessdate=3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a speed of almost {{convert|1|mi/s|km/s|order=flip|abbr=on}} &amp;ndash; about five times the speed of sound in air &amp;ndash; it took about seven seconds for a voice message to travel from the craft to the support ship and another seven seconds for answers to return.

While at the bottom, Piccard and Walsh reported observing a number of small [[sole (fish)|sole]] and [[flounder]] (both [[flatfish]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | year = 2012 | title = Meet the only man alive who has been to the deepest ocean | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17060355 | publisher = [[BBC]] | accessdate =24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8426132.stm | title=Meet the creatures that live beyond the abyss | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=24 February 2012 | date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy of this observation has later been questioned and recent authorities do not recognize it as valid.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The theoretical maximum depth for fish is at about {{convert|8000-8500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, beyond which they would become [[hyperosmotic]].&lt;ref name=Wolff1961&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wolff, T.|year=1961|title=The deepest recorded fishes|journal=Nature|volume=190|pages=283â€“284|doi=10.1038/190283a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jamieson2012&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jamieson, A.J.|author2=P.H.

The ascent took 3 hours and 15 minutes.

==Other deep dives by ''Trieste''==
Beginning in April 1963, ''Trieste'' was modified and used in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to search for the missing nuclear submarine {{USS|Thresher|SSN-593}}. ''Trieste'' was delivered to Boston Harbor by USS ''Point Defiance'' (LSD-31) under the command of Captain H. H. Haisten. In August 1963, ''Trieste'' found the wreck off the coast of [[New England]], {{convert|8400|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} below the surface.&lt;ref name=brand&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brand, V |title=Submersibles - Manned and Unmanned |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=7 |issue=3 |year=1977 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6154 |accessdate=10 July 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801135138/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6154| archivedate= 1 August 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Trieste'' was changed, improved and redesigned so many times that almost no original parts remain. It was transported to the Washington Navy Yard where it was exhibited along with the Krupp pressure sphere in the [[U.S. Navy Museum|National Museum of the U.S. Navy]] at the [[Washington Navy Yard]] in 1980. Its original Terni pressure sphere was incorporated into the ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste II|Trieste II]]''.
