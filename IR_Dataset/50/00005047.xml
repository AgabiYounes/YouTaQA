'''Biotite''' is a common group of [[Silicate minerals#Phyllosilicates|phyllosilicate]] [[mineral]]s within the [[mica]] group, with the approximate [[chemical formula]] {{chem|K(Mg,Fe)|3|AlSi|3|O|10|(F,OH)|2}}. It is primarily a [[solid solution|solid-solution]] series between the [[iron]]-[[endmember]] [[annite]],  and the [[magnesium]]-endmember [[phlogopite]]; more [[Aluminium|aluminous]] end-members include [[siderophyllite]] and [[eastonite]]. Biotite was regarded as a mineral ''species'' by the [[International Mineralogical Association]] until 1998, when its status was changed to a mineral ''group''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minerals_Net&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.minerals.net/mineral/biotite.aspx | title=The Biotite Mineral Group | publisher=Minerals.net | accessdate=29 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindat.org/min-677.html&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''biotite'' is still used to describe unanalysed dark micas [[Field research|in the field]]. Biotite was named by [[Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann|J.F.L. Hausmann]] in 1847 in honor of the French [[physicist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]], who performed early research into the many [[Optical mineralogy|optical properties]] of [[mica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Johann Friedrich Ludwig Hausmann| title = Handbuch der Mineralogie| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqgTAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA674| year = 1828| publisher = Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht| isbn = | page = 674 }} &quot;Zur Bezeichnung des sogenannten einachsigen Glimmers ist hier der Name Biotit gewählt worden, um daran zu erinnern, daß Biot es war, der zuerst auf die optische Verschiedenheit der Glimmerarten aufmerksam machte.&quot;  (For the designation of so-called uniaxial mica, the name &quot;biotite&quot; has been chosen in order to recall that it was Biot who first called attention to the optical differences between types of mica.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the biotite group are [[sheet silicate]]s. [[Iron]], [[magnesium]], [[aluminium]], [[silicon]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]] form sheets that are weakly bound together by [[potassium]] [[ion]]s. It is sometimes called &quot;iron mica&quot; because it is more iron-rich than phlogopite. It is also sometimes called &quot;black mica&quot; as opposed to &quot;white mica&quot; ([[muscovite]]) – both form in the same [[Rock (geology)|rocks]], and in some instances side-by-side.

==Properties==

Like other [[mica]] minerals, biotite has a highly perfect [[basal cleavage]], and consists of flexible sheets, or [[Lamellae (materials)|lamellae]], which easily flake off.  It has a [[monoclinic crystal system]], with [[tabular habit|tabular]] to [[Prism (geometry)|prismatic]] crystals with an obvious [[wikt:pinacoid|pinacoid]] termination.  It has four prism faces and two pinacoid faces to form a [[Hexagonal (crystal system)|pseudohexagonal]] crystal.  Although not easily seen because of the cleavage and sheets, fracture is uneven. It appears greenish to brown or black, and even yellow when [[weathering|weathered]]. It can be transparent to opaque, has a vitreous to pearly [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]], and a grey-white [[Streak (mineralogy)|streak]]. When biotite crystals are found in large chunks, they are called &quot;books&quot; because they resemble books with pages of many sheets. The color of biotite is usually black and the mineral has a hardness of 2.5–3 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]].

Biotite [[Solvation|dissolves]] in both [[acid]] and [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] [[aqueous solution]]s, with the highest [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] rates at low [[pH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malmström|first1=Maria|last2=Banwart|first2=Steven|title=Biotite dissolution at 25°C: The pH dependence of dissolution rate and stoichiometry|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=July 1997|volume=61|issue=14|pages=2779–2799|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00093-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, biotite dissolution is highly [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] with crystal edge surfaces ([[Miller index|''h k''0]]) reacting 45 to 132 times faster than basal surfaces ([[Miller index|001]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodson|first1=Mark E.|title=Does reactive surface area depend on grain size?

===Optical properties===

In [[thin section]], biotite exhibits moderate [[Optical relief|relief]] and a pale to deep greenish brown or brown color, with moderate to strong [[pleochroism]]. Biotite has a high [[birefringence]] which can be partially masked by its deep intrinsic color.&lt;ref name=&quot;min-in-thin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://funnel.sfsu.edu/courses/geol426/Handouts/mintable.pdf|title=Identification Tables for Common Minerals in Thin Section|last=Faithful|first=John|year=1998|access-date=March 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Polarized light microscopy|cross-polarized light]], biotite exhibits extinction approximately parallel to cleavage lines, and can have characteristic [[Bird's eye maple (mineral property)|bird's eye extinction]], a mottled appearance caused by the distortion of the mineral's flexible lamellae during grinding of the thin section. Basal sections of biotite in thin section are typically approximately hexagonal in shape and usually appear [[isotropic]] under cross-polarized light.&lt;ref name=&quot;min-rock-sec&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Minerals in Rock Sections: The Practical Methods of Identifying Minerals in Rock Sections with the Microscope|url=https://archive.org/details/mineralsinrocks02luqugoog|quote=bird's eye extinction thin section grinding.|last=Luquer|first=Lea McIlvaine|year=1913|publisher=D.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Occurrence==

Members of the biotite group are found in a wide variety of [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks]]. For instance, biotite occurs in the [[lava]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and in the Monzoni intrusive complex of the western [[Dolomites]]. Biotite in [[granite]] tends to be poorer in magnesium than the biotite found in its volcanic equivalent, [[rhyolite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CTV74&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Igneous Petrology | publisher=McGraw-Hill |last1=Carmichael |first1=I.S. |last2=Turner |first2=F.J. |last3=Verhoogen |first3=J. |year=1974 |location=New York |pages=250 |isbn=978-0-07-009987-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biotite is an essential [[phenocryst]] in some varieties of [[lamprophyre]]. Biotite is occasionally found in large cleavable crystals, especially in [[pegmatite]] veins, as in [[New England]], [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]] USA. Other notable occurrences include [[Bancroft, Ontario|Bancroft]] and [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]] Canada. It is an essential constituent of many metamorphic [[schist]]s, and it forms in suitable compositions over a wide range of [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. It has been estimated that biotite comprises up to 7% of the exposed continental crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesbitt|first1=H.W|last2=Young|first2=G.M|title=Prediction of some weathering trends of plutonic and volcanic rocks based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|date=July 1984|volume=48|issue=7|pages=1523–1534|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(84)90408-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An igneous rock composed almost entirely of dark mica (biotite or phlogopite) is known as a ''[[glimmerite]]'' or ''biotitite''.&lt;ref name=&quot;glimmerite&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malawi glimmerites|url=|doi=10.1016/0899-5362(88)90012-7|last=Morel|first=S. W.|journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences|volume=7|year=1988|pages=987–997|issue=7/8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biotite may be found in association with its common alteration product [[Chlorite group|chlorite]].&lt;ref name=&quot;min-rock-sec&quot;/&gt;

The largest documented single crystals of biotite were approximately {{convert|7|m2|abbr=on}} sheets found in [[Iveland]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM66/AM66_885.pdf| journal = American Mineralogist| volume = 66| pages = 885–907| year= 1981| title= The largest crystals| author = P. C. Rickwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Uses==
Biotite is used extensively to constrain ages of rocks, by either [[potassium-argon dating]] or [[argon–argon dating]]. Because [[argon]] escapes readily from the biotite crystal structure at high temperatures, these methods may provide only minimum ages for many rocks. Biotite is also useful in assessing temperature histories of metamorphic rocks, because the partitioning of [[iron]] and [[magnesium]] between biotite and [[garnet]] is sensitive to temperature.
