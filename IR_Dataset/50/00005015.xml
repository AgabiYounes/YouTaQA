'''Bjørn Lomborg''' ({{IPA-da|pjɶɐ̯n ˈlɒmˌpɒˀu̯|lang}}; born 6 January 1965) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] author and President of his [[think tank]], [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]]. He is former director of the Danish government's [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI) in [[Copenhagen]]. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book, ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' (2001), in which he argues that many of the costly measures and actions adopted by scientists and policy makers to meet the challenges of global warming will ultimately have minimal impact on the world's rising temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;foreignpolicyblogs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2013/10/23/a-candid-discussion-with-bjorn-lomborg/ |title=A Candid Discussion with Bjorn Lomborg |first=Reza |last=Akhlaghi |date=23 October 2013 |website=Foreign Policy Blogs |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], a project-based conference where prominent [[economists]] sought to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methods based on the theory of [[welfare economics]].

In 2009, ''[[Business Insider]]'' cited Lomborg as one of &quot;The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-ten-most-important-climate-change-skeptics-2009-7?op=1 |title=The 10 Most-Respected Global Warming Skeptics |website=Business Insider |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2015 |last=Weisenthal |first=Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Lomborg campaigned against the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, he argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions. His issue is not with the reality of climate change, but rather with the economic and political approaches being taken (or not taken) to meet the challenges of that climate change. He is a strong advocate for focusing attention and resources on what he perceives as far more pressing world problems, such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/17/comment.climatechange |title=Sucked dry |newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2015 |last=Lomborg |first=Bjorn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704517504574589952331068322 |title=Time for a Smarter Approach to Global Warming |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=24 April 2015 |last=Lomborg |first=Bjorn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his critique of the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]], Lomborg stated: &quot;Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/wrongheaded-in-rio |title=Wrongheaded in Rio |date=13 June 2012 |work=[[Project Syndicate]] |first1=Bjørn |last1=Lomborg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Lomborg was an undergraduate at the [[University of Georgia]], earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in [[political science]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] in 1991, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in political science at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1994.

== Career ==
Lomborg lectured in [[statistics]] in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an [[assistant professor]] (1994–1996) and [[associate professor]] (1997–2005). He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an adjunct professor in Policy-making, Scientific Knowledge and the Role of Experts at the Department of Management, Politics and Philosophy, [[Copenhagen Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-management-politics-and-philosophy/events/appointment-of-bjoern-lomborg |title=Appointment of Bjørn Lomborg |website=Copenhagen Business School |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in his career, his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in [[collective action]] [[Ethical dilemma|dilemmas]], simulation of [[political party|party]] behavior in [[Party-list proportional representation|proportional voting systems]], and the use of surveys in [[public administration]]. In 1996, Lomborg's paper, &quot;Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma&quot;, was published in the [[academic journal]], ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.&lt;ref name=1996Nucleus&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lomborg |first=Bjørn |year=1996 |title=Nucleus and Shield: The Evolution of Social Structure in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=278–307 |doi=10.2307/2096335 |publisher=[[American Sociological Association]] |jstor=2096335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the [[Environmental movement|environmental arena]]. In 1998, Lomborg published four [[essay]]s about the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in the leading Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'', which according to him &quot;resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lomborg.com/about/biography/ |title=Bjørn Lomborg Biography |website=www.lomborg.com |access-date=26 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the ''Skeptical Environmentalist'', whose English translation was published as a work in [[environmental economics]] by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited ''Global Crises, Global Solutions'', which presented the first conclusions of the Copenhagen Consensus, published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled ''[[Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming]].''

In March 2002, the newly elected [[Centre-right|center-right]] [[prime minister]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus,&lt;ref name=lomborg-error&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fog |first1=Kåre |title=The functioning of the Environmental Assessment Institute |url=http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/lomborgstory15.htm |website=www.lomborg-errors.dk |accessdate=25 October 2015 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.

Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the Copenhagen Consensus in 2002, which seeks to establish priorities for advancing [[world|global]] welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics. A panel of prominent economists was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government and was co-sponsored by ''[[The Economist]]''. A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, ''[[Global Crises, Global Solutions]]'', edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by [[Cambridge University Press]].

In 2006, Lomborg became director of the newly established [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]], a Danish government-funded institute intended to build on the mandate of the EAI, and expand on the original Copenhagen Consensus conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/our-story |title=Our story |website=Copenhagen Consensus Center |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark withdrew its funding in 2012 and the Center faced imminent closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/23/bjorn-lomborg-climate-thinktank-close |title=Bjorn Lomborg's climate sceptic thinktank to close |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-17 Apr 2015&quot; /&gt; Lomborg left the country and reconstituted the Center as a non-profit organization in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;cosmos&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth-sciences/bj%C3%B8rn-lomborg-resilient-environmentalist |title=Bjørn Lomborg: The resilient environmentalist |magazine=[[Cosmos (Australian magazine)|COSMOS]] |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2014 |last=Kloor |first=Keith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024519/https://cosmosmagazine.com/earth-sciences/bj%C3%B8rn-lomborg-resilient-environmentalist |archive-date=29 November 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/press-contact |title=Press Contact |website=Copenhagen Consensus Center |accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center was based out of a &quot;Neighborhood Parcel Shipping Center&quot; in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], though Lomborg himself was based in [[Prague]] in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conversation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/still-no-consensus-for-bjorn-lomborg-the-climate-change-refugee-45423 |title=Still no consensus for Bjorn Lomborg, the climate change refugee |last=Holmes |first=David |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=30 July 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Lomborg described the Center's funding as &quot;a little more than $1m a year...from private donations&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-17 Apr 2015&quot; /&gt; of which Lomborg himself was paid $775,000 in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conversation&quot; /&gt;

In April 2015, it was announced that an alliance between the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the [[University of Western Australia]] would see the establishment of the Australian Consensus Centre, a new policy research center at the UWA Business School. The University described the Center's goals as a &quot;focus on applying an economic lens to proposals to achieve good for Australia, the region and the world, prioritizing those initiatives which produce the most social value per dollar spent.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.uwa.edu.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201504027455/events/new-economic-prioritisation-research-centre-uwa |title=New economic prioritisation research centre at UWA |website=University of Western Australia |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appointment came under intense scrutiny, particularly when leaked documents revealed that the Australian government had approached UWA and offered to fund the Consensus Centre, information subsequently confirmed by a senior UWA lecturer.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH-23 Apr 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bjorn-lomborg-centre-leaked-documents-cast-doubt-on-abbott-government-claims-20150423-1mqfnn.html |title=Bjorn Lomborg centre: leaked documents cast doubt on Abbott government claims |last1=Cox |first1=Lisa |last2=Knott |first2=Matthew |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports indicated that Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]]'s office was directly responsible for Lomborg's elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/prime-minister-tony-abbotts-office-the-origin-for-controversial-bjorn-lomborg-centre-decision-20150423-1mrha2.html |title=Prime Minister Tony Abbott's office the origin for controversial Bjorn Lomborg centre decision |last1=Massola |first1=James |last2=Knott |first2=Matthew |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; $4&amp;nbsp;million of the total funding for the Center was to be provided by the Australian federal government,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian-17 Apr 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/17/abbott-government-gives-4m-to-help-climate-sceptic-set-up-australian-centre |title=Abbott government gives $4m to help climate contrarian set up Australian centre |last=Taylor |first=Lenore |date=16 April 2015 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with UWA not contributing any funding for the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Paul |title=Message from the Vice-Chancellor on the Australian Consensus Centre |url=http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/201505087564/message-vice-chancellor-australian-consensus-centre |website=University of Western Australia |accessdate=10 May 2015 |date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 May 2015, UWA cancelled the contract for hosting the Australian Consensus Centre as &quot;the proposed centre was untenable and lacked academic support&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-09/students-praise-uwa-for-ditching-bjorn-lomborg-think-tank/6457210 |title=Students praise UWA for ditching controversial $4m Bjorn Lomborg Consensus Centre think tank |website=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC News]] |date=9 May 2015 |accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UWA cancels contract for Consensus Centre headed by controversial academic Bjorn Lomborg |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-08/bjorn-lomborg-uwa-consensus-centre-contract-cancelled/6456708 |accessdate=10 May 2015 |work=ABC News |date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian federal education minister, [[Christopher Pyne]], said that he would find another university to host the ACC.

In July 2015, [[Flinders University]] senior management began quietly canvassing its staff about a plan to host the renamed Lomborg Consensus Centre at the University, likely in the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences. A week later the story was broken on Twitter by the NTEU (National Tertiary Education Union)&lt;ref name=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/NTEUWA/status/624107282452754433 |website=Twitter.com|title=NTEU WA Division on Twitter: &quot;@NTEUSA @NTEUNational @NTEUVictoria @NTEUNSW @NTEUQld Do we need a new hashtag #lomborgflinders since we hear he maybe heading there?&quot;|accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scott Ludlam.&lt;ref name=&quot;twitter2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/SenatorLudlam/status/624113257838542848 |website=Twitter.com |title=Scott Ludlam on Twitter: &quot;rumour has it Bjorn Lomborg might be setting up shop at Flinders Uni in SA: anyone able to confirm? #lomborgflinders #findbjorn&quot; |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story appeared the next day in ''The Australian'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/flinders-university-in-talks-on-lomborg-plan-for-consensus-centre/news-story/1228444c2700a67079bd436aeea2205f |title=Flinders University in talks on Lomborg plan for Consensus Centre |date=23 July 2015 |newspaper=The Australian |url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; but described as &quot;academic conversations&quot; with no mention of Bjorn Lomborg's involvement and portrayed as a grassroots desire for the Centre by the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.flinders.edu.au/flinders-news/2015/07/24/statement-from-the-vice-chancellor-on-current-academic-discussions/ |title=Statement from the Vice-Chancellor on current academic discussions |date=24 July 2015 |website=Flinders University}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, a story appeared in ''The Guardian'' quoting two Flinders University academics and an internal document demonstrating staff's withering rejection of the idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/bjrn-lomborgs-4m-centre-rejected-by-flinders-university-academics |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Bjørn Lomborg's $4m centre rejected by Flinders University academics |date=28 July 2015 |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flinders staff and students vowed to fight against the establishment of any Centre or any partnership with Lomborg,&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/students-and-staff-warn-of-angry-backlash-if-sceptical-environmentalist-bjorn-lomborg-sets-up-research-centre-at-flinders-university-20150724-gijmlz.html |first=Nicole |last=Hasham |date=24 July 2015 |title=Students and staff warn of angry backlash if 'sceptical environmentalist' Bjorn Lomborg sets up research centre at Flinders University |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing his lack of scientific credibility, his lack of academic legitimacy and the political nature of the process of establishing the Centre with the Abbott federal government. The [[Australian Youth Climate Coalition]] and [[350.org]] launched a national campaign to support staff and students in their rejection of Lomborg.&lt;ref name=&quot;aycc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aycc.org.au/bjorn_free |title=Open Letter to Flinders Uni - Keep Us Bjorn-Free |website=Australian Youth Climate Coalition |accessdate=12 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229101704/http://www.aycc.org.au/bjorn_free |archive-date=29 February 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 2015, education minister [[Simon Birmingham]] told a senate committee the offered funding had been withdrawn.&lt;ref name=aaas-no-funds&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dayton |first1=Leigh |title=Climate-change contrarian loses Australian funding |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/10/climate-change-doubter-loses-australian-funding |website=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |accessdate=25 October 2015 |date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently unclear whether the Australian Government would honour its original commitment and transfer the funds directly to the Centre to cover the costs incurred, in particular given Lomborg's unique expertise and contribution.

Several of Bjørn Lomborg's articles in newspapers such as [[The Wall Street Journal]] and [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] have been checked by [[Climate Feedback]], a worldwide network of scientists who collectively assess the credibility of influential climate change media coverage. The Climate Feedback reviewers assessed that the scientific credibility ranged between &quot;low&quot; and &quot;very low&quot;. The Climate Feedback reviewers come to the conclusion that in one case Lomborg &quot;practices cherry-picking&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/wall-street-journal-bjorn-lomborg-alarming-thing-climate-alarmism/ |title=Analysis of &quot;The Alarming Thing About Climate Alarmism&quot; |date=10 February 2015 |website=climatefeedback.org |accessdate=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a second case he &quot;had reached his conclusions through cherry-picking from a small subset of the evidence, misrepresenting the results of existing studies, and relying on flawed reasoning&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/bjorn-lomborg-overheated-climate-alarm-wall-street-journal/ |title=Analysis of &quot;An Overheated Climate Alarm&quot; |date=11 April 2016 |website=climatefeedback.org |accessdate=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a third case &quot;[his] article [is in] blatant disagreement with available scientific evidence, while the author does not offer adequate evidence to support his statements&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/the-telegraph-bjorn-lomborg-in-many-ways-global-warming-will-be-good-thing/ |title=Analysis of &quot;…in many ways global warming will be a good thing&quot; |date=9 May 2016 |website=climatefeedback.org |accessdate=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in a fourth case, &quot;The author, Bjorn Lomborg, cherry-picks this specific piece of research and uses it in support of a broad argument against the value of climate policy. He also misrepresents the Paris Agreement to downplay its potential to curb future climate change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://climatefeedback.org/evaluation/sea-level-rise-those-non-disappearing-pacific-islands-bjorn-lomborg-wall-street-journal/ |title=Analysis of &quot;About Those Non-Disappearing Pacific Islands&quot; |date=17 October 2016 |website=climatefeedback.org |accessdate=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' ==
{{main|The Skeptical Environmentalist}}
In 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.

In the chapter on climate change in ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', he states: &quot;This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lomborg |first=Bjørn |authorlink=Bjørn Lomborg |title=The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World |url=https://archive.org/details/skepticalenviron00lomb_0|url-access=registration |year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/skepticalenviron00lomb_0/page/259 259]|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0521010683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cost–benefit analyses]], calculated by the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], ranked climate mitigation initiatives lowest on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/2004copenhagen_consensus_result_final.pdf |title=Copenhagen Consensus: The Results |website=Copenhagen Consensus Center |accessdate=21 November 2014}} &quot;Optimal carbon tax,&quot; &quot;The Kyoto Protocol,&quot; and &quot;Value-at-risk carbon tax&quot; ranked 15, 16, and 17 on a ranked list of 17 evaluated projects, with a collective Project Rating of Bad.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview with the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: &quot;Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Elmhirst |first=Sophie |date=24 September 2010 |title=The NS Interview: Bjørn Lomborg |journal=New Statesman |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2010/09/interview-gay-climate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formal accusations of scientific dishonesty ===
After the publication of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', Lomborg was formally accused of scientific dishonesty by a group of environmental scientists, who brought a total of three complaints against him to the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] (DCSD), a body under Denmark's [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (MSTI). Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a &quot;debate&quot; publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;icg2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1343527.html |title=The 'Lomborg case' on sustainable development and scientific dishonesty |website=International Geological Congress |date=2008 |accessdate=23 November 2014 |last=Hansen |first=Jens Morten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges claimed that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

In January 2003, the DCSD released a ruling that sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of scientific facts, but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fivu.dk/en/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-the-danish-committees-on-scientific-dishonesty |title=2003 Annual Report |website=The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty |access-date=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=icg2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3340305.stm |title=Lomborg celebrates ministry ruling |website=[[BBC News]] |date=22 December 2003 |accessdate=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a [[petition]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm |title=Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed |trans-title=Signature collection in protest against the decision by Bjørn Lomborg from - The Committees on Scientific Dishonesty |website=Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen |language=da |access-date=28 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030117223212/http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm |archive-date=17 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by 287 Danish academics, primarily social scientists, who criticised the DCSD for evaluating the book as a work of science, whereas the petitioners considered it clearly an opinion piece by a non-scientist.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Social scientists call for abolition of dishonesty committee |first=Alison |last=Abbott |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=421 |issue=6924 |pages=681 |date=13 February 2003 |doi=10.1038/421681b|pmid=12610589 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE50446/kun-faa-ingenioerer-stoetter-lomborg/ |title=Kun få ingeniører støtter Lomborg |trans-title=Few engineers support Lomborg |first1=Jesper |last1=Tornbjerg |first2=Morten |last2=Jastrup |first3=Marcus |last3=Rubin |newspaper=[[Politiken]] |date=17 January 2003 |language=da |accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2003/annual-report-2002-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty |title=2002 Annual Report |website=The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty |accessdate=13 February 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071025142432/http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2003/annual-report-2002-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty |archive-date=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and [[natural science]]s community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD/&gt;

=== Recognition ===
The alumni network of the [[Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership]] (CPSL) voted ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Visser |first1=Wayne |title=The Top 50 Sustainability Books |year=2009 |publisher=Greenleaf Publishing |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-1-906093-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued debate and criticism ===
The rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003–2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.

''The Lomborg Deception'', a book by [[Howard Friel]], claims to offer a &quot;careful analysis&quot; of the ways in which Lomborg has &quot;selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence&quot;,&lt;ref name=pk&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/328/5983/1230-a.pdf |title=The Climate Change Debates |last=Kitcher |first=Philip |website=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=328 |date=4 June 2010 |pages=1230–1234 |access-date=10 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/233942 |title=Book Review: The Lomborg Deception |magazine=[[Newsweek]] |date=22 February 2010 |accessdate=23 February 2010 |first=Sharon |last=Begley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lomborg has denied these claims in a 27-page argument-by-argument response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/118-file/BL%20reply%20to%20Howard%20Friel.pdf?PHPSESSID=472777bb754a1c0c02d803620257a62a |title=A Response by Bjorn Lomborg to Howard Friel's 'The Lomborg Deception' |last=Lomborg |first=Bjørn |work=Lomborg.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111016162230/http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/118-file/BL%20reply%20to%20Howard%20Friel.pdf |archive-date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friel has written a reply to this response, in which he admits two errors, but otherwise in general rejects Lomborg's arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/HFResponseToLomborgFeb262010.pdf |title=Response by Howard Friel to Bjørn Lomborg's comments about The Lomborg Deception |date=26 February 2010 |website=Yale Press |accessdate=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412024906/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/HFResponseToLomborgFeb262010.pdf |archive-date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arthur Rörsch, Thomas Frello, Ray Soper and Adriaan De Lange published an article in 2005 in the ''[[Journal of Information Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250207154 |title=On the Opposition Against the Book The Skeptical Environmentalist by B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |number=1 |pages=16–28 |date=March 2005 |via=ResearchGate |accessdate=10 June 2019|doi=10.3172/JIE.14.1.16 |last1=Rörsch |first1=Arthur |last2=Frello |first2=Thomas |last3=Soper |first3=Ray |last4=De Lange |first4=Adriaan }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused its authority to suppress Lomborg.

The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of ''Journal of Information Ethics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fog |first=K. |title=The real nature of the opposition against B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=66–76 |date=September 2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.2.66}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called &quot;the [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] hypothesis&quot;, which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition. Fog and other scientists have continued to criticize Lomborg for what one called &quot;a history of misrepresenting&quot; climate science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/ |last=Fog |first=K. |title=Lomborg Errors |website=Lomborg-errors.dk |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2015 |last=Rahmstorf |first=Stefan |title=Bjørn Lomborg, just a scientist with a different opinion? |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=18727 |website=RealClimate.org |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the government of Australia offered the University of Western Australia $4&amp;nbsp;million to establish a &quot;consensus centre&quot; with Lomborg as director. The university accepted the offer, setting off a firestorm of opposition from its faculty and students and from climate scientists around the world. In April 2015 the university reversed the decision and rejected the offer. The government continued to seek a sponsor for the proposed institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=4 June 2015 |last=Knott |first=M. |title=Bjorn Lomborg saga: Senate estimates hears 'consensus centre' could still come to Australia |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bjorn-lomborg-saga-senate-estimates-hears-consensus-centre-could-still-come-to-australia-20150604-ghgd75.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October 2015 the offered funding was withdrawn.&lt;ref name=aaas-no-funds/&gt; (For further details see the &quot;Copenhagen Consensus&quot; sub-section of the &quot;[[#Copenhagen Consensus|Career]]&quot; section, above.)

Lomborg's approach evolved in directions more compatible with action to restrain climate change. In April 2015 he gained further attention when he issued a call for all subsidies to be removed from fossil fuels on the basis that &quot;a disproportionate share of the subsidies goes to the middle class and the rich&quot;...making fossil fuel so &quot;inexpensive that consumption increases, thus exacerbating global warming&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;theglobeandmail&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/its-time-to-stop-subsidizing-fossil-fuels/article24002168/ |title=It's time to stop subsidizing fossil fuels |first=Bjorn |last=Lomborg |date=17 April 2015 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=12 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In publications such as the ''Wall Street Journal'' he argued that the most productive use of resources would be a massive increase in funding for research to make renewable energy economically competitive with fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lomborg |first1=Bjorn |title=The Charade of the Paris Treaty |work=The Wall Street Journal Review |date=17–18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussions in the media ==
After the release of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the [[News media|media]], where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international [[mass media]]. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and [[Publishing|print media]] around the world. He is also a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2005.
* ''[[Scientific American]]'' published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own [[website]], quoting the article at such length that ''Scientific American'' threatened to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in PDF format on ''Scientific American''{{'}}s site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF |title=Bjørn Lomborg's comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA) |date=16 February 2002 |website=Scientific American |access-date=26 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine also printed a response to the rebuttal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00040A72-A95C-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF |title=A Response to Lomborg's Rebuttal |last=Rennie |first=John |date=15 April 2002 |magazine=Scientific American |access-date=26 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Economist]]'' defended Lomborg, claiming the panel of experts that had criticised Lomborg in ''Scientific American'' was both biased and did not actually counter Lomborg's book. ''The Economist'' argued that the panel's opinion had come under no scrutiny at all, and that Lomborg's responses had not been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1522706 |title=Thought control |date=9 January 2003 |magazine=The Economist |access-date=26 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''&amp;nbsp;— the U.S. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television programme featured an episode entitled &quot;Environmental Hysteria&quot; in which Lomborg criticised what he claimed was environmentalists' refusal to accept a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of environmental questions, and stressed the need to prioritise some issues above others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/topics.do?topic=eh |title=Bullshit: Environmental Hysteria |website=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] |access-date=3 June 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622081241/http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/topics.do?topic=eh |archive-date=22 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' stated, &quot;Lomborg pulls off the remarkable feat of welding the techno-optimism of the Internet age with a lefty's concern for the fate of the planet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lomborg.com/files/lombquo.doc |title=Early Praise for The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World |website=Cambridge University Press |access-date=26 February 2006 |via=lomborg.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221051355/http://www.lomborg.com/files/lombquo.doc |archive-date=21 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] strongly criticised ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', claiming it to be &quot;seriously flawed and failing to meet basic standards of credible scientific analysis&quot;, accusing Lomborg of presenting data in a fraudulent way, using flawed logic and selectively citing non-peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/solutions/fight-misinformation/ucs-examines-the-skeptical.html |title=UCS Examines 'The Skeptical Environmentalist' |website=Union of Concerned Scientists |accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was conducted by [[Peter Gleick]], [[Jerry D.
