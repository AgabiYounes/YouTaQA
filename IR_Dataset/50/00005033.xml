'''Ellas McDaniel''' (born '''Ellas Otha Bates'''; December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), known as '''Bo Diddley''', was an American singer, guitarist, songwriter and music producer who played a key role in the transition from the [[blues]] to [[rock and roll]]. He influenced many artists, including [[Buddy Holly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2007/03/20/7496086/bo-diddleys-unique-rhythm-continues-to-inspire|title=Bo Diddley's Unique Rhythm Continues to Inspire|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elvis Presley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Fox |first= Ted |title= Showtime at the Apollo |publisher= Da Capo |year= 1983 |isbn= 978-0-306-80503-5 |pages=5 &amp; 92 |quote=Elvis Presley, a young, still raw hayseed, was making his first trip to the Big Apple to see his new record company, and the Apollo was where he wanted to be. Night after night in New York he sat in the Apollo transfixed by the pounding rhythms, the dancing and prancing, the sexual spectacle of rhythm-and-blues masters like Bo Diddley.&amp;nbsp;... In 1955, Elvis's stage presence was still rudimentary. But watching Bo Diddley charge up the Apollo crowd undoubtedly had a profound effect on him. When he returned to New York a few months later for his first national television appearance, on Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey's &quot;Stage Show,&quot; he again spent hours at the Apollo after rehearsals. On the Dorsey show Elvis shocked the entire country with his outrageous hip-shaking performance, and the furor that followed made him an American sensation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The Beatles|Beatles]], the [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]],&lt;ref name=&quot;independent_bo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=Bo Diddley, Guitarist Who Inspired the Beatles and the Stones, Dies Aged 79|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bo-diddley-guitarist-who-inspired-the-beatles-and-the-stones-dies-aged-79-838868.html|accessdate=April 26, 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Animals]], and [[the Clash]].&lt;ref name= &quot;influences&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Partridge |first=Kenneth |url= https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/04/how-the-clash-can-lead-to-a-great-record-collection/ |title=How The Clash Can Lead to a Great Record Collection |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=April 11, 2017 |accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life ===
Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], as Ellas Otha Bates,&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give his name as Otha Ellas Bates.&lt;/ref&gt; he was adopted and raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, whose surname he assumed. In 1934, the McDaniel family moved to the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of Chicago, where he dropped the Otha and became Ellas McDaniel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodiddley.com/history.html|title=Bo Diddley -History|website=Bodiddley.com|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an active member of Chicago's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he studied the [[trombone]] and the violin, becoming so proficient on the violin that the musical director invited him to join the orchestra. He performed until he was 18. However, he was more interested in the pulsating, rhythmic music he heard at a local [[Pentecostal Church]] and took up the guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2066171/Bo-Diddley.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Bo Diddley, who has died aged 79, was one of the most important influences in the development of popular music, even though for much of his career he was seldom in the charts or in the recording studio. | date=June 2, 2008 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsimon.com/diddley.htm |title=Bo Diddley Page |publisher=Tsimon.com |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by a performance by [[John Lee Hooker]],&lt;ref name='Rock Hall'/&gt; he supplemented his income as a carpenter and mechanic by [[busking|playing on street corners]] with friends, including Jerome Green (c. 1934–1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/jerome.html |title=Jerome Green |publisher=Members.tripod.com |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Hipsters band, later renamed the Langley Avenue Jive Cats. Green became a near-constant member of McDaniel's backing band, the two often trading joking insults with each other during live shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoundsShow&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= The R&amp;B Show |first= Martin |last= Hayman |newspaper=[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] |publisher= Spotlight Publications |date= August 28, 1971|page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2013}} During the summers of 1943 and 1944, he played at the [[Maxwell Street]] market in a band with [[Earl Hooker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cowdery.home.netcom.com/maxwell/bo.html |title=1997 Interview |publisher=Cowdery.home.netcom.com |accessdate=April 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714164701/http://cowdery.home.netcom.com/maxwell/bo.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1951 he was playing on the street with backing from Roosevelt Jackson on [[washtub bass]] and [[Jody Williams (blues musician)|Jody Williams]], whom he had taught to play the guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahl, Bill 2002&quot;&gt;Dahl, Bill (2002). CD liner notes. &quot;Jody Williams, ''Return of a Legend''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/musicians.html |title=Bo Diddley – The Originator |publisher=Members.tripod.com |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams later played lead guitar on &quot;[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]&quot; (1956).&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahl, Bill 2002&quot;/&gt;

In 1951, he landed a regular spot at the 708 Club, on Chicago's South Side,&lt;ref name=&quot;SoundsShow&quot;/&gt; with a repertoire influenced by [[Louis Jordan]], John Lee Hooker, and [[Muddy Waters]]. In late 1954, he teamed up with the harmonica player [[Billy Boy Arnold]], the drummer Clifton James and the [[Bassist|bass player]] Roosevelt Jackson and recorded [[Demo (music)|demos]] of &quot;[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm a Man]]&quot; and &quot;[[Bo Diddley (song)|Bo Diddley]]&quot;. They re-recorded the songs at [[Chess Records|Chess Studios]], with a backing [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] comprising [[Otis Spann]] (piano), [[Lester Davenport]] (harmonica), Frank Kirkland (drums), and Jerome Green (maracas). The record was released in March 1955, and the [[A-side and B-side|A-side]], &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, became a number one R&amp;B hit.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Jacqueline (2013).

===Origins of stage name===
The origin of the stage name Bo Diddley is unclear. McDaniel claimed that his peers gave him the name, which he suspected was an insult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19748/m1/ |title=Show 3 – The Tribal Drum: The Rise of Rhythm and Blues. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library  |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the name first belonged to a singer his adoptive mother knew. Harmonicist [[Billy Boy Arnold]] said that it was a local comedian's name, which [[Leonard Chess]] adopted as McDaniel's stage name and the title of his first single. McDaniel also stated that his school classmates in Chicago gave him the nickname, which he started using when sparring and boxing in the neighborhood with The Little Neighborhood Golden Gloves Bunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject=Bo Diddley |subject-link=Bo Diddley |interviewer=Arlene R.

===Success in the 1950s and 1960s===
On November 20, 1955, Diddley appeared on the popular television program ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. When someone on the show's staff overheard him casually singing &quot;[[Sixteen Tons]]&quot; in the dressing room, he was asked to perform the song on the show. Seeing &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; on the cue card, he thought he was to perform both [[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|his self-titled hit single]] and &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Austen, Jake (2005).

Chicago Review Press. pp. 14, 15. {{ISBN|1-55652-572-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55652-572-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan was furious and banned Diddley from his show, reputedly saying that he wouldn't last six months. Chess Records included Diddley's cover of &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; on the 1960 album ''[[Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001XAQSW#moreAboutThisProduct |title=Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger: Bo Diddley: Music |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dustygroove.com/item.php?id=sx6fryfrvp&amp;ref=browse.php&amp;refQ=cat%3D11%26amp%3Bpage%3D5 |title=Dusty Groove – Bo Diddley: Bo Diddley Is A Gunslinger |publisher=[[Dusty Groove]]|accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diddley's hit singles continued in the 1950s and 1960s: &quot;[[Pretty Thing]]&quot; (1956), &quot;[[Say Man]]&quot; (1959), and &quot;[[You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover]]&quot; (1962). He also released numerous albums, including ''Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger'' and ''Have Guitar, Will Travel''. These bolstered his self-invented legend.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoundsShow&quot;/&gt; Between 1958 and 1963, [[Checker Records]] released eleven full-length Bo Diddley albums. In the 1960s he broke through as a crossover artist with white audiences (appearing at the [[Alan Freed]] concerts, for example),&lt;ref name=&quot;SoundsShow&quot;/&gt; but he rarely aimed his compositions at teenagers. The album title ''Surfing with Bo Diddley'' derived from his influence on [[surf music|surf]] guitarists rather than surfing per se.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In 1963, Diddley starred in a UK concert tour with the [[Everly Brothers]] and [[Little Richard]] along with the Rolling Stones (an unknown band at that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fe62DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=Bo+diddley+1963#v=onepage&amp;q=Bo%20diddley%201963&amp;f=false|title=Symphony and Song: The Intersection of Words and Music|last=Kennedy|first=Victor|last2=Gadpaille|first2=Michelle|date=December 14, 2016|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443857338|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote many songs for himself and also for others.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bo-diddley/biography|title=Bo Diddley Biography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=September 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956 he and guitarist Jody Williams co-wrote the pop song &quot;[[Love Is Strange]]&quot;, a hit for [[Mickey &amp; Sylvia]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Blakey |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Originator_2/career50s.html |title=Bo Diddley – The Originator |publisher=Members.tripod.com |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote &quot;Mama (Can I Go Out)&quot;, which was a minor hit for the pioneering rockabilly singer [[Jo Ann Campbell]], who performed the song in the 1959 rock and roll film ''[[Go Johnny Go]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

After moving from Chicago to Washington, D.C., the basement of his home at 2614 Rhode Island Avenue NE, housed his first [[home recording]] studio. Diddley's home studio was frequented by several of Washington, D.C.'s musical luminaries and the site where he recorded the commercially released album ''Bo Diddley Is a Gunslinger''. Diddley also produced and recorded [[Marvin Gaye]] (his valet), a member of the local Doo Wop group, the Marquees. Diddley co-wrote the Marquees' first single featuring Gaye titled &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;. It was released on [[Okeh Records]], after the Chess brothers turned it down. During this time, [[Moonglows]]' founder [[Harvey Fuqua]] sang backing vocals on many of Diddley's home recordings. Gaye later joined the Moonglows and followed them to Motown.&lt;ref name='Rock Hall'/&gt;

Diddley included women in his band: [[Norma-Jean Wofford]], also known as The Duchess; Gloria Jolivet; [[Peggy Jones (musician)|Peggy Jones]], also known as Lady Bo, a lead guitarist (rare for a woman at that time); Cornelia Redmond, also known as Cookie V; Debby Hastings, who led his band after guitarist Jim Satten resigned.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Over the decades, Diddley's performing venues ranged from intimate clubs to stadiums. On March 25, 1972, he played with the [[Grateful Dead]] at the [[Academy of Music (New York City)|Academy of Music]] in New York City. The Grateful Dead released part of this concert as [[Dick's Picks Volume 30|Volume 30]] of the band's concert album series, ''[[Dick's Picks]]''. Also in the early 1970s, the soundtrack of the ground-breaking animated film ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz the Cat]]'' contained his song &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, in which a crow idly [[Fingerstyle guitar|finger-pops]] to the track.

Diddley spent some years in [[New Mexico]], living in [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] from 1971 to 1978, while continuing his musical career. He served for two and a half years as a deputy sheriff in the [[Valencia County, New Mexico|Valencia County]] Citizens' Patrol; during that time he purchased and donated three highway-patrol pursuit cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;nmmc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newmexicomusic.org/noteable.php?select=5|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815163720/http://www.newmexicomusic.org/noteable.php?select=5|url-status=dead|title=Bo Diddley|archivedate=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, he left Los Lunas and moved to [[Hawthorne, Florida]], where he lived on a large estate in a custom-made log cabin, which he helped to build. For the remainder of his life he divided his time between [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and Florida, living the last 13 years of his life in [[Archer, Florida]], a small farming town near [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]].
  
In 1979, he appeared as an opening act for [[The Clash]] on their US tour.

In 1983, he starred as a Philadelphia pawn shop owner in the comedy film ''[[Trading Places]]''.

In ''Legends of Guitar'' (filmed live in Spain in 1991), with [[B.B. King]], [[Les Paul]], [[Albert Collins]], and [[George Benson]], among others. He joined the Rolling Stones on their 1994 concert broadcast of ''[[Voodoo Lounge]]'', performing &quot;[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]&quot;.

Diddley performed a number of shows around the country in 2005 and 2006 with fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer [[Johnnie Johnson (musician)|Johnnie Johnson]] and his band, consisting of Johnson on keyboards, Richard Hunt on drums and Gus Thornton on bass. In 2006, he participated as the headliner of a [[grassroots]]-organized fundraiser concert to benefit the town of [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], which had been devastated by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The &quot;Florida Keys for Katrina Relief&quot; had originally been set for October 23, 2005, when [[Hurricane Wilma]] barreled through the [[Florida Keys]] on October 24, causing flooding and economic mayhem.

In January 2006, the Florida Keys had recovered enough to host the fundraising concert to benefit the more hard-hit community of Ocean Springs. When asked about the fundraiser, Diddley stated, &quot;This is the United States of America. We believe in helping one another&quot;. The all-star band formed by Charlie Tona, a long-time close personal friend of Bo Diddley, included members of the Soul Providers, and famed artists Clarence Clemons of the E Street Band, Joey Covington of Jefferson Airplane, Alfonso Carey of The Village People, and Carl Spagnuolo of Jay &amp; The Techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com/KatrinaRelief/organizers_and_volunteers.htm|title=Organizers and Volunteers|website=Floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com/musical_performers.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929222848/http://www.floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com/musical_performers.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 29, 2007 |title=Musical Performers |publisher=Floridakeysforkatrinarelief.com |date=January 8, 2006 |accessdate=February 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Holger Petersen, on ''[[Saturday Night Blues]]'' on [[CBC Radio]] in the fall of 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/snb/latestshow.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928074108/http://www.cbc.ca/snb/latestshow.html |date=September 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented on racism in the music industry establishment during his early career, which deprived him of [[royalties]] from the most successful part of his career.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

His final guitar performance on a studio album was with the [[New York Dolls]] on their 2006 album ''[[One Day It Will Please Us to Remember Even This]]''. He contributed guitar work to the song &quot;Seventeen&quot;, which was included as a bonus track on the limited-edition version of the disc.

In 1989, Diddley entered into a licensing agreement with the sportswear brand [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. The Wieden &amp; Kennedy produced commercial in the &quot;[[Bo Knows]]&quot; campaign, teamed Diddley with dual sportsman [[Bo Jackson]], and resulted in one of the most iconic advertisements in advertising history. The agreement ended in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richlabonte.net/exonews/xtra4/diddley_sues.htm |title=Diddley Sues Nike For Using His Image |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614163231/http://richlabonte.net/exonews/xtra4/diddley_sues.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1999, a T-shirt of Diddley's image and &quot;You don't know diddley&quot; slogan was purchased in a Gainesville, Florida sports apparel store. Diddley felt that Nike should not continue to use the slogan or his likeness and fought Nike over the copyright infringement. Despite the fact that lawyers for both parties could not come to a renewed legal arrangement, Nike allegedly continued marketing the apparel and ignored cease-and-desist orders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,617695,00.html |title=Bo Diddley Sues Nike|website=People}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a lawsuit was filed on Diddley's behalf, in Manhattan Federal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/bo-sues-nike-diddly-article-1.873023 |title=Bo Sues Nike, Says He Got Diddly|website=Daily News|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he released ''A Man Amongst Men'', his first major label album with guest artists like Keith Richards, Ron Wood and the Shirelles. The album earned a Grammy Award nomination in 1997 for the Best Contemporary Blues Album category.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

This marked his achievements and noted that he was &quot;acclaimed as a founder of rock-and-roll.&quot; He was not supposed to perform, but as he listened to the music of local musician Jesse Robinson, who sang a song written for this occasion, Robinson sensed that Diddley wanted to perform and handed him a microphone, the only time that he performed publicly after his stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlbt.com/Global/story.asp?S=7305146&amp;nav=menu119_3 |title= Bo Diddley Honored in Hometown |publisher=Wlbt.com |date=January 1, 2010 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 2007, Diddley was admitted to [[intensive care]] in [[Creighton University Medical Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], following a stroke after a concert the previous day in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; Starting the show, he had complained that he did not feel well. He referred to smoke from the wildfires that were ravaging south Georgia and blowing south to the area near his home in Archer, Florida. The next day, as he was heading back home, he seemed dazed and confused at the airport; 911 and airport security were called, and he was immediately taken by ambulance to Creighton University Medical Center where he stayed for several days. After tests, it was confirmed that he had suffered a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news|title=Breaking Celeb News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip|website=E!

His funeral, a four-hour &quot;homegoing&quot; service, took place on June 7, 2008, at Showers of Blessings Church in Gainesville, Florida, and kept in tune with the vibrant spirit of Bo Diddley's life and career.

== Beat ==
{{Main|Bo Diddley beat}}
The &quot;Bo Diddley beat&quot; is essentially the [[clave rhythm]], one of the most common [[bell pattern]]s found in [[sub-Saharan African music traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa, David (2010: 244). ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins''. Redway, California: Bembe. {{ISBN|1-886502-80-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 1944–55, including two by [[Johnny Otis]] from 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Tamlyn, Garry Neville (1998). ''The Big Beat: Origins and Development of Snare Backbeat and Other Accompanimental Rhythms in Rock 'n' Roll''. PhD thesis. Table 4.16. page 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bo Diddley gave different accounts of how he began to use this rhythm. Sublette asserts, &quot;In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], 'Bo Diddley' has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'Rhumba' on the track sheets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sublette, Ned (2007: 83). &quot;The Kingsmen and the Cha-cha-chá.&quot; Ed. Eric Weisbard. ''Listen Again: A Momentary History of Pop Music''. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0822340410}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bo Diddley beat is similar to &quot;[[Juba dance|hambone]]&quot;, a style used by street performers who play out the beat by slapping and patting their arms, legs, chest, and cheeks while chanting rhymes.&lt;ref&gt;Roscetti, Ed (2008). ''Stuff! Good Drummers Should Know''. Hal Leonard Corporation. p. 16. {{ISBN|1-4234-2848-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat resembling the [[Shave and a Haircut|&quot;shave and a haircut, two bits&quot;]] rhythm, Diddley came across it while trying to play [[Gene Autry]]'s &quot;(I've Got Spurs That) [[Jingle, Jangle, Jingle]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/298/Blues+Reflections:+2003 |title=Blues Reflections |publisher=Afropop.org |date=April 3, 1970 |accessdate=February 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605102906/http://www.afropop.org/multi/feature/ID/298/Blues+Reflections:+2003 |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years before his &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, a song with similar syncopation &quot;Hambone&quot;, was cut by the [[Red Saunders (musician)|Red Saunders]] Orchestra with the Hambone Kids. In 1944, &quot;[[Rum and Coca Cola]]&quot;, containing the Bo Diddley beat, was recorded by the [[the Andrews Sisters|Andrews Sisters]]. [[Buddy Holly]]'s &quot;[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]&quot; (1957) and [[Them (band)|Them's]] &quot;[[Mystic Eyes]]&quot; (1965) used the beat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sixties&quot;&gt;Hicks, Michaël (2000). ''Sixties Rock'', p.36. {{ISBN|978-0-252-06915-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bo Diddley beat.png|thumb|280px|right|&quot;Bo Diddley beat&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sixties&quot; /&gt;/[[Son clave]] {{audio|Bo Diddley beat.mid|Play}}.]] In its simplest form, the Bo Diddley beat can be counted out as either a one-bar or a two-bar phrase. Here is the count as a one-bar phrase: '''One''' e and '''ah''', two e '''and''' ah, three e '''and''' ah, '''four''' e and ah (the boldface counts are the [[Clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm).

Many songs (for example, &quot;[[Hey Bo Diddley]]&quot; and &quot;[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]&quot;) often have no [[chord (music)|chord]] changes; that is, the musicians play the same chord throughout the piece, so that the rhythms create the excitement, rather than having the excitement generated by harmonic [[tension (music)|tension and release]]. In his other recordings, Bo Diddley used various rhythms, from straight [[beat (music)|back beat]] to [[Popular music|pop]] [[ballad]] style to [[doo-wop]], frequently with maracas by Jerome Green.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

An influential guitar player, Bo Diddley developed many special effects and other innovations in tone and attack, particularly the resonant &quot;shimmering&quot; sound. His trademark instrument was his self-designed, one-of-a-kind, rectangular-bodied &quot;Twang Machine&quot; (referred to as &quot;cigar-box shaped&quot; by music promoter [[Dick Clark]]) built by [[Gretsch]]. He had other uniquely shaped guitars custom-made for him by other manufacturers throughout the years, most notably the &quot;Cadillac&quot; and the rectangular &quot;Turbo 5-speed&quot; (with built-in envelope filter, flanger and delay) designs made by Tom Holmes (who also made guitars for ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons, among others). In a 2005 interview on [[Triple J|JJJ]] radio in Australia, he implied that the rectangular design sprang from an embarrassing moment. During an early gig, while jumping around on stage with a [[Gibson L5]] guitar, he landed awkwardly, hurting his groin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3 |title=Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=March 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624195337/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/boone_m1035862.mp3 |archive-date=June 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3 |title=Mp3 file : Jay and the Doctor |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=March 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624195333/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jayandthedoctor/listen/bodidleytw_m1035870.mp3 |archive-date=June 24, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went about designing a smaller, less restrictive guitar that allowed him to keep jumping around on stage while still playing his guitar. He also played the violin, which is featured on his mournful [[instrumental rock|instrumental]] &quot;The Clock Strikes Twelve&quot;, a [[twelve-bar blues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/buyersguides/gr/diddleymasters.htm |title=Bo Diddley – I'm a Man: The Chess Masters, 1955–1958 – CD review |publisher=Oldies.about.com |date=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=February 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He often created lyrics as witty and humorous adaptations of [[folk music]] themes. The song &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; was based on the African-American clapping rhyme &quot;[[Juba dance|Hambone]]&quot; (which in turn was based on the [[lullaby]] &quot;[[Hush Little Baby]]&quot;). Likewise, &quot;Hey Bo Diddley&quot; is based on the song &quot;[[Old MacDonald]]&quot;. The song &quot;Who Do You Love?&quot; with its [[roots of hip hop|rap]]-style boasting, and his use of the African-American game known as &quot;[[the dozens]]&quot; on the songs &quot;Say Man&quot; and &quot;Say Man, Back Again,&quot; are cited as progenitors of hip-hop music (for example, &quot;You got the nerve to call somebody ugly. Why, you so ugly, the stork that brought you into the world ought to be arrested&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Say Man&quot; (McDaniels) 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Influence on US Military Culture: 
The Army and other US ground forces often use 'Jodies' marching cadences in a 'call-and-answer' arrangement to relieve boredom of long marches during training and in the field. The platoon Sergeant typically shouts or sings the call and troops repeat in answer, all in the characteristic 120 beat per minute pace. Troops had been chanting cadences for decades before, but it became prevalent in the years after Korea, extending to today.

One can't say if the musician received inspiration for his greatest hit from the Army, or vice-versa, but the 'Bo Diddley' format dominates 'Jodies' cadences, with clever rhymed couplets, to the traditional &quot;Hambone&quot; tune, noted above.
