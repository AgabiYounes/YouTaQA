The '''Brisbane Broncos Rugby League Football Club Ltd.''', commonly referred to as the '''Broncos''', are an Australian professional [[rugby league]] football club based in the city of [[Brisbane]], the capital of the state of [[Queensland]]. Founded in April 1988, the Broncos play in Australia's elite competition, the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership. They have won six premierships, including two NSWRL titles, a Super League premiership and three NRL premierships. They also have two [[World Club Challenge]]s. The Broncos have achieved four [[minor premiership]]s during their 29 years in multiple competitions, making them Rugby League's most successful club over the past three decades. Until 2015, Brisbane had never been defeated in a [[grand final]], and since 1991, have only failed to qualify for the finals twice. They are one of the most successful clubs in the National Rugby League since it began in 1998, winning three premierships (second only to the [[Sydney Roosters]]' four). It is also one of the most successful clubs in the history of rugby league, having won 62.5% of games played since its induction in 1988, second only to Melbourne Storm with 65.2%. Since the club's founding, Brisbane has never received the wooden spoon.

The club records the highest annual revenue of all NRL clubs – $A32.8m for the 2012 financial year – and is one of the most valuable clubs of any code in Australia, worth over $42 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The club was founded in April 1988 as part of the [[Winfield Cup]]'s national expansion, becoming, along with the [[Gold Coast-Tweed Giants]], one of Queensland's first two participants in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]]. The Broncos later became the dominant force in the competition before playing a significant role in the [[Super League War]] of the mid-1990s, then continuing to compete successfully in the newly created National Rugby League competition. The Broncos are based in the Brisbane suburb of [[Red Hill, Queensland|Red Hill]] where their training ground and Leagues club are located, but they play their home games at [[Milton, Queensland|Milton]]'s [[Suncorp Stadium|Lang Park]].  It is the only publicly listed sporting club on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]], trading as Brisbane Broncos Limited ({{asx|BBL}}).

The club's current head coach is former [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] coach, [[Anthony Seibold]], who was the Dally M coach of the year for 2018.

==History==

{{Main|History of the Brisbane Broncos}}
Queensland's success in the 1980s, the early years of the [[State of Origin series]] between [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] and [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]], in addition to the inclusion of a combined [[Brisbane Rugby League]] team in the [[Amco Cup|mid-week competition]], convinced the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] (NSWRL) to invite a Queensland-based team into the competition.&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt; After tough competition between the various syndicates for the Brisbane licence, the [[Queensland Rugby League]] chose the bid of former [[Brisbane Rugby League]] (BRL) players, [[Barry Maranta]] and [[Paul Morgan (rugby league)|Paul &quot;Porky&quot; Morgan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt; At the first meeting with the NSWRL hierarchy, the newly formed Brisbane Broncos were asked to pay a $500,000 fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/broncos/behindthescenes-of-the-brisbane-broncos-entry-into-the-nswrl-30-years-ago/news-story/fab1962393d8f0ae13ff67516df23328|title=NRL Brisbane Broncos 2018: Story behind Broncos entry into NSWRL 30 years ago {{!}} Fox Sports|website=www.foxsports.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Darren Lockyer cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Darren Lockyer]] playing for the Broncos in 2004. Lockyer made his Broncos debut in 1995 and is a former captain of the Brisbane Broncos.]]
The Broncos secured the services of [[Australian Kangaroos]] captain [[Wally Lewis]] and former [[Brisbane Rugby League|BRL]] coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]].&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt; The team made their debut in the NSWRL's [[1988 Winfield Cup]] premiership against reigning premiers, the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]], and defeated them 44–10. However, after this promising start they failed to make the finals. In their [[1989 Brisbane Broncos season|second season]] they won the mid-week knockout competition, the [[1989 Panasonic Cup (rugby league)|1989 Panasonic Cup]]. The club first tasted [[1992 Brisbane Broncos season#Grand final|premiership success in 1992]], and [[1993 Brisbane Broncos season#Grand final|again in 1993]], defeating the [[St. George Dragons]] in both years at [[Sydney Football Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Pramberg, Bernie | author2=Malone, Paul | author3=Colman, Mike | author4=Dick, Barry | last-author-amp=yes| title= Broncos: 20 Fabulous Years | publisher={{sic|Play|right|hide=y}} Publishing Pty Ltd. | year=2007| isbn=0-9775226-4-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, in order to increase in the Winfield Cup, [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] controversially sacked [[Wally Lewis]] as the Broncos' captain and inserted [[Gene Miles]] into the job. Once [[Gene Miles]] retired, Wayne thought he could lessen the reliance on [[Wally Lewis]], who he said was not a good club man or a good trainer.

In [[Brisbane Broncos 1995|1995]], the [[Super League War]] broke out.  After threats of expulsion from the NSWRL, the Broncos were one of the last clubs to sign with the new league and all players followed suit (The Canberra Raiders, Canterbury Bulldogs and Cronulla Sharks were the first to sign, and it was only revealed many years later that the Broncos were in fact one of the last clubs to sign for either competition).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/League/League-apart/2005/03/25/1111692629384.html League apart – League]. http://www.smh.com.au. Retrieved on 20 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Broncos CEO [[John Ribot]] moved to take over the running of the rebel [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], leading to a perception that the conflict was orchestrated by the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncshistory&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whiticker, Alan  |author2=Collis, Ian  |lastauthoramp=yes | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs| publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd. | year=2004| isbn=1-74110-075-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos History RL1908 | url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Brisbane-Broncos.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020621182544/http://rl1908.com/Clubs/Brisbane-Broncos.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=21 June 2002 | accessdate=6 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brisbane won the only [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|Super League premiership]] in [[Brisbane Broncos 1997|1997]], before winning the first National Rugby League trophy in the re-unified [[Brisbane Broncos 1998|1998]] competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

[[Brisbane Broncos 1999|1999]] was disappointing for the club with a terrible early-season form hindering their attempt at a third consecutive premiership losing 8 of their first 10 matches. Club legend [[Allan Langer]] retired mid-season, perhaps as a result of the team's form. Despite the club's mid-season turnaround, which resulted in qualification for the finals after an 11-match winning streak, the team was eliminated by the [[Cronulla Sharks]] in the first week of the finals.  However, the Broncos' rebounded in 2000 with their fifth premiership, defeating the [[Sydney Roosters]]. The game marked the retirement of veterans [[Kevin Walters]] and [[Michael Hancock (rugby league)|Michael Hancock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt; Not long after the disappointment of the previous year, in 2000, the Broncos rested on the very top of the ladder from round 4.

[[Image:NRL Grand Final 2006.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The 2006 Grand final at [[Stadium Australia]].]]
Queensland Representative, Allan Langer returned to the club in [[Brisbane Broncos 2002|2002]] for one season before eventually retiring. 2002 was also the beginning of Brisbane's &quot;post-Origin slump&quot;, which has haunted the club in the years since. Many players represent [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] in the [[State of Origin series]], with 7 Broncos players on average included in the Queensland Origin team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brisbane Broncos – Representative Players |url=http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?MenuID=330&amp;TopMenuID=266 |accessdate=21 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005101053/http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?MenuID=330&amp;TopMenuID=266 |archivedate=5 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This extra workload has caused a loss of form for the club immediately after the series, evidenced in 2003 when the ladder-leading Broncos lost 10 of their last 11 games.  Despite faring better in [[Brisbane Broncos 2004|2004]] and [[Brisbane Broncos 2005|2005]], the team still struggled in the latter stages of the season, losing all of their finals matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

In [[Brisbane Broncos 2006|2006]], after a strong early and mid-season performance, the Broncos again entered the post-Origin slump, losing 5 consecutive games. However, they reversed this run of form, winning 6 of their last 7 games including the [[2006 NRL Grand Final|premiership decider]] against the [[Melbourne Storm]] and keeping their perfect Grand Final record intact.
&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt; After a dismal 2007 season in which they only scraped into the finals, coach Wayne Bennett announced he would leave at the end of 2008 after twenty-one years as coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Fox Sports|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,23162743-23214,00.html|title=Bennett tells players he's leaving|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Henjak]], a former professional [[rugby league]] footballer who had been assistant coach with the Broncos since the beginning of 2006, was named their second-ever coach, commencing as coach for the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/19/2221586.htm|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|title=Henjak name Broncos coach|date=19 April 2008|accessdate=19 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420115709/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/19/2221586.htm|archive-date=20 April 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2009 season included their worst-ever post-Origin slump, featuring three matches in a row where the opposing team scored more than 40 points, concluding with a 56–0 loss to Canberra on 1 August 2009. They rallied around and in their match against Penrith two rounds later, they won 58–24. This snapback (after Penrith, they won the rest of their games that season) got them into the finals for the 18th year running, but they fell against Melbourne in the 3rd preliminary final by 40–10.

Their 2010 season started moderately: a 30–24 win against North Queensland, a 14–22 loss to Canberra, and a 48–16 hammering by the Warriors on 28 March 2010. On Monday 29 March, former Broncos player and recruitment agent Allan Langer was caught drink-driving in Brisbane's northside.&lt;ref&gt;The Courier-Mail, 30 March 2010 and various other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from a late season 10–6 win against eventual premiers [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|St George Illawarra]], the 2010 season was one to forget; with injuries and poor form seeing the Broncos out of the finals for the first time since 1991. The Broncos missing the finals now means that every club has missed the finals at least once since the 2002 season.

In February 2011, it was announced that [[Ivan Henjak]] was to be sacked from the club, only three weeks before the beginning of the season. [[Anthony Griffin (rugby league)|Anthony Griffin]] took over as coach for the 2011 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/21/3144713.htm|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|title=Broncos sack coack Henjak|date=21 February 2011|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming just the third head coach in the history of the Brisbane Broncos. He led the club to a third-place finish at the end of the season, losing to eventual premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] in the preliminary finals.

2012 marked the Broncos' 25th season in the NRL competition. They finished eighth on the premiership ladder, and were knocked out of the finals in the first week, losing 33–16 to the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in Townsville. 2013 saw the Broncos finish 12th on the NRL ladder, marking its lowest ever finish in the club's history and seeing the club out of the finals for only the second time since 1991.

In what is considered by some commentators to be one of the best Grand Finals in recent history the 2015 NRL Grand Final against the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] went in to [[Golden Point]] overtime for the first time. After a Cowboys try, [[Johnathan Thurston]] had missed a match winning [[Rugby league gameplay|try conversion]] after the 80 minutes, kick off was given to the Broncos, with a promising chance to the Broncos, only resulting in a knock-on by Bronco's Half-Back, Ben Hunt. After the ball spill, the ball was given back to the Cowboys and Johnathan Thurston kicked a field goal 2 minutes into the Golden Point period to win the match for the North Queensland Cowboys 17–16.

In the 2017 NRL season, the Brisbane Broncos highest try-scorer of 2017 is former Gold Coast Titans Centre, James Roberts with 15 tries, 2888 run metres, 4 try-assists and 289 tackles.

In December 2017, the Brisbane Broncos expressed their interest in applying for a licence to participate in the inaugural [[NRL Women's Premiership]] season.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncos-womens-interest&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/new-womens-nrl-excites-jillaroos-but-more-details-are-needed-say-players-20171219-h07llh|title=New women's NRL excites Jillaroos but more details are needed, say players|newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|first=Warren|last=Barnsley|date=20 December 2017|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, the club was granted a license to participate in the inaugural NRL Women's season, starting in August.&lt;ref name=&quot;won-license&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/broncos-win-spot-in-nrl-womens-competition/news-story/60ac789a48db9ab5400c5e1dc390c7d0|title=Broncos win spot in NRL women’s competition|work=news.com.au|first=Rikki-Lee|last=Arnold|date=19 March 2018|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club won the inaugural season of the competition, defeating the [[Sydney Roosters#NRL Women's team|Sydney Roosters]] by 34&amp;ndash;12 in the Grand Final.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRLWpremiers&quot;/&gt;

In the 2018 NRL season, Brisbane finished in 6th place on the table at the end of the regular season. The following week, Brisbane were eliminated from the finals series after being defeated 48-18 by a highly unfancied St George-Illawarra side. The loss was also the final game for retiring Brisbane player [[Sam Thaiday]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/09/08/sea-eagles-skipper-daly-cherry-evans-backs-brisbane-broncos-halves-to-land-first-premiership-since-2006/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://wwos.nine.com.au/nrl/nrl-st-george-illawarra-dragons-upset-brisbane-broncos-in-elimination-final/81ab9e91-2775-4d4d-baab-13f834e65112&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2018 season, Wayne Bennett was sacked as the head coach for making preseason plans with the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] for the following year. The coaching swap between Wayne Bennett and [[Anthony Seibold]] that was planned for 2020 between the Broncos and Rabbitohs happened immediately and Seibold took over.

In the [[2019 NRL season]], Brisbane finished in 8th place on the table at the end of the regular season with 11 wins, 1 draw and 12 losses.  At the beginning of the season, Brisbane endured their worst start to a year since entering the competition in 1988 but won 5 of their last 8 games to qualify for the finals. They played [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] in week one of the finals at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]] and lost the match 58–0, marking the club's worst ever defeat. It was also the biggest finals loss in the history of the competition which eclipsed the previous record set by Newtown when they defeated St George 55–7 in the 1944 finals series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-15/eels-make-history-with-58-point-finals-flogging-of-broncos/11505120/|title=Parramatta Eels eliminate Brisbane Broncos from the NRL Finals with a thumping 58-0 win|website=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/finals/fuming-seibold-fires-off-at-players-promises-review-of-roster-after-embarrassing-loss/news-story/aed1578918d1dbedc4eb33c3904d2b0e/|title=Fuming Seibold fires off at players, promises review of roster after ‘embarrassing’ loss|website=Fox Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/09/15/seibold-top-to-bottom-review-needed-as-broncos-search-for-answers/|title=Seibold: 'Top to bottom' review needed as Brisbane search for answers|website=NRL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/22/brisbane-broncos-post-bennett-blues-still-haunting-anthony-seibold/|title=Brisbane Broncos' post-Bennett blues still haunting Anthony Seibold|website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/09/02/nrl-finals-countdown-best-and-worst-case-scenarios-for-all-teams-in-round-25/|title=Best and worst-case scenarios for all teams in Round 25|website=NRL}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also extended the club's longest ever premiership drought to thirteen seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-09-16/embarrassed-brisbane-broncos-set-to-undertake-nrl-review/11515438|title=Brisbane Broncos left disappointed and embarrassed by record NRL final defeat against Eels|publisher=ABC News ([[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]])|date=16 September 2019|accessdate=18 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emblem and colours ==
It had originally been planned for the Brisbane Broncos to adopt a logo incorporating both a [[kangaroo]] and a stylised &quot;Q&quot; which had been featured in the logo for the Queensland Rugby League for many years. However, with the [[Australian national rugby league team]] also known as the Kangaroos, this was deemed inappropriate and conflicting. The state flower the [[Cooktown Orchid]] and the [[Poinsettia]] which had long been used by Brisbane representative teams in the [[Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)|Bulimba Cup]] and midweek knockout competitions was also ruled out, along with other [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animals]] such as the [[brumby]], [[Phalangeriformes|possum]], [[galah]] and the [[kookaburra]], which was used on Brisbane's Kookaburra Queen [[Paddle steamer|paddleships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broncsteamtobeat&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat | publisher=University of Queensland Press | year=2001 | isbn=0-7022-3275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having wanted to continue with the use of [[alliteration]] for local sporting teams such as the [[Brisbane Bullets]] and [[Brisbane Bears]] (later the [[Brisbane Lions]]), the club's directors eventually decided on the nickname [[Bronco]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncshistory&quot; /&gt; This name was chosen by [[Barry Maranta]] because he was a fan of NFL team, [[Denver Broncos]]. [[The Australian]] newspaper has described the name as &quot;Mystifyingly American&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/the-maleficent-seven-these-are-our-least-lovable-sports-teams/story-fnlpdory-1226850856983&lt;/ref&gt;

The original club logo was first featured in the Broncos' inaugural season in the premiership in 1988 and was used until 1999. It used a mostly gold colour scheme, in line with the predominant colour on the team jerseys. In 2000, the club adopted a new logo with a more maroon design, which was much closer to the traditional colour associated with Queensland rugby league and Queensland sport in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot; /&gt; This design continues to be used to date.

Traditionally, the colours of the Brisbane Broncos have been maroon, white and gold, which have all long been linked to the history of rugby league in Queensland. Initially, the founders of the club favored the official blue and gold colours of [[Brisbane City Council]]. However, Sydney advertiser [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]] advised the board that &quot;Queenslanders had been booing players wearing blue for more than three-quarters of a century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;broncsteamtobeat&quot; /&gt; As a result, the traditional maroon and white colours of Queensland along with gold, symbolizing the Queensland sunshine,
&lt;ref name=&quot;broncsteamtobeat&quot; /&gt; were adopted as the club's colours.

In the inaugural [[1988 Brisbane Broncos season|1988 season]], the club's jersey design featured the top third being gold, the middle being alternating hoops of maroon and white and the bottom third being maroon. Although this design featured gold strongly, it did not please everyone as the jersey had to differentiate from the maroon and white of [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and the maroon of the [[Queensland rugby league team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot; /&gt; Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue was added to the jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favor of a mainly maroon jersey with gold trim.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot; /&gt;

At the 1995 [[Rugby League World Sevens]] tournament, the club introduced a new combination of jersey colours – mauve, aqua and white. Brisbane Broncos Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it &quot;will become our Sevens strip... but we will never change the Broncos' colours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bronco! Magazine Issue 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, following the release of the club's predominantly white with navy-blue and maroon away jersey, the National Rugby League ordered the club to produce a third jersey since the new away jersey clashed with the home jerseys of the [[Penrith Panthers]], Melbourne Storm and [[New Zealand Warriors]]. An aqua strip using the same design as the jerseys used from 1999 to 2001 was worn, which was much derided by the local media. Following two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favor of the design worn against Newcastle in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot; /&gt;

{{Main|Brisbane Broncos Stadiums}}
[[Image:Suncorpstadium071006.JPG|thumb|250px|right|View of the current Brisbane Broncos home ground, [[Suncorp Stadium]].]]
In their first five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at the 52,500 capacity [[Lang Park]] (or more commonly referred to as &quot;Suncorp Stadium&quot; due to sponsorship of Suncorp, Australia), the ground considered to be the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust due to a sponsorship conflict with the QRL having a commercial agreement with [[Castlemaine XXXX]] brewery with prominent signs around the ground, while the Broncos were sponsored by rival brewery Powers who were not permitted any permanent signs (the Broncos initially got around this by not using the change rooms at half time during games, instead sitting on the ground with a temporary protective banner surrounding them which just happened to have prominent Powers logos), the team relocated to the 60,000 capacity [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]] in 1993 (ANZ had been the main stadium of the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot;/&gt; The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's first premiership title in the previous season.&lt;ref name = &quot;broncscrowd&quot;/&gt; However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined and it was not until 2002 that the club again registered more than the 1996 average attendance of 23,712. ANZ Stadium, as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre was called at the time due to sponsorship rights, was featured on [[The Mole (Australia season 3)#Episode 8|an episode of ''The Mole'']] in April 2002.

With the Queensland Government's $280,000,000 redevelopment of Lang Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Suncorp Stadium Land Park Redevelopment |url=http://www.arup.com/australasia/project.cfm?pageid=1354 |accessdate=22 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407144415/http://www.arup.com/australasia/project.cfm?pageid=1354 |archivedate=7 April 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the team moved back to the refurbished and renamed Suncorp Stadium upon its completion in mid-2003. The more centrally-located stadium has begun to attract larger crowds, with the 2006 average attendance of 31,208 being significantly higher than the [[Newcastle Knights]] with 21,848 and about double the regular season competition average of 15,601.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncscrowd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://afltables.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html |accessdate=6 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000300/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html |archivedate=1 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club record attendance for a regular season match is 58,593, set against the St. George Dragons in the final round of the 1993 season. The record attendance for a match at Suncorp Stadium is 50,859 for Darren Lockyer's final home game. Before kick-off at the Stadium an instrumental version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]&quot; is routinely played.

The Broncos all-time home attendance record was set at ANZ Stadium during the [[1997 Super League (Australia) season#Grand final|1997 Super League Grand Final]] when 58,912 saw the Broncos defeat the [[Cronulla Sharks]] 26-8 to claim the only [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] premiership played in Australia.

==Brisbane Broncos Leagues Club==
Located in 98 Fulcher Road, Queensland, Australia (4059), the Brisbane Broncos League is the Broncos training ground and includes a restaurant and buffet. The Brisbane Broncos have also purchased the TAFE (opposite the club) and have recently built a new training field and building. The Broncos' training ground is also used for the [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian Kangaroos]].

The club is located within Gilbert Park and opened in 1988. Wests Juniors Football Club originally called Gilbert Park home, with the small clubhouse beside owned by Wests Old Boys. These two clubs merged in 1967 and in 1987 was purchased to form Broncos Leagues Club.

Bruno Cullen, who had been with the Broncos' off-field staff since 1989, became the club's third CEO in 2003.

[[National Roads and Motorists' Association|NRMA Insurance]] are the major sponsors of the Broncos as of 2011, replacing [[WOW Sight &amp; Sound]]. [[Nova 106.9]] are the main radio sponsors after taking over from rival station [[B105 FM]] in late 2006. Live broadcasts of all Broncos matches are provided by both [[612 ABC Brisbane]] (except games played on Monday Night) and [[4MMM]]. [[QTQ|Channel Nine Queensland]] also sponsors the Broncos, although former player [[Shane Webcke]] is signed to rival [[BTQ|Seven Queensland]].

In 2012, local Brisbane based company Firstmac replaced WOW sight &amp; Sound as sleeve sponsor for 3 years to launch into the retail financial services market. This sponsorship took only 9 days to negotiate following the announcement of WOW Sight &amp; Sound going into receivership. Firstmac stipulated a unique clause in their contract that they could pay for 250 tickets to be distributed to WOW Sight &amp; Sound staff that lost their jobs. Firstmac has since launched a Firstmac Broncos home loan in conjunction with their new sponsorship agreement.

== Club Rivalries ==

=== North Queensland Cowboys ===
{{Main|North Queensland Cowboys}}

The Broncos biggest rivals are the North Queensland Cowboys. The two clubs had a long-standing 'sibling rivalry' with the Cowboys characterized as the underdog. The rivalry increased in intensity after the Cowboys won their first premiership, beating the Broncos at the 2015 Grand Final at [[ANZ Stadium]]. [[2015 NRL Grand Final|Considered one of the greatest grand finals of all time]], the win established the Cowboys as competitive equals. Between 2015 and 2017 a staggering 3 of 5 of the games played between the two clubs led to a Golden Point finish. It is regarded as one of the greatest sports rivalries and is considered the fiercest rivalry by far in the NRL, earning the nickname of the &quot;[[Queensland derby]]&quot;.

=== Sydney Roosters ===
{{Main|Sydney Roosters}}

Since the 2000 Grand Final between the Roosters and Broncos, both clubs have built on a rivalry which still continues today. From 2002 to 2010, the Roosters and the Broncos played in the traditional Good Friday match.

=== Newcastle Knights ===
{{Main|Newcastle Knights}}

Another notable rivalry is with fellow debutants from 1988, the [[Newcastle Knights]]. From the omission of the [[Gold Coast Chargers]] at the end of the 1998 season until the arrival of the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in the 2007 season, the Knights were geographically the closest club to the Broncos. Adding to this, players from both Brisbane and Newcastle have featured heavily in the annual State of Origin sides for Queensland and New South Wales respectively.

=== Melbourne Storm ===
{{Main|Melbourne Storm}}

Since the 2006 Grand Final where Brisbane etched out Melbourne in a thriller, a rivalry still continues today between the two clubs. Adding to this, both Brisbane and Melbourne usually feature heavily in Queensland's annual State of Origin side.

=== Gold Coast Titans ===
{{Main|Gold Coast Titans}}

The rivalry remains due to the fact that the Titans are geographically the closest club to the Broncos. Brisbane previously enjoyed the rivalry with the [[Gold Coast Chargers]], until the Chargers exited the competition at the end of 1998 season, returning as the [[Gold Coast Titans]] in 2007.

== Club affiliations ==
The Brisbane Broncos have five split feeder clubs from the Queensland Cup ([[Redcliffe Dolphins]], [[Ipswich Jets]], [[Norths Devils|Northern Suburbs Devils]], [[Souths Logan Magpies]] and [[Wynnum Manly Seagulls|Wynnum-Manly Seagulls]], making the Broncos the only club with more than three affiliated feeder clubs. Former feeder clubs of the Broncos were [[Aspley Broncos]] and [[Toowoomba Clydesdales]] and [[Burleigh Bears]], who switched to the [[Gold Coast Titans]].

== Club victory song ==
The Broncos' victory song, &quot;We're The Broncos&quot;:

'''We’re the Broncos'''

'''The mighty Broncos'''

'''We keep fighting every second till the end'''

==NRL Women's team==
