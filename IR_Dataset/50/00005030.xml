'''Bloody Sunday''', or the '''Bogside Massacre''',&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann&quot;/&gt; was a [[mass shooting]] on 30 January 1972 in the [[Bogside]] area of [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], when [[British soldiers]] shot 26 unarmed civilians during a protest march against [[Operation Demetrius|internment without trial]]. 14 people died: 13 were killed outright, while the death of another man four months later was attributed to his injuries. Many of the victims were shot while fleeing from the soldiers, and some were shot while trying to help the wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot;/&gt; Other protesters were injured by shrapnel, [[rubber bullet]]s or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN names&quot;&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/deadinj.htm 'Bloody Sunday', Derry 30 January 1972 – Names of the Dead and Injured].

The soldiers were from the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (&quot;1 Para&quot;). This battalion was involved in two other controversial shootings: the [[Ballymurphy massacre]] several months before and the killing of [[Ulster Protestants|Protestant]] civilians in the [[Shankill Road|Shankill]] several months after.&lt;!--see &quot;Aftermath&quot;--&gt;

Two investigations were held by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]. The [[Widgery Tribunal]], held in the immediate aftermath, largely cleared the soldiers and British authorities of blame. It described the soldiers' shooting as &quot;bordering on the reckless&quot;, but accepted their claims that they shot at gunmen and bomb-throwers. The report was widely criticised as a &quot;[[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = More 'butcher' than 'grocer' | author = David Granville | url = http://www.irishdemocrat.co.uk/features/more-butcher-than-grocer/ | publisher = [[Morning Star (British newspaper)|The Morning Star]] | date = 28 July 2005 | accessdate =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Schooled in scandal | author = Nick Cohen | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/kelly/comment/0,,1136486,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 1 February 2004 | accessdate =18 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1972: 'Bloody Sunday' report excuses Army | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2491000/2491125.stm |work=BBC News | date = 19 April 1972| accessdate =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Saville Inquiry]], chaired by [[Lord Saville of Newdigate]], was established in 1998 to reinvestigate the incident.

Bloody Sunday  came to be regarded as one of the most significant events of [[the Troubles]], because many civilians were killed by forces of the state, in full view of the public and the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Eamonn McCann| title=The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – The Families Speak Out | location=London | publisher=Pluto Press | year=2006 | isbn=0-7453-2510-6}} pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; It was the highest number of people killed in a single shooting incident during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/majinc.htm Significant Violent Incidents During the Conflict]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).&lt;/ref&gt; Bloody Sunday fuelled [[Irish Catholics|Catholic]] and [[Irish nationalist]] hostility towards the British Army and worsened the conflict. Support for the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) rose, and there was a surge of recruitment into the organisation, especially locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson | title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? | location=London | publisher=Fourth Estate | year=2000|isbn=1-84115-316-8}} P. 293: &quot;Youngsters who had seen their friends die that day flocked to join the IRA…&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|The Troubles}}
The City of Derry was perceived by many Catholics and [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in Northern Ireland to be the epitome of what was described as &quot;fifty years of Unionist misrule&quot;: despite having a nationalist majority, [[gerrymandering]] ensured elections to the City Corporation always returned a [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] majority. At the same time the city was perceived to be deprived of public investment: motorways were not extended to it, a university was opened in the relatively small (Protestant-majority) town of [[Coleraine]] rather than Derry and, above all, the city's housing stock was in an appalling state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyte&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Gallager |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm#chap1 |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1983|accessdate=21 April 2011|isbn = 0-7190-0919-7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city therefore became a significant focus of the civil rights campaign led by organisations such as [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA) in the late 1960s and it was in Derry that the [[Battle of the Bogside]] – the event that more than any other pushed the Northern Ireland administration to ask for military support for civil policing – took place in August 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;Purdie&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bob Purdie |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/purdie.htm#nicra |title=Politics in the Streets: The origins of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland |publisher=Blackstaff Press |year=1990|accessdate=21 April 2011|isbn = 0-85640-437-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many Catholics initially welcomed the British Army as a neutral force, in contrast to what was regarded as a sectarian police force, relations between them soon deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Niall Ó Dochartaigh |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/troops/chap4.htm#honey |title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |publisher=Cork University Press |year=1997 |accessdate=19 April 2011|isbn = 978-1-85918-108-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to escalating levels of violence across Northern Ireland, [[Operation Demetrius|internment without trial]] was introduced on 9 August 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;g45&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Geraghty | first = Tony | authorlink = Tony Geraghty | title = The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence | publisher = [[Harper Collins]] | year = 2000 | page = 45 | isbn = 978-0-00-638674-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was disorder across Northern Ireland following the introduction of internment, with 21 people being killed in three days of rioting.&lt;ref name=&quot;e141&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = English | first = Richard | authorlink = Richard English | title = Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA | publisher = [[Pan Books]] | year = 2003 | page = 141 | isbn = 0-330-49388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belfast, soldiers of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] shot dead 11 Catholic civilians in what became known as the [[Ballymurphy Massacre]]. On 10 August, [[Bombardier (rank)|Bombardier]] Paul Challenor became the first soldier to be killed by the Provisional IRA in Derry, when he was shot by a sniper on the [[Creggan, Derry|Creggan estate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b83&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter | title = Brits: The War Against the IRA | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing | year = 2001 | page = [https://archive.org/details/brits00pete/page/83 83] | isbn = 0-7475-5806-X | url = https://archive.org/details/brits00pete/page/83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further six soldiers had been killed in Derry by mid-December 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;b84&quot;&gt;''Brits'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; At least 1,332 rounds were fired at the British Army, who also faced 211 explosions and 180 [[nail bomb]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;b84&quot; /&gt; and who fired 364 rounds in return.

IRA activity also increased across Northern Ireland with thirty British soldiers being killed in the remaining months of 1971, in contrast to the ten soldiers killed during the pre-internment period of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;e141&quot; /&gt; Both the [[Official IRA]] and Provisional IRA had established [[no-go area]]s for the British Army and [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) in Derry through the use of barricades.&lt;ref name=&quot;b82&quot;&gt;''Brits'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place to prevent access to what was known as [[Free Derry]], 16 of them impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles.&lt;ref name=&quot;b82&quot; /&gt; IRA members openly mounted roadblocks in front of the media, and daily clashes took place between nationalist youths and the British Army at a spot known as &quot;aggro corner&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;b82&quot; /&gt; Due to rioting and damage to shops caused by [[incendiary device]]s, an estimated total of {{Nowrap|£4 million}} worth of damage had been caused to local businesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;b82&quot; /&gt;

===Lead-up to the march===
On 18 January 1972, [[Brian Faulkner]], [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], banned all parades and marches in Northern Ireland until the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Events+surrounding+one+of+the+darkest+days+in+history.-a061037924 |title=Events surrounding one of the darkest days in history |last=Macaskill |first=Jamie |work=Daily Record |location=Glasgow |date=28 March 2000 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 1972, a week before Bloody Sunday, an anti-internment march was held at [[Magilligan]] strand, near Derry. The protesters marched to a new internment camp there, but were stopped by soldiers of the Parachute Regiment. When some protesters threw stones and tried to go around the barbed wire, paratroopers drove them back by firing [[rubber bullet]]s at close range and making [[baton charge]]s. The paratroopers badly beat a number of protesters and had to be physically restrained by their own officers. These allegations of brutality by paratroopers were reported widely on television and in the press. Some in the Army also thought there had been undue violence by the paratroopers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter009 Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume I, Chapter 9], paragraphs 202–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/chron.htm 'Bloody Sunday', 30 January 1972 – A Chronology of Events]. [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).&lt;/ref&gt;

NICRA intended, despite the ban, to hold another anti-internment march in Derry on Sunday 30 January. The authorities decided to allow it to proceed in the Catholic areas of the city, but to stop it from reaching [[Guildhall, Derry|Guildhall Square]], as planned by the organisers. The authorities expected that this would lead to rioting. Major General [[Robert Ford (British Army officer)|Robert Ford]], then Commander of Land Forces in Northern Ireland, ordered that the [[1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (1 Para), should travel to Derry to be used to arrest possible rioters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saville2.16-17&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter002 |title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry |year=2010 |volume=2.15–2.16 |accessdate=22 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915134440/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter002/ |archivedate=15 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest operation was codenamed 'Operation Forecast'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry].

He gave orders to Lieutenant Colonel [[Derek Wilford]], commander of 1 Para. He in turn gave orders to Major [[Ted Loden]], who commanded the [[Company (military unit)|company]] who launched the arrest operation.

The protesters planned on marching from Bishop's Field, in the Creggan housing estate, to the Guildhall, in the city centre, where they would hold a rally. The march set off at about 2:45pm. There were 10,000–15,000 people on the march, with many joining along its route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101017065242/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume02/chapter014/|title=The beginning of the march - Chapter 14 - Volume II - Bloody Sunday Inquiry Report|website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=14 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Widgery, Baron Widgery|Lord Widgery]], in his now discredited tribunal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0616/1224272613911.html |title='Relief and vindication in Derry at findings in 5,000-page report'|work=The Irish Times |accessdate=26 March 2011|date=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/7827351/Bloody-Sunday-soldiers-should-face-trial-but-not-jail-families-say.html |title='Bloody Sunday: soldiers should face trial but not jail, families say'|newspaper=The Telegraph |accessdate=26 March 2011|location=London|first1=John|last1=Bingham|first2=Rosa|last2=Prince|first3=Thomas|last3=Harding|date=14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.independent.co.uk/topic/saville-widgery |title='saville widgery' |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=26 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129214943/http://search.independent.co.uk/topic/saville-widgery |archivedate=29 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1997/02/06/00031.asp |title='Written Answers. – Bloody Sunday Inquiry'|publisher=House of the Oireachtas |accessdate=26 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that there were only 3,000 to 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/181194/Bloody-Sunday-March-that-led-to-deadly-clashes |title=Bloody Sunday: March that led to deadly clashes |last=Flanagan |first=Padraic |work=Sunday Express |location=London |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The march made its way along William Street but, as it neared the city centre, its path was blocked by British Army barriers. The organisers redirected the march down Rossville Street, intending to hold the rally at [[Free Derry Corner]] instead. However, some broke off from the march and began [[stone throwing|throwing stones at soldiers]] manning the barriers. The soldiers fired rubber bullets, [[CS gas]] and [[water cannon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. [[The Stationery Office]]. 15 June 2010. p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Such clashes between soldiers and youths were common, and observers reported that the rioting was not intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Pringle &amp; Philip Jacobson |title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? |location=London |publisher=Fourth Estate |year=2000 |isbn=1-84115-316-8}} P. 100: &quot;…the level of rioting was no greater than usual – and no petrol bombs or nail bombs were being thrown.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the crowd spotted paratroopers occupying a derelict three-story building overlooking William Street, and began throwing stones at the windows. At about 3:55pm, these paratroopers opened fire. Civilians Damien Donaghy and John Johnston were shot and wounded while standing on waste ground opposite the building. These were the first shots fired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry] [[The Stationery Office]]. p.15&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers claimed Donaghy was holding a black cylindrical object,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson |title=Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They? |location=London |publisher=Fourth Estate |year=2000 |isbn=1-84115-316-8}}P 116: &quot;Seconds after the corporal fired, he would say that he spotted the same man with a black cylindrical object in one hand strike what appeared to be a match against the wall. Johnston was standing a few feet from Donaghy. One of the bullets sliced through his right thigh.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; but the Saville Inquiry concluded that all of those shot were unarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/15/bloody-sunday-inquiry-key-findings |title=Bloody Sunday inquiry: key findings |last1=Siddique |first1=Haroon |last2=French |first2=Megan |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 4:07pm, the paratroopers were ordered to go through the barriers and arrest rioters. The paratroopers, on foot and in armoured vehicles, chased people down Rossville Street and into the Bogside. Two people were knocked down by the vehicles. Brigadier MacLellan had ordered that only one company of paratroopers be sent through the barriers, on foot, and that they should not chase people down Rossville Street. Colonel Wilford disobeyed this order, which meant there was no separation between rioters and peaceful marchers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. [[The Stationery Office]]. p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

The paratroopers disembarked and began seizing people. There were many claims of paratroopers beating people, clubbing them with rifle butts, firing rubber bullets at them from close range, making threats to kill, and hurling abuse. The Saville Report agreed that soldiers &quot;used excessive force when arresting people […] as well as seriously assaulting them for no good reason while in their custody&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume03/chapter044/|title=Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume III, Chapter 44: Conclusions on the treatment of those arrested in Sector 2|website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One group of paratroopers took up position at a low wall about {{convert|80|yd|m}} in front of a rubble barricade that stretched across Rossville Street. There were people at the barricade and some were throwing stones at the soldiers, but none were near enough to hit them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume05/chapter070 Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume V, Chapter 70], paragraph 20&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers fired on the people at the barricade, killing six and wounding a seventh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry]. [[The Stationery Office]]. p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

A large group of people fled or were chased into the car park of Rossville Flats. This area was like a courtyard, surrounded on three sides by high-rise flats. The soldiers opened fire, killing one civilian and wounding six others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry].

Another group of people fled into the car park of Glenfada Park, which was also a courtyard-like area surrounded by flats. Here, the soldiers shot at people across the car park, about 40–50 yards away. Two civilians were killed and at least four others wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279167/0030.pdf Principal Conclusions and Overall Assessment of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry].

Some of those shot were given [[first aid]] by civilian volunteers, either on the scene or after being carried into nearby homes. They were then driven to hospital, either in civilian cars or in ambulances. The first ambulances arrived at 4:28pm. The three boys killed at the rubble barricade were driven to hospital by the paratroopers. Witnesses said paratroopers lifted the bodies by the hands and feet and dumped them in the back of their APC, as if they were &quot;pieces of meat&quot;. The Saville Report agreed that this is an &quot;accurate description of what happened&quot;. It says the paratroopers &quot;might well have felt themselves at risk, but in our view this does not excuse them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume07/chapter122/ Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume VII, Chapter 122], paragraphs 290–293&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties===
[[File:Murder victims of Bloody Sunday.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Murals in Northern Ireland|Mural]] by the [[Bogside Artists]] depicting all who were killed by the British Army on the day]]
In all, 26 people were shot by the paratroopers;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN names&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;  13 died on the day and another died of his injuries four months later. The dead were killed in four main areas: the rubble barricade across Rossville Street, the courtyard car park of Rossville Flats (on the north side of the flats), the courtyard car park of Glenfada Park, and the forecourt of Rossville Flats (on the south side of the flats).&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;

All of the soldiers responsible insisted that they had shot at, and hit, gunmen or bomb-throwers. No soldier said he missed his target and hit someone else by mistake. The Saville Report concluded that all of those shot were unarmed and that none were posing a serious threat. It also concluded that none of the soldiers fired in response to attacks, or threatened attacks, by gunmen or bomb-throwers. No warnings were given before soldiers opened fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.uk&quot;/&gt;

The casualties are listed in the order in which they were killed.

* '''John 'Jackie' Duddy''', age 17. Shot as he ran away from soldiers in the car park of Rossville Flats.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; The bullet struck him in the shoulder and entered his chest. Three witnesses said they saw a soldier take deliberate aim at the youth as he ran.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; He was the first fatality on Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; Both Saville and Widgery concluded that Duddy was unarmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;
* '''Michael Kelly''', age 17. Shot in the stomach while standing at the rubble barricade on Rossville Street. Both Saville and Widgery concluded that Kelly was unarmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; The Saville Inquiry concluded that 'Soldier F' shot Kelly.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;
* '''Hugh Gilmour''', age 17. Shot as he ran away from soldiers near the rubble barricade.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; The bullet went through his left elbow and entered his chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Bloody Sunday in Derry: What Really Happened'' {{ISBN|978-0-863-22274-0}} pp. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; Widgery acknowledged that a photograph taken seconds after Gilmour was hit&lt;ref&gt;''Bloody Sunday in Derry: What Really Happened'' {{ISBN|978-0-863-22274-0}} p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; corroborated witness reports that he was unarmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIDGERY&quot; /&gt; The Saville Inquiry concluded that 'Private U' shot Gilmour.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;
* '''William Nash''', age 19. Shot in the chest at the rubble barricade.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; Three people were shot while apparently going to his aid, including his father Alexander Nash.&lt;ref name=savillechapter86&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103103930/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume05/chapter086/ Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, Volume V, Chapter 86], paragraphs 360–364&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''John Young''', age 17. Shot in the face at the rubble barricade, apparently while crouching and going to the aid of William Nash.&lt;ref name=savillechapter86/&gt;

* '''Kevin McElhinney''', age 17. Shot from behind, near the rubble barricade, while attempting to crawl to safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;
* '''James 'Jim' Wray''', age 22. Shot in the back while running away from soldiers in Glenfada Park courtyard. He was then shot again in the back as he lay mortally wounded on the ground. Witnesses, who were not called to the Widgery Tribunal, stated that Wray was calling out that he could not move his legs before he was shot the second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; 'Soldier F' faces charges for his murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soldier F&quot;&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-47540271 &quot;Bloody Sunday: Soldier F faces murder charges&quot;].

* '''William McKinney''', age 26. Shot in the back as he attempted to flee through Glenfada Park courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279147/0029_vi.pdf Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry - Volume VI: Events in Glenfada Park North and Abbey Park].

* '''Gerard 'Gerry' McKinney''', age 35. Shot in the chest at Abbey Park. A soldier, identified as 'Private G', ran through an alleyway from Glenfada Park and shot him from a few yards away. Witnesses said that when he saw the soldier, McKinney stopped and held up his arms, shouting &quot;Don't shoot! Don't shoot!&quot;, before being shot. The bullet apparently went through his body and struck Gerard Donaghy behind him.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;
* '''[[Gerard V. Donaghy|Gerard 'Gerry' Donaghy]]''', age 17. Shot in the stomach at Abbey Park while standing behind Gerard McKinney. Both were apparently struck by the same bullet. Bystanders brought Donaghy to a nearby house. A doctor examined him, and his pockets were searched for identification. Two bystanders then attempted to drive Donaghy to hospital, but the car was stopped at an Army checkpoint. They were ordered to leave the car and a soldier drove it to a Regimental Aid Post, where an Army medical officer pronounced Donaghy dead. Shortly after, soldiers found four nail bombs in his pockets. The civilians who searched him, the soldier who drove him to the Army post, and the Army medical officer, all said that they did not see any bombs. This led to claims that soldiers planted the bombs on Donaghy to justify the killings. Donaghy was a member of [[Fianna Éireann]], an IRA-linked republican youth movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; Paddy Ward, a police informer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derryjournal.com/news/death-of-informer-1-2143992|title=Death of 'informer'|website=Derryjournal.com|accessdate=14 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331092559/https://www.derryjournal.com/news/death-of-informer-1-2143992|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; told the Saville Inquiry he gave two nail bombs to Donaghy several hours before he was shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;INNES&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = McGuinness is named as bomb runner | author = John Innes | url = http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=628&amp;id=1161662003 |work=The Scotsman | location=Edinburgh | date = 21 October 2003 | accessdate =18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquiry concluded that the bombs were probably in Donaghy's pockets when he was shot; but that he was not about to throw a bomb when he was shot, and was not shot because he had bombs. &quot;He was shot while trying to escape from the soldiers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;

The Saville Inquiry concluded that he was shot by 'Soldier F', who came out of Glenfada Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt; Doherty was photographed, moments before and after he died, by French journalist [[Gilles Peress]]. Despite testimony from 'Soldier F' that he had shot a man holding a pistol, Widgery acknowledged that the photographs show Doherty was unarmed, and that forensic tests on his hands for gunshot residue proved negative.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAINBS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Inquiry urged to identify soldiers | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2004398.stm |work=BBC News | date = 23 May 2002 | accessdate =16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Thirteen people were shot and killed, with another man later dying of his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10138851 |title=The victims of Bloody Sunday |work=BBC News |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official army position, backed by the British [[Home Secretary]], [[Reginald Maudling]], the next day in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], was that the paratroopers had reacted to gun and nail bomb attacks from suspected IRA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Northern Ireland |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1972/jan/31/northern-ireland |house=House of Commons |date=31 January 1972 |column_start=32 |column_end=43 |speaker=Reginald Maudling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the soldiers, all eyewitnesses—including marchers, local residents, and British and Irish journalists present—maintain that soldiers fired into an unarmed crowd, or were aiming at fleeing people and those tending the wounded, whereas the soldiers themselves were not fired upon. No British soldier was wounded by gunfire or reported any injuries, nor were any bullets or nail bombs recovered to back up their claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;12-years&quot;/&gt;

On 2 February 1972, the day that 12 of those killed were buried, there was a [[general strike]] in the Republic. It was described as the biggest general strike in Europe since the Second World War relative to population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/bloody-sunday-helped-reconcile-southern-nationalists-to-partition-1.453388|title=Bloody Sunday helped reconcile Southern nationalists to partition|work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial services were held in Catholic and Protestant churches, as well as synagogues, throughout the Republic.

In the days following Bloody Sunday, [[Bernadette Devlin McAliskey|Bernadette Devlin]], the independent Irish nationalist [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Ulster]], expressed anger at what she perceived as British government attempts to stifle accounts being reported about the shootings. Having witnessed the events firsthand, she was infuriated that Speaker [[Selwyn Lloyd]] consistently denied her the chance to speak in Parliament about the shootings, although parliamentary convention decreed that any MP witnessing an incident under discussion would be granted an opportunity to speak about it in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Daughters of Ireland |author = Ros Wynne-Jones |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/daughters-of-ireland-1271972.html |work=The Independent |location=UK |date = 9 March 1997 |accessdate =6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |house=House of Commons |title=Northern Ireland |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1972/jan/31/northern-ireland |date = 31 January 1972 |column_start = 32 |column_end = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[inquest]] into the deaths was held in August 1973. The city's [[coroner]], Hubert O'Neill, a retired British Army major, issued a statement at the completion of the inquest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/chron.htm 'Bloody Sunday', 30 January 1972 – A Chronology of Events].

{{quote|This Sunday became known as Bloody Sunday and bloody it was. It was quite unnecessary. It strikes me that the Army ran amok that day and shot without thinking what they were doing. They were shooting innocent people. These people may have been taking part in a march that was banned but that does not justify the troops coming in and firing live rounds indiscriminately. I would say without hesitation that it was sheer, unadulterated murder. It was murder.}}

Several months after Bloody Sunday, the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment—again under Lt Col Derek Wilford—were involved in another controversial shooting incident. On 7 September, 1 Para raided houses and the headquarters of the [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) in the [[Ulster Protestant|Protestant]] [[Shankill Road|Shankill]] area of Belfast. Two Protestant civilians were shot dead and others wounded by the paratroopers, who claimed they were returning fire at [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] gunmen. This sparked angry demonstrations by local Protestants, and the UDA declared: &quot;Never has Ulster witnessed such licensed sadists and such blatant liars as the 1st Paras. These gun-happy louts must be removed from the streets&quot;. A unit of the British Army's [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] refused to carry out duties until 1 Para was withdrawn from the Shankill.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Ian S. ''Crimes of Loyalty: A History of the UDA''. Edinburgh University Press, 2006. pp.104-105&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 1972, Lt Col Wilford, who was directly in charge of the soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday, was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] by [[Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10287463|title=Bloody Sunday: Key soldiers involved|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[John Major]], writing to John Hume stated: &quot;The Government made clear in 1974 that those who were killed on 'Bloody Sunday' should be regarded as innocent of any allegation that they were shot whilst handling firearms or explosives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Don Mullan]] |title=Eyewitness Bloody Sunday |location=Wolfhound |publisher=Printing Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-86327-586-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, General (then Captain) Sir [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]], adjutant of 1 Para on Bloody Sunday, said: &quot;I have no doubt that innocent people were shot&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 1998, Lt Col Derek Wilford expressed his anger at Tony Blair's intention of setting up the Saville inquiry, stating that he was proud of his actions on Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/I+was+proud+to+lead+the+Paras+on+Bloody+Sunday...don't+dare+say+sorry...-a060659224|title=I was proud to lead the Paras on Bloody Sunday...don't dare say sorry for me, Mr Blair.|website=Thefreelibrary.com|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later in 2000 during an interview with the BBC, Wilford said: &quot;There might have been things wrong in the sense that some innocent people, people who were not carrying a weapon, were wounded or even killed. But that was not done as a deliberate malicious act.

== Widgery Inquiry ==
Two days after Bloody Sunday, the British Parliament adopted a resolution for a [[tribunal]] into the shootings, resulting in Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] commissioning the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[John Widgery, Baron Widgery|Lord Widgery]], to undertake it. Many witnesses intended to [[boycott]] the tribunal as they lacked faith in Widgery's impartiality, but were eventually persuaded to take part. Widgery's quickly-produced report—completed within 10 weeks (on 10 April) and published within 11 weeks (on 19 April)—supported the Army's account of the events of the day. Among the evidence presented to the tribunal were the results of paraffin tests, used to identify lead residues from firing weapons, and that nail bombs had been found on the body of one of those killed. Tests for traces of explosives on the clothes of eleven of the dead proved negative, while those of the remaining man could not be tested as they had already been washed. It has been argued that firearms residue on some deceased may have come from contact with the soldiers who themselves moved some of the bodies, or that the presence of lead on the hands of one (James Wray) was easily explained by the fact that his occupation regularly involved the use of lead-based [[solder]].{{refn|group=n|The contamination discovered upon victim William Nash was solely discovered upon his right hand, whereas Nash had been left-handed.

Most witnesses to the event disputed the report's conclusions and regarded it as a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]], the slogan &quot;Widgery washes whiter&quot; - a play on the contemporary advertisement for [[Daz (detergent)|Daz]] soap powder - emblazoned on walls in Derry, crystallized the views of many nationalists about the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ynW7sYN70_MC&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;ots=CVVTqH2M0r&amp;dq=%22widgery%20washes%20whiter%22&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q=%22widgery%20washes%20whiter%22&amp;f=false |title=Commemoration and Bloody Sunday: Pathways of Memory|last=Conway |first=B |year=2010 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-31032-6 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although British prime minister John Major rejected John Hume's requests for a [[public inquiry]] into the killings, his successor, Tony Blair, decided to start one. A second commission of inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, was established in January 1998 to re-examine Bloody Sunday.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbchist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/saville_inquiry_into_bloody_sunday |title=Saville Inquiry into Bloody Sunday |work=BBC History |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other judges were [[John Toohey (judge)|John Toohey]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], a former [[Judge|Justice]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] who had worked on Aboriginal issues (he replaced New Zealander Sir [[Edward Somers]] QC, who retired from the Inquiry in 2000 for personal reasons), and Mr Justice [[William Lloyd Hoyt|William Hoyt]] QC, former [[Chief Justice]] of [[New Brunswick]] and a member of the [[Canadian Judicial Council]]. The hearings were concluded in November 2004, and the report was published 15 June 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbchist&quot;/&gt; The Saville Inquiry was a more comprehensive study than the Widgery Tribunal, interviewing a wide range of witnesses, including local residents, soldiers, journalists and politicians. Lord Saville declined to comment on the Widgery report and made the point that the Saville Inquiry was a judicial inquiry into Bloody Sunday, not the Widgery Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOuCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 |title=Operation Banner: The British Army in Northern Ireland 1969 – 2007 |last=Van der Bijl |first=Nick |publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Military |isbn=978-1-8441-5956-7 |year=2009 |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence given by [[Martin McGuinness]], a senior member of [[Sinn Féin]] and later the [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]], to the inquiry stated that he was second-in-command of the Derry City brigade of the Provisional IRA and was present at the march.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbchist&quot;/&gt; A claim was made at the Saville Inquiry that McGuinness was responsible for supplying detonators for nail bombs on Bloody Sunday. Paddy Ward claimed he was the leader of the [[Fianna Éireann]], the youth wing of the PIRA in January 1972. He claimed that McGuinness, the second-in-command of the PIRA in the city at the time, and another anonymous PIRA member gave him bomb parts on the morning of 30 January, the date planned for the civil rights march. He said his organisation intended to attack city-centre premises in Derry on the day when civilians were shot dead by British soldiers. In response McGuinness rejected the claims as &quot;fantasy&quot;, while Gerry O'Hara, a Sinn Féin councillor in Derry stated that he and not Ward was the Fianna leader at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;INNES&quot; /&gt;

The report concluded that an Official IRA sniper fired on British soldiers, albeit that on the balance of evidence his shot was fired ''after'' the Army shots that wounded Damien Donaghey and John Johnston. The Inquiry rejected the sniper's account that this shot had been made in reprisal, stating the view that he and another Official IRA member had already been in position, and the shot had probably been fired simply because the opportunity had presented itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;SavilleSnipers312&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report |title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume&amp;nbsp;I – Chapter 3 |publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824013430/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003 |archivedate=24 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the Saville Inquiry was inconclusive on Martin McGuinness's role, due to a lack of certainty over his movements, concluding that while he was &quot;engaged in paramilitary activity&quot; during Bloody Sunday, and had probably been armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun]], there was insufficient evidence to make any finding other than they were &quot;sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SavilleMcGuinness3119&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003/#the-report |title=Report of The Bloody Sunday Inquiry – Volume&amp;nbsp;I – Chapter 3 |publisher=Bloody Sunday Inquiry |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |quote=3.119 in the course of investigating the activities of the Provisional and Official IRA on the day, we considered at some length allegations that Martin McGuinness, at that time the Adjutant of the Derry Brigade or Command of the Provisional IRA, had engaged in paramilitary activity during the day. In the end we were left in some doubt as to his movements on the day. Before the soldiers of Support Company went into the Bogside he was probably armed with a Thompson sub-machine gun, and though it is possible that he fired this weapon, there is insufficient evidence to make any finding on this, save that we are sure that he did not engage in any activity that provided any of the soldiers with any justification for opening fire. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824013430/http://report.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org/volume01/chapter003 |archivedate=24 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the soldiers in charge on the day of Bloody Sunday, the Saville Inquiry arrived at the following findings:

*Lieutenant Colonel [[Derek Wilford]]: Commander of 1 Para and directly responsible for arresting rioters and returning to base. Found to have 'deliberately disobeyed' his superior Brigadier Patrick MacLellan's orders by sending Support Company into the Bogside (and without informing MacLellan).&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt;
*Major [[Ted Loden]]: Commander in charge of soldiers, following orders issued by Lieutenant Colonel Wilford. Cleared of misconduct; Saville cited in the report that Loden &quot;neither realised nor should have realised that his soldiers were or might be firing at people who were not posing or about to pose a threat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt; The inquiry found that Loden could not be held responsible for claims (whether malicious or not) by some of the individual soldiers that they had received fire from snipers.
*Captain [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]]: Second in command of 1 Para on the day of Bloody Sunday. Cleared of sinister actions following Jackson's compiling of a list of what soldiers told Major Loden on why they had fired. This list became known as the &quot;Loden List of Engagements&quot; which played a role in the Army's initial explanations. While the inquiry found the compiling of the list was 'far from ideal', Jackson's explanations were accepted based on the list not containing the names of soldiers and the number of times they fired.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt;
*Major General [[Robert Ford (British Army officer)|Robert Ford]]: Commander of land forces and set the British strategy to oversee the civil march in Derry. Cleared of any fault, but his selection of 1 Para, and in particular his selection of Colonel Wilford to be in control of arresting rioters, was found to be disconcerting, specifically as &quot;1 PARA was a force with a reputation for using excessive physical violence, which thus ran the risk of exacerbating the tensions between the Army and nationalists&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt;
*Brigadier Pat MacLellan: Operational commander of the day. Cleared of any wrongdoing as he was under the impression that Wilford would follow orders by arresting rioters and then returning to base, and could not be blamed for Wilford's actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt;
*Major Michael Steele: With MacLellan in the operations room and in charge of passing on the orders of the day. The inquiry report accepted that Steele could not believe other than that a separation had been achieved between rioters and marchers, because both groups were in different areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2521517.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – N Ireland – Major gives Bloody Sunday evidence|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other soldiers: Lance Corporal F was found responsible for a number of the deaths and that a number of soldiers have &quot;knowingly put forward false accounts in order to seek to justify their firing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot; /&gt;
*Intelligence officer Colonel Maurice Tugwell and [[Colin Wallace]], (an IPU army press officer): Cleared of wrongdoing. Saville believed the information Tugwell and Wallace released through the media was not down to any deliberate attempt to deceive the public but rather due to much of the inaccurate information Tugwell had received at the time by various other figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/8577087.stm|title=BBC News – Britain's propaganda war during the Troubles|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on the findings of the Saville Inquiry in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the British prime minister [[David Cameron]] said:{{quote|Mr Speaker, I am deeply patriotic. I never want to believe anything bad about our country. I never want to call into question the behaviour of our soldiers and our army, who I believe to be the finest in the world. And I have seen for myself the very difficult and dangerous circumstances in which we ask our soldiers to serve. But the conclusions of this report are absolutely clear. There is no doubt, there is nothing equivocal, there are no ambiguities. What happened on Bloody Sunday was both unjustified and unjustifiable. It was wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10322295|title=BBC News – Bloody Sunday: PM David Cameron's full statement|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Murder investigation==
Following the publication of the Saville Report, a murder investigation was begun by the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]'s Legacy Investigation Branch. On 10 November 2015, a 66-year-old former member of the Parachute Regiment was arrested for questioning over the deaths of William Nash, Michael McDaid and John Young. He was released on bail shortly after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-34794691|title=Bloody Sunday: Former British soldier released on bail|work=BBC News|date=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland]] (PPS) announced in March 2019 that there was enough evidence to prosecute &quot;Soldier F&quot; for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney, both of whom were shot in the back. He will also be charged with four attempted murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloody Sunday: Soldier F faces murder charges |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-47540271 |website=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=14 March 2019 |date=14 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/14/bloody-sunday-trial-will-test-limits-justice-northern-ireland|title=Bloody Sunday trial will test limits of justice in Northern Ireland|first=Owen Bowcott Legal affairs|last=correspondent|date=14 March 2019|accessdate=14 March 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/14/prosecutors-explain-bloody-sunday-charges-against-soldier-f|title=Prosecutors explain Bloody Sunday murder charges against 'Soldier F'|first=Owen|last=Bowcott|date=14 March 2019|accessdate=14 March 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saville Inquiry concluded, based on the evidence, that &quot;Soldier F&quot; also killed Michael Kelly, Patrick Doherty and Barney McGuigan, but evidence from the inquiry was inadmissible to the prosecution and &quot;the only evidence capable of identifying the soldier who fired the relevant shots came from Soldier F's co-accused, Soldier G, who is deceased&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/why-soldier-f-will-be-charged-over-bloody-sunday-but-other-soldiers-will-not-be-1.3825921 &quot;Why Soldier F will be charged over Bloody Sunday but other soldiers will not be&quot;].

When it was deployed on duty in Northern Ireland, the British Army was welcomed by Roman Catholics as a neutral force there to protect them from Protestant mobs, the RUC and the [[Ulster Special Constabulary|B-Specials]].&lt;ref&gt;This &quot;Honeymoon period&quot;, as it has come to be known, ended around the time of the [[Falls Road Curfew]] on 3 July 1970. See CAIN for details here [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch70.htm]. The 'B-Specials' were disbanded and replaced by the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]] (UDR) on 1 April 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; After Bloody Sunday many Catholics turned on the British army, seeing it no longer as their protector but as their enemy. Young [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] became increasingly attracted to violent [[Irish republicanism|republican]] groups. With the Official IRA and [[Official Sinn Féin]] having moved away from mainstream Irish republicanism towards [[Marxism]], the Provisional IRA began to win the support of newly radicalised, disaffected young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloody Sunday Victims Deserve Better Than This |date=15 March 2019 |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bloody-sunday-families-deserve-better-than-this-8sr8pbtfb |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=16 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following twenty years, the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other smaller republican groups such as the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) stepped up their [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997|armed campaigns]] against the state and those seen as being in service to it. With rival paramilitary organisations appearing in both the nationalist/republican and unionist/loyalist communities (such as the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF), etc. on the loyalist side), the Troubles cost the lives of thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/topics/troubles_paramilitaries |title=Paramilitaries in the Troubles |website=BBC History |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to the House of Commons on the Inquiry, British prime minister David Cameron stated: &quot;These are shocking conclusions to read and shocking words to have to say. But you do not defend the British Army by defending the indefensible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=''RTÉ News'' |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0615/bloodysunday.html |title=Bloody Sunday killings 'unjustifiable' |date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledged that all those who died were unarmed when they were killed by British soldiers, and that a British soldier had fired the first shot at civilians. He also said that this was not a premeditated action, though &quot;there was no point in trying to soften or equivocate&quot; as &quot;what happened should never, ever have happened&quot;. Cameron then apologised on behalf of the British Government by saying he was &quot;deeply sorry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/15/david-cameron-bloody-sunday-apology |title=David Cameron condemns Bloody Sunday killings and makes apology |work=The Guardian |location=London |last=Stratton |first=Allegra |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted by [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]] in June 2010 found that 61 per cent of Britons and 70 per cent of Northern Irish agreed with Cameron's apology for the Bloody Sunday events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Angus Reid Public Opinion |url=http://www.visioncritical.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/2010.06.28_Sunday_BRI.pdf |title=Britons and Northern Irish Welcome PM's Apology for Bloody Sunday |publisher=Angus Reid Public Opinion |date=28 June 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, shortly before the annual Bloody Sunday remembrance march, two Parachute Regiment flags appeared in the loyalist Fountain, and Waterside, [[Drumahoe]] areas of Derry.
