'''Buffalo''' is the [[List of cities in New York (state)|second largest city]] in the [[United States|U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and the largest city in [[Western New York]]. {{As of|2018||df=}}, the population was 256,304. The city is the [[county seat]] of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and a major gateway for commerce and travel across the [[Canada–United States border]], forming part of the bi-national [[Buffalo Niagara Region]]. As of the April 1, 2010, the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) had a population of 1,135,509; the combined statistical area (CSA), which adds [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]], had a population of 1,215,826 inhabitants.

The Buffalo area was inhabited before the 17th century by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Iroquois]] tribe and later by French colonizers. The city grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of immigration, the construction of the [[Erie Canal]] and [[Rail transportation in the United States|rail transportation]], and its close proximity to [[Lake Erie]]. This growth provided an abundance of fresh water and an ample trade route to the [[Midwestern United States]] while grooming its economy for the grain, steel and automobile industries that dominated the city's economy in the 20th century. Since the city's economy relied heavily on manufacturing, [[deindustrialization]] in the latter half of the 20th century led to a steady decline in population. While some manufacturing activity remains, Buffalo's economy has transitioned to service industries with a greater emphasis on healthcare, research and higher education, which emerged following the [[Great Recession]].

Buffalo is on the eastern shore of Lake Erie, at the head of the [[Niagara River]], {{convert|16|mi}} south of [[Niagara Falls]]. Its early embrace of electric power led to the nickname &quot;The City of Light&quot;. The city is also famous for its urban planning and layout by [[Joseph Ellicott (surveyor)|Joseph Ellicott]], an extensive system of parks designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], as well as [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Buffalo, New York|significant architectural works]]. Its culture blends [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] traditions, with annual festivals including [[Taste of Buffalo]] and [[Allentown, Buffalo#Allentown Art Festival|Allentown Art Festival]], two professional sports teams ([[Buffalo Bills]] and [[Buffalo Sabres]]), and a thriving and progressive music and arts scene.

==Etymology==
The city of Buffalo received its name from a nearby creek called [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]].{{Sfn|Ketchum|1865|p=63–65}} British military engineer Captain [[John Montresor]] made reference to &quot;Buffalo Creek&quot; in his 1764 journal, which may be the earliest recorded appearance of the name.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Buffalo Historical Society Publications |chapter=The Achievements of Captain John Montresor |author=Severance, Frank H. |editor=Buffalo Historical Society |location=Buffalo, NY |date=1902 |publisher=Bigelow Brothers |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBs8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 |page=15 |access-date=August 14, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916180643/https://books.google.com/books?id=pBs8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA15 |archivedate=September 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several theories regarding how Buffalo Creek received its name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beautiful&quot;&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/docview/436693160?

===Prehistory and European exploration===
[[File:Village of Buffalo.tif|left|thumb|An early map of the village of Buffalo and outer lots in 1854. Inset is Ellicott's 1804 plan.|alt=Sepia map of an old waterfront village plan.]]
[[File:Buffalo 1813.jpg|thumb|The village of Buffalo, 1813]]
[[File:Walk in the Water (steamboat).JPG|thumb|[[Walk-in-the-water (steamboat)|''Walk-in-the-Water'']] was the first steamboat to sail Lake Erie in 1818; by the 1840s there were about 30 steamboats and 300 schooners and other craft navigating Lake Erie and connected lakes|alt=Lithograph of a large steamboat with smokestack and two sails.]]
The first inhabitants of the State of New York are believed to have been nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]], who migrated after the disappearance of [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene glaciers]] during or before 7000 BCE.{{Sfn|Thompson|1977|p=113}}

Around 1000 CE, 1,000 years ago, the [[Woodland period]] began, marked by the rise of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] and its tribes throughout the state.{{Sfn|Thompson|1977|p=113}}

During French exploration of the region in 1620, the region was occupied simultaneously by the [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] [[Erie people]], a tribe outside of the Five Nations of the Iroquois southwest of Buffalo Creek,{{Sfn|Thompson|1977|pp=114–115, 117}} and the [[Wenrohronon|Wenro people]] or ''Wenrohronon'', an Iroquoian-speaking tribal offshoot of the large [[Neutral Nation]] who lived along the inland south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] and at the east end of [[Lake Erie]] and a bit of its northern shore.{{Sfn|Bingham|1931|p=1}} For trading, the Neutral people made a living by growing tobacco and [[hemp]] to trade with the Iroquois,{{Sfn|Thompson|1977|p=118}} using animal paths or warpaths to travel and move goods across the state. These paths were later paved, and now function as major roads.{{Sfn|Thompson|1977|p=117–118}}

Later, during the [[Beaver Wars]] of the 1640s-1650s, the combined warriors of the [[Five Nations of the Iroquois]] Confederacy conquered the populous Neutrals&lt;ref name=&quot;AmHeritageBk&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1961|encyclopedia=|location=|id=|title=The American Heritage Book of Indians|author=Editor: Alvin M.

[[Louis Hennepin]] and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Sieur de La Salle]] made the earliest European discoveries of the upper Niagara and Ontario regions in the late 1600s.{{Sfn|Becker|1906|pp=15–20}} On August 7, 1679, La Salle launched a vessel, [[Le Griffon]], that became the first full-sized ship to sail across the Great Lakes before it disappeared in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]].{{Sfn|Turner|1849|p=119–126}}

After the [[American Revolution]], the colony of New York—now a state—began westward expansion, looking for habitable land by following trends of the Iroquois.{{Sfn|Thompson|1977|p=140}} Land near fresh water was of considerable importance.{{Sfn|Thompson|1977|p=148}} New York and Massachusetts were fighting for the territory Buffalo lies on, and Massachusetts had the right to purchase all but a one-mile (1600-meter) wide portion of land. The rights to the Massachusetts' territories were sold to [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] in 1791, and two years later to the [[Holland Land Company]].{{Sfn|Sprague|1882|p=19}}{{Sfn|Becker|1906|p=108}}

As a result of the war, in which the Iroquois tribe sided with the [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]],{{Sfn|Thompson|1977|p=141}} Iroquois territory was gradually reduced in the mid-to-late-1700s by European settlers through successive treaties statewide, such as the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]], the [[First Treaty of Buffalo Creek]] (1788), and the Treaty of Geneseo (1797). The Iroquois were corralled onto reservations, including [[Buffalo Creek Reservation|Buffalo Creek]]. By the end of the 18th century, only {{convert|338|mi2|acre km2 ha}} of reservation territory remained.{{Sfn|Brush|1901|p=87}}

Former slave Joseph &quot;Black Joe&quot; Hodges,{{Sfn|Becker|1906|pp=106–108}}{{sfn|Bingham|1931|pp=137–138}} and Cornelius Winney, a Dutch trader from [[Albany, New York|Albany]] who arrived in 1789, were early settlers along the mouth of Buffalo Creek.{{Sfn|Sprague|1882|pp=20, 21}} The first white settlers along the creek were prisoners captured during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].{{Sfn|Becker|1906|p=106–107}} The first resident and landowner{{Sfn|Ketchum|1865|p=141}} of Buffalo with a permanent presence was Captain William Johnston, a white Iroquois interpreter who had been in the area since the days after the Revolutionary War and who the Senecas granted creekside land as a gift of appreciation. His house stood at present-day Washington and Seneca streets.{{Sfn|Bingham|1931|pp=132–134}}

On July 20, 1793, the [[Holland Land Purchase]] was completed, containing the land of present-day Buffalo, brokered by Dutch investors from [[Holland]].{{Sfn|Turner|1849|p=401}} The [[Treaty of Big Tree]] removed Iroquois title to lands west of the [[Genesee River]] in 1797.{{sfn|Bingham|1931|p=145}} In the fall of 1797, [[Joseph Ellicott]], the architect who helped survey Washington D.C. with brother [[Andrew Ellicott|Andrew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recalling Pioneer Days|last=Bartlett|first=George Hunter|publisher=The Buffalo Historical Society|year=1922|isbn=|location=|pages=3|hdl = 2027/wu.89065904492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=John|date=1899|title=Early Maps and Surveyors of the City of Washington, D.

In 1804, Ellicott designed a radial [[grid plan]] that would branch out from the village forming bicycle-like spokes, interrupted by diagonals, like the system used in the nation's capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elmendorf|first=Dwight L.|date=March 1913|title=Washington the Capital|url=|journal=The Mentor|volume=1|page=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the village was the intersection of eight streets, in what would become [[Niagara Square]].

According to an early resident, the village had sixteen residences, a schoolhouse and two stores in 1806, primarily near Main, Swan and Seneca streets.{{Sfn|Turner|1849|p=498}} There were also blacksmith shops, a tavern and a drugstore.{{Sfn|Becker|1906|p=114–115}} The streets were small at 40 feet wide, and the village was still surrounded by woods.{{Sfn|Becker|1906|pp=111, 118}} The first lot sold by the Holland Land Company was on September 11, 1806, to Zerah Phelps.{{Sfn|Bingham|1931|p=493}} By 1808, lots would sell from $25 to $50.{{Sfn|Becker|1906|p=115}}

Like most former industrial cities of the [[Great Lakes]] region in the United States, Buffalo is recovering from an economic depression from suburbanization and the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950 when it was the 15th largest city in the United States, down from the 8th largest city in America in 1900, and its population has been spreading out to the suburbs every census since then.

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the city's population was 50.4% White (45.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 38.6% Black or African-American, 0.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 3.9% from some other race and 3.1% from two or more races, while 10.5% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/3611000.html |title=Buffalo Demographics: 2010 |publisher=quickfacts.census.go |accessdate=November 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504172555/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/3611000.html |archivedate=May 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, there has been an ever-growing number of [[Myanmar|Burmese]] refugees, mostly of the [[Karen people|Karen]] ethnicity, with an estimated 4,665 now residing in Buffalo as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Burma to Buffalo, The refugee wave is changing our city|author1=Zremski, Jerry|author2=Gee, Derek|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=October 16, 2016|url=http://projects.buffalonews.com/long-reads/burma/index.html|accessdate=October 20, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021002747/http://projects.buffalonews.com/long-reads/burma/index.html|archivedate=October 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's [[median household income]] is $24,536 and the median family income is $30,614. Males have a median income of $30,938 versus $23,982 for females. The city's per capita income is $14,991. Of the population 26.6%, and 23% of families, are below the poverty line. Of the total population, 38.4% of those under the age of 18 and 14% of those 65 and older live below the poverty line.

However, unlike the Bills, the Sabres don't have a league championship, having lost the 1975 Stanley Cup to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] and the 1999 Stanley Cup to the [[Dallas Stars]]. Since 2014, both the Bills and Sabres have been owned by [[Terrence Pegula]], a key investor in Buffalo's revitalization efforts.

The Buffalo parks system has over 20 parks with several parks accessible from any part of the city. The Olmsted Park and Parkway System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city parkland is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Constructed in 1868 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his partner [[Calvert Vaux]], the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted-designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and are maintained by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy (BOPC), a non-profit, for public benefit corporation which serves as the city's parks department. It is the first non-governmental organization of its kind to serve in such a capacity in the United States.&lt;ref name=AboutBOPC&gt;{{cite web |title=The Conservancy |url=https://www.bfloparks.org/about/ |publisher=Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy |year=2016 |accessdate=August 24, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013022752/https://www.bfloparks.org/about/ |archivedate=October 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated at the confluence of Lake Erie and the Buffalo and Niagara rivers, Buffalo is a waterfront city. Its rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of [[transshipment]], manufacturing, and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade and industry. Beginning in 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront began to be transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. To this end, [[Buffalo Harbor State Park]], nicknamed &quot;Outer Harbor&quot;, was opened in 2014.&lt;ref name=BuffNews_BHSP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/downtown-waterfront/buffalo8217s-first-state-park-to-start-taking-shape-on-outer-harbor-20140827 |title=Buffalo's first state park to start taking shape on outer harbor |newspaper=The Buffalo News |date=August 27, 2014 |author=Mark Sommer |accessdate=April 12, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905120824/http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/downtown-waterfront/buffalo8217s-first-state-park-to-start-taking-shape-on-outer-harbor-20140827 |archivedate=September 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalo's intent was to stress its architectural and historical heritage to create a tourism destination, and early data indicates they were successful.&lt;ref name=VBN2015BusinessPlan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitbuffaloniagara.com/content/uploads/2015/02/VBN-business-plan-2015.pdf|title=2015 Business Plan|publisher=Visit Buffalo Niagara|year=2015|access-date=August 24, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910075722/http://www.visitbuffaloniagara.com/content/uploads/2015/02/VBN-business-plan-2015.pdf|archivedate=September 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of mayors of Buffalo, New York}}[[File:McKinley Monument, Buffalo, NY - IMG 3702.JPG|thumb|[[Buffalo City Hall]], with [[McKinley Monument]] in the foreground|alt=|225x225px]]
At the [[City (New York)|municipal]] level, the City of Buffalo has a mayor and a council of nine [[city council|councilmembers]]. Buffalo also serves as the seat of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] with some of the 11 members of county legislature representing at least a portion of Buffalo. At the state level, there are three states [[New York State Assembly|assemblymembers]] and two state [[New York State Senate|senators]] representing parts of the city proper. At the federal level, Buffalo is the heart of {{ushr|NY|26}} in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], represented by Democrat [[Brian Higgins]].

In a trend common to northern &quot;[[Rust Belt]]&quot; regions, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] has dominated Buffalo's political life for the last half-century. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was [[Chester A. Kowal]] in 1965. In 1977, Democratic Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] was elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the [[Conservative Party (New York)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Right to Life Party]], after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker [[Arthur Eve]]. Griffin switched political allegiances several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms.

Griffin's successor, Democrat [[Anthony M. Masiello]] (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on [[social conservatism]], often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. However, in 2005, Democrat [[Byron Brown]] was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%–27%) over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform. In 2013, the Conservative Party endorsed Brown for a third term because of his pledge to cut taxes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and on the edge of bankruptcy. At [[New York State Comptroller]] [[Alan Hevesi]]'s urging, the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority, a [[New York state public-benefit corporations|New York State public-benefit corporation]]. Mayor Tony Masiello began conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government the following year, but they came to nought.

The offices of the Buffalo District, [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] are next to the Black Rock Lock in the Erie Canal's Black Rock channel. In addition to maintaining and operating the lock, the District plans, designs, constructs and maintains water resources projects from [[Toledo, Ohio]] to [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]]. These include the [[Mount Morris Dam|flood-control dam]] at [[Mount Morris (town), New York|Mount Morris, New York]], oversight of the lower Great Lakes (Lake Erie and Lake Ontario), review and permitting of wetlands construction, and remedial action for hazardous waste sites. Buffalo is also the home of a major office of the [[National Weather Service]] (NOAA), which serves all of western and much of central New York State. Buffalo is home to one of the 56 national [[List of FBI field offices|FBI field offices]]. The field office covers all of Western New York and parts of the Southern Tier and Central New York. The field office operates several task forces in conjunction with local agencies to help combat issues such as gang violence, terrorism threats and health care fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffalo.fbi.gov/ |title=FBI Buffalo Division |publisher=Buffalo.fbi.gov |date=March 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310043306/http://buffalo.fbi.gov/ |archivedate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buffalo is also the location of the chief judge, [[United States Attorney]] and administrative offices for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York]].

The [[Buffalo Metro Rail]], also operated by the NFTA, is a {{convert|6.4|mi|km}} long,{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} single line [[light rail]] system that extends from Erie Canal Harbor in downtown Buffalo to the University Heights district (specifically, the South Campus of University at Buffalo) in the city's northeastern part.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The line's downtown section runs above ground and is free of charge to passengers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} North of [[Fountain Plaza (Metro Rail)|Fountain Plaza]] Station, at the northern end of downtown, the line moves underground until it reaches its northern terminus at University Heights. Passengers pay a fare to ride this section of the rail.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Two train stations, [[Buffalo-Depew (Amtrak station)|Buffalo-Depew]] and [[Buffalo-Exchange Street Station|Buffalo-Exchange Street]], serve the city and are operated by [[Amtrak]]. Historically, the city was a major stop on through routes between Chicago and New York City through the lower Ontario peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;drury&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Drury |first = George H. |title = The Historical Guide to North American Railroads: Histories, Figures, and Features of more than 160 Railroads Abandoned or Merged since 1930 |publisher = Kalmbach Publishing |year = 1994 |location = [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]] |pages = 91, 229–231|doi = |id = |isbn = 978-0-89024-072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffalo is at the Lake Erie's eastern end and serves as a playground for many personal yachts, sailboats, power boats and watercraft.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} The city's extensive [[breakwall]] system protects its inner and outer harbors, which are maintained at commercial navigation depths for Great Lakes freighters.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} A Lake Erie tributary that flows through south Buffalo is the Buffalo River and Buffalo Creek.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLaren|first=Patrick|last2=Singer|first2=Jill|date=2008-07-01|title=Sediment Transport and Contaminant Behavior in the Buffalo River, New York: Implications for River Management|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|volume=244|pages=954–968|doi=10.2112/06-0802.1|issn=0749-0208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight [[New York State Routes|New York State highways]], one three-digit [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]] and one [[U.S. Highway]] traverse the city of Buffalo. [[New York State Route 5]], commonly referred to as Main Street within the city{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}, enters through [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] as a [[limited-access highway]] and intersects with [[Interstate 190 (New York)|Interstate 190]], a north-south highway connecting [[Interstate 90 in New York|Interstate 90]] in the southeastern suburb of [[Cheektowaga (town), New York|Cheektowaga]] with Niagara Falls. [[NY 354]] (Clinton Street) and [[NY 130]] (Broadway) are east to west highways connecting south and downtown Buffalo to the eastern suburbs of [[West Seneca, New York|West Seneca]] and [[Depew, New York|Depew]]. [[NY 265]] (Delaware Avenue) and [[NY 266]] (Niagara Street and River Road) both start in downtown Buffalo and end in the city of [[Tonawanda (city), New York|Tonawanda]]. One of three U.S. highways in Erie County, the other two being [[U.S. 20]] (Transit Road) and [[U.S. 219]] (Southern Expressway), [[U.S. 62]] (Bailey Avenue) is a north to south trunk road that enters the city through Lackawanna and exits at the [[Amherst, NY|Amherst]] town border at a junction with NY 5. Within the city, the route passes by light industrial developments and high-density areas of the city. Bailey Avenue has major intersections with Interstate 190 and the Kensington Expressway.

Three major expressways serve Buffalo.
