'''''Blue Velvet''''' is a 1986 American [[neo-noir]] [[mystery film]] written and directed by [[David Lynch]]. Blending [[psychological horror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/25-most-disturbing-movies/|title=25 Most Disturbing Movies|publisher=gamesradar.com|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/25-best-horror-movies-since-the-shining/slideshow/21/|title=25 Best Horror Movies Since The Shining|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|date=October 25, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716171902/http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/25-best-horror-movies-since-the-shining/slideshow/21/|archive-date=July 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[film noir]], the film stars [[Kyle MacLachlan]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Dennis Hopper]], and [[Laura Dern]], and is named after [[Bobby Vinton]]'s 1963 [[Blue Velvet (song)|song of the same name]]. The film concerns a young college student who, returning home to visit his ill father, discovers a severed human ear in a field that leads to his uncovering a vast criminal conspiracy and entering a romantic relationship with a troubled [[lounge singer]].

The screenplay of ''Blue Velvet'' had been passed around multiple times in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with several major studios declining it due to its strong sexual and violent content.&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Lynch | first=David | authorlink=David Lynch |others=Edited by Chris Rodley | title=Lynch on Lynch | publisher=[[Faber &amp; Faber]] | date=March 24, 2005 | isbn=978-0-571-22018-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failure of his 1984 film ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'', Lynch made attempts at developing a more &quot;personal story&quot;, somewhat characteristic of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] style displayed in his first film ''[[Eraserhead]]'' (1977). The independent studio [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]], owned at the time by Italian film producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]], agreed to finance and produce the film.

''Blue Velvet'' initially received a divided critical response,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/my-problem-with-blue-velvet |title=My Problem with 'Blue Velvet' |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=October 2, 1986 |accessdate=January 4, 2017}} &quot;...{{nbsp}}with his latest movie, 'Blue Velvet,' [Lynch] finds himself at the center of a national critical firestorm.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; with many stating that its objectionable content served little artistic purpose. Nevertheless, the film earned Lynch his second [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for Best Director, and came to achieve [[cult film|cult status]]. As an example of a director casting against the norm, it was credited for re-launching Hopper's career and for providing Rossellini with a dramatic outlet beyond her previous work as a fashion model and a cosmetics spokeswoman. In the years since, the film has generated significant attention for its thematic symbolism, and is now widely regarded as one of Lynch's major works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/lynchdavid.php |title=David Lynch's Acclaimed Films |publisher=They Shoot Pictures, Don't They |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greatest films of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Blue Velvet (1986) | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_velvet/ | accessdate=June 17, 2007 | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/17/artsfeatures.davidlynch |title=David Lynch: Blue Velvet |last=Malcolm |first=Derek |newspaper=The Guardian |date=February 17, 2000 |accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications including ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[BBC|BBC Magazine]]'' have ranked it among the greatest American films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150720-the-100-greatest-american-films|title=The 100 greatest American films|publisher=BBC|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, it was chosen by the [[American Film Institute]] as one of the [[AFI's 10 Top 10|greatest American mystery films ever made]].

==Plot==
College student Jeffrey Beaumont returns home to [[Lumberton, North Carolina]], after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. Walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams and becomes reacquainted with the detective's daughter, Sandy. After eavesdropping on her father discussing the ear with a colleague, Sandy tells Jeffrey that it somehow relates back to a lounge singer named Dorothy Vallens. Intrigued, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator and steals a spare key while she's distracted by a man in a distinctive yellow [[sport coat]], whom Jeffrey takes to calling &quot;The Yellow Man&quot;.

Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, in which she sings &quot;[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]&quot;; the pair leave early so that Jeffrey can investigate her apartment in her absence. However, Dorothy returns home early, discovers Jeffrey hiding in a closet, and threatens him with a knife. Believing Jeffrey's curiosity to be sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy forces him to undress and [[Fellatio|fellate]]s him. Jeffrey retreats back to the closet when their encounter is interrupted by the arrival of a man named [[Frank Booth (Blue Velvet)|Frank Booth]], who beats and subjects Dorothy to a variety of violent sex acts during the course of a [[sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] game in which he refers to her as &quot;mommy&quot; and himself as &quot;baby&quot; or &quot;daddy&quot;. It becomes apparent that Frank—a [[gangster]]—has abducted Dorothy's husband and child to force her into [[sex slavery]]. After Frank departs, Dorothy makes a romantic overture toward Jeffrey, who leaves. A disturbed Jeffrey relays the experience to Sandy, who tells him about a [[prophetic dream]] in which robins descend from the sky to eat and kill insects that have overrun the world.

Jeffrey returns to Dorothy's apartment, where she confesses an attraction to him and the two enter into a [[sadomasochistic]] sexual relationship in which Dorothy encourages Jeffrey to beat her, though he proves hesitant. Later, Jeffrey observes Frank in the audience at one of Dorothy's shows and begins following him, observing him engaging in [[drug dealing]] and a meeting with the Yellow Man. Jeffrey tells Sandy about his observations and the two briefly kiss; later, Jeffrey returns to Dorothy, who coerces him into a violent sexual encounter that leaves him disturbed.

Frank catches Jeffrey and Dorothy together and abducts them, forcing Jeffrey to accompany him to the home of a criminal associate named Ben, who is holding Dorothy's family hostage. While Frank permits Dorothy to see her husband and son, he forces Jeffrey to watch Ben perform an impromtu [[lip-sync]] of [[Roy Orbison]]'s &quot;[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]&quot;, which causes Frank to suffer a breakdown. Afterwards, he takes Jeffrey to a field, where he gives him a threatening, symbolic kiss before subjecting him to a violent beating.

The next day, Jeffrey goes to the police station, where he realizes that Sandy's father's partner is The Yellow Man, who has been murdering Frank's rival drug dealers and stealing their supplies from the [[evidence room]] for Frank to sell himself. Later, Jeffrey confesses everything to Sandy and the two attend a party together where they admit their feelings for one another. On the way home, they're pursued by an unidentified car and assume it's Frank and his gang. As they arrive at Jeffrey's home, Sandy recognizes the car as that of her boyfriend, Mike. Mike and his gang leap from his car, ready to beat up Jeffrey for stealing Sandy. Before the fight can start, a naked and beaten Dorothy emerges. Though confused, Mike assumes that there's nothing between Jeffrey and Sandy, and he retreats as the two whisk Dorothy to Sandy's house.

Jeffrey asks Sandy to tell her father everything and returns alone to Dorothy's apartment, where he discovers her husband dead and The Yellow Man mortally wounded. Remembering that Frank has a police radio in his car, Jeffrey uses the Yellow Man's [[walkie-talkie]] to lie about his precise location in the apartment; after Frank enters, Jeffrey ambushes and shoots him dead with the Yellow Man's gun.

Sandy's father leads a police raid on Frank's headquarters, killing his men and crippling his criminal empire. Jeffrey and Sandy enter into a relationship and attend a family barbecue with his recuperated father, where they note the presence of a robin consuming a bug, while Dorothy is reunited with her son.

I'd sorta had enough of the woods by the time I left, but still, lumber and lumberjacks, all this kinda thing, that's America to me like the picket fences and the roses in the opening shot.

The film's story originated from three ideas that crystallized in the filmmaker's mind over a period of time starting as early as 1973. The first idea was only &quot;a feeling&quot; and the title ''Blue Velvet'', Lynch told ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'' in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cineaste&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bouzereau |first=Laurent |year=1987 |title=An Interview with David Lynch |journal=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LynchOnLynch&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = Lynch on Lynch | first = Chris | last = Rodley | year = 2005 | publisher = New York: Faber and Faber | isbn = 978-0-571-22018-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second idea was an image of a severed, human ear lying in a field. &quot;I don't know why it had to be an ear. Except it needed to be an opening of a part of the body, a hole into something else&amp;nbsp;... The ear sits on the head and goes right into the mind so it felt perfect,&quot; Lynch remarked in a 1986 interview to ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;LynchOnLynch&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nan |last=Robertson |title=The All-American Guy Behind ''Blue Velvet'' |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 11, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third idea was [[Bobby Vinton]]'s classic rendition of the song ''[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]'' and &quot;the mood that came with that song a mood, a time, and things that were of that time.&quot;&lt;ref name=villagevoice&gt;{{cite news |first=Lizzie |last=Borden |title=The World According to Lynch |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=September 23, 1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch eventually spent two years writing two drafts, which, he stated, were not very good. The problem with them, Lynch has said, was that &quot;there was maybe all the unpleasantness in the film but nothing else. A lot was not there. And so it went away for a while.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot;/&gt;

After completing ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth had read and enjoyed Lynch's ''[[Ronnie Rocket]]'' script, but did not think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. &quot;I told him I had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a [[Film treatment|treatment]]. I went home and thought of the ear in the field.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cineaste&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peary&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Cult Movies 3 | first = Danny | last = Peary | year = 1988 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. | location = New York | pages = 38–42 | isbn = 978-0-671-64810-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was announced in August 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with [[Dino De Laurentiis]] that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; This deal meant that ''Blue Velvet'' was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;/&gt; &quot;After ''Dune'' I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rodley&quot;/&gt; Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Blue Velvet&amp;nbsp;— David Lynch | url=http://www.lynchnet.com/bv/ | accessdate=June 11, 2007 | publisher=LynchNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast of ''Blue Velvet'' included several then-relatively unknown actors. Isabella Rossellini had gained some exposure before the film for her [[Lancôme]] ads in the early 1980s and for being the daughter of actress [[Ingrid Bergman]] and Italian film director [[Roberto Rossellini]]. After completion of the film, during test screenings, [[ICM Partners]]—the agency representing Rossellini—immediately dropped her as a client. Furthermore, the [[nuns]] at the school in Rome that Rossellini attended in her youth called to say they were praying for her.&lt;ref name=&quot;LookingBack&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=David Lynch should be shot&quot;: Looking back on the madness and chaos of &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and Ronald Reagan's '80s|date=March 26, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/03/26/david_lynch_should_be_shot_looking_back_on_the_madness_and_chaos_of_blue_velvet_and_ronald_reagans_80s/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Hopper was the biggest &quot;name&quot; in the film, having starred in ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969), while Kyle MacLachlan had played the central role in Lynch's critical and commercial failure ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'' (1984), a science fiction epic based on [[Dune (novel)|the novel of the same name]]. MacLachlan later became a recurring collaborator with Lynch, who remarked: &quot;Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''GQ'', (for the modern man), Kyle MacLachlan, August 1992, Volume 62, Number 8, pp. 134–137, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Hopper—said to be Lynch's third choice ([[Michael Ironside]] has stated that Frank was written with him in mind)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://horrornews.net/89714/interview-michael-ironside-extraterrestrial/|title= Interview: Michael Ironside (Extraterrestrial)|date= October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;—accepted the role, reportedly having exclaimed, &quot;I've got to play Frank!

Laura Dern, then just 19 years old, was cast after various successful actresses at the time turned it down, including [[Molly Ringwald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Edge of Your Seat: The 100 Greatest Movie Thrillers|first=Douglas|last=Brode|page=52|publisher=Citadel Press|year=2003|isbn=9780806523828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene in which Dorothy appears naked outside was inspired by a real-life experience Lynch had during childhood when he and his brother saw a naked woman walking down a neighborhood street at night. The experience was so traumatic to the young Lynch that it made him cry, and he had never forgotten it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Ebert | first=Roger | title=Biting into ''Blue Velvet'' | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=October 2, 1986 | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19861002/PEOPLE/41216001/1023 | accessdate=February 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Principal photography]] of ''Blue Velvet'' began in August 1985 and completed in November. The film was shot at [[EUE/Screen Gems]] studio in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], which also provided the exterior scenes of Lumberton. The scene with a raped and battered Dorothy proved to be particularly challenging. Several townspeople arrived to watch the filming with picnic baskets and rugs, against the wishes of Rossellini and Lynch. However, they continued filming as normal, and when Lynch yelled cut, the townspeople had left. As a result, police told Lynch they were no longer permitted to shoot in any public areas of Wilmington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Some of Me | first=Isabella | last=Rossellini | year=1997 | publisher=Random House | location=New York | isbn=978-0-679-45252-2 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/someofme00ross }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch's original rough cut ran for approximately four hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue Velvet&quot; /&gt; He was contractually obligated to deliver a two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Velvet''; a two-part search for the film's deleted scenes at [http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s87velvet1.html DVD Talk]. Retrieved July 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made cuts at the request of the [[MPAA]]. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the [[deleted scene]]s, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the [[Blu-ray]] disc release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Blue Velvet Blu-Ray To Include Newly Rediscovered Deleted Footage | url=http://www.filmbuffonline.com/FBOLNewsreel/wordpress/2011/01/24/blue-velvet-blu-ray-to-include-deleted-scenes/ | accessdate=January 24, 2011 | publisher= Film Buff Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.&lt;ref name = BBFC/&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Blue Velvet 1986.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;I guess it means there's trouble until the robins come&quot;: Throughout the film, a dream Sandy had is alluded to, in which the world was full of darkness and turmoil until a group of [[robin (disambiguation)#Birds|robins]] were set free, unleashing blinding light and love. [[Lighting]] is a strong symbolic aspect of the film, illustrated in this second shot which is lit from above before fading out, representing a return to normalcy.]]
Despite ''Blue Velvet''{{'}}s initial appearance as a mystery, the film operates on a number of thematic levels. The film owes a large debt to 1950s [[film noir]], containing and exploring such conventions as the [[femme fatale]] (Dorothy Vallens), a seemingly unstoppable [[villain]] (Frank Booth), and the questionable moral outlook of the hero (Jeffrey Beaumont), as well as its unusual use of shadowy, sometimes dark [[cinematography]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rubin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Thrillers | first=Martin | last=Rubin | year=1999 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | location=Britain | pages=175 | isbn=978-0-521-58839-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Velvet'' represents and establishes Lynch's famous &quot;askew vision&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Johnson | first=J | year=2004 | title=Pervert in the Pulpit: Morality in the Works of David Lynch | pages =38–39 | isbn=978-0-7864-1753-7 | publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and introduces several common elements of Lynch's work, some of which would later become his trademarks, including distorted characters, a polarized world, and debilitating damage to the skull or brain.

The film's thematic framework hearkens back to [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Henry James|James]], and early [[gothic fiction]], as well as films such as ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955) and the entire notion of film noir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denzin&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The cinematic society: The Voyeur's Gaze | first=Norman K. | last=Denzin | year=1995 | publisher=Sage Publications | location=Britain | pages=247 | isbn=978-0-521-58839-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch has called it a &quot;film about things that are hidden—within a small city and within people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalsocietyoffilmcritics&quot; /&gt;

[[Feminist]] psychoanalytic film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]] argues that ''Blue Velvet'' establishes a metaphorical [[Oedipal]] family—&quot;the child&quot;, Jeffrey Beaumont, and his &quot;parents&quot;, Frank Booth and Dorothy Vallens—through deliberate references to film noir and its underlying Oedipal theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulvey&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Cult etherworlds and the Unconscious: Oedipus and ''Blue Velvet''&quot;, Fetishism And Curiosity 3 | first = Laura | last = Mulvey | year = 1996 | publisher = British Film Institute | location = Suffolk | pages = 137–154 | isbn = 978-0-671-64810-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor, Winquist&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Postmodernism | first = Victor E. | last = Taylor | year = 2001 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | pages = 466 | isbn = 978-0-415-15294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting violence, she claims, can be read as symbolic of domestic violence within real families. For instance, Frank's violent acts can be seen to reflect the different types of abuse within families, and the control he has over Dorothy might represent the hold an abusive husband has over his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Blue Velvet | last=Atkinson | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Atkinson (writer) | year=1997 | publisher=British Film Institute | location=London | isbn=978-0-85170-559-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Atkinson reads Jeffrey as an innocent youth who is both horrified by the violence inflicted by Frank, but also tempted by it as the means of possessing Dorothy for himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Cinema of the 1980s| first = Stephan | last = Prince| year = 2007 | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick | pages = 160–167| isbn = 978-0-8135-4034-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkinson takes a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] approach to the film; considering it to be an expression of the traumatised innocence which characterises Lynch's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; He states, &quot;Dorothy represents the sexual force of the mother [figure] because she is forbidden and because she becomes the object of the unhealthy, infantile impulses at work in Jeffrey's [[subconscious]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt;

===Symbolism===
Symbolism is used heavily in ''Blue Velvet''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; The most consistent symbolism in the film is an insect motif introduced at the end of the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]esque paradise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black [[ants]]. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like [[Oxygen mask#Anesthesia oxygen masks|gas mask]] that Frank wears, but also the excuse that Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a [[Yellowjacket|type of wasp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; Finally, a [[American Robin|robin]] eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.

The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers is also a key symbolic element,&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt; leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, the audience is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal until the end of the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Blue Velvet (soundtrack)}}
The ''Blue Velvet'' soundtrack was supervised by [[Angelo Badalamenti]] (who makes a brief cameo appearance as the pianist at the Slow Club where Dorothy performs). The soundtrack makes heavy usage of vintage pop songs, such as [[Bobby Vinton]]'s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; and [[Roy Orbison]]'s &quot;[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]&quot;, juxtaposed with an orchestral score inspired by [[Shostakovich]]. During filming, Lynch placed speakers on set and in streets and played Shostakovich to set the mood he wanted to convey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue Velvet&quot;&gt;''Mysteries of Love: The Making of Blue Velvet'', ''Blue Velvet'' Special Edition DVD documentary, [2002]&lt;/ref&gt; The score makes direct quotations from Shostakovich's [[Symphony No. 15 (Shostakovich)|15th Symphony]], which Lynch had been listening to regularly while writing the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;''Blue Velvet'' film score at [http://www.thecityofabsurdity.com/bluevelvet/bvsound.html &quot;The City of Absurdity&quot;]. Retrieved June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch had originally opted to use &quot;[[Song to the Siren (Tim Buckley song)|Song to the Siren]]&quot; by [[This Mortal Coil]] during the scene in which Sandy and Jeffrey share a dance; however, he could not obtain the rights for the song at the time. He would go on to use this song in ''Lost Highway'', eleven years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/17/song-to-the-siren-classic|title=Song to the Siren's irresistible tang|newspaper=The Guardian|date=November 18, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2016|last1=Aston|first1=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/11/the-saddest-music-in-the-world-174088/|title=The saddest music in the world|work=[[Indiewire]]|date=November 16, 2011|accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked ''Blue Velvet's'' soundtrack on its list of the ''100 Greatest Film Soundtracks'', at the 100th position. Critic John Alexander wrote, &quot;the haunting soundtrack accompanies the title credits, then weaves through the narrative, accentuating the noir mood of the film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;British Film Resource&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Films of David Lynch: 50 Percent Sound | publisher = The British Film Resource | year = 1997 | url=http://www.britishfilm.org.uk/lynch/Schap3.html | accessdate = August 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch worked with music composer [[Angelo Badalamenti]] for the first time in this film and asked him to write a score that had to be &quot;like Shostakovich, be very Russian, but make it the most beautiful thing but make it dark and a little bit scary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chion |first=Michael |year=1995 | title = Blue Velvet | journal=British Film Institute, London |pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badalamenti's success with ''Blue Velvet'' would lead him to contribute to all of Lynch's future full-length films until ''[[Inland Empire (film)|Inland Empire]]'' as well as the cult television program ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Blue Velvet'' premiered in competition at the [[Montréal World Film Festival]] in August 1986, and at the [[Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto Festival of Festivals]] on September 12, 1986, and a few days later in the United States. It debuted commercially in both countries on September 19, 1986, in 98 theatres across the United States. In its opening weekend, the film grossed a total of $789,409. It eventually expanded to another 15 theatres, and domestically grossed a total of $8,551,228.&lt;ref name=&quot;BoxOfficeMojo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Blue Velvet | website=[[Box Office Mojo]] | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bluevelvet.htm | accessdate=October 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blue Velvet'' was met with uproar during its audience reception, with lines formed around city blocks in New York City and Los Angeles. There were reports of mass walkouts and refund demands during its opening week. At a Chicago screening, a man fainted and had to have his [[pacemaker]] changed. Upon completion, he returned to the cinema to see the ending. At a Los Angeles cinema, two strangers became engaged in a heated disagreement, but decided to resolve the disagreement to return to the theatre.&lt;ref name=&quot;LookingBack&quot; /&gt;

It was also released internationally, in Australia, most of [[West Germany]], China, Canada, Hong Kong, and Japan, followed by subsequent video releases. The film performed well overseas, grossing $900,000 in Australia, and $450,139 in Hong Kong.

===Critical reception===
''Blue Velvet'' was released to a polarized reception in the United States. The critics who did praise the film were often vociferous.&lt;ref name=&quot;LookingBack&quot; /&gt; ''The New York Times'' critic [[Janet Maslin]] directed much praise toward the performances of Hopper and Rossellini: &quot;Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best understood in terms of sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems to be exactly what's called for.&quot; She called it &quot;an instant cult classic&quot;. Maslin concluded by saying that ''Blue Velvet'' &quot;is as fascinating as it is freakish. It confirms Mr. Lynch's stature as an innovator, a superb technician, and someone best not encountered in a dark alley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Maslin | first = Janet | title = Blue Velvet, Comedy of the Eccentric | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 19, 1986 | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9A0DE3D61E38F93AA2575AC0A960948260 | accessdate = October 30, 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sheila Benson]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film &quot;the most brilliantly disturbing film ever to have its roots in small-town American life,&quot; describing it as &quot;shocking, visionary, rapturously controlled&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blue-velvet|title=Blue Velvet (1986) Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Gene Siskel]] included ''Blue Velvet'' on his list of the best films of 1986, at the fifth spot. [[Peter Travers]], film critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', named it the best film of the 1980s and referred to it as an &quot;American masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot; /&gt;

However, the film was not without its detractors. Paul Attanasio of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said &quot;the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents&quot; and that Angelo Badalamenti &quot;contributes an extraordinary score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score,&quot; but stated that Lynch &quot;isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Attanasio | first = Paul | title = Blue Velvet | work = [[The Washington Post]] |date=September 19, 1986 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/bluevelvetrattanasio_a0ad54.htm | accessdate = October 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A general criticism from U.S. critics was ''Blue Velvet''{{'}}s often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence.

And when you ask an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebert&quot; /&gt; While Ebert in later years came to consider Lynch a great filmmaker, his negative view of ''Blue Velvet'' remained unchanged after he revisited it in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper: Webchat with Roger Ebert |date=August 2, 2007 |accessdate=August 24, 2009 |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/chat/transcript-ebert-070802.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017161603/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/chat/transcript-ebert-070802.html |archivedate=October 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Roger Ebert's Twitter Feed | date = January 20, 2009 | accessdate = January 20, 2010 | url = https://twitter.com/ebertchicago/status/8010331149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is now considered a masterpiece and has a &quot;Certified Fresh&quot; score of 93% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 74 reviews with an average rating of 8.75/10. The critical consensus states: &quot;If audiences walk away from this subversive, surreal shocker not fully understanding the story, they might also walk away with a deeper perception of the potential of film storytelling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_velvet/|title=Blue Velvet|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]]|accessdate=July 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also has a score of 76 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blue-velvet|title=Blue Velvet|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 9, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking back in his ''Guardian/Observer'' review, critic Philip French wrote, &quot;The film is wearing well and has attained a classic status without becoming respectable or losing its sense of danger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = French | first = Philip | title = Blue Velvet | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = December 16, 2001 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,619471,00.html | accessdate = October 30, 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Kermode]] walked out on the film and gave the film a poor review upon its release, but revised his view of the film over time. In 2016, he remarked, &quot;as a film critic, it taught me that when a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, you have to be very careful about assessing it ... I didn't walk out on ''Blue Velvet'' because it was a bad film. I walked out on it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kermodeandmayo|title=Kermode Uncut: Blue Velvet|date=December 2, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=251DlvLXzD4|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it initially gained a relatively small theatrical audience in North America and was met with controversy over its artistic merit, ''Blue Velvet'' soon became the center of a &quot;national firestorm&quot; in 1986, and over time became an American classic. In the late 1980s, and early 1990s, after its release on videotape, the film became a widely recognized [[cult film]], for its dark depiction of a suburban America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/b/blue_velvet.html | title = Blue Velvet | last=Berardinelli |first=James | authorlink = James Berardinelli | publisher = Reelviews | accessdate = August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Boston Globe]] | title = Blue Velvet already a classic | date = April 12, 1987 | url =https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59484290.html | accessdate=July 5, 2012 | first=Jay | last=Carr}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its many VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases, the film reached broader American audiences. It marked David Lynch's entry into the Hollywood mainstream and Dennis Hopper's comeback. Hopper's performance as Frank Booth has itself left an imprint on popular culture, with countless tributes, cultural references and parodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =  https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/aug/04/dennis-hopper-blue-velvet-screening | title = Hopper mad: Blue Velvet screening prompts Lynchian tributes to Dennis | last=Walters |first=Ben | work = The Guardian | accessdate = August 25, 2012 | location=London | date=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's success also helped Hollywood address previously censored issues, as ''Psycho'' (1960) had. ''Blue Velvet'' has been frequently compared to that ground-breaking film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taschen Books&quot; /&gt; It has become one of the most significant, well-recognized films of its era, spawning countless imitations and parodies in media. The film's dark, stylish and erotic production design has served as a benchmark for a number of films, parodies and even Lynch's own later work, notably ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' (1990–91), and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001). [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine cited it as one of the most &quot;influential American films&quot;, as did [[Michael Atkinson (writer)|Michael Atkinson]], who dedicated a book to the film's themes and motifs.&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkinson&quot; /&gt;
