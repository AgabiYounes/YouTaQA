The '''2001 United Kingdom general election''' was held on Thursday 7 June 2001, four years after [[1997 United Kingdom general election|the previous election on 1 May 1997]], to elect [[List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election|659 members]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. Under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was re-elected to serve a second term in government with another landslide victory, returning 413 of the 418 seats won by the party in the previous general election in 1997, a net loss of five seats, though with a significantly lower turnout than before—59.4%, compared to 71.3% at the previous election. Blair went on to become the first Labour [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] to serve a consecutive full term in office. As Labour retained much of their 1997 [[landslide victory]], the 2001 election was dubbed &quot;the quiet landslide&quot; by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parkinson|first1=Justin|title=The rise and fall of New Labour|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-10518842|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was little change outside [[Northern Ireland]], with 620 out of the 641 seats in [[Great Britain]] electing candidates from the same party as they did in 1997. Factors contributing to the Labour victory included a strong economy, falling unemployment, and public perception that the Labour government had delivered on many key election pledges that it had made in 1997.

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], under [[William Hague]]'s leadership, was still deeply divided on the issue of [[European Union|Europe]] and the party's policy platform had drifted considerably to the [[right-wing politics|right]]. A series of publicity stunts that backfired also harmed Hague, and he resigned as party leader three months later, becoming the first Leader of the Conservative and Unionist Party in the House of Commons since [[Austen Chamberlain]] nearly eighty years prior not to serve as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].

The election was largely a repeat of the 1997 general election, with Labour losing only 6 seats overall and the Conservatives making a net gain of one seat (gaining nine seats but losing eight). The Conservatives did manage to gain [[Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (UK Parliament constituency)|a seat]] in [[Scotland]], which ended the party's status as an &quot;[[England]]-only&quot; party in the prior parliament, but once again were left unrepresented in [[Wales]]. Although they did not gain many seats, three of the few new MPs elected were future Conservative [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]] [[David Cameron]] and [[Boris Johnson]] and future Conservative [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[George Osborne]]; who would serve in the same Cabinet as Cameron from 2010 to 2016. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] gained six seats.

The 2001 general election is the last to date in which any government has held an overall majority of more than 100 seats in the House of Commons, and one of only two since the [[World War II|Second World War]] (the other being 1997) in which a single party won over 400 MPs. It was also the last election at which Labour secured over 40% of the popular vote until the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]]. Notable departing MPs included former Prime Ministers [[Edward Heath]] and [[John Major]], former Deputy Prime Minister [[Michael Heseltine]], former Cabinet ministers [[Tony Benn]] and [[Peter Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville|Peter Brooke]], and [[Ken Livingstone]].

Change was seen in Northern Ireland, with the moderately [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) losing four seats to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). This transition was mirrored in the nationalist community with the moderate [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) losing votes to the more staunchly [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] [[Sinn Féin]].

The election was also marked by exceptionally low voter turnout, falling below 60% for the first (and so far, only) time since [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Audickas |first1=Lukas |last2=Cracknell |first2=Richard |title=UK Election Statistics: 1918–2018: 100 Years of Elections |url=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7529/CBP-7529.pdf |page=25 |date=13 December 2018 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |department=Briefing Paper Number CBP7529 |access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election was broadcast live on the [[BBC]] and presented by [[David Dimbleby]], [[Jeremy Paxman]], [[Andrew Marr]], [[Peter Snow]], and [[Anthony King (political scientist)|Tony King]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6weF6Q37F2w&amp;feature=mfu_in_order&amp;playnext=1&amp;videos=UsHbCo8smUk| BBC Vote 2001 Coverage&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 general election was notable for being the first in which pictures of the party logos appeared on the ballot paper. Prior to this, the ballot paper had only displayed the candidate's name, address, and party name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/ballot-paper-vote-voting-slip-for-post-posting-postal-vote-news-photo/466659381 |title=General Election 2001 postal vote ballot paper voting slip |last=Overs |first=Jeff |date=1 June 2001 |publisher=BBC News &amp; Current Affairs |via=Getty Images |id=466659381 |access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The election had been expected on 3 May, to coincide with [[2001 United Kingdom local elections|local elections]], but on 2 April 2001, both were postponed to 7 June because of rural movement restrictions imposed in response to the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|foot-and-mouth outbreak]] that had started in February.

The elections were marked by voter apathy, with turnout falling to 59.4%, the lowest (and first under 70%) since the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|Coupon Election]] of 1918. Throughout the election the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had maintained a significant lead in the opinion polls and the result was deemed to be so certain that some [[bookmaker]]s paid out for a Labour majority before the election day. However, the opinion polls the previous autumn had shown the first Tory lead (though only by a narrow margin) in the opinion polls for eight years as they benefited from the public anger towards the government over the [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|fuel protests]] which had led to a severe shortage of motor fuel.

By the end of 2000, however, the dispute had been resolved and Labour were firmly back in the lead of the opinion polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1322000/1322211.stm |work=BBC News |title=Tories 'to cut fuel duty' |date=10 May 2001 |accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, a mere 29 parliamentary seats changed hands at the 2001 Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2001 also saw the rare election of an independent. [[Richard Taylor (British politician)|Dr. Richard Taylor]] of [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] (usually now known simply as &quot;Health Concern&quot;) unseated a government MP, [[David Lock]], in [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]]. There was also a high vote for [[British National Party]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] in [[Oldham West and Royton (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham West and Royton]], in the wake of recent [[2001 Oldham riots|race riots]] in the town of [[Oldham]].

In [[Northern Ireland]], the election was far more dramatic and marked a move by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] away from support for the [[Good Friday Agreement]], with the moderate unionist [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) losing to the more hardline [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). This polarisation was also seen in the nationalist community, with the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) vote losing out to more left-wing and republican [[Sinn Féin]]. It also saw a tightening of the parties as the small [[UK Unionist Party]] lost its only seat.

==Campaign==
For Labour, the last four years had run relatively smoothly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} The party had successfully defended all their [[List of United Kingdom by-elections|by election]] seats, and many suspected a Labour win was inevitable from the start.

Many in the party, however, were afraid of voter apathy, which was epitomised in a poster of &quot;Hague with [[Margaret Thatcher|Lady Thatcher]]'s hair&quot;, captioned &quot;Get out and vote. Or they get in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/election2001/poster/0,,498578,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420050156/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/election2001/poster/0,,498578,00.html |archive-date=20 April 2017 |location=London |work=The Guardian |title='Get out and vote. Or they get in.' – Election 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite recessions in mainland Europe and the United States, due to the bursting of global tech bubbles, Britain was notably unaffected and Labour however could rely on a strong economy as unemployment continued to decline toward election day, putting to rest any fears of a Labour government putting the economic situation at risk.

For William Hague, however, the Conservative Party had still not fully recovered from the loss in 1997. The party was still divided over Europe, and talk of a referendum on [[United Kingdom and the euro|joining the Eurozone]] was rife. As Labour remained at the political centre, the Tories moved to the right. A policy gaffe by [[Oliver Letwin]] over public spending cuts left the party with an own goal that Labour soon exploited.

Margaret Thatcher also added to Hague's troubles when speaking out strongly against the Euro to applause. Hague himself, although a witty performer at PMQs, was dogged in the press and reminded of his speech at Conservative Conference at the age of 16. ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper only added to the Conservatives' woes by backing Labour for a second consecutive election, calling Hague a &quot;dead parrot&quot; during the [[Conservative Party Conference (UK)|Conservative Party's conference]] in October 1998.&lt;ref&gt;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ThhguC97EdA/STaU-tJdVzI/AAAAAAAAASA/GVBGsJaLKAI/s400/PARROT-HAGUE.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Sun prints Tories' obituary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/187130.stm |work=BBC News Online |location=London |date=7 October 1998 |access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McElvoy |first=Anne |authorlink=Anne McElvoy |date=7 October 1998 |title=Hague's parrot is not dead, he's just resting – with the odd squawk |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/hagues-parrot-is-not-dead-hes-just-resting-with-the-odd-squawk-1176592.html |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tories campaigned on a strongly right-wing platform, emphasising the issues of Europe, immigration and tax, the fabled [[Norman Tebbit|&quot;Tebbit Trinity&quot;]]. However, Labour countered by asking where the proposed tax cuts were going to come from, and decried the Tory policy as &quot;cut here, cut there, cut everywhere&quot;, in reference to the widespread belief that the Conservatives would make major cuts to public services in order to fund tax cuts.

[[Charles Kennedy]] contested his first election as leader of the Liberal Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393329.stm | work=BBC News | title=2001: Labour claims second term | date=5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
During the election Sharron Storer, a resident of [[Birmingham]], criticised Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in front of television cameras about conditions in the [[National Health Service]]. The widely televised incident happened on 16 May during a campaign visit by Blair to the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] in Birmingham. Sharron Storer's [[domestic partner|partner]], Keith Sedgewick, a cancer patient with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and therefore highly susceptible to infection, was being treated at the time in the [[bone marrow]] unit, but no bed could be found for him and he was transferred to the casualty unit for his first 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British Government and Politics: A Comparative Guide |author=Duncan Watts|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MiTDykvtbEkC&amp;pg=PA320|isbn=978-0-7486-2323-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334131.stm|title=BBC NEWS – VOTE2001 – Ambush upset Blair's day|date=16 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1334000/1334903.stm|title=BBC NEWS – VOTE2001 – Cancer patient's partner confronts Blair|date=17 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polling==
{{Main|Opinion polling for the 2001 United Kingdom general election}}

==Results==
The election result was effectively a repeat of 1997, as the Labour Party retained an overwhelming majority with [[BBC]] announcing the victory at 02:58 on the early morning of 8 June. Having presided over relatively serene political, economic and social conditions, the feeling of prosperity in the United Kingdom had been maintained into the new millennium, and Labour would have a free hand to assert its ideals in the subsequent parliament. Despite the victory, voter apathy was a major issue, as turnout fell below 60%, 12 percentage points down on 1997. All three of the main parties saw their total votes fall, with Labour's total vote dropping by 2.8 million on 1997, the Conservatives 1.3 million, and the Liberal Democrats 428,000. Some suggested this dramatic fall was a sign of the general acceptance of the status quo and the likelihood of Labour's majority remaining unassailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1383000/1383403.stm | work=BBC News | title=The poll that never was | date=11 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Conservatives, this huge loss they had sustained in 1997 was repeated. Despite gaining nine seats, the Tories lost seven to the Liberal Democrats, and one even to Labour. [[William Hague]] was quick to resign, doing so at 07:44 outside the Conservative Party headquarters. Some believed that Hague had been unlucky; although most considered him to be a talented orator and an intelligent statesman, he had come up against the charismatic [[Tony Blair]] in the peak of his political career, and it was no surprise that little progress was made in reducing Labour's majority after a relatively smooth parliament.

Staying at what they considered rock bottom, however, showed that the Conservatives had failed to improve their negative public image, had remained somewhat disunited over Europe, and had not regained the trust that they had lost in the 1990s. But in Scotland, despite gaining one seat from the [[Scottish National Party]], their vote collapse continued. They failed to retake former strongholds in Scotland as the Nationalists consolidated their grip on the Northeastern portion of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/vote2001/hi/english/newsid_1377000/1377378.stm | work=BBC News | title=Labour romps home again | date=8 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Liberal Democrats could point to steady progress under [[Charles Kennedy]], gaining more seats than the main two parties—albeit only six overall—and maintaining the performance of a pleasing 1997 election, where the party had doubled its number of seats from 20 to 46. While they had yet to become electable as a government, they underlined their growing reputation as a worthwhile alternative to Labour and Conservative, offering plenty of debate in Parliament and representing more than a mere protest vote.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The SNP failed to gain any seats and lost a seat to the Conservatives by just 79 votes. [[Plaid Cymru]] both gained a seat from Labour and lost one to them.

In [[2001 United Kingdom general election results in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] the Ulster Unionists, despite gaining North Down, lost five other seats.
