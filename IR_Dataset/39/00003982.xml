}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an intermediate form in the [[deprotonation]] of [[carbonic acid]]. It is a [[Polyatomic ion|polyatomic]] [[anion]] with the chemical formula {{chem|[[Hydrogen|H]]|[[Carbon|C]]|[[Oxygen|O]]|3|-}}.

Bicarbonate serves a crucial biochemical role in the physiological [[pH]] [[buffering solution|buffering]] system.&lt;ref name=&quot;veq&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/medph/intro.html | publisher = Biology.arizona.edu | date = October 2006 | title = Clinical correlates of pH levels: bicarbonate as a buffer | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150531000344/http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/medph/intro.html | archivedate = 2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;bicarbonate&quot; was coined in 1814 by the English chemist [[William Hyde Wollaston]].&lt;ref&gt;William Hyde Wollaston (1814) &quot;A synoptic scale of chemical equivalents,&quot; ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', '''104''':  1-22.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uYdJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On page 11], Wollaston coins the term &quot;bicarbonate&quot;:  &quot;The next question that occurs relates to the composition of this crystallized carbonate of potash, which I am induced to call bi-carbonate of potash, for the purpose of marking more decidedly the distinction between this salt and that which is commonly called a subcarbonate, and in order to refer at once to the double dose of carbonic acid contained in it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The prefix &quot;bi&quot; in &quot;bicarbonate&quot; comes from an outdated naming system and is based on the observation that there is twice as much [[carbonate]] ({{Chem|CO|3|2-}}) per sodium ion in [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and other bicarbonates than in [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and other carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem99/chem99492.htm|title=Classroom Resources - Argonne National Laboratory|website=www.newton.dep.anl.gov|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226223438/http://newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/chem99/chem99492.htm|archivedate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name lives on as a [[trivial name]].

According to the Wikipedia article [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry]], the prefix '''bi–''' is a deprecated way of indicating the presence of a single '''hydrogen''' ion. The recommended nomenclature today mandates explicit referencing of the presence of the single hydrogen ion: '''sodium hydrogen carbonate''' or '''sodium hydrogencarbonate'''. A parallel example is [[sodium bisulfite]] (NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Chemical properties==

The bicarbonate ion (hydrogencarbonate ion) is an [[anion]] with the [[empirical formula]] {{Chem|HCO|3|-}} and a molecular mass of 61.01&amp;nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|daltons]]; it consists of one central carbon [[atom]] surrounded by three oxygen atoms in a [[trigonal planar]] arrangement, with a hydrogen atom attached to one of the oxygens. It is [[isoelectronic]] with [[nitric acid]]&amp;nbsp;{{chem|HNO|3}}. The bicarbonate ion carries a negative one [[formal charge]] and is an [[Amphoterism#Amphiprotic molecules|amphiprotic]] species which has both acidic and basic properties. It is both the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]] of [[carbonic acid]]&amp;nbsp;{{chem|H|2|CO|3}}; and the [[conjugate acid]] of {{chem|CO|3|2−}}, the [[carbonate]] ion, as shown by these [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:

:{{chem|CO|3|2−}} + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} {{Chem|HCO|3|-}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2  OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} {{Chem|HCO|3|-}} + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} {{chem|CO|3|2−}} + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

A bicarbonate salt forms when a [[cation|positively charged ion]] attaches to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the ion, forming an [[ionic compound]]. Many bicarbonates are [[solubility|soluble]] in [[aqueous solution|water]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]]; in particular, sodium bicarbonate contributes to [[total dissolved solids]], a common parameter for assessing [[water quality]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Physiological role==
[[File:Riassorbimento bicarbonati e respirazione cellulare.svg|450px|thumbnail|right|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced as a waste product of the oxidation of sugars in the mitochondria reacts with water in a reaction catalyzed by [[carbonic anhydrase]] to form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is in equilibrium with the cation H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and anion HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. It is then carried to the lung, where the reverse reaction occurs and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas is released. In the kidney (left), cells (green) lining the proximal tubule conserve bicarbonate by transporting it from the glomerular filtrate in the lumen (yellow) of the nephron back into the blood (red). The exact stoichiometry in the kidney is omitted for simplicity.]]{{clear left}}
Bicarbonate ({{Chem|HCO|3|-}}) is a vital component of the [[pH]] [[Buffer solution|buffering system]]&lt;ref name=&quot;veq&quot; /&gt; of the human body (maintaining [[acid–base homeostasis]]). 70%–75% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the body is converted into [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which is the [[conjugate acid]] of {{Chem|HCO|3|-}} and can quickly turn into it.

With carbonic acid as the [[Reaction intermediate|central intermediate]] [[Chemical species|species]], bicarbonate – in conjunction with water, [[hydronium|hydrogen ions]], and [[carbon dioxide]] – forms this buffering system, which is maintained at the volatile equilibrium&lt;ref name=&quot;veq&quot; /&gt; required to provide prompt resistance to pH changes in both the acidic and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] directions. This is especially important for protecting [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] of the [[central nervous system]], where pH changes too far outside of the normal range in either direction could prove disastrous (see [[acidosis]] or [[alkalosis]]).

Bicarbonate also serves much in the digestive system. It raises the internal pH of the stomach, after highly acidic digestive juices have finished in their digestion of food. Bicarbonate also acts to regulate pH in the small intestine. It is released from the [[pancreas]] in response to the hormone [[secretin]] to neutralize the acidic [[chyme]] entering the duodenum from the stomach.&lt;ref&gt;Berne &amp; Levy, ''Principles of Physiology''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bicarbonate in the environment==
Bicarbonate is the dominant form of [[Total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] in sea water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The chemistry of ocean acidification : OCB-OA|url=http://www.whoi.edu/OCB-OA/page.do?pid=112136|website=www.whoi.edu|publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|accessdate=17 May 2017|language=en-NZ|date=24 September 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519193604/http://www.whoi.edu/OCB-OA/page.do?pid=112136|archivedate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in most fresh waters. As such it is an important sink in the [[carbon cycle]].

In freshwater ecology, strong [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] activity by freshwater plants in daylight releases gaseous [[oxygen]] into the water and at the same time produces bicarbonate ions. These shift the pH upward until in certain circumstances the degree of alkalinity can become toxic to some organisms or can make other chemical constituents such as [[ammonia]] toxic. In darkness, when no photosynthesis occurs, respiration processes release carbon dioxide, and no new bicarbonate ions are produced, resulting in a rapid fall in pH.

==Other uses==
The most common salt of the bicarbonate ion is [[sodium bicarbonate]], NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is commonly known as [[baking soda]]. When heated or exposed to an [[acid]] such as [[acetic acid]] ([[vinegar]]), sodium bicarbonate releases [[carbon dioxide]]. This is used as a [[leavening agent]] in [[baking]].

The flow of bicarbonate ions from rocks weathered by the carbonic acid in rainwater is an important part of the [[carbon cycle]].

[[Ammonium bicarbonate]] is used in [[digestive biscuit]] manufacture.

==Diagnostics==
In [[diagnostic medicine]], the [[blood value]] of bicarbonate is one of several indicators of the state of [[acid–base physiology]] in the body. It is measured, along with [[carbon dioxide]], [[chloride]], [[potassium]], and [[sodium]], to assess [[electrolyte]] levels in an [[electrolyte panel]] test (which has [[Current Procedural Terminology]], CPT, code 80051).

The parameter ''standard bicarbonate concentration'' (SBC&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) is the bicarbonate concentration in the blood at a [[PaCO2|P&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] of {{convert|40|mmHg|kPa|2|abbr=on}}, full oxygen saturation and 36&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u13/u1312_03.htm Acid Base Balance (page 3)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613020114/http://www.nda.ox.ac.uk/wfsa/html/u13/u1312_03.htm |date=2002-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
