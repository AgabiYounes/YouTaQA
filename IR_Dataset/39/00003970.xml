It is the second largest airline in the United Kingdom, based on fleet size and passengers carried, behind [[easyJet]]. In January 2011 BA merged with [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]], creating the [[International Airlines Group]] (IAG), a [[holding company]] registered in [[Madrid]], Spain. IAG is the world's third-largest airline group in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest in Europe. It is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and in the [[FTSE 100 Index]]. British Airways is the first passenger airline to have generated more than [[United States dollar|$]]1 billion on a single air route in a year (from 1 April 2017, to 31 March 2018, on the [[London Heathrow to New York JFK Air Route|New York JFK - London Heathrow]] route).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielreed/2018/07/09/for-real-new-york-london-is-the-worlds-first-billion-dollar-route-for-british-airways/|title=New York-London Is The World's First Billion-Dollar Airline Route|last=Reed|first=Dan|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=29 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BA was created in 1974 after a British Airways Board was established by the British government to manage the two nationalised airline corporations, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] and [[British European Airways]], and two regional airlines, [[Cambrian Airways]] from [[Cardiff]], and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|Northeast Airlines]] from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. On 31 March 1974, all four companies were merged to form British Airways. However, it is marking 2019 as its centenary based on predecessor companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mediacentre.britishairways.com/pressrelease/details/86/2019-319/10551|title=BRITISH AIRWAYS' CENTENARY LAUNCHES WITH A LOVE LETTER TO BRITAIN FEATURING THE BEST OF BRITISH TALENT|last=Airways|first=British|website=mediacentre.britishairways.com|language=en|access-date=15 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After almost 13 years as a state company, BA was privatised in February 1987 as part of a wider privatisation plan by the [[Second Thatcher ministry|Conservative government]]. The carrier expanded with the acquisition of [[British Caledonian]] in 1987, [[Dan-Air]] in 1992, and [[British Midland International]] in 2012. Its preeminence highlights the reach of the country's influence as many of its destinations in several regions were historically part of the British Empire.

It is a founding member of the [[Oneworld]] airline alliance, along with [[American Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Qantas]], and the now-defunct [[Canadian Airlines]]. The alliance has since grown to become the third-largest, after [[SkyTeam]] and [[Star Alliance]].

==History==
{{Main|History of British Airways}}
[[File:British Airways Boeing 747-100 in BOAC basic livery Marmet.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 747-100]] in BOAC-British Airways transition livery. The 747-100 variant was launched in 1966.]]

Proposals to establish a joint British airline, combining the assets of the [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and [[British European Airways]] (BEA) were first raised in 1953 as a result of difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate air rights through the British colony of [[Cyprus]]. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary [[Cyprus Airways]] to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the [[Middle East]]. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of a merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the time, [[Rab Butler]]. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Higham, ''Speedbird: The Complete History of BOAC'' (London: IB Tauris, 2013) p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report that a new British Airways Board, managing both BEA and BOAC, and the two regional British airlines [[Cambrian Airways]] based at Cardiff, and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|Northeast Airlines]] based at Newcastle upon Tyne, was constituted on 1 April 1972.&lt;ref&gt;''Airliner World (Cambrian Airways – The Welsh Dragon: New routes and turboprops)'', Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, September 2012, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Although each airline's branding was maintained initially, two years later the British Airways Board unified its branding, effectively establishing British Airways as an airline on 31 March 1974.&lt;ref name = EOP7&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1970-1979/public/en_gb|publisher=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1970–1979|accessdate=6 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618043935/http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1970-1979/public/en_gb|archive-date=18 June 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following two years of fierce competition with [[British Caledonian]], the second-largest airline in the [[United Kingdom]] at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers would no longer compete on long-haul routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201427.html |title = UK abandons long-haul competition |work = Flight International |date = 7 August 1975 |page = 173 |access-date = 30 June 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315044020/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201427.html |archive-date = 15 March 2012 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways and [[Air France]] operated the [[supersonic]] airliner [[Concorde|Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde]], and the world's first [[supersonic]] passenger service flew in January 1976 from [[London Heathrow]] to [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name = 'Concordeintro3'&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=inkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PeADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5479,5052446|title=Concorde starts regular service|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date= 26 January 1976|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services to the US began on 24 May 1976 with a flight to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles]] airport, and flights to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]] airport followed on 22 September 1977. Service to Singapore was established in co-operation with [[Singapore Airlines]] as a continuation of the flight to Bahrain.&lt;ref name = EOP7/&gt; Following the [[Air France Flight 4590|Air France Concorde crash]] in Paris and a slump in air travel following the [[11 September attacks]] in New York in 2001, it was decided to cease Concorde operations in 2003 after 27 years of service. The final commercial Concorde flight was BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 24 October 2003.&lt;ref name = EOP2000&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-2000-present/public/en_gb|title=Explore Our Past:2000 – present|work=British Airways|accessdate=20 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424172652/http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-2000-present/public/en_gb|archive-date=24 April 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 the airline was instructed to prepare for privatisation by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Second Thatcher ministry|Thatcher]] government. [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Sir John King]], later Lord King, was appointed chairman, charged with bringing the airline back into profitability. While many other large airlines struggled, King was credited with transforming British Airways into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4896070.html |title=A-Z of Employers |work=The Independent |date=12 February 1998 |first=Rachelle |last=Thackray |accessdate=27 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102054517/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4896070.html |archivedate=2 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag carrier was privatised and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/danair-swallowed-up-by-ba-rivals-say-competition-and-choice-will-be-cut-by-takeover-that-will-axe-1900-jobs-1559258.html|title=After much fanfare, the sale of British Airways set to begin|work=The Independent|last=Marshall|first=Tyler|date=24 October 1992|location=London|access-date=25 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925082235/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/danair-swallowed-up-by-ba-rivals-say-competition-and-choice-will-be-cut-by-takeover-that-will-axe-1900-jobs-1559258.html|archive-date=25 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Airways effected the takeover of the UK's &quot;second&quot; airline, British Caledonian, in July of that same year.&lt;ref name = BAP&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1980-1989/public/en_gb|work=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1980–1989|accessdate=8 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419123453/http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1980-1989/public/en_gb|archive-date=19 April 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Atlantic]] in 1984 created a competitor for BA. The intense rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic culminated in the former being sued for libel in 1993, arising from claims and counterclaims over a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign against Virgin. This campaign included allegations of poaching Virgin Atlantic customers, tampering with private files belonging to Virgin and undermining Virgin's reputation in the City. As a result of the case BA management apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot;, and the company agreed to pay £110,000 damages to Virgin, £500,000 to Branson personally and £3&amp;nbsp;million legal costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirtytricks&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=BA dirty tricks against Virgin cost £3m|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/11/newsid_2520000/2520189.stm|publisher=BBC: On This Day|date=11 January 1993|accessdate=23 October 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307120257/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/11/newsid_2520000/2520189.stm|archive-date=7 March 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord King stepped down as chairman in 1993 and was replaced by his deputy, Colin Marshall, while [[Robert Ayling|Bob Ayling]] took over as CEO.&lt;ref name = EOP9/&gt; Virgin filed a separate action in the US that same year regarding BA's domination of the trans-Atlantic routes, but it was thrown out in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirtytricks&quot; /&gt;

In 1992 British Airways expanded through the acquisition of the financially troubled [[Dan-Air]], giving BA a much larger presence at Gatwick airport. [[British Asia Airways]], a subsidiary based in Taiwan, was formed in March 1993 to operate between London and [[Taipei]]. That same month BA purchased a 25% stake in the Australian airline [[Qantas]] and, with the acquisition of [[Brymon Airways]] in May, formed British Airways Citiexpress (later [[BA Connect]]).&lt;ref name = EOP9&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1990-1999/public/en_gb|work=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1990–1999|accessdate=8 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417001437/http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1990-1999/public/en_gb|archive-date=17 April 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1998, British Airways, along with [[American Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]], Qantas, and [[Canadian Airlines]], formed the [[Oneworld]] [[airline alliance]]. Oneworld began operations on 1 February 1999, and is the third-largest airline alliance in the world, behind [[SkyTeam]] and Star Alliance.&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt;

Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by cabin crew over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew would strike until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident.&lt;ref name = CCSA&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/15/british-airways-strike-background|work=The Guardian|title=BA strike: conflict that was always on airline's flight path|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=4 July 2010|location=London|first=Dan|last=Milmo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908174204/http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/15/british-airways-strike-background|archive-date=8 September 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|authors=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca |chapter=chapter 5 |accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, wildcat action was taken by union members over a decision by [[Gate Gourmet]] not to renew the contracts of 670 workers and replace them with agency staff; it is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30&amp;nbsp;million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4162036.stm|title=Gate Gourmet probes union claims|work=BBC News|date=18 August 2005|accessdate=23 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118195017/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4162036.stm|archive-date=18 January 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, BA became involved in a [[British Airways cross controversy|civil rights dispute]] when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the [[christian cross|cross]], a religious symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman to sue BA in necklace row|work=BBC News|date=15 October 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6052608.stm|accessdate=23 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115182209/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6052608.stm|archive-date=15 November 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA's practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly questioned by British politicians such as the former [[Home Secretary]] [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] and the former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Lucy |last = Cockcroft |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/7028261/BA-wrong-to-ban-Christian-from-wearing-cross-because-it-plays-into-extremists-hands.html |title = BA 'wrong' to ban Christian from wearing cross because it 'plays into extremists' hands' |work = The Telegraph |date = 19 January 2010 |access-date = 2 April 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160415125723/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/7028261/BA-wrong-to-ban-Christian-from-wearing-cross-because-it-plays-into-extremists-hands.html |archive-date = 15 April 2016 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Jane |last = Merrick |author2 = Sam Greenhill |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-418268/Jack-Straw-joins-chorus-condemnation-BAs-cross-ban.html |title = Jack Straw joins chorus of condemnation over BA's 'cross' ban |work = Daily Mail |date = 24 November 2006 |access-date = 1 November 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131127143853/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-418268/Jack-Straw-joins-chorus-condemnation-BAs-cross-ban.html |archive-date = 27 November 2013 |url-status = live |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations have been turbulent between BA and Unite. In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes to be imposed by BA management. The strike was called off at the last minute, British Airways losing £80&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name = CCSA/&gt; In December 2009, a ballot for strike action over Christmas received a high level of support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8411214.stm|title=British Airways cabin crew vote for Christmas strike|work=BBC News|date=14 December 2009|accessdate=24 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219065442/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8411214.stm|archive-date=19 December 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal.

Except the [[Boeing 707]] and early [[Boeing 747]] variants from BOAC, British Airways inherited a mainly UK-built fleet of aircraft when it was formed in 1974. The airline introduced the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Boeing 757]] into the fleet in the 1980s, followed by the [[Boeing 747-400]], [[Boeing 767]] and [[Boeing 777]] in the 1990s.

Later in 2007, BA announced their order of thirty-six new long-haul aircraft, including twelve [[Airbus A380]]s and twenty-four [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;baorder&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=BA opts for A380 and Dreamliner|date=27 September 2007|work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7015621.stm|accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolls-Royce Trent]] engines were again selected for both orders with Trent 900s powering the A380s and Trent 1000s powering the 787s. The Boeing 787s will replace 14 of British Airways' Boeing 767 fleet, while the Airbus A380s will replace 20 of BA's Boeing 747-400s and will most likely be used to increase capacity on key routes from London Heathrow.

On 1 August 2008, BA announced orders for six Boeing 777-300ERs and options for four more as an interim measure to cover for delays over the deliveries of their 787-8/9s. Of the six that have been ordered, four will be leased and two will be fully acquired by British Airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/money/2008/08/01/bcnba301.xml|title=BA warns that ticket prices will jump as routes are axed|last=Dunkley|first=Jamie|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=1 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|History of British Airways#Liveries and logos}}
[[File:British Airways (Landor livery) Boeing 747-436 G-BNLY (City of Swansea) departing JFK Airport.jpg|thumb|One of the four retro liveries to celebrate the 100th anniversary of British Airways and its predecessors. This aircraft (registered as G-BNLY) is painted in the [[Landor Associates]] design.]]
The aeroplanes that British Airways inherited from the four-way merger between BOAC, BEA, Cambrian, and Northeast were temporarily given the text logo &quot;British airways&quot; but retained the original airline's livery. With its formation in 1974, British Airways' aeroplanes were given a new white, blue, and red colour scheme with a stylized [[Union Jack]] painted on their tail fins, designed by Negus &amp; Negus. In 1984, a new livery designed by [[Landor Associates]] updated the airline's look as it prepared for privatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ray |last=Moseley |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474804971.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+12%2C+1986&amp;author=Ray+Moseley+Chicago+Tribune&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=British+Airways+scores+big+profit+turnaraound&amp;pqatl=google |title=British Airways scores big profit turnaraound |work=Chicago Tribune |date=12 January 1986 |access-date=5 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208074507/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474804971.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+12%2C+1986&amp;author=Ray+Moseley+Chicago+Tribune&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=British+Airways+scores+big+profit+turnaraound&amp;pqatl=google |archive-date=8 February 2013 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; For celebrating centenary, BA announced four retro liveries...three on Boeing 747-400 aircraft (one in each of BOAC, Negus &amp; Negus, and Landor Associates liveries), and one A319 in BEA livery.

[[File:British Airways (27078321943).jpg|thumb|right|Current BA aircraft bear ''Chatham Dockyard Union flag'' tail art.]]
In 1997, there was a controversial change to a new Project Utopia livery; all aircraft used the corporate colours consistently on the fuselage, but tailfins bore one of multiple designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/by-their-tailfins-shall-we-know-them-1256015.html|title=By their tailfins shall we know them?|work=The Independent|date=15 June 1997|first=Hugh|last=Aldersey-Williams|accessdate=28 June 2010|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104142727/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/by-their-tailfins-shall-we-know-them-1256015.html|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people spoke out against the change, including the former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who famously covered the tail of a model 747 at an event with a handkerchief, to show her displeasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1324788.stm |title=BA turns tail on colours |work=BBC News |date=11 May 2001 |accessdate=6 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207175655/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1324788.stm |archive-date=7 December 2008 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; BA's traditional rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of the negative press coverage by applying the Union flag to the winglets of their aircraft along with the slogan &quot;Britain's national flagcarrier&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60450784|title=Tony Parsons' column: Don't Jack it in yet|work=The Mirror|date=14 June 1999|last=Parsons|first=Tony|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the CEO of British Airways, [[Bob Ayling]], announced that all BA planes would adopt the tailfin design ''Chatham Dockyard Union Flag'' originally intended to be used only on the Concorde, based on the Union Flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/union-jack-is-back-on-the-worlds-favourite-airline-1098648.html|title=Union Jack is back on the world's favourite airline|work=The Independent|date=7 June 1999|accessdate=28 June 2010|location=London|first=Warwick|last=Mansell|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108044023/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/union-jack-is-back-on-the-worlds-favourite-airline-1098648.html|archive-date=8 November 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; All BA aircraft have since borne the ''Chatham Dockyard Union flag'' variant of the Project Utopia livery, except for the four retro aircraft.

===Loyalty programmes===

British Airways' tiered loyalty programme, called the Executive Club, includes access to special lounges and dedicated &quot;fast&quot; queues.&lt;ref name=execclub&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/consumer_affairs/article711216.ece|title=Now you can fly further with air loyalty plans|work=The Times |accessdate=13 June 2009| first=Jessica | last=Bown | date=30 April 2006 | location=London}}
&lt;/ref&gt; BA also invites its top corporate accounts to join a &quot;Premier&quot; incentive programme. British Airways operates airside lounges for passengers travelling in premium cabins, and these are available to certain tiers of Executive Club members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/lounges/public/en_gb|title=Lounges|work=British Airways|accessdate=17 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831102449/http://www.britishairways.com/travel/lounges/public/en_gb|archive-date=31 August 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; First class passengers, as well as Gold Executive Club members, are entitled to use First Class Lounges.

==Incidents and accidents==
British Airways is known to have a strong reputation for safety and was rated as one of the top 20 safest airlines globally in 2017 and 2018 according to [[Business Insider]] and AirlineRatings.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.com/safest-airlines-in-the-world-for-2018-2017-12|title=The 20 safest airlines in the world|last=Zhang |first=Benjamin |date= 1 November 2018|website=Business Insider |access-date= 31 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.com/safest-airlines-in-the-world-for-2019-2019-1|title=The 21 safest airlines in the world|last=Zhang |first=Benjamin |date= 3 January 2019|website=Business Insider |access-date= 31 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since BA's inception in 1974, it has been involved in three hull-loss incidents ([[British Airways Flight 149]] was destroyed on the ground at [[Kuwait International Airport]] as a result of military action during the [[First Gulf War]] with no one on board) and two hijacking attempts. To date, the only fatal accident experienced by a BA aircraft occurred in 1976 with [[British Airways Flight 476]] which was involved in a midair collision later attributed to an error made by [[air traffic control]].

[[File:BA38 Crash.jpg|thumb|The damaged British Airways Flight 38, photographed on 17 January 2008.]]
* On 22 November 1974, British Airways Flight 870 was hijacked shortly after take-off from [[Dubai]] for London Heathrow. The [[Vickers VC10]] landed at [[Tripoli]] for refuelling before flying on to Tunis. The captain, Jim Futcher, returned to the aircraft to fly it knowing the hijackers were on board. A hostage, 43-year-old German banker Werner Gustav Kehl, was shot in the back. The hijackers eventually surrendered after 84 hours. Futcher was awarded the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]], the [[Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators]] Founders Medal, the [[British Air Line Pilots Association]] Gold Medal and a Certificate of Commendation from British Airways for his actions during the hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/25/archives/hijackers-free-all-but-3-in-crew-at-tunis-airport-threaten-to-blow.html|title=Hijackers Free All but 3 in Crew at Tunis Airport|last=|first=|date=1974-11-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106000428/https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/25/archives/hijackers-free-all-but-3-in-crew-at-tunis-airport-threaten-to-blow.html|archive-date=2019-11-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00715FE3B5F137B93C4AB178AD95F408785F9|title=Four Hijackers Surrender; Tunisian Aide Denies Deal; Passengers in London|date=26 November 1974|work=The New York Times|accessdate=28 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605132729/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00715FE3B5F137B93C4AB178AD95F408785F9|archive-date=5 June 2011}}https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F0DE4DF103BE63BBC4E51DFB767838F669EDE {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306030210/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F0DE4DF103BE63BBC4E51DFB767838F669EDE|date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Medals&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2055787/Captain-Jim-Futcher.html|title=Captain Jim Futcher|date=31 May 2008|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=31 May 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531150513/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2055787/Captain-Jim-Futcher.html|archive-date=31 May 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110789977|title=WORLD NEWS|date=27 November 1974|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|accessdate=6 November 2019|issue=13,923|location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia|volume=49|page=6|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 10 September 1976, a [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Trident 3B]] on [[1976 Zagreb mid-air collision|British Airways Flight 476]] departed from London Heathrow to Istanbul. It collided in mid-air with an [[Inex Adria]] [[McDonnell-Douglas DC-9|DC9-31]] near [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yMUVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4hEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6621,1799120|title=Worst midair crash ever claims 176 in Yugoslavia|work=Milwaukee Sentinel|date=11 September 1976|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 54 passengers and 9 crew members on the BA aircraft died. This is the only fatal accident to a British Airways aircraft since the company's formation in 1974.
* On 24 June 1982, [[British Airways Flight 9]], a Boeing 747-200 registration ''G-BDXH'', flew through a cloud of volcanic ash and dust from the eruption of [[Galunggung|Mount Galunggung]]. The ash and dust caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/683277272.html?dids=683277272:683277272&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+25%2C+1982&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Jet+Safe+After+Heart-Stopping%2C+Dead-Engine+Dive&amp;pqatl=google|title=Jet Safe After Heart-Stopping, Dead-Engine Dive|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 June 1982|accessdate=28 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604203513/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/683277272.html?dids=683277272:683277272&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+25,+1982&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Jet+Safe+After+Heart-Stopping,+Dead-Engine+Dive&amp;pqatl=google|archive-date=4 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had to be shut down again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched to such an extent that it was difficult for the pilots to see out of the plane. However, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at [[Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport]] just outside [[Jakarta]]. There were no fatalities or injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Box&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Faith|first=Nicholas|title=Black Box|work=Boxtree|origyear=1996 |year=1998|isbn=978-0-7522-2118-2|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 10 June 1990, [[British Airways Flight 5390]], a [[BAC One-Eleven]] flight between [[Birmingham]] and [[Málaga]], suffered a windscreen blowout due to the fitting of incorrect bolts the previous day. The Captain suffered major injuries after being partially blown out of the aircraft, but the co-pilot landed the plane safely at [[Southampton Airport]].&lt;ref name=OgdenInterview&gt;{{Cite news|title=This is your captain screaming (interview with Nigel Ogden)|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 February 2005|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/World/This-is-your-captain-screaming/2005/02/04/1107476802601.html|accessdate=21 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410002719/http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/This-is-your-captain-screaming/2005/02/04/1107476802601.html|archive-date=10 April 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 2 August 1990, [[British Airways Flight 149]] landed at [[Kuwait International Airport]] four hours after the Iraqi invasion of [[Kuwait]]. The aircraft, a [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-100]] ''G-AWND'', was destroyed, and all passengers and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/395492.stm|title=BA loses Iraq hostage appeal|work=BBC News|date=15 July 1999|accessdate=2 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303203622/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/395492.stm|archive-date=3 March 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6055048.stm|title=UK hostages describe Kuwait ordeal|work=BBC News |date=16 October 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 29 December 2000, [[British Airways Flight 2069]] was en route from London to Nairobi when a mentally ill passenger entered the cockpit and grabbed the controls. As the pilots struggled to remove the intruder, the [[Boeing 747-400]] stalled twice and banked to 94 degrees. Several people on board were injured by the violent manoeuvres, which briefly caused the aircraft to descend at 30,000&amp;nbsp;ft per minute{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}. The man was finally restrained with the help of several passengers, and the co-pilot regained control of the aircraft. The flight landed safely in Nairobi.
* On 17 January 2008, [[British Airways Flight 38]], a [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] ''G-YMMM'', from [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing]] to London crash-landed approximately {{convert|1000|ft|m}} short of London Heathrow Airport's runway 27L, and slid onto the runway's [[displaced threshold]]. The aircraft sustained damage to its landing gear, wing roots and engines, resulting in the first hull loss of a Boeing 777. There were no fatalities, but there was one serious injury and 12 minor injuries. The accident was caused by icing in the fuel system, resulting in a loss of power.&lt;!--PLEASE SEE the discussion at WT:AV re the INCIDENT ON 24 MAY before adding it here--&gt;
* On 24 May 2013, British Airways Flight 762, using an [[Airbus A319-131]] and registered as G-EUOE, returned to [[London Heathrow Airport]] after fan cowl doors detached from both engines shortly after takeoff. During the approach a fire broke out in the right engine and persisted after the engine was shut down. The aircraft landed safely with no injuries to the 80 people on board. A preliminary accident report revealed that the cowlings had been left unlatched following overnight maintenance. The separation of the doors caused airframe damage and the right hand engine fire resulted from a ruptured fuel pipe.
* On 22 December 2013, British Airways Flight 34, a Boeing 747–436 ''G-BNLL'', hit a building at [[O. R. Tambo International Airport]] in [[Johannesburg]] after missing a turning on a taxiway. The starboard wing was severely damaged but there were no injuries amongst the crew or 189 passengers, however four members of ground staff were injured when the wing smashed into the building.&lt;ref name=Tel10534084&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/10534084/British-Airways-plane-collides-with-building-at-Johannesburg-airport.html |title=British Airways plane collides with building at Johannesburg airport |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 December 2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223225530/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/10534084/British-Airways-plane-collides-with-building-at-Johannesburg-airport.html |archive-date=23 December 2013 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was officially withdrawn from service in February 2014.&lt;ref name=BASourceBNLL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebasource.com/british-airways-b747-400-g-bnll-officially-withdrawn/ |title=British Airways B74i7-400 G-BNLL Officially Withdrawn. |publisher=The BA Source |date=22 February 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227140005/http://www.thebasource.com/british-airways-b747-400-g-bnll-officially-withdrawn/ |archive-date=27 February 2014 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
