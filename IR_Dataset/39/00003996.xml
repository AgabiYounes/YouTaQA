[[File:Motorboat at Kankaria lake.JPG|thumb|right|A recreational [[motorboat]] with an [[outboard motor]]]]

A '''boat''' is a [[watercraft]] of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a [[ship]], which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.

Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, such as the [[whaleboat]], were intended for use in an offshore environment. In modern [[Navy|naval]] terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.  Anomalous definitions exist, as [[lake freighter]]s {{convert|1000|ft|m}} long on the [[Great Lakes]] are called &quot;boats&quot;.

Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions. [[Canoe]]s have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport. [[Fishing boat]]s vary widely in style partly to match local conditions. [[Pleasure boat|Pleasure craft]] used in [[boating|recreational boating]] include ski boats, [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoon boats]], and [[sailboat]]s. [[House boat]]s may be used for vacationing or long-term residence. [[Lighter (barge)|Lighters]] are used to convey cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore. [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|Lifeboat]]s have rescue and safety functions.

Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g. [[rowboat]]s and [[pedalo|paddle boats]]), wind  (e.g. [[sailboat]]s), and motor (including [[gasoline]], [[diesel engine|diesel]], and electric).

==Types==
[[File:সারি সারি পাল তোলা নৌকা.jpg|thumb|right|Boats with sails in Bangladesh]]
{{main|List of boat types}}
Boats can be categorized into three main types:
# Unpowered or human-powered. Unpowered craft include [[raft]]s meant for one-way downstream travel. Human-powered boats include [[canoe]]s, [[kayak]]s, [[gondola]]s and boats propelled by poles like a [[Punt (boat)|punt]].
# [[Sailboat]]s, propelled mainly by means of [[sail]]s.
# [[Motorboat]]s, propelled by mechanical means, such as [[engine]]s.

==Terminology==
{{details|Glossary of nautical terms}}
The [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] is the main, and in some cases only, structural component of a boat.  It provides both capacity and [[buoyancy]]. The [[keel]] is a boat's &quot;backbone&quot;, a lengthwise structural member to which the perpendicular frames are fixed. On most boats a [[deck (ship)|deck]] covers the hull, in part or whole. While a [[ship]] often has several decks, a boat is unlikely to have more than one. Above the deck are often [[Lifeline (safety)|lifelines]] connected to [[stanchion]]s, [[Bulwark (nautical)|bulwark]]s perhaps topped by [[Gunnel (ship element)|gunnel]]s, or some combination of the two. A [[cabin (ship)|cabin]] may protrude above the deck forward, aft, along the centerline, or covering much of the length of the boat. Vertical structures dividing the internal spaces are known as [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s.

The forward end of a boat is called the [[bow (ship)|bow]], the aft end the [[stern]]. Facing forward the right side is referred to as [[starboard]] and the left side as [[Port and starboard|port]].

Until the mid-19th century most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although [[Reed (plant)|reed]], bark and animal skins were also used. Early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in Ancient Egypt, the [[birch bark]] [[canoe]], the animal hide-covered [[kayak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Streever |first= Bill |title= Cold: Adventures in the World's Frozen Places |url= https://archive.org/details/coldadventuresin00stre |url-access= registration |location= New York |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |year= 2009 |page= [https://archive.org/details/coldadventuresin00stre/page/154 154]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[coracle]] and the [[dugout canoe]] made from a single log.

By the mid-19th century, many boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. In 1855 ferro-cement boat construction was patented by the French, who coined the name &quot;ferciment&quot;. This is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boat's hull and covered over with cement. Reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structure it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode. These materials and methods were copied all over the world and have faded in and out of popularity to the present time.

As the forests of Britain and Europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats, and the [[Bessemer process]] ([[patent]]ed in 1855) cheapened the cost of steel, steel ships and boats began to be more common. By the 1930s boats built entirely of steel from frames to plating were seen replacing wooden boats in many industrial uses and fishing fleets. Private recreational boats of steel remain uncommon. In 1895 WH Mullins produced steel boats of galvanized iron and by 1930 became the world's largest producer of pleasure boats.

Mullins also offered boats in aluminum from 1895 through 1899 and once again in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;WH Mullins boat history, Salem Ohio&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref}} but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that [[aluminium]] gained widespread popularity. Though much more expensive than steel, aluminum alloys exist that do not corrode in salt water, allowing a similar load carrying capacity to steel at much less weight.

Around the mid-1960s, boats made of [[fiberglass]] (aka &quot;glassfibre&quot;) became popular, especially for recreational boats. Fiberglass is also known as &quot;GRP&quot; (glass-reinforced plastic) in the UK, and &quot;FRP&quot; (for fiber-reinforced plastic) in the US. Fiberglass boats are strong, and do not rust, corrode, or rot. Instead, they are susceptible to structural degradation from sunlight and extremes in temperature over their lifespan. Fiberglass structures can be made stiffer with sandwich panels, where the fiberglass encloses a lightweight core such as balsa&lt;ref&gt;.. as in the [[Iroqois]] [[catamaran]]&lt;/ref&gt; or foam.

[[Cold moulding]] is a modern construction method, using wood as the structural component. In cold moulding very thin strips of wood are layered over a form. Each layer is coated with resin, followed by another directionally alternating layer laid on top. Subsequent layers may be stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous, or weighted or vacuum bagged to provide compression and stabilization until the resin sets.

==Propulsion==
{{See also|Marine propulsion}}
The most common means of boat propulsion are as follows:
* Engine
** [[Inboard motor]]
** [[Stern drive]] (Inboard/outboard)
** [[Outboard motor]]
** [[Paddle wheel]]
** Water jet ([[jetboat]], [[personal water craft]])
** Fan ([[hovercraft]], [[air boat]])
* Man ([[Watercraft rowing|rowing]], [[Watercraft paddling|paddling]], [[setting pole]] etc.)
* Wind ([[Sails|sail]]ing)

==Buoyancy==
{{Main|Buoyancy}}

A boat [[displacement (fluid)|displaces]] its weight in water, regardless whether it is made of wood, steel, fiberglass, or even concrete.  If weight is added to the boat, the volume of the hull drawn below the waterline will increase to keep the balance above and below the surface equal.  Boats have a natural or designed level of buoyancy.  Exceeding it will cause the boat first to ride lower in the water, second to take on water more readily than when properly loaded, and ultimately, if overloaded by any combination of structure, cargo, and water, sink.
