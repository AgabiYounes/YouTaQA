'''Christoph Ludwig Agricola''' (November 5, 1667 – August 8, 1719) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Landscape art|landscape painter]] and etcher. He was born and died at [[Regensburg]] (Ratisbon).

==Life and career==
Christoph Ludwig Agricola was born on 5 November 1667 at Regensburg in Germany. He trained, as many painters of the period did, by studying nature.&lt;ref&gt;Viardot, L., ''An Illustrated History of Painters of All Schools'', Sampson, Low, Marston, Searle, &amp; Rivington, 1877, p. 258; Kugler, F., ''Handbook of Painting: The German, Flemish, and Dutch Schools,'' Volume 2, J. Murray, 1874, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt;  

He  spent a great part of his life in travel, visiting England, the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], and residing for a considerable period at [[Naples]], where he may have been influenced by [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Agricola, Christoph Ludwig,&quot; ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Agricola,_Christoph_Ludwig Online:]; Viardot, L., ''An Illustrated History of Painters of All Schools'', Sampson, Low, Marston, Searle, &amp; Rivington, 1877, p. 258; Kugler, F., Waagen, F.G. and Crowe, J.A., ''The German, Flemish and Dutch Schools of Painting'',  Volume 2, J. Murray, 1911, p. 567 &lt;/ref&gt; He also stayed for some years circa 1712 in [[Venice]], where he painted many works for the patron [[Zaccaria Sagredo]].&lt;ref&gt;Boni, Page 8&lt;/ref&gt; 

He died in Regensburg in 1719. 

==Work==
Although he primarily worked in gouache and oils, documentary sources reveal that he also produced a small number of etchings.&lt;ref&gt;Ottley, W., ''Notices of Engravers, and Their Works, being the Commencement of a new Dictionary, which it is not intended to continue, containing some account of upwards of three hundred masters, etc,'' 1831&lt;/ref&gt; He was a good draughtsman, used warm lighting and exhibited a warm, masterly brushstroke.&lt;ref&gt;Kugler, F., ''Handbook of Painting: The German, Flemish, and Dutch Schools,'' Volume 2, J. Murray, 1874, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt;  

His numerous landscapes, chiefly cabinet pictures, are remarkable for fidelity to nature, and especially for their skilful representation of varied phases of climate, especially nocturnal scenes and weather anomalies such as thunderstorms.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Agricola, Christoph Ludwig,&quot; ''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Agricola,_Christoph_Ludwig Online:]; Koziel, A., &quot;The Forgotten Star of Wroclaw: A Few Words about the Work of Christian Johann Bendeler (1699-1728)&quot; in: Šeferisová Loudová, M., Kroupa, J. and   Lubomír, K.,  ''Orbis artium: k jubileu Lubomíra Slavíčka'',  Vol. 1, Brno, Masarykova Univerzita, 2009, pp. 219-233 [https://digilib.phil.muni.cz/bitstream/handle/11222.digilib/123956/SpisyFF_382-2009-1_22.pdf?sequence=1 PDF Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; In composition his style shows the influence of [[Nicolas Poussin]], while in light and colour he imitates [[Claude Lorrain]]. His work often displays the idealistic scenes associated with his former mentor, Poussin. &lt;ref&gt;Macfall, H., ''The Renaissance in the North; and the Flemish Genius,'' [Volume 4 in the series, ''History of Painting''], Dana Estes and Company, 2004, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; His compositions include ruins of ancient buildings in the foreground, but his favourite figure for the foreground was men dressed in Oriental attire.&lt;ref&gt;Kugler, F., ''Handbook of Painting: The German, Flemish, and Dutch Schools,'' Volume 2, J. Murray, 1874, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt;  He also produced a series of etchings of birds. &lt;ref&gt;''Watercolours, Pictures and Prints of Birds'' [Auction Catalogue], Christie, Manson &amp; Woods, 1989, pp 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

His pictures can be found in [[Dresden]], [[Braunschweig]], [[Vienna]], [[Florence]], Naples and many other towns of both Germany and [[Italy]].

==Legacy==
He probably tutored the artist, [[Johann Theile]], and had an enormous influence on him.&lt;ref&gt;Killy,  W. and Vierhaus, R., ''Thibaut - Zycha'',  Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 2; Kugler, F., Waagen, F.G. and Crowe, J.A., ''The German, Flemish and Dutch Schools of Painting'',  Volume 2, J. Murray, 1911, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians have also noted that the work of the landscape painter, Christian Johann Bendeler (1699-1728), was also influenced by Agricola. &lt;ref&gt;Koziel, A., &quot;The Forgotten Star of Wroclaw: A Few Words about the Work of Christian Johann Bendeler (1699-1728)&quot; in: Šeferisová Loudová, M., Kroupa, J. and   Lubomír, K.,  ''Orbis artium: k jubileu Lubomíra Slavíčka'',  Vol. 1, Brno, Masarykova Univerzita, 2009, pp. 219-233 [https://digilib.phil.muni.cz/bitstream/handle/11222.digilib/123956/SpisyFF_382-2009-1_22.pdf?sequence=1 PDF Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;
