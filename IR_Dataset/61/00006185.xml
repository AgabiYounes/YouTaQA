'''Charles Elwood Yeager''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|eɪ|ɡ|ər}}; born February 13, 1923) is a former [[United States Air Force]] officer, [[flying ace]], and record setting [[test pilot]]. In 1947, he became the first pilot in history confirmed to have exceeded the [[speed of sound]] in level flight.

Yeager's career began in [[World War II]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]].{{#tag:ref|Yeager had not been in an airplane prior to January 1942, when his Engineering Officer invited him on a test flight after maintenance of an [[Beechcraft Model 18|AT-11]]. He related that he got really sick on the flight: &quot;After puking all over myself I said, 'Yeager, you made a big mistake'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title = My First Time |magazine = [[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]] |volume = 17 |issue = 2 |date = June–July 2002 |page = 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942 he entered [[Enlisted rank|enlisted]] pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of [[flight officer]] (the World War II USAAF equivalent to [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officer]]), later achieving most of his aerial victories as a [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]] [[fighter pilot]].

After the war, Yeager became a test pilot of many types of aircraft, including experimental rocket-powered aircraft. As the first human to officially break the [[sound barrier]], on October 14, 1947, he flew the experimental [[Bell X-1]] at [[Mach number|Mach]] 1 and an altitude of {{convert|45,000|ft|m|sigfig=3}}, for which he won both the [[Collier Trophy|Collier]] and [[Mackay Trophy|Mackay]] trophies in 1948. He then went on to break several other speed and altitude records.

Yeager later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in Germany, as well as in [[Southeast Asia]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. In recognition of the outstanding performance ratings of those units, he was promoted to [[brigadier general]] in 1969. Yeager's three war active duty flying career spans more than 30 years and has taken him to many parts of the world, including the [[Soviet Union]] during the height of the [[Cold War]].

==Early life and education==
Yeager was born February 13, 1923, to farming parents Susie Mae (Sizemore) and Albert Hal Yeager in [[Myra, West Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Ken |last = Sullivan |publisher = West Virginia Humanities Council |year = 2006 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g0cUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Albert+Hal+and+Susie+Mae+Sizemore+Yeager%22&amp;dq=%22Albert+Hal+and+Susie+Mae+Sizemore+Yeager%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqn92PqIjeAhWBl-AKHeqmAcsQ6AEIFjAA |title= The West Virginia Encyclopedia |access-date=October 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015192316/https://books.google.ca/books?id=g0cUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Albert+Hal+and+Susie+Mae+Sizemore+Yeager%22&amp;dq=%22Albert+Hal+and+Susie+Mae+Sizemore+Yeager%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqn92PqIjeAhWBl-AKHeqmAcsQ6AEIFjAA |archive-date=October 15, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from high school in [[Hamlin, West Virginia]], in June 1941.

His first experience with the military was as a teen at the [[Citizens Military Training Camp]] at [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], during the summers of 1939 and 1940.

==Career==

===World War II===
Yeager enlisted as a private in the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on September 12, 1941, and became an aircraft mechanic at [[George Air Force Base]], [[Victorville, California]]. At enlistment, Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than three months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards. Having unusually sharp vision (a [[visual acuity|visual acuity rated 20/10]]), which once enabled him to shoot a deer at {{convert|600|yd}},&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_297&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 297|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeager displayed natural talent as a pilot and was accepted for flight training.

Yeager received his wings and a promotion to [[Warrant Officer (United States)#Flight Officer|flight officer]] at [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke Field]], [[Arizona]], where he graduated from class 43C on March 10, 1943. Assigned to the [[357th Fighter Group]] at [[Tonopah, Nevada]], he initially trained as a fighter pilot, flying [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]s (being grounded for seven days for clipping a farmer's tree during a training flight),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine = Take Off |number = 36 |page = 991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and shipped overseas with the group on November 23, 1943.

[[File:P51-1 300.jpg|thumb|[[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51D-20NA]], ''Glamorous Glen III'', is the aircraft in which Yeager achieved most of his aerial victories.]]
Stationed in the United Kingdom at [[RAF Leiston]], Yeager flew [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]]s in combat with the [[363d Fighter Squadron]]. He named his aircraft ''Glamorous Glen''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chuck Yeager downs five – becomes an 'Ace in a Day' |date=n.d. |access-date=July 7, 2015 |website=World War II Today |url=http://ww2today.com/12-october-1944-chuck-yeager-downs-five-becomes-an-ace-in-a-day |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121114735/http://ww2today.com/12-october-1944-chuck-yeager-downs-five-becomes-an-ace-in-a-day |archive-date=January 21, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=12 October 1944 |date=n.d. |access-date=July 7, 2015 |website=This Day in Aviation |url=http://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/363d-fighter-squadron/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707233503/http://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/363d-fighter-squadron/ |archive-date=July 7, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; after his girlfriend, Glennis Faye Dickhouse, who became his wife in February 1945. Yeager had gained one victory before he was shot down over France in his first aircraft (P-51B-5-NA s/n 43-6763) on March 5, 1944 during his eighth mission.&lt;ref name=EscapeEvasion&gt;{{cite web |url = http://narademo.umiacs.umd.edu/cgi-bin/isadg/viewitem.pl?item=105467 |title = Escape and Evasion Case File for Flight Officer Charles (Chuck) E.

During his stay with the ''Maquis'', Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat; he helped construct bombs for the group, a skill that he had learned from his father.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_45&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 45|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for helping a B-24 navigator, &quot;Pat&quot; Patterson, who was shot in the knee during the escape attempt, to cross the [[Pyrenees]]. Yeager cut off the tendon by which Patterson's leg was hanging below the knee, then tied off the leg with a spare shirt made of parachute silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TWveOFiCUrcC&amp;dq=master+of+air|title=Masters of the Air: America's Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany|last=Miller|first=Donald L.|date= 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9780743235457|language=en |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a regulation prohibiting &quot;evaders&quot; (escaped pilots) from flying over enemy territory again, the purpose of which was to prevent a second capture from compromising resistance groups, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. He had joined another evader, fellow P-51 pilot 1st Lt Fred Glover,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Disney |first = Ryan |title = Escape &amp; Evasion Report No. 686: The True Story of an American Fighter Pilot's Escape from Nazi-Occupied France |publisher = Amazon Digital Services |year = 2016 |asin = B01N9LBA0H }}&lt;/ref&gt; in speaking directly to the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], on June 12, 1944. With Glover pleading their case, they argued that because the Allies had invaded France and the ''Maquis'' were by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops, if Yeager or Glover were shot down again, there was little about those who had previously helped them evade capture that could be revealed to the enemy.

Eisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot, along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school. In part, because of his maintenance background, he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.

Yeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On October 12, 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make &quot;[[ace in a day]],&quot; downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman. Yeager said both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter, a German [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] that he shot down as it was on final approach for landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/chuck-yeager-fighter-pilot/|last=Niderost|first=Eric|title=Chuck Yeager: Fighter Pilot|website=Warfare History Network|access-date=March 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329064304/http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/chuck-yeager-fighter-pilot/|archive-date=March 29, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckyeager.com/yeager-destroys-an-me-262|title=Encounter Report|date=November 6, 1944|access-date=March 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222114645/http://www.chuckyeager.com/yeager-destroys-an-me-262|archive-date=February 22, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that &quot;atrocities were committed by both sides&quot;, and he said he went on a mission with orders from the [[Eighth Air Force]] to &quot;strafe anything that moved.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfgang W.

Yeager was commissioned a [[US Second Lieutenant|second lieutenant]] while at Leiston, and was promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Air Force)|captain]] before the end of his tour. He flew his 61st and final mission on January 15, 1945 and returned to the United States in early February. As an evader, he received his choice of assignments and, because his new wife was pregnant, chose [[Wright Field]] to be near his home in West Virginia. His high number of flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft, which brought him under the command of Colonel [[Albert Boyd]], head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_60&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 60|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Test pilot – breaking the sound barrier====
[[File:Yeager supersonic flight 1947.ogv|thumb|Yeager broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947 in the X-1.]]
Yeager remained in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] after the war, becoming a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field (now [[Edwards Air Force Base]]), following graduation from [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School]] (Class 46C).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cnet.com/news/getting-schooled-with-the-air-forces-elite-test-pilots &lt;!--|title = Test pilot Capt Chuck Yeager--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906051721/https://www.cnet.com/news/getting-schooled-with-the-air-forces-elite-test-pilots/ |archive-date=September 6, 2017 |title = Getting schooled with the Air Force's elite test pilots |work = CNET |access-date =  April 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Bell Aircraft]] test pilot [[Chalmers &quot;Slick&quot; Goodlin]] demanded $150,000 ($1.6 million in 2015 dollars) to break the sound &quot;barrier,&quot; the USAAF selected Yeager to fly the rocket-powered [[Bell X-1|Bell XS-1]] in a [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] program to research high-speed flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_121&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 121|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;right_stuff_52-53&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author-link = Tom Wolfe |last = Wolfe |first = Tom |title-link = The Right Stuff (book) |title = The Right Stuff |location = New York |publisher = [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux|Farrar-Straus-Giroux]] |year = 1979 |isbn = 0-374-25033-2 |ref = harv |pages= [https://archive.org/details/rightstuff00tomw/page/52 52–53] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such was the difficulty in this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges was along the lines of &quot;Yeager better have paid-up insurance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_157&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 157|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, Yeager broke two ribs when he fell from a horse.

On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the X-1's hatch by himself. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever, to allow Yeager to seal the hatch.

The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]].

Yeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records. He was also one of the first American pilots to fly a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]], after its pilot, [[No Kum-sok]], defected to [[South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Clark |first = Mark |title = From the Danube to the Yalu |location = New York |publisher = Harper |year = 1954 |ref = harv |page = 208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Kum-Suk |first1 = No |first2 = J.

That year, he flew a [[chase plane|chase aircraft]] for the civilian pilot [[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]] as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_252&quot;/&gt;

On November 20, 1953 the U.S. Navy program involving the [[Douglas Skyrocket|D-558-II Skyrocket]] and its pilot, [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]], became the first team to reach twice the speed of sound. After they were bested, Ridley and Yeager decided to beat rival Crossfield's speed record in a series of test flights that they dubbed &quot;Operation NACA Weep.&quot; Not only did they beat Crossfield by setting a new record at Mach 2.44 on December 12, 1953, but they did it in time to spoil a celebration planned for the [[Wright brothers|50th anniversary of flight]] in which Crossfield was to be called &quot;the fastest man alive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_252&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 252|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new record flight, however, did not entirely go to plan, since shortly after reaching Mach 2.44, Yeager lost control of the X-1A at about {{convert|80000|ft|m|abbr=on}} due to [[inertia coupling]], a phenomenon largely unknown at the time. With the aircraft simultaneously rolling, pitching, and yawing out of control, Yeager dropped {{convert|51000|ft|m}} in less than a minute before regaining control at around {{convert|29000|ft|m}}. He then managed to land without further incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_252&quot;/&gt; For this achievement, Yeager was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] (DSM) in 1954.{{Refn|Yeager received the DSM in the Army design, since the [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]] was not awarded until 1965.|group=lower-alpha}}

====Military command====
[[File:Charles Yeager photo portrait head on shoulders left side.jpg|thumb|upright|Chuck Yeager in 1950]]
Yeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. From May 1955 to July 1957, he commanded the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86H Sabre]]-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport|Hahn AB]], [[West Germany]], and [[Toul-Rosieres Air Base]], [[France]]; and from 1957 to 1960 the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre|F-100D Super Sabre]]-equipped [[1st Fighter Squadron (United States)|1st Fighter Day Squadron]] (later, while still under Yeager's command, re-designated the 306th Tactical Fighter Squadron) at [[George Air Force Base]], [[California]], and [[Morón Air Base]], [[Spain]].

Now a full colonel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chuckyeager.com/1961-1975-to-new-heights |title=Yeager (n.d.).

(Yeager himself had only a high school education, so he was not eligible to become an astronaut like those he trained.) Between December 1963 and January 1964,&lt;ref name=Crash&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/NF-104A_crash_site.htm |title = The Crash of Chuck Yeager's NF-104A |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041207150655/http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/NF-104A_crash_site.htm |archive-date = December 7, 2004 |via = Check-Six.com |date = December 10, 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeager completed five flights in the [[NASA M2-F1]] [[lifting body]]. An accident during a [[Lockheed NF-104A#Third NF-104A|December 1963 test flight]] in one of the school's [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104]]s eventually put an end to his record attempts.

In 1966, Yeager took command of the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing at [[Clark Air Base]], the [[Philippines]], whose squadrons were deployed on rotational temporary duty (TDY) in [[South Vietnam]] and elsewhere in [[Southeast Asia]]. There he accrued another 414 hours of combat time in 127 missions, mostly in a [[Martin B-57 Canberra]] light bomber. In February 1968, Yeager was assigned command of the [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Seymour Johnson Air Force Base]], [[North Carolina]], and led the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]] wing in [[South Korea]] during the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|''Pueblo'' crisis]].

On June 22, 1969, Yeager was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] and was assigned in July as the vice-commander of the [[Seventeenth Air Force]].

From 1971 to 1973, at the behest of Ambassador Joe Farland, Yeager was assigned to [[Pakistan]] to advise the [[Pakistan Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_391&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 391|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In one of the numerous raids carried out by Indian pilots against Pakistani airfields, Yeager's plane was destroyed while it was parked at Islamabad airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_398&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 398|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward C.

===Post-retirement career===
[[File:ChuckYeager.jpeg|thumb|upright|Brigadier General Yeager in 2000]]

On March 1, 1975, following assignments in Germany and Pakistan, Yeager retired from the Air Force at [[Norton Air Force Base]], California, after serving over 33 years on active duty, although he continued to occasionally fly for the USAF and NASA as a consulting test pilot at Edwards AFB.{{refn|For his consultant work to the Test Pilot School Commander at Edwards Air Force Base, Yeager was paid one dollar annually, along with all the flying time he wanted. The $1 allowed him to be covered by [[workers' compensation]] insurance.|group=lower-alpha}}

Yeager made a [[cameo appearance]] in the movie ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]'' (1983). He played &quot;Fred,&quot; a bartender at [[Happy Bottom Riding Club|&quot;Pancho's Place&quot;]], which was most appropriate, as Yeager said, &quot;if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 172|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own role in the movie was played by [[Sam Shepard]].

For several years in the 1980s, Yeager was connected to [[General Motors]], publicizing [[AC Delco]], the company's automotive parts division.&lt;ref name=&quot;yeagerbio_418&quot;&gt;{{harvp|Yeager|Janos|1985|p= 418|ps=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 he was invited to drive the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] [[pace car]] for the [[1986 Indianapolis 500|70th running of the Indianapolis 500]]. In [[1988 Indianapolis 500|1988]], Yeager was again invited to drive the pace car, this time at the wheel of an [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Yeager to the [[Rogers Commission]] that investigated the explosion of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.456fis.org/CHUCK_YEAGER_BIOGRAPHY.htm |title = Brigadier General Charles E.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yeager set several light general aircraft performance records for speed, range, and endurance. Most notable were flights conducted on behalf of [[Piper Aircraft]]. On one such flight, Yeager performed an emergency landing as a result of fuel exhaustion. On another, he piloted Piper's [[turboprop]] [[Piper PA-42 Cheyenne|Cheyenne 400LS]] to a time-to-height record: FL350 (35,000 feet) in 16 minutes, exceeding the climb performance of a Boeing 737 at gross weight.

During this time Yeager also served as a technical adviser for three Electronic Arts [[flight simulator]] video games. The games include ''[[Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer]]'', ''[[Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer 2.0]]'', and ''[[Chuck Yeager's Air Combat]]''. The game manuals featured quotes and anecdotes from Yeager, and were well received by players. Missions featured several of Yeager's accomplishments and let players attempt to top his records. ''Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer'' was Electronic Art's top selling game for 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/chuck-yeagers-advanced-flight-simulator |publisher = Moby Games |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170731194151/http://www.mobygames.com/game/chuck-yeagers-advanced-flight-simulator |archive-date = July 31, 2017  |title = ''Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer'' |access-date = June 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Yeager participated in the documentary ''[[The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club]]'', a profile of his friend [[Pancho Barnes]]. The documentary was screened at film festivals, aired on public television in the United States and won an [[Emmy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legendofpanchobarnes.com/ |title=The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club |access-date=August 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523111947/http://www.legendofpanchobarnes.com/ |archive-date=May 23, 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeager is fully retired from military test flying, after having maintained that status for three decades after his official retirement from the Air Force. On October 14, 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new ''Glamorous Glennis III'', an [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15D Eagle]], past Mach 1. The chase plane for the flight was an [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] piloted by [[Bob Hoover]], a longtime test, fighter and [[aerobatic]] pilot who had been Yeager's wingman for the first supersonic flight. This was supposed to be Yeager's last official flight with the U.S. Air Force. However he was called back into flying with the USAF in 2000 and continued to do so until the end of 2012. At the end of his speech to the crowd in 1997, Yeager concluded, &quot;All that I am ... I owe to the Air Force.&quot; Later that month, he was the recipient of the [[Tony Jannus Award]] for his achievements.

On October 14, 2012, on the 65th anniversary of breaking the sound barrier, Yeager did it again at the age of 89, flying as co-pilot in a [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] piloted by Captain David Vincent out of [[Nellis Air Force Base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Rogers |first = Keith |url = https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/military/famous-pilot-yeager-re-enacting-right-stuff-65-years-later/ |title = Famous pilot Yeager re-enacting right stuff 65 years later |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180910094804/https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/military/famous-pilot-yeager-re-enacting-right-stuff-65-years-later/ |archive-date = September 10, 2018  |work = Las Vegas Review-Journal |date = October 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Yeager was inducted into the [[National Aviation Hall of Fame]], arguably aviation's highest honor. In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal &quot;equivalent to a noncombat [[Medal of Honor]] ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the X-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on October 14, 1947.&quot; President [[Gerald Ford]] presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on December 8, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:United_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_89.djvu/1094 |title = Public Law 94-179 |work = United States Statutes |access-date = September 10, 2012 |via = Wikisource }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This is apparently a unique award, as the law that created it states it is equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor.

Yeager, who never attended college and was often modest about his background, is considered by many, including ''Flying Magazine'', the California Hall of Fame, the State of West Virginia, National Aviation Hall of Fame, a few U.S. presidents, and the United States Army Air Force, to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. Despite his lack of higher education, he has been honored in his home state. [[Marshall University]] has named its highest academic scholarship, the [[Society of Yeager Scholars]], in his honor. Yeager was also the chairman of [[Experimental Aircraft Association]]'s [[Young Eagles|Young Eagle Program]] from 1994–2004, and has been named the program's chairman emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Ford |first = Harrison |title = Freedom and Responsibility |magazine = [[Sport Aviation (magazine)|Sport Aviation]] |date = September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Yeager named his plane after his wife Glennis as a good-luck charm; &quot;You're my good-luck charm, hon. Any airplane I name after you always brings me home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How is it done?|last=Frost|first=John|publisher=The Reader's Digest Association Limited|year=1990|isbn=|location=London|pages=202|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeager and Glennis moved to [[Grass Valley, California]], after his retirement from the Air Force in 1975. The couple prospered because of Yeager's best-selling autobiography, speaking engagements and commercial ventures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moller&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last = Moller |first = Dave |url = http://www.theunion.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040219/NEWS/102190105 |title = Yeager children sue their father |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120820012601/http://www.theunion.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20040219%2FNEWS%2F102190105 |archive-date = August 20, 2012 |work = The Union |location = Nevada County, California |date = February 19, 2004 |access-date = September 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glennis Yeager died of [[ovarian cancer]] in 1990. They had four children (Susan, Don, Mickey and Sharon).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tresniowski&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Tresniowski |first = Alex |url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20149499,00.html |title = The Wife Stuff: Feuds, Trials &amp; Lawsuits, Bills, Bills, Bills, Chuck Yeager |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110809080730/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20149499,00.html |archive-date = August 9, 2011 |magazine = [[People (American magazine)|People]] |date = March 8, 2004 |access-date = September 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Yeager met actress Victoria Scott D'Angelo on a hiking trail in Nevada County. The pair started dating shortly thereafter, and married in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Chuck-Yeager-is-in-love-Three-of-his-kids-doubt-2821681.php |title=Chuck Yeager is in love.

The children contended that D'Angelo, 35 years Yeager's junior, had married him for his fortune.  Yeager and D'Angelo both denied the charge. Litigation ensued, in which his children accused D'Angelo of &quot;undue influence&quot; on Yeager, and Yeager accused his children of diverting millions of dollars from his assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-jul-02-et-hubler2-story.html |title=Far from heavens |last=Hubler |first=Shawn |date=2 July 2004 |website=Los Angeles Times |access-date=6 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, the [[California Court of Appeal]] ruled for Yeager, finding that his daughter Susan had breached her duty as trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.metnews.com/articles/2008/yeag082608.htm |title = C.A. rules against Chuck Yeager's daughter in dispute with stepmother |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121218050222/http://www.metnews.com/articles/2008/yeag082608.htm |archive-date = December 18, 2012 |work = MetNews |date = August 26, 2008 |access-date = November 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |url = http://www.fearnotlaw.com/articles/article22023.html |litigants = Yeager v.
