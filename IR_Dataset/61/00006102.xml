In the [[subtractive color]] system, or [[CMYK color model|CMYK (subtractive)]], which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one of the [[primary colors]], along with [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]]. In the [[additive color]] system, or [[RGB color model|RGB (additive)]] color model, used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of [[green]] and [[light]] [[blue]] . Cyan is the [[complementary color|complement]] of [[red]]; it can be made by the removal of red from white light. Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity will make [[white]] light.

The [[web colors|web color]] cyan is synonymous with [[aqua (color)|aqua]].   Other colors in the cyan color range are [[teal (color)|teal]], [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[electric blue (color)|electric blue]], [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]], and others described as [[blue-green]].

In most languages, 'cyan' is not a basic [[color term]] and it [[wikt:phenomenologically|phenomenologically]] appears as a greenish vibrant [[hue]] of blue to most English speakers.  Other English terms for this &quot;borderline&quot; hue region include ''blue green'', ''aqua'', and ''turquoise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raffman |first1=Diana |title=Unruly Words: A Study of Vague Language |date=2014 |publisher=OUP USA |isbn=9780199915101 |pages=56–57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVfSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyan on the web and in printing==

===The web colors cyan and aqua===

The [[web color]] cyan shown at right is a [[secondary color]] in the [[RGB color model]], which uses combinations of red, green and blue light to create all the colors on computer and television displays.  In [[X11 colors]], this color is called both cyan and [[aqua (color)|aqua]].  In the HTML color list, this same color is called aqua.

The web colors are more vivid than the cyan used in the [[CMYK]] color system, and the web colors cannot be accurately reproduced on a printed page. To reproduce the web color cyan in inks, it is necessary to add some white ink to the printer's cyan below, so when it is reproduced in printing, it is not a primary subtractive color. It is called ''aqua'' (a name in use since 1598) because it is a color commonly associated with [[water]], such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul ''The Dictionary of Color'' 1930 (see under Aqua in Index, page 189)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyan is also one of the common inks used in [[four-color printing]], along with [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[black]]; this set of colors is referred to as CMYK.  In printing, the cyan ink is sometimes known as printer's cyan, process cyan, or process blue.

While both the additive secondary and the subtractive primary are called ''cyan'', they can be substantially different from one another. Cyan printing ink is typically more saturated than the RGB secondary cyan, depending on what [[RGB color space]] and ink are considered.  That is, process cyan is usually outside the RGB [[gamut]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=P.U.P.A. Gilbert and Willy Haeberli |title=Physics in the Arts |date=2011 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9780123918895 |page=110 |edition=Revised |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bobHqrTny4QC&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure cyan ink. This is because real-world subtractive (unlike additive) color mixing does not consistently produce the same result when mixing apparently identical colors, since the specific frequencies filtered out to produce that color affect how it interacts with other colors. [[Phthalocyanine_Blue_BN|Phthalocyanine blue]] is one such commonly used pigment.  A typical formulation of ''process cyan'' is shown in the color box at right.

==In science and nature==

===Color of water===
* Pure water is nearly colorless. However, it does [[water absorption|absorb]] slightly more red light than blue, giving large volumes of water a bluish tint; increased scattering of blue light due to fine particles in the water shifts the blue color toward green, for a typically cyan net color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Clouds in a Glass of Beer: Simple Experiments in Atmospheric Physics|author = Craig F.

===Cyan and cyanide===
* [[Cyanide]] derives its name from [[Prussian blue]], a blue pigment containing the cyanide ion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfqpDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA572&amp;dq=Cyanide+derives+its+name+from+Prussian+blue,+a+blue+pigment+containing+the+cyanide+ion.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwio-pW_uYzXAhUIs1QKHTXYC-gQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Cyanide%20derives%20its%20name%20from%20Prussian%20blue,%20a%20blue%20pigment%20containing%20the%20cyanide%20ion.&amp;f=false|title=Colour Design: Theories and Applications|last=Best|first=Janet|date=2017-06-08|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|isbn=9780081018897|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
* The [[planet]] [[Uranus]] is colored cyan because of the abundance of [[methane]] in its [[atmosphere]]. Methane absorbs red light and reflects the blue-green light which allows observers to see it as cyan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/pia00032.html|title=Uranus in True and False Color|last=Administrator|first=NASA Content|date=2015-04-02|work=NASA|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography and film===
* [[Cyanotype]], or [[blueprint]], a [[monochrome]] [[List of photographic processes|photographic printing process]] that predates the use of the word ''cyan'' as a color, yields a deep ''cyan-blue'' colored print based on the Prussian blue pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Cyanotype: the history, science and art of photographic printing in Prussian blue|author = Mike Ware|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=C-7I69gFIbMC&amp;pg=PA21 |publisher = NMSI Trading Ltd|year = 1999|isbn = 1-900747-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cinecolor]], a bi-pack color process, the photographer would load a standard camera with two films, one orthochromatic, dyed red, and a panchromatic strip behind it. Color light would expose the cyan record on the ortho stock, which also acted as a filter, exposing only red light to the panchromatic film stock.&lt;ref&gt;Belton, John (2000): CinecoIor.

* [[Cyanosis]] is an abnormal blueness of the skin, usually a sign of poor oxygen intake; patients are typically described as being &quot;cyanotic&quot;.&lt;ref name=Mosby&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mosby's Medical, Nursing &amp; Allied Health Dictionary]] |series=Mosby-Year Book |year=1994 |page=425 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
