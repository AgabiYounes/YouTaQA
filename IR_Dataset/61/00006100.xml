'''Chernobyl''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ɜːr|ˈ|n|oʊ|b|əl}} {{respell|chur|NOH|bəl}}, &lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-en|UK|tʃ|ɜːr|ˈ|n|ɒ|b|əl}} {{respell|chur|NOB|əl}}) or '''Chornobyl''' ({{lang-uk|Чорнобиль|Chornobyl'}}) is a [[ghost town|ghost city]] in the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]], situated in the [[Ivankiv Raion]] of northern [[Kiev Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]. Chernobyl is about {{convert|90|km|mi|sigfig=1}} north of [[Kiev]], and {{convert|160|km|mi|sigfig=1}} southwest of the [[Belarus|Belarusian]] city of [[Gomel]]. Before its evacuation, the city had about 14,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mould|first=Richard|title=Chernobyl Record|publisher=[[Institute of Physics]]|location=Bristol, England|page=105|chapter=Evacuation zones and populations|isbn=0-7503-0670-X|date=May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was evacuated on 5 May 1986, 9 days after the [[Chernobyl disaster|nuclear accident]] at the nearby [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], which was the most disastrous nuclear accident in history. The plant is {{convert|15|km|mi|sigfig=1}} north of the Chernobyl city. [[Pripyat]] is a city much closer to the plant; it was built in the 1970s as a home for the power-plant's workers, and its population of 50,000 was evacuated 30 hours after the accident. The city of [[Slavutych]], built for those evacuated from Pripyat, also received the population evacuated from Chernobyl.

The city was the [[administrative center]] of [[Chernobyl Raion]] (district) from 1923. After the accident, in 1988, the raion was disestablished and administration was transferred to the neighboring [[Ivankiv Raion]].

Although Chernobyl is mostly a ghost town today, a small number of animals and people still live there, in houses marked with signs that read, &quot;Owner of this house lives here&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Withington|first=John|title=Disaster!: A History of Earthquakes, Floods, Plagues, and Other Catastrophes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tE4tAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT328|date=13 December 2013|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-62636-708-1|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers on watch and administrative personnel of the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] are also stationed in the city. There are two [[general store]]s, and a tourist hotel.

==History==
[[File:Свято-Іллінська церква в Чорнобилі.jpg|thumb|left|Orthodox Church of St. Elijah]]
Chernobyl was originally part of the land of [[Kievan Rus′]]. The first known mention of Chernobyl is from an 1193 charter, which describes it as a hunting-lodge of [[Knyaz]] [[Rurik Rostislavich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;&gt;[[Norman Davies]], ''[[Europe: A History]]'', Oxford University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-19-820171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Chernobyl.in.ua/en/Chernobyl.htm Chernobyl ancient history and maps]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, it was a crown village of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The village was granted to [[Filon Kmita]], a captain of the royal [[cavalry]], as a [[fiefdom]] in 1566. The province where Chernobyl is located was transferred to the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in 1569, and later annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1793.&lt;ref name=&quot;ND2&quot;&gt;[[Davies, Norman]] (1995) [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/195/index.html &quot;Chernobyl&quot;], ''[[The Sarmatian Review]], vol. 15'', No. 1, Polish Institute of Houston at [[Rice University]], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304203059/http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/195/index.html |date=4 March 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 20th century, Chernobyl was inhabited by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[peasant]]s, some [[Poles|Polish]] people and a relatively large number of Jews.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Jews were brought to Chernobyl by [[Filon Kmita]], during the Polish campaign of colonization. After 1596, the traditionally [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Ukrainian peasantry of the district were forcibly converted, by Poland, to the [[Greek Catholic]] Uniate religion.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Many of these converts returned to [[Eastern Orthodox]]y after the [[Partitions of Poland]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1626, during the [[Counter-reformation]], the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] church and [[monastery]] were founded by Lukasz Sapieha. A group of [[Old Catholics]] opposed the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].{{clarify|date=June 2017}} In 1832, following the failed Polish November Uprising, the Dominican monastery was sequestrated. The church of the Old Catholics was disbanded in 1852.&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot; /&gt;

Until the end of the 19th century Chernobyl was a privately owned city that belonged to the [[Chodkiewicz]] family. In 1896 they sold the city to the state, but until 1910 they owned a castle and a house in the city. 

In the second half of the 18th century, Chernobyl became a major center of [[Hasidic Judaism]]. The [[Chernobyl (Hasidic dynasty)|Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty]] had been founded by Rabbi [[Menachem Nachum Twersky]]. The Jewish population suffered greatly from [[pogrom]]s in October 1905 and in March–April 1919; many Jews were killed or robbed at the instigation of the Russian nationalist [[Black Hundreds]]. When the [[Twersky Dynasty]] left Chernobyl in 1920, it ceased to exist as a centre of Hasidism.

Chernobyl had a population of 10,800 in 1898, including 7,200 [[Jews]]. Chernobyl was occupied in [[World War I]];{{by whom|date=June 2017}} Ukrainians and [[Bolsheviks]] fought over the city in the ensuing [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Civil War]]. In the [[Polish–Soviet War]] of 1919–20, Chernobyl [[Battle of Czarnobyl (1920)|was taken first by the Polish Army]] and then by cavalry of the [[Red Army]]. From 1921 onwards, it was officially incorporated into the [[Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot;/&gt;

Between 1929 and 1933, Chernobyl suffered from killings during [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivization]] campaign. It was also affected by the [[Holodomor|famine]] that resulted from Stalin's policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/stalin.htm|title=The History Place – Genocide in the 20th Century: Stalin's Forced Famine 1932–33|website=www.historyplace.com|access-date=16 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181224182059/http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/genocide/stalin.htm|archive-date=24 December 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish and German community of Chernobyl was deported to [[Kazakhstan]] in 1936, during the [[Frontier Clearances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Biography of No Place: From Ethnic Borderland to Soviet heartland|last=Brown|first=Kate|date=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0674011686|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=52727650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Chernobyl was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] from 25 August 1941 to 17 November 1943. The Jewish community was murdered during the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Nazi occupation of 1941–44]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ND&quot; /&gt;

Twenty years later, the area was chosen as the site of the first nuclear power station to be built on Ukrainian soil. The [[Duga radar|Duga]] [[over-the-horizon radar]] array, several miles outside of Chernobyl, was the origin of the [[Russian Woodpecker]]; it was designed as part of an [[anti-ballistic missile]] [[early warning radar]] network. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Chernobyl remained part of [[Ukraine]].

{{Main|Chernobyl disaster}}

On 26 April 1986, one of the reactors at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] exploded after unsanctioned experiments on the reactor by plant operators were done improperly. The resulting loss of control was due to design flaws of the [[RBMK]] reactor, which made it unstable when operated at low power, and prone to thermal runaway where increases in temperature increase reactor power output.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chernobyl : the history of a nuclear catastrophe|last=1957–|first=Plokhy, Serhii|isbn=9781541617094|edition= First|location=New York, NY|oclc=1003311263|date = 15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Producing power : the pre-Chernobyl history of the Soviet nuclear industry|last=1970-|first=Schmid, Sonja D.|isbn=9780262321792|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904249268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chernobyl city was evacuated 9 days after the disaster. The level of contamination with [[caesium-137]] was around 555 [[Becquerel|kBq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (surface ground deposition in 1986).&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The atlas of cesium-137 contamination of Europe after the Chernobyl accident |display-authors=3 |author1=Izrael, Yu A |author2=Cort, M De |author3=Jones, A R |author4=Nazarov, I M |author5=Fridman, Sh D |author6=Kvasnikova, E V |author7=Stukin, E D |author8=Kelly, G N |author9=Matveenko, I I |author10=Pokumeiko, Yu M |author11=Tabatchnyi, L Ya |author12=Tsaturov, Yu

Later analyses concluded that, even with very conservative estimates, relocation of the city (or of any area below 1500 [[Becquerel|kBq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) could not be justified on the grounds of radiological health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Evaluation of countermeasures to be taken to assure safe living conditions to the population affected by the Chernobyl accident in the USSR

This however does not account for the uncertainty in the first few days of the accident about further depositions and weather patterns.
Moreover, an earlier short-term evacuation could have averted more significant doses from short-lived isotope radiation (specifically [[iodine-131]], which has a half-life of about eight days).
Estimates of health effects are a subject of some controversy, see [[Effects of the Chernobyl disaster#Long-term health effects|Effects of the Chernobyl disaster]].

In 1998, average caesium-137 doses from the accident (estimated at 1-2mSv per year) did not exceed those from other sources of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Atlas of ceasium deposition on Europe after the Chernobyl accident |author1=M De Cort |author2=G Dubois |author3=Sh D Fridman |author4=M G Germenchuk |author5=Yu A Izrael |author6=A Janssens |author7=A R Jones |author8=G N Kelly |author9=E V Kvasnikova |author10=I I Matveenko |author11=I M Nazarov |author12=Yu M Pokumeiko |author13=V A Sitak |author14=E D Stukin |author15=L Ya Tabachny |author16=Yu S Tsaturov |author17=S I Avdyushin |display-authors=3 |year=1998|url=http://cricket.biol.sc.edu/chernobyl/UN-reports/Atlas.pdf  |isbn=92-828-3140-X |oclc=48391311 |at=p. 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current effective ceasium-137 dose rates as of 2019 are 200-250 nSv/h, or roughly 1.7-2.2 mSv per year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Information on the radiation state of the environment of the exclusion zone |author=State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management |url=http://dazv.gov.ua/radiatsijnij-stan/informatsiya-pro-radiatsijnij-stan-dovkillya-zoni-vidchuzhennya.html |access-date=22 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which is comparable to the worldwide average [[background radiation]] from natural sources.

The base of operations for the administration and monitoring of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was moved from Pripyat to Chernobyl. Chernobyl currently contains offices for the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone#Administration|State Agency of Ukraine on the Exclusion Zone Management]] and accommodations for visitors. Apartment blocks have been repurposed as accommodations for employees of the State Agency. The length of time that workers may spend within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is restricted by regulations that have been implemented to limit radiation exposure. Today, visits are allowed to Chernobyl, but limited by strict rules.

In 2003, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] launched a project, called the [[Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP)]], for the recovery of the affected areas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070704002250/http://www.undp.org.ua/?page=projects&amp;projects=14 CRDP: Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (United Nations Development Program)]&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the efforts of the [[Government of Ukraine]] to mitigate the long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.

The city has become overgrown and many types of animals live there. According to census information collected over an extended period of time, it is estimated that more [[mammals]] live there now than before the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;
