Along with [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Breton language|Breton]], Cornish is descended directly from the [[Common Brittonic]] language spoken throughout much of [[Great Britain]] before the English language came to dominate. It was the main language of Cornwall for centuries until it was pushed westwards by English, maintaining close links with its sister language [[Breton language|Breton]], with which it was [[mutually intelligible]] until well into the [[Middle Ages]]. Cornish continued to function as a [[Vernacular|common community language]] in parts of [[Cornwall]] until the  mid 18th century. There is some evidence of knowledge of the language persisting into the 19th century, possibly almost overlapping the beginning of revival efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Beresford Ellis |first=Peter |title=The Story of the Cornish Language |year=1990 |publisher=Tor Mark Press |isbn=0-85025-371-3 |pages=19–25|quote=Of John  Davey of Zenmor who died in 1891, it was claimed that he was the last surviving native speaker of the language. His stone memorial reads 'John Davey 1812-1891 of Boswednack in this parish ... who was the last to possess any traditional considerable knowledge of the Cornish Language.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A process to revive the language was begun in the early 20th century, with a number of orthographical systems still in use, although an attempt was made to impose a [[Standard Written Form]] in 2008. In 2010, [[UNESCO]] announced that its former classification of the language as &quot;extinct&quot; was &quot;no longer accurate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-11935464 |title=Cornish language no longer extinct, says UN |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=7 December 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the revival of the language, some Cornish textbooks and [[Cornish literature|works of literature]] have been published, and an increasing number of people are studying the language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diarmuid O'Neill 240&quot; /&gt; Recent developments include [[music of Cornwall|Cornish music]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38589] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225143453/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38589|date=25 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[independent film]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38588] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225143447/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=38588|date=25 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and children's books.

== Classification ==
Cornish is one of the [[Brittonic languages]], which constitute a branch of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] section of the [[Celtic languages|Celtic language family]]. Brittonic also includes [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Breton language|Breton]] and the [[Cumbric language]]; the last is [[extinct language|extinct]]. [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]] are part of the separate [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] branch of Insular Celtic.

[[Joseph Loth]] viewed Cornish and Breton as being two dialects of the same language, claiming that &quot;Middle Cornish is without doubt closer to Breton as a whole than the modern Breton dialect of [[Quiberon]] [''Kiberen''] is to that of [[Saint-Pol-de-Léon]] [''Kastell-Paol''].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Nicholas J. A. |title=The Preterite in Cornish |journal=Cornish Studies |date=2010 |volume=18 |series=Second Series |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Britonia6hcentury.png|thumb|right|upright|The [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brittonic speakers]] around the 6th century. Cornish and [[Breton language|Breton]] are very closely related]]

Cornish evolved from the [[Common Brittonic]] spoken throughout Britain south of the [[Firth of Forth]] during the [[British Iron Age]] and [[Roman Britain|Roman period]]. As a result of [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|westward Anglo-Saxon expansion]], the Britons of the southwest were separated from those in modern-day [[Wales]] and [[Cumbria]]. Some scholars have proposed that this split took place after the [[Battle of Deorham]] in about 577. The western dialects eventually evolved into [[Welsh language|modern Welsh]] and the now extinct [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], while [[Southwestern Brittonic languages|Southwestern Brittonic]] developed into Cornish and Breton, the latter as a result of emigration to parts of the continent, known as [[Brittany]] over the following centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=Kenneth |title=Language and History in Early Britain |url=https://archive.org/details/languagehistoryi0000jack |url-access=registration |location=Edinburgh| publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old Cornish ===
The area controlled by the southwestern Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of [[Wessex]] over the next few centuries. During the Old Cornish period (800–1200), the Cornish-speaking area was largely coterminous with modern-day [[Cornwall]]; the region of [[Devon]] was isolated by [[Wessex]] in 936 AD. Whilst some claim that many inhabitants fled to Cornwall or [[Brittany]], a genetic study carried out by the [[University of Oxford]] &amp; [[University College London]] discovered separate genetic groups in Cornwall and Devon, not only were there differences on either side of the Tamar, with a division almost exactly along the modern county boundary dating back to the 6th Century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-03-19-who-do-you-think-you-really-are-genetic-map-british-isles|title=Who do you think you really are?

This suggests the Anglo-Saxon migration into Devon was limited rather than a mass movement of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The manuscript was widely thought to be in [[Old Welsh]] until the 18th century when it was identified as Cornish. At this time there was still little difference between Welsh and Cornish, and even fewer differences between Cornish and Breton, with some scholars arguing that the terms &quot;Old Cornish&quot; and &quot;Old Breton&quot; are merely geographical terms for the same language.

=== Middle Cornish ===
[[File:Origo Mundi kynsa gwersow.jpg|thumb|right|The opening verses of ''Origo Mundi'', the first play of the [[Ordinalia]] (the ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of medieval Cornish literature), written by an unknown monk in the late 14th century]]

The Cornish language continued to flourish well through the Middle Cornish period (1200–1600), reaching a peak of about 39,000 speakers in the 13th century, after which the number started to decline.&lt;ref name = &quot;ken&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=George |first1=Ken |date=1986 |title=How many people spoke Cornish traditionally? |journal=Cornish Studies |volume=14 |pages=67–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;stalmaszczyk&quot;/&gt; This period provided the bulk of traditional Cornish literature, which was used to reconstruct the language during its revival. Most important is the ''[[Ordinalia]]'', a cycle of three mystery plays, ''Origo Mundi'', ''Passio Christi'' and ''Resurrexio Domini''.  Together these provide about 20,000 lines of text. Various plays were written by the canons of [[Glasney College]], intended to educate the Cornish people about the Bible and the Celtic saints. From this period also is ''{{lang|kw|[[Beunans Meriasek]]}}'' and the recently discovered ''{{lang|kw|[[Bewnans Ke]]}}''.

In the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], an [[report|account]] was given by [[Andrew Boorde]] in his 1542 ''Boke of the Introduction of Knowledge''. He states, &quot;{{lang|enm|In Cornwall is two speches, the one is naughty Englysshe, and the other is Cornysshe speche. And there be many men and women the which cannot speake one worde of Englysshe, but all Cornyshe.}}&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, Henry (1904) ''A Handbook of the Cornish Language Chiefly in Its Latest Stages with Some Account of Its History and Literature''. London: David Nutt&lt;/ref&gt;

When Parliament passed the [[Act of Uniformity 1549]], people in many areas of Cornwall did not speak or understand English. The intention of the Act was to replace worship in [[Latin]] with worship in English, which was known by the lawmakers not to be universally spoken throughout England. Instead of merely banning Latin, the Act was framed so as to enforce English. The [[Prayer Book Rebellion]], which may also have been influenced by the retaliation of the English after the failed [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]], broke out, and was ruthlessly suppressed: over 4,000 people who protested against the imposition of an English prayer book were massacred by [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] army. Their leaders were executed and the people suffered numerous reprisals.

The rebels' document claimed they wanted a return to the old religious services and ended, &quot;We the Cornishmen (whereof certain of us understand no English) utterly refuse this new English [altered spelling].&quot; [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]], Duke of [[Somerset]], replied to the Cornishmen, inquiring as to why they should be offended by services in English when they had them in Latin, which they also did not understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose-Troup|first1=Frances|title=The Western Rebellion of 1549|date=1913|publisher=Smith|location=London|pages=435–36|url=https://archive.org/stream/westernrebellion00rose#page/434/mode/2up|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cornish language shift.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|A map showing the westward decline of Cornish, 1300–1750]]
Through many factors, including loss of life and the spread of English, the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] proved a turning-point for the Cornish language.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mills&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mills |first1=Jon |date=2010 |title=Genocide and Ethnocide: The Suppression of the Cornish Language |url= https://kar.kent.ac.uk/27912/2/Mills%2C%20Jon%20%282010%29%20Genocide%20and%20Ethnocide%20-%20The%20Suppression%20of%20the%20Cornish%20Language%20%28not%20for%20distribution%29.pdf|journal=Interfaces in Language |pages=189–206 |doi=10.13140/2.1.1439.5843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Berresford-Ellis cites the years 1550–1650 as a century of immense damage for the language, and its decline can be traced to this period. In 1680, [[William Scawen]] wrote an essay describing 16 reasons for the decline of Cornish, among them the lack of a distinctive Cornish alphabet, the loss of contact between Cornwall and [[Brittany]], the cessation of the miracle plays, loss of records in the Civil War, lack of a Cornish Bible, and immigration to Cornwall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berresford-Ellis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L709AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82|title=The Cornish Language and Its Literature|first=Peter Berresford|last=Ellis|date=1 January 1974|publisher=Mass.|via=Google Books|isbn=9780710079282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Modern Cornish ===
[[File:Lether Bodinar.jpg|thumb|right|upright|William Bodinar's letter, dated 3 July 1776]]
By the middle of the 17th century, the language had retreated to [[Penwith]] and [[Kerrier]], and transmission of the language to new generations had almost entirely ceased. In his ''Survey of Cornwall'', published in 1602, [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]] writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;[M]ost of the inhabitants can speak no word of Cornish, but very few are ignorant of the English; and yet some so affect their own, as to a stranger they will not speak it; for if meeting them by chance, you inquire the way, or any such matter, your answer shall be, &quot;{{lang|kw|Meea navidna caw zasawzneck}},&quot; &quot;I [will] speak no Saxonage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carew1811&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Carew |first=Richard |title=Carew's Survey of Cornwall: to which are added, notes illustrative of its history and antiquities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhTOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA152 |accessdate=13 February 2013 |year=1811 |publisher=Printed by T. Bensley for J. Faulder |page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Late Cornish period from 1578 to about 1800 has fewer sources of information on the language but they are more varied in nature.  Written sources from this period are often spelled following English spelling conventions since the majority of writers of the time had had no exposure to Middle Cornish texts or the Cornish orthography within them, although after 1700 some writers began to adopt the orthography used by Edward Lhuyd in his Archaeologia Britannica, for example using the circumflex to denote long vowels.  In 1776, [[William Bodinar]], who had learnt Cornish from fishermen, wrote a letter in Cornish which was probably the last prose in the language. However, the last verse was the ''[[Cranken Rhyme]]'', written in the late 19th century by [[John Davey (Cornish speaker)|John Davey]] of [[Boswednack]].

The search for the last speaker is hampered by a lack of transcriptions or audio recordings, so that it is impossible to tell, from this distance, whether the language these people were reported to be speaking was Cornish, or English with a heavy Cornish substratum, nor what their level of fluency was. Nevertheless this academic interest, along with the beginning of the [[Celtic Revival]] in the late 19th century, provided the groundwork for a Cornish language revival movement.

Notwithstanding the uncertainty over who was the last speaker of Cornish, there is no certainty that any native speaker of the language lived beyond the 18th century, and researchers have posited the following numbers for the prevalence of the language between 1050 and 1800.&lt;ref name=&quot;ken&quot; /&gt;

=== Recent Modern Cornish ===
{{See also|Cornish language revival}}
In 1904, the Celtic language scholar and Cornish cultural activist [[Henry Jenner]] published ''A Handbook of the Cornish Language''. The publication of this book is often considered to be the point at which the revival movement started.

The revival focused on reconstructing and standardising the language, including coining new words for modern concepts, and creating educational material in order to teach Cornish to others. In 1929 [[Robert Morton Nance]] published his [[Unified Cornish]] system, based on the Middle Cornish literature while extending the attested vocabulary with forms based on Celtic roots also found in Breton and Welsh, publishing a dictionary in 1938. Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish for most of the 20th century. However, as the revival grew in strength and focus shifted from written to spoken Cornish, Nance's stiff, archaic formulation of the language seemed less suitable for a spoken revival, and academic research into the traditional literature proved that the Unified system lacked some phonological distinctions.

In the 1980s, in response to dissatisfaction with Unified Cornish, [[Ken George]] published a new system, {{lang|kw|[[Kernewek Kemmyn]]}} (&quot;Common Cornish&quot;). Like Unified Cornish, it retained a Middle Cornish base but implemented an orthography that aspired to be as [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] as possible. It was subsequently adopted by the Cornish Language Board as well as by many Cornish speakers, but came under fierce criticism for a variety of reasons by Jon Mills&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reconstructive Phonology and Contrastive Lexicology: Problems with the Gerlyver Kernewek Kemmyn|last=Mills, Jon|date=1999|publisher=University of Exeter Press|oclc=1078438372}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicholas Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cornish today : an examination of the revived language|last=Williams, Nicholas, 1942-|date=2006|publisher=Evertype|isbn=9781904808077|edition= 3rd|location=Westport, Co. Mayo|oclc=80332199}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as those who found its orthography too different from traditional Cornish spelling conventions. Also during this period, [[Richard Gendall]] created his Modern Cornish system (also known as &quot;Revived Late Cornish&quot;), which used Late Cornish as a basis, and Nicholas Williams published a revised version of Unified; however neither of these systems gained the popularity of Unified or Kemmyn.

The revival entered a period of factionalism and public disputes, with each orthography attempting to push the others aside. By the time that Cornish was recognised by the UK government under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2002, it had become recognised that the existence of multiple orthographies was unsustainable with regards to using the language in education and public life, as none had achieved a wide consensus. A process of unification was set about which resulted in the creation of the public-body [[Cornish Language Partnership]] in 2005 and agreement on a [[Standard Written Form]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Jonathan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7074487.stm |title=Breakthrough for Cornish language |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7408686.stm |title=Standard Cornish spelling agreed |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a new milestone was reached when UNESCO altered its classification of Cornish, stating that its previous label of &quot;extinct&quot; was no longer accurate.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

== Geographic distribution and number of speakers ==
[[File:Penzansagasdynerghcrop.jpeg|thumb|right|Cornish can be seen in many places in [[Cornwall]]; this sign is at Penzance railway station]]
Speakers of Cornish reside primarily in [[Cornwall]], which has a population of 563,600 (2017 estimate). There are also some speakers living outside Cornwall, particularly in the countries of the [[Cornish diaspora]], as well as other [[Celtic nations]]. Estimates of the number of Cornish speakers vary according to the definition of being a speaker, and is difficult to accurately determine due to the individualised nature of language take-up. Nevertheless, there is recognition that the number of Cornish speakers is growing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diarmuid O'Neill 240&quot; /&gt; From before the 1980s to the end of the 20th century there was a sixfold increased in the number of speakers to around 300.&lt;ref name=ekeltoi1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferdinand |first1=Siarl |date= 2 December 2013 |title=A Brief History of the Cornish Language, its Revival and its Current Status |url=https://www4.uwm.edu/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol2/2_6/ferdinand_2_6.html |journal= E-Keltoi: Journal of Interdisciplinary Celtic Studies|volume=2 |pages=199–227 |issn=1540-4889|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One figure for the mean number of people who know a few basic words, such as knowing that &quot;Kernow&quot; means &quot;Cornwall&quot;, was 300,000; the same survey gave the figure of people able to have simple conversations at 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rebuilding the Celtic Languages: Reversing Language Shift in the Celtic Countries |author=Diarmuid O'Neill |page=242 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PFckH-GBKAC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=%22Predennek%22#PPA240,M1 |publisher=Y Lolfa |isbn=0-86243-723-7 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cornish Language Strategy project commissioned research to provide quantitative and qualitative evidence for the number of Cornish speakers: due to the success of the revival project it was estimated that 2,000 people were fluent (surveyed in spring 2008), an increase from the estimated 300 people who spoke Cornish fluently suggested in a study by Kenneth MacKinnon in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC BBC/British Council&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='South West:TeachingEnglish:British Council:BBC|url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/uk-languages/south-west|accessdate=9 February 2010|publisher=BBC|year=2010|work=BBC/British Council website|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108190250/http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/uk-languages/south-west|archivedate=8 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walesonline creche&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=First Cornish-speaking creche is inspired by example set in Wales|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/01/16/first-cornish-speaking-creche-is-inspired-by-example-set-inwales-91466-25612689/|accessdate=18 January 2010|publisher=Welsh Media Ltd|date=16 January 2010|work=WalesOnline website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.gosw.gov.uk/497666/docs/254795/mode_of_use.doc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327121248/http://www.gosw.gov.uk/497666/docs/254795/mode_of_use.doc|date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenefer Lowe of the [[Cornish Language Partnership]] said in an interview with the BBC in 2010 that there were around 300 fluent speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-11935464|title=Cornish language no longer extinct, says UN|date=7 December 2010|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Councillor and Bard [[Bert Biscoe]] in a statement to [[Western Morning News]] in 2014 said there were &quot;several hundred fluent speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;brooks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Richard|title=The Cornish Language: In Danger or Flourishing?|url=https://www.k-international.com/blog/cornish-language-danger-flourishing/|accessdate=23 July 2019|date=18 November 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cornwall Council]] estimated in 2015 that there were 300–400 fluent speakers who used the language regularly, with 5,000 people having a basic conversational ability in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harley|first1=Nicola|title=Council splashes out £180,000 to try to stop the Cornish language dying out|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/11976596/Council-splashes-out-180000-to-try-to-stop-the-Cornish-language-dying-out.html|accessdate=1 July 2017|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 November 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornish has no official status anywhere but, since 2002, it has been recognised as a minority language under the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. The [[Cornish Language Partnership]] promotes and develops the language in Cornwall.

[[Cornwall Council]]'s policy is to support the language, in line with the European Charter. A motion was passed in November 2009 in which the council promoted the inclusion of Cornish, as appropriate and where possible, in council publications and on signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Birch|first1=Sophie|title=Cornwall cultural strategy evidence report|url=https://www.cornwall.gov.uk/media/3623631/FINAL_Cultural_strategy_evidence_report.pdf|publisher=Cornwall Council|accessdate=19 April 2018|page=24|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan has drawn some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Dyslexic-councillor-says-Cornish-language-road/story-21947323-detail/story.html |title=Dyslexic councillor says Cornish language road signs could prove dangerous for drivers |work=[[Plymouth Herald]] |date=21 July 2014 |accessdate=29 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729230737/http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Dyslexic-councillor-says-Cornish-language-road/story-21947323-detail/story.html |archive-date=29 July 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, [[Cornwall Council]] announced that staff would be encouraged to use &quot;basic words and phrases&quot; in Cornish when dealing with the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elgot|first1=Jessica|title=Cornwall council plans to encourage staff to speak Cornish|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/07/cornwall-council-plans-to-encourage-staff-to-speak-cornish|website=The Guardian|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014 the Cornish people were recognised by the UK Government as a national minority under the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Milmo |first1=Cahal |title=Cornish to be recognised as a national minority along with Scots, Welsh and Irish |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cornish-people-formally-declared-a-national-minority-along-with-scots-welsh-and-irish-9278725.html |accessdate=3 February 2019 |newspaper=The Independent |date=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FCNM provides certain rights and protections to a national minority with regard to their minority language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/157.htm Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities].

[[UNESCO]]'s ''Atlas of World Languages'' classifies Cornish as &quot;critically endangered.&quot; UNESCO has said that a previous classification of &quot;extinct&quot;, which came under fierce criticism from Cornish speakers, &quot;does not reflect the current situation for Cornish&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

In 2016, British government funding for the Cornish language ceased, and responsibility transferred to Cornwall council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornish language funding stopped by government|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-36104716|website=BBC News|date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
{{main|Cornish phonology}}
{{IPA notice}}
The phonology of modern Cornish is based on a number of sources. The work of the linguist [[Edward Lhuyd]], who visited Cornwall in 1700 to record the language, has provided a major source of input. Analysis of the traditional literature has also been used, as the Middle Cornish plays were often written in rhyming verse, and Late Cornish texts were written phonetically following English spelling conventions.

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Cornish grammar}}
The grammar of Cornish shares with other Celtic languages a number of features which, while not unique, are unusual in an Indo-European context. The grammatical features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the initial consonant mutations, the [[verb–subject–object]] word order, [[inflected preposition]]s, fronting of emphasised syntactic elements, and the use of two different forms for &quot;to be&quot;. Cornish nouns belong to one of two [[grammatical gender]]s, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for [[grammatical case|case]]. Cornish has a variety of different endings to indicate the plural, and some nouns have a third collective form. Verbs are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] for [[Tense-aspect-mood|tense and mood]], which can be indicated either by inflection of the main verb, or by the use of auxiliary verbs. In Cornish vocabulary, a large number of the lexical items are language and culture specific. Examples of these include the Cornish word ''{{lang|kw|atal}}'', which means &quot;mine waste&quot; and the word ''{{lang|kw|beetia}}'', which means &quot;to mend fishing nets&quot;. ''{{lang|kw|Foogan}}'' and ''{{lang|kw|hogan}}'' are different types of pastry cakes. ''{{lang|kw|Troyl}}'' is culture specific when referring to &quot;a traditional Cornish dance get-together&quot;, while ''{{lang|kw|Furry}}'' is a specific kind of ceremonial dance that takes place in Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Mills |first=Jon |title=The Vocabularium Cornicum: a Cornish vocabulary?|journal=Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie |volume=60 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/zcph.2013.009 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Cornish translates the English noun, &quot;book&quot;, as ''{{lang|kw|[[wikt:lyver|lyver]]}}'' (= [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''{{lang|cy|[[wikt:llyfr|llyfr]]}}''), but ''{{lang|kw|lyver}}'' can actually be translated into English as &quot;book&quot; or &quot;volume&quot; because it can be considered one in a set of books.

As in other Celtic languages, Cornish lacks a number of verbs that are commonly found in other languages. This includes modals and psych-verbs;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Padel |first=Oliver |title=The nature and date of the Old Cornish Vocabulary |journal=Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie |volume=61 |issue=1 |doi=10.1515/zcph.2014.009 |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; examples &quot;have&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, &quot;hate&quot;, &quot;prefer&quot;, &quot;must&quot;/&quot;have to&quot;, &quot;make&quot;/&quot;compel to&quot;. These functions are instead fulfilled by periphrastic constructions involving a verb and various prepositional phrases.
* ''Initial [[consonant mutation]]'':  The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context. As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared to three in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], two in [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Manx language|Manx]], and one in [[Scottish Gaelic]]).  These are known as ''soft'' (''b'' &gt; ''v'', etc.), ''hard'' (''b'' &gt; ''p''), ''aspirate'' (''b'' unchanged, ''t'' &gt; ''th'') and ''mixed'' (''b'' &gt; ''f'').

* ''[[inflected language|inflected]] (or [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]]) [[preposition]]s'':  A preposition combines with a personal pronoun to give a separate word form.  For example, ''{{lang|kw|gans}}'' (with, by) + ''{{lang|kw|my}}'' (me) → ''{{lang|kw|genev}}''; ''{{lang|kw|gans}}'' + ''{{lang|kw|ev}}'' (him) → ''{{lang|kw|ganso}}''.
* ''No indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]].'' ''{{lang|kw|Porth}}'' means &quot;harbour&quot; or &quot;a harbour&quot; (there is, however, a definite article: ''{{lang|kw|an porth}}'' means &quot;the harbour&quot;).

The [[Celtic Congress]] and [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language.

There have been films such as ''{{lang|kw|[[Hwerow Hweg]]}}'', some televised, made entirely, or significantly, in the language. Some businesses use Cornish names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornish (Kernewek/Kernowek/Kernuak/Curnoack)|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cornish.htm|website=Omniglot|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Use|url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/default.aspx?page=17|website=Cornish Language Partnership|accessdate=4 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917143538/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/default.aspx?page=17|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to sociolinguist Kenneth MacKinnon, Jenner wrote &quot;There has never been a time when there has been no person in Cornwall without a knowledge of the Cornish language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Diarmuid O Page 222&quot;&gt;''Rebuilding the Celtic languages'' By Diarmuid O'Néill (Page 222)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3327 post] on the blog ''[[Language Log]]''. Retrieved 2 August 2011, linguist [[Geoffrey K. Pullum]] reported that MacKinnon was quoting an edition of Jenner that is no longer available to him (Pullum's main concern was the impact of the triple negative in the cited sentence).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornish has significantly and durably affected Cornwall's place-names, as well as in [[Cornish surnames]], and knowledge of the language helps the understanding of these ancient meanings. Cornish names are adopted for children, pets, houses and boats.

There is Cornish literature, including spoken poetry and song, as well as traditional Cornish chants historically performed in marketplaces during religious holidays and public festivals and gatherings.

There are periodicals solely in the language such as the monthly ''{{lang|kw|An Gannas}}'', ''{{lang|kw|An Gowsva}}'', and ''{{lang|kw|An Garrick}}''. [[BBC Radio Cornwall]] has a news broadcast in Cornish, and sometimes has other programmes and features for learners and enthusiasts. Local newspapers such as the ''[[Western Morning News]]'' have articles in Cornish, and newspapers such as ''The Packet'', ''The West Briton'' and ''The Cornishman'' have also been known to have Cornish features. There is an online radio service in Cornish called {{lang|kw|Radyo an Gernewegva}},&lt;ref name=&quot;kernewegva1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radyo.kernewegva.com |title=RanG |publisher=Radyo.kernewegva.com |date= |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; publishing a one-hour podcast each week, based on a magazine format.

The language has financial sponsorship from sources, including the [[Millennium Commission]]. A number of language organisations exist in Cornwall: {{lang|kw|[[Agan Tavas]]}} (Our Language), the Cornish sub-group of the [[European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages]], {{lang|kw|[[Gorsedh Kernow]]}}, {{lang|kw|[[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]]}} (the Cornish Language Board) and {{lang|kw|[[Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek]]}} (the Cornish Language Fellowship). There are ceremonies, some ancient, some modern, which use the language or are entirely in the language.

=== Cultural events ===
Though estimations of the number of Cornish speakers vary, the speakers of Cornish today are thought to be around five hundred. Currently, Cornish is spoken by its speakers at home, outside the home, in the workplace, and at ritual ceremonies. Cornish is also being used in the arts. Revived Cornish is constructed on historical Cornish, so that the Cornish language develops. English language has had some effect in this development. Regardless of having &quot;no concrete purpose during the twentieth century,&quot; the number of Cornish speakers has gradually increased.

The [[Celtic Congress]] and [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language. Cornish has significantly and durably affected Cornwall's place-names, as well as in [[Cornish surnames]], and knowledge of the language helps the understanding of these ancient meanings. Cornish names are adopted for children, pets, houses and boats. There are periodicals solely in the language such as the monthly ''An Gannas'', ''An Gowsva'', and ''An Garrick''. [[BBC Radio Cornwall]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; has a news broadcast in Cornish, and sometimes has other programmes and features for learners and enthusiasts. Local newspapers such as the ''[[Western Morning News]]'' have articles in Cornish, and newspapers such as ''The Packet'', ''The West Briton'' and ''The Cornishman'' have also been known to have Cornish features. The language has financial sponsorship from sources, including the [[Millennium Commission]]. A number of language organisations exist in Cornwall: [[Agan Tavas]] (Our Language), the Cornish sub-group of the [[European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages]], [[Gorsedh Kernow]], [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]] (the Cornish Language Board) and [[Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek]] (the Cornish Language Fellowship).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mills|first=J.|date=1 November 2000|title=Linguistic Relativity and Linguistic Determinism: Idiom in 20th Century Cornish|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED540362.pdf|access-date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoyle|first=Mark|date=October 1999|title=The Dissidence of Despair: Rebellion And Identity In Early Modern Cornwall|journal=Journal of British Studies|volume=38|issue=4|pages=423–444|jstor=175946|doi=10.1086/386202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornwall has had cultural events associated with the language, including the international [[Celtic Media Festival]], hosted in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] in 1997.  The [[Old Cornwall Society]] has promoted the use of the language at events and meetings. Two examples of ceremonies that are performed in both the English and Cornish languages are [[Crying the Neck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newquay.oldcornwall.org.uk/articles/crying_the_neck.shtml |title=Crying the Neck in Cornwall |publisher=Newquay.oldcornwall.org.uk |accessdate=11 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708232916/http://newquay.oldcornwall.org.uk/articles/crying_the_neck.shtml |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the annual mid-summer bonfires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redrutholdcornwall.org/bonfire.htm |title=Bonfire |publisher=Redrutholdcornwall.org |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=11 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114202557/http://www.redrutholdcornwall.org/bonfire.htm |archivedate=14 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study and teaching ===
Cornish is taught in some schools; it was previously taught at degree level at the [[University of Wales]], though the only existing course in the language at University level is as part of a course in Cornish Studies at the [[University of Exeter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Institute|url=http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/history/research/centres/ics/about/|publisher=University of Exeter|website=Institute of Cornish Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, a course in the language was started as part of the Celtic Studies curriculum at the [[University of Vienna]], Austria.
The [[University of Cambridge]] offers courses in Cornish through its [[John Trim Resources Centre]], which is part of its [[Language Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.langcen.cam.ac.uk/lc/index.html |title=The Language Centre |website=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (which is part of the faculty of English), also carries out research into the Cornish language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk |title=The Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic |website=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a university level course aiming to encourage and support practitioners working with young children to introduce the Cornish language into their settings was launched. The ''Cornish Language Practice Project (Early Years)'' is a [[Qualifications and Credit Framework|level 4]] course approved by [[Plymouth University]] and run at [[Cornwall College]]. The course is not a Cornish language course, but students will be assessed on their ability to use the Cornish language constructively in their work with young children. The course will cover such topics as ''Understanding Bilingualism'', ''Creating Resources'' and ''Integrating Language and Play'', but the focus of the language provision will be on Cornish. A non-accredited specialist Cornish language course has been developed to run alongside the level 4 course for those who prefer tutor support to learn the language or develop their skills further for use with young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevren|url=http://www.magakernow.org.uk/pdf/2014_12_Kevren_misKevardhu.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2015|agency=Maga|date=December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112341/http://www.magakernow.org.uk/pdf/2014_12_Kevren_misKevardhu.pdf|archivedate=28 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornwall's first Cornish language [[day care|crèche]], ''{{lang|kw|Skol dy'Sadorn Kernewek}}'', was established in 2010 at [[Cornwall College]], [[Camborne]]. The nursery teaches children aged between two and five years alongside their parents to ensure the language is also spoken in the home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walesonline creche&quot; /&gt;

A number of dictionaries are available in the different orthographies (a dictionary in the Standard Written Form has yet to be published), including ''{{lang|kw|An Gerlyver Meur}}'' by [[Ken George]], ''{{lang|kw|Gerlyver Kernowek–Sawsnek}}'' by [[Nicholas Williams]] and ''A Practical Dictionary of Modern Cornish'' by [[Richard Gendall]]. Course books include the three-part ''{{lang|kw|Skeul an Yeth}}'' series, ''{{lang|kw|Clappya Kernowek}}'', ''{{lang|kw|Tavas a Ragadazow}}'' and ''{{lang|kw|Skeul an Tavas}}'', as well as the more recent ''{{lang|kw|Bora Brav}}'' and ''{{lang|kw|Desky Kernowek}}''.

Classes and conversation groups for adults are available at several locations in Cornwall, as well as in [[London]], [[Cardiff]] and [[Bristol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maga: class list and map&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Find a Class|url=http://www.learncornishnow.com/find-a-class.html|website=Learn Cornish Now|publisher=Cornish Language Office|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cornish studies ===
[[William Scawen]] produced a manuscript on the declining Cornish language that continually evolved until he died in 1689, aged 89. He was one of the first to realise the language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78. The only version that was ever published was a short first draft, but the final version, which he worked on until his death, is a few hundred pages long. At the same time a group of scholars, led by [[John Keigwin]] (nephew of William Scawen), of Mousehole, tried to preserve and further the Cornish language, and chose to consciously write in Cornish. One of their number, [[Nicholas Boson]], tells how he had formerly being discouraged from using Cornish to servants by his mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies-Deacon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davies-Deacon |first1=Merryn Sophie |title=Orthographies and ideologies in revived Cornish |website=Semantics Scholar |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/20cb/03efee7fb9f8e6afd703ec160d7ee4d139c3.pdf |accessdate=2 December 2019 |pages=17–19 |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group left behind a large number of translations of parts of the Bible, proverbs and songs. They were contacted by the Welsh linguist [[Edward Lhuyd]] who came to Cornwall to study the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ellis |first1=Peter Beresford |title=The Cornish language and its literature |date=1974 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |isbn=978-0710079282 |pages=82-94, 100-108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Modern Cornish was the subject of a study published by Lhuyd in 1707,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lhuyd&quot;&gt;Lhuyd, Edward (1707) ''Archæologia Britannica: giving some account additional to what has been hitherto publish'd, of the languages, histories and customs of the original inhabitants of Great Britain, from collections and observations in travels through Wales, Cornwall, Bas-Bretagne, Ireland, and Scotland; Vol. I. Glossography''. Oxford: printed at the Theater for the author, and sold by Mr. Bateman, London&lt;/ref&gt; and differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar. Such differences included sound changes and more frequent use of auxiliary verbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies-Deacon&quot;/&gt;. The medieval language also possessed two additional tenses for expressing past events and an extended set of possessive suffixes.

[[John Whitaker (historian)|John Whitaker]], the Manchester-born rector of [[Ruan Lanihorne]], studied the decline of the Cornish language. In his 1804 work ''the Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall'' he concluded that: &quot;[T]he English Liturgy, was not desired by the Cornish, but forced upon them by the tyranny of England, at a time when the English language was yet unknown in Cornwall. This act of tyranny was at once gross barbarity to the Cornish people, and a death blow to the Cornish language.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jago, Fred W. P. (1882) ''The Ancient Language and the Dialect of Cornwall''. New York: AMS Press, 1983, (originally published 1882, Netherton and Worth, Truro), pp. 4 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Williams published the first comprehensive Cornish dictionary in 1865, the ''Lexicon Cornu-Britannicum''. As a result of the discovery of additional ancient Cornish manuscripts, 2000 new words were added to the vocabulary by [[Whitley Stokes (scholar)|Whitley Stokes]] in ''A Cornish Glossary''. William C. Borlase published ''Proverbs and Rhymes in Cornish'' in 1866 while ''A Glossary of Cornish Names'' was produced by John Bannister in the same year. [[Fred W. P. Jago|Frederick Jago]] published his ''English–Cornish Dictionary'' in 1882.

In 2002, the Cornish language gained new recognition because of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Conversely, along with government provision was the governmental basis of &quot;New Public Management,&quot; measuring quantifiable results as means of determining effectiveness. This put enormous pressure on finding a single orthography that could be used in unison. The revival of Cornish required extensive rebuilding. The Cornish orthographies that were reconstructed may be considered versions of Cornish because they are not traditional sociolinguistic variations. In the middle-to-late twentieth century, the debate over Cornish orthographies angered more people because several language groups received public funding. This caused other groups to sense favouritism as playing a role in the debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sayers|first=Dave|date=2012|title=Standardising Cornish: The Politics Of A New Minority Language|url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/10586|journal=Language Problems and Language Planning|volume=36|issue=2|pages=99–119|doi=10.1075/lplp.36.2.01say|access-date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A governmental policymaking structure called New Public Management (NPM) has helped the Cornish language by managing public life of the Cornish language and people. In 2007, the Cornish Language Partnership MAGA represents separate divisions of government and their purpose is to further enhance the Cornish Language Developmental Plan. MAGA established an &quot;Ad-Hoc Group,&quot; which resulted in three orthographies being presented. The relations for the Ad-Hoc Group were to obtain consensus among the three orthographies, and then develop a &quot;single written form.&quot; The end result was creating a new form of Cornish, which had to be natural for both new learners and skilled speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Review of ''Faction and Faith.

=== Media ===
In 1983 [[BBC Radio Cornwall]] started broadcasting around two minutes of Cornish every week. In 1987, however, they gave over 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday mornings for a programme called ''{{lang|kw|Kroeder Kroghen}}'' (&quot;[[Holdall]]&quot;), presented by John King, running until the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ball, Nicole Muller, The Celtic Languages, Psychology Press, 12 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually replaced with a five-minute news bulletin called ''{{lang|kw|An Nowodhow}}'' (&quot;The News&quot;). The bulletin was presented every Sunday evening for many years by [[Rod Lyon]], then Elizabeth Stewart, and currently a team presents in rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cornwall/connected/stories/cornish_news.shtml |title=Cornwall – Connected – Hear the news read in Cornish |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pirate FM]] ran short bulletins on Saturday lunchtimes from 1998 to 1999. In 2006, Matthew Clarke who had presented the Pirate FM bulletin, launched a web-streamed news bulletin called ''{{lang|kw|Nowodhow an Seythen}}'' (&quot;Weekly News&quot;), which in 2008 was merged into a new weekly magazine podcast ''{{lang|kw|[[Radyo an Gernewegva]]}}'' (RanG).

Cornish television shows have included a 1982 series by [[Westward Television]] each episode containing a three-minute lesson in Cornish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Ball, Nicole Muller&quot;&gt;Martin Ball, Nicole Muller&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|kw|An Canker-Seth}}'', an eight episode series produced by [[Television South West]] and broadcast between June and July 1984, later on [[S4C]] from May to July 1985, and as a schools programme in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastforschools.co.uk/site/An_Canker-Seth |title=An Canker-Seth |publisher=BroadcastForSchools.co.uk |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also by Television South West were two bilingual programmes on Cornish Culture called ''{{lang|kw|Nosweyth Lowen}}''&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin Ball, Nicole Muller&quot; /&gt;
In 2016 Kelly's Ice Cream of [[Bodmin]] introduced a light hearted television commercial in the Cornish language and this has been repeated in 2017.

The first episode from the third season of the US television program [[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]] features a conversation between miners in the Cornish language, including a toast of shots using &quot;sláinte&quot;, a term also common in the Irish language. One of the miners is then shot by thugs working for businessman [[George Hearst]] and justifies the murder by saying, &quot;He come at me with his foreign gibberish.&quot;

English composer [[Peter Warlock]] wrote a Christmas carol in Cornish (setting words by Henry Jenner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Peter Warlock: Works|url= http://www.peterwarlock.org/PWWORKS.HTM#songs|publisher=The Peter Warlock Society |accessdate=2 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cornish electronic musician [[Aphex Twin]] has used Cornish names for track titles, most notably on his ''[[Drukqs|DrukQs]]'' album. 

Several traditional Cornish folk songs have been collected and can be sung to various tunes. These include &quot;[[An Awhesyth]]&quot;, &quot;[[Bro Goth agan Tasow]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Delkiow Sivy]]&quot;.

In 2018, the singer [[Gwenno Saunders]] released an album in Cornish, entitled ''[[Le Kov]]'', saying: &quot;I speak Cornish with my son: if you’re comfortable expressing yourself in a language, you want to share it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gwenno&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180412-the-rebirth-of-britains-lost-languages|first=Holly|last=Williams|website=BBC|title=The rebirth of Britain's 'lost' languages|date=12 April 2018|access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Place-names and surnames ===
{{See also|Cornish surnames}}

[[File:CornwallKernowMappa.png|thumb|right|Place-names translated into SWF]]
The Cornish language has influenced the toponomy of Cornwall, and has historically been used in surnames for the [[Cornish people]]. Long before the agreement of the [[Standard Written Form|Standard Written Form of Cornish]] in the 21st century, Late Cornish orthography in the [[Early Modern]] period usually followed Welsh to English transliteration, phonetically rendering C for K, I for Y, U for W, and Z for S. This meant that place-names were adopted into English with spellings such as &quot;Porthcurno&quot; and &quot;Penzance&quot;; they are written ''Porth Kernow'' and ''Pen Sans'' in the Standard Written Form of Cornish, agreed upon in 2008. Likewise, words such as Enys (&quot;island&quot;) can be found spelled as &quot;Ince&quot; as at [[Ince Castle]]. These apparent mistransliterations can however reveal an insight into how names and places were actually pronounced, explaining, for example, how anglicised [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]] is still pronounced &quot;Lann-zan&quot; from Cornish &quot;Lann Stefan&quot; (though with emphasis on the first element, the result of accent shift in English, and a consonant change s &gt; z which again would have occurred in English in this alternative English form of the name).
