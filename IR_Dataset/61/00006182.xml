'''Cantonese cuisine''' or more accurately, '''Guangdong cuisine''' ({{zh|t=廣東菜}}), also known as '''Yue cuisine''' ({{zh|labels=no|t=粵菜}}) refers to the [[cuisine]] of the [[Guangdong|Guangdong province]] of China (particularly the provincial capital, [[Guangzhou]], and the surrounding regions in the [[Pearl River Delta]], including [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hsiung&quot;&gt;Hsiung, Deh-Ta. Simonds, Nina. Lowe, Jason. [2005] (2005). The food of China: a journey for food lovers. Bay Books. {{ISBN|978-0-681-02584-4}}. p17.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Cantonese&quot; specifically refers to only [[Guangzhou]] or the language known as [[Cantonese]] associated with it, but people generally refer to &quot;Cantonese cuisine&quot; to all the cooking styles of the speakers of [[Yue Chinese]] languages from within Guangdong. The [[Teochew cuisine]] and [[Hakka cuisine]] of Guangdong are considered their own styles, as is neighboring [[Guangxi]]'s {{interlanguage link|Guangxi cuisine|zh|广西菜|lt=cuisine}} despite also being considered [[Lingnan culture|culturally Cantonese]]. It is one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]]. Its prominence outside China is due to the large number of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] [[Overseas Chinese|emigrants]]. Chefs trained in Cantonese cuisine are highly sought after throughout China.&lt;ref name=&quot;civitello11&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CwRE0HIIyWkC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=Cantonese+food+is+the+best#v=onepage&amp;q=Cantonese%20food%20is%20the%20best&amp;f=false |accessdate=|pages=281 |isbn=9781118098752 |author1=Civitello |first1=Linda |date=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, most Chinese restaurants in the West served largely Cantonese dishes.

==Background==
{{Cuisine of China}}

[[Guangzhou|Guangzhou (Canton) City]], the provincial capital of [[Guangdong]] and the center of [[Lingnan culture|Cantonese culture]], has long been a trading hub and many imported foods and ingredients are used in Cantonese cuisine. Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including [[offal]], chicken feet, duck's tongue, [[frog legs]], snakes and snails. However, lamb and goat are less commonly used than in the cuisines of northern or western China. Many cooking methods are used, with [[steaming]] and [[stir frying]] being the most favoured due to their convenience and rapidity. Other techniques include [[shallow frying]], [[double steaming]], [[braising]] and [[deep frying]].

For a lot of traditional Cantonese cooks, the flavours of a dish should be well balanced and not greasy. Apart from that, spices should be used in modest amounts to avoid overwhelming the flavours of the primary ingredients, and these ingredients in turn should be at the peak of their freshness and quality. There is no widespread use of fresh [[herb]]s in Cantonese cooking, in contrast with their liberal use in other cuisines such as [[Sichuanese cuisine|Sichuanese]], [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], [[Lao cuisine|Lao]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] and [[European cuisine|European]]. [[Garlic chives]] and [[coriander]] leaves are notable exceptions, although the former are often used as a vegetable and the latter are usually used as mere garnish in most dishes.

== Foods ==

=== Sauces and condiments ===
In Cantonese cuisine, a number of ingredients such as [[sugar]], [[salt]], [[Soy sauce#Chinese|soy sauce]], [[Huangjiu|rice wine]], [[cornstarch]], [[vinegar]], [[scallion]] and [[sesame oil]], suffice to enhance flavour, although garlic is heavily used in some dishes, especially those in which internal organs, such as entrails, may emit unpleasant odours. [[Ginger]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[five-spice powder]], powdered [[black pepper]], [[star anise]] and a few other spices are also used, but often sparingly.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Dried and preserved ingredients===
Although Cantonese cooks pay much attention to the freshness of their primary ingredients, Cantonese cuisine also uses a long list of preserved food items to add flavour to a dish. This may be influenced by [[Hakka cuisine]], since the [[Hakka people|Hakkas]] were once a dominant group occupying [[History of Hong Kong under Imperial China|imperial Hong Kong]] and other southern territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot;&gt;Barber, Nicola. [2004] (2004) Hong Kong. Gareth Stevens Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8368-5198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some items gain very intense flavours during the [[Drying (food)|drying]]/[[Food preservation|preservation]]/[[oxidation]] process and some foods are preserved to increase their shelf life. Some chefs combine both dried and fresh varieties of the same items in a dish. Dried items are usually soaked in water to [[Hydrate|rehydrate]] before cooking. These ingredients are generally not served ''a la carte'', but rather with vegetables or other Cantonese dishes.

===Traditional dishes===
A number of dishes have been part of Cantonese cuisine since the earliest territorial establishments of Guangdong. While many of these are on the menus of typical [[Cantonese restaurant]]s, some simpler ones are more commonly found in Cantonese homes. Home-made Cantonese dishes are usually served with plain [[white rice]].

===Deep fried dishes===

There are a small number of deep-fried dishes in Cantonese cuisine, which can often be found as [[street food]]. They have been extensively documented in [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s–1930s)|colonial Hong Kong]] records of the 19th and 20th centuries. A few are synonymous with Cantonese breakfast and lunch,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wordie&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Streets: Exploring Hong Kong Island|last= Wordie|first= Jason|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2002|publisher= [[Hong Kong University Press]]|location= Hong Kong|isbn= 962-209-563-1|page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though these are also part of other cuisines.

=== Soups ===

Old fire soup, or ''lou fo tong'' ({{zh|t=老火湯|s=老火汤|j=lou5 fo2 tong|p=lǎohuǒ tāng|l=old fire-cooked soup|labels=no}}), is a clear [[broth]] prepared by simmering meat and other ingredients over a low heat for several hours. Chinese herbs are often used as ingredients. There are basically two ways to make old fire soup – put ingredients and water in the pot and heat it directly on fire, which is called ''bou tong'' ({{zh|t=煲湯|s=煲汤|j=bou1 tong1|p=bāo tāng|labels=no}}); or put the ingredients in a small stew pot, and put it in a bigger pot filled with water, then heat the bigger pot on fire directly, which is called ''dun tong'' ({{zh|t=燉湯|s=燉汤|j=dun6 tong1|p=dùn tāng|labels=no}}). The latter way can keep the most original taste of the soup.

Soup chain stores or delivery outlets in cities with significant Cantonese populations, such as Hong Kong, serve this dish due to the long preparation time required of slow-simmered soup.

=== Seafood ===
[[Image:CantoneseRestaurantSeafood.jpg|thumb|right|Seafood tanks in a Cantonese restaurant]]

Due to Guangdong's location along the [[South China Sea]] coast, fresh seafood is prominent in Cantonese cuisine, and many Cantonese restaurants keep aquariums or seafood tanks on the premises. In Cantonese cuisine, as in cuisines from other parts of Asia, if seafood has a repugnant odour, strong spices and marinating juices are added; the freshest seafood is odourless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of [[soy sauce]], [[ginger]] and [[spring onion]] is added to steamed fish. In Cantonese cuisine, the light seasoning is used only to bring out the natural sweetness of the seafood. As a rule of thumb, the spiciness of a dish is usually inversely proportionate to the freshness of the ingredients.

=== Noodle dishes ===

Noodles are served either in soup broth or fried. These are available as home-cooked meals, on [[dim sum]] side menus, or as street food at [[dai pai dong]]s, where they can be served with a variety of toppings such as [[fish ball]]s, [[beef ball]]s, or [[fish slice]]s.

A typical dish may consist of [[offal]] and half an order of multiple varieties of roasted meat. The majority of siu laap is [[white meat]].

===Little pot rice===
[[File:Claypot Chicken Rice, Singapore.JPG|thumb|right|Little pot chicken rice with vegetable and [[Chinese sausage]]]]

Little pot rice ({{zh|s=煲仔饭|t=煲仔飯|j=bou1 zai2 faan6|p=bāozǎifàn|labels=no}}) are dishes cooked and served in a flat-bottomed pot (as opposed to a round-bottomed [[wok]]). Usually this is a [[saucepan]] or [[braising]] pan (see [[clay pot cooking]]). Such dishes are cooked by covering and steaming, making the rice and ingredients very hot and soft. Usually the ingredients are layered on top of the rice with little or no mixing in between. Many standard combinations exist.

===Banquet/dinner dishes===

A number of dishes are traditionally served in Cantonese restaurants only at dinner time. [[Dim sum]] restaurants stop serving [[bamboo]]-basket dishes after the [[yum cha]] period (equivalent to [[afternoon tea]]) and begin offering an entirely different menu in the evening. Some dishes are standard while others are regional. Some are customised for special purposes such as [[Chinese marriage]]s or banquets. Salt and pepper dishes are one of the few spicy dishes.

===Dessert===

After the evening meal, most Cantonese restaurants offer ''[[tong sui]]'' ({{zh|s=糖水|t=糖水|p=táng shuǐ|j=tong4 seoi2|l=sugar water|labels=no}}), a sweet soup. Many varieties of ''tong sui'' are also found in other Chinese cuisines. Some desserts are traditional, while others are recent innovations. The more expensive restaurants usually offer their specialty desserts. Sugar water is the general name of dessert in Guangdong province. It is cooked by adding water and sugar to some other cooking ingredients. It is said that Huazhou sugar water is the famous and popular one in Guangdong. There is a saying that Chinese sugar water is in Guangdong, and Cantonese sugar water in Huazhou. And the booming of Huazhou sugar water stores prove it.{{CN|date=September 2019}}

===Delicacies===

Certain Cantonese delicacies consist of parts taken from rare or endangered animals, which raises controversy over [[animal rights]] and [[Environmental issues in China|environmental issues]]. This is often{{according to whom|date=March 2015}} due to alleged health benefits of certain animal products. For example, the continued spreading of the idea that [[shark cartilage]] can cure cancer has led to decreased shark populations even though scientific research has found no evidence to support the credibility of shark cartilage as a cancer cure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/64/23/8485|title=Shark Cartilage, Cancer and the Growing Threat of Pseudoscience|first1=Marilyn J.|last1=Wolfe|first2=Jeffrey C.|last2=Wolf|first3=Keith C.|last3=Cheng|first4=Gary K.|last4=Ostrander|date=1 December 2004|publisher=|journal=Cancer Research|volume=64|issue=23|pages=8485–8491|via=cancerres.aacrjournals.org|doi=10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-2260|pmid=15574750}}&lt;/ref&gt;
