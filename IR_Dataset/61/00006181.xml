{{Cuisine of China}}
'''Cuisine of Chinese Muslims''' ({{zh|t=淸眞菜|p=Qīngzhēn cài|l=Ḥalāl cuisine}}, [[Dungan language|Dungan]]: Чыңжән цаы or {{zh|t=回族菜|p=Huízú cài|l=Hui people's cuisine}}, [[Dungan language|Dungan]]: Ҳуэйзў цаы) is the cuisine of the [[Hui people|Hui]] (ethnic Chinese Muslims) and other Muslims living in China such as [[Bonan people|Bonan]], [[Dongxiangs|Dongxiang]], [[Salar people|Salar]] and Uyghurs as well as [[Dungan people|Dungans]] of [[Central Asia]].

==History==

Due to the large [[Muslims|Muslim]] population in Western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to or are run by, Muslims. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in [[China proper]]. It is heavily influenced by [[Beijing cuisine]], with nearly all cooking methods identical, and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine though seldom in east coast restaurants.

During the [[Yuan dynasty]], [[halal]] methods of slaughtering animals and preparing food was banned and forbidden by the Mongol emperors, starting with [[Genghis Khan]] who banned Muslims and Jews from slaughtering their animals their own way and made them follow the Mongol method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&amp;q=chinggis%20khan%20forbidden%20halal&amp;f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&amp;q=%20halal%20chinggis%20khan%20you%20are%20our%20slaves%20&amp;f=false|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=illustrated|location=|page=228|isbn=0-8122-4237-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say “we do not eat Mongol food”. [Cinggis Qa’an replied:] “By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?” He thereupon made them eat. “If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.” He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under [[Kublai Khan|Qubilai]]] all the Muslims say: “if someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat”. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |title=The Integration of Religious Minorities in China: The Case of Chinese Muslims |author=Donald Daniel Leslie |year=1998 |page=12 |publisher=The Fifty-ninth George Ernest Morrison Lecture in Ethnology |accessdate=30 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217112014/http://islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Traditionally, there is a distinction between northern and southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both using [[mutton]] and lamb. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. The reason for this difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese, and shrimp are rare in comparison to southern China due to the arid climate of northern China.

A Chinese Islamic restaurant ({{zh|t=淸眞菜館|p=qīngzhēn càiguǎn}}) can be similar to a [[Mandarin cuisine|Mandarin restaurant]] with the exception that there is no [[pork]] on the menu and is{{clarify|date=February 2015}} primarily noodle/soup based.

In most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/Halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]]). They primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as pictures of Islamic [[Carpet|rug]]s and Arabic writing.

Another difference is that [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and [[Lamb (food)|mutton]] dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions. ([[Chinese Islamic cuisine#Image gallery|Refer to image 1]].)

Other Muslim ethnic minorities like the [[Salar people|Salar]], [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]], [[Bonan people|Bonan]], and [[Tibetan Muslims]] have their own cuisines as well. Dongxiang people operate their own restaurants serving their cuisine.

Many cafeterias (canteens) at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students (Hui or western Chinese minorities), typically labeled &quot;qingzhen.&quot; Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim and will allow access to these dining areas or will allow access on special occasions such as the [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] feast following [[Ramadan]].

Several Hui restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine exist in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbZuVatiFIUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dru+c+gladney#v=snippet&amp;q=los%20angeles%20restaurants&amp;f=false|title=Dislocating China: reflections on Muslims, minorities, and other subaltern subjects|author=Dru C.

Many Chinese Hui Muslims who moved from [[Yunnan]] to [[Burma]] (Myanmar) are known as [[Panthays]] operate restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine such as noodles. Chinese Hui Muslims from Yunnan who moved to [[Thailand]] are known as [[Chin Haw]], and they also own restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic food.

Most Chinese regard Hui halal food as cleaner than food made by non Muslims so their restaurants are popular in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTROdDIiaT8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=hui+halal+food+cleaner#v=onepage&amp;q=hui%20halal%20food%20cleaner&amp;f=false|title=Governing China's Multiethnic Frontiers|author=Morris Rossabi|year=2005|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=|page=32|isbn=0-295-98412-0|accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hui who migrated to [[Northeast China]] ([[Manchuria]]) after the [[Chuang Guandong]] opened many new inns and restaurants to cater to travelers, which were regarded as clean.

The [[Thailand|Thai]] Department of Export Promotion claims that &quot;China's halal food producers are small-scale entrepreneurs whose products have little value added and lack branding and technology to push their goods to international standards&quot; to encourage Thai private sector halal producers to market their products in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai private sector urged to penetrate China's halal market|author=MCOT online news|newspaper=MCOT online news|date=May 17, 2011|url=http://www.mcot.net/cfcustom/cache_page/210644.html|accessdate=2010-11-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520214517/http://www.mcot.net/cfcustom/cache_page/210644.html|archivedate=May 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lamian===
{{main|Lamian}}
'''Lamian''' ([[Chinese Islamic cuisine#Image gallery|Refer to image 2]]) ({{zh|s=拉面|t=拉麪|p=lāmiàn}}, [[Dungan language|Dungan]]: Ламян)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/60892|title=Kyrgyzstan Eats: A Dungan Feast in Naryn|website=Eurasianet.org|accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Chinese dish of hand-made noodles, usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup (湯麪, даңмян tāngmiàn), but sometimes stir-fried (炒麪, Чаомян chǎomiàn) and served with a tomato-based sauce. Literally, 拉, ла (lā) means to pull or stretch, while 麪, мян (miàn) means noodle. The hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce a single very long noodle.

Words that begin with L are not native to Turkic — läghmän is a loanword as stated by Uyghur linguist Abdlikim: It is of Chinese derivation and not originally Uyghur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellér-Hann2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ildikó Bellér-Hann|title=Situating the Uyghurs Between China and Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NKCU3BdeBbEC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=laghman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t4VYVfz9LpOhyATQjYKwBg&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=laghman&amp;f=false|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-7041-4|pages=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inner Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUJuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+most+likely+etymology+of+the+word+is+that+which+derives+it+from+the+Chinese+%27leng+mian%27+%28cold+noodles%29+or+%27la+mian%27+%28pulled+noodles%29+%28Qazaq+tilining+1987%29.+6&amp;dq=The+most+likely+etymology+of+the+word+is+that+which+derives+it+from+the+Chinese+%27leng+mian%27+%28cold+noodles%29+or+%27la+mian%27+%28pulled+noodles%29+%28Qazaq+tilining+1987%29.+6&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi23ojSrKvMAhWFNj4KHdYcAEAQ6AEIHzAA|year=2000|publisher=The White Horse Press for the Mongolia and Inner Asia Studies Unit at the University of Cambridge|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wang2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Q.

===Beef noodle soup===
{{Main|Beef noodle soup}}
'''Beef noodle soup''' ([[Chinese Islamic cuisine#Image gallery|Refer to image 2]]) is a [[noodle soup]] dish composed of stewed [[beef]], beef broth, [[vegetable]]s and [[wheat noodle]]s. It exists in various forms throughout [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The most common [[Vietnam]]ese version is called [[Kho (cooking technique)|Bo kho]] but uses [[rice noodle]]s. It was created by the Hui people during the [[Tang dynasty]] of [[China]].

In the west, this food may be served in a small portion as a soup. In China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish.

===Chuanr===
{{Main|Chuan (food)}}
'''Chuanr''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 串儿, [[Dungan language|Dungan]]: Чўанр, [[Pinyin]]: chuànr (shortened from &quot;chuan er&quot;), &quot;''kebab''&quot;), originating in the [[Xinjiang]] (新疆) province of China and in recent years has been disseminated throughout the rest of that country, most notably in [[Beijing]]. It is a product of the Chinese Islamic cuisine of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] (维吾尔) people and other [[Islam in China|Chinese Muslims]]. Yang rou chuan or lamb kebabs, is particularly popular.

===Suan cai===
{{Main|Suan cai}}
'''Suan cai''' is a traditional fermented vegetable dish, similar to Korean [[kimchi]] and German [[sauerkraut]], used in a variety of ways. It consists of pickled Chinese cabbage. Suan cai is a unique form of pao cai due to the material used and the method of production. Although ''suan cai'' is not exclusive to Chinese Islamic cuisine, it is used in Chinese Islamic cuisine to top off noodle soups, especially [[beef noodle soup]].

===Nang===
''Nang'' (Chinese: 馕, Dungan: Нәң) is a type of round unleavened bread, topped with sesame. It is similar to South and Central Asia [[naan]].
