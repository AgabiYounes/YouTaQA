Central America consists of seven countries: [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Belize]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Panama]]. The combined population of Central America is estimated at 44.53 million (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=World Population Review|title=Central America Population 2020|language=en|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/continents/central-america-population/|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central America is a part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n [[biodiversity hotspot]], which extends from northern Guatemala to central Panama. Due to the presence of several [[active fault|active geologic faults]] and the [[Central America Volcanic Arc]], there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region, such as [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury and property damage.

In the [[Pre-Columbian era]], Central America was inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area|Isthmo-Colombian]] peoples to the south and east. Following the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages to the [[Americas]], Spain began to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonize the Americas]]. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) were governed by the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]] from [[Mexico City]] as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy [[Juan O'Donojú|Juan de O’Donojú]] signed the [[Treaty of Córdoba]], which established New Spain's independence from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/spain-accepts-mexican-independence|title=Spain accepts Mexican independence|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 September 1821, the [[Act of Independence of Central America]] was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the [[Spanish Empire]] and provide for the establishment of a new [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American state]]. Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region (i.e. what would become [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]]) were annexed to the [[First Mexican Empire]]; however, in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] until 1838.

In 1838, [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]] became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent autonomous countries, followed by [[El Salvador]] in 1841, [[Panama]] in 1903 and [[Belize]] in 1981{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}. Despite the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], there is anecdotal evidence that demonstrates that [[Salvadorans]], [[Panamanians]], [[Costa Ricans]], [[Guatemalans]], [[Hondurans]] and [[Nicaraguans]] continue to maintain a Central American identity. For instance, Central Americans sometimes refer to their nations as if they were provinces of a Central American state. It is not unusual to write &quot;C.A.&quot; after the country's name in formal and informal contexts. Governments in the region sometimes reinforce this sense of belonging to Central America in its citizens. For example, automobile licence plates in many of the region's countries include the moniker, ''Centroamerica,'' alongside the country's name. [[Belizeans]] are mostly associated to be culturally [[West Indian]] rather than Central American.

== Different definitions ==
[[File:Flag-map of Central America.svg|thumb|[[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]] and [[Belize]] are historically the seven nations in Central America politically, geographically and culturally.]]

&quot;Central America&quot; may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:
* The [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas]] defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States and specifically includes all of Mexico.&lt;ref name=UN2017 /&gt;
* [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] is usually thought to comprise [[Mexico]] to the north of the 7 states of ''Central America'' as well as [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] to the south. Usually, the whole of the [[Caribbean]] to the northeast, and sometimes the [[Guyanas]], are also included.&lt;br /&gt; According to one source, the term &quot;Central America&quot; was used as a synonym for &quot;[[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]]&quot; at least as recently as 1962.&lt;ref name=Augelli1962 /&gt;
* In [[Ibero-America]] (Spanish and Portuguese speaking American countries), the [[Americas]] is considered a single continent, and Central America is considered a [[subregion]] of [[North America]] comprising the seven countries south of Mexico and north of Colombia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} 
* For the people living in the five countries formerly part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] there is a distinction between the Spanish language terms &quot;América Central&quot; and &quot;Centroamérica&quot;.  While both can be translated into English as &quot;Central America&quot;, &quot;América Central&quot; is generally used to refer to the geographical area of the seven countries between [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]], while &quot;Centroamérica&quot; is used when referring to the former members of the Federation emphasizing the shared culture and history of the region.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} 
* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as a rule and occasionally in Spanish and other languages, the entirety of the [[Antilles]] is often included in the definition of Central America. Indeed, the [[Dominican Republic]] is a full member of the [[Central American Integration System]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

In the [[Pre-Columbian era]], the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of [[Mesoamerica]]. Most notable among these were the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the [[Aztec]]s, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern [[El Salvador]], eastern [[Honduras]], Caribbean [[Nicaragua]], most of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] were predominantly speakers of the [[Chibchan languages]] at the time of European contact and are considered by some&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoopes&amp;Fonseca2003&quot; /&gt; culturally different and grouped in the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].

Following the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of [[Maya civilization|Maya territory]] in 1523. Soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] commenced the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of northern Central America]] for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Beginning with his arrival in [[Soconusco]] in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Pipil people|Pipil]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]]. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the [[Petén Basin]] remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms – the [[Kowoj]] and the [[Itza people]] – were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the [[Spanish conquest of Petén]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1538, Spain established the [[Real Audiencia of Panama#First installation|Real Audiencia of Panama]], which had jurisdiction over all land from the [[Strait of Magellan]] to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the ''[[Real Audiencia of Guatemala|Audiencia Real de Guatemala]]''. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in [[Antigua Guatemala]], was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a [[Captaincies of the Spanish Empire|captaincy general]] and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of [[British Honduras|present-day Belize]] and Panama.

The Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a [[1811 Independence Movement|rebellion in 1811]] which began in the [[Intendant#Spain and the Spanish Empire|intendancy]] of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the [[Act of Independence of Central America]]. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] and the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]], and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.

[[File:Salcoatitán, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|250px|The five rowed volcanos in the coat of arms of Central America was inspired by the [[Cordillera de Apaneca]] volcanic range of [[El Salvador]], visible from the city of [[Sonsonate]], which became the capital of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] in 1834.]]

From its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived [[First Mexican Empire]]. When the [[Agustín de Iturbide|Emperor of Mexico]] abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The Federal Republic of Central America was a [[representative democracy]] with its capital at [[Guatemala City]]. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], [[Mosquito Coast]], and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see [[History of Belize (1506–1862)]]. Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a [[Departments of Guatemala|Guatemalan department]]. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it [[British Honduras]]. It became independent as Belize in 1981.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Panama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], has for most of its history been culturally and politically linked to South America. Panama was part of the [[Province of Tierra Firme]] from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed ''Audiencia Real de Panama''. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], the capital of which was located at [[Bogotá|Santa Fé de Bogotá]]. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of [[Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada|military and political struggles]] took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the [[Republic of New Granada]]. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as [[Panama State]], first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the [[Granadine Confederation]], and finally within the [[United States of Colombia]]. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the [[Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the [[Isthmus Department]]. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession of Panama]] on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

By the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase [[banana republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Livingstone|first=Grace|title=America's Backyard: The United States and Latin America from the Monroe Doctrine to the War on Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH5jDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT31|year=2013|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|isbn=978-1-84813-611-3|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict, and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation. Poverty, social injustice, and violence are still widespread.&lt;ref name=Argueta2011 /&gt; Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the western hemisphere (only [[Haiti]] is poorer).&lt;ref name=ticotimes /&gt;

Central America is the tapering isthmus of southern North America, with unique and varied geographic features. The Pacific Ocean lies to the southwest, the Caribbean Sea lies to the northeast, and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] lies to the north. Some [[Physical geography|physiographists]] define the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] as the northern geographic border of Central America,&lt;ref name=MW /&gt; while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the [[Atrato River]], where it connects to the [[Pacific/Chocó natural region|Pacific Lowlands]] in northwestern South America.

Of the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]], the [[Cordillera Isabelia]] and the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]]. At {{convert|4220|m|ft|sp=us}}, [[Volcán Tajumulco]] is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:

Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=IBP, Inc.|title=Central American Countries Mineral Industry Handbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Regulations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_PxCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|year=2015|isbn=978-1-329-09114-6|pages=7, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trade winds]] have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the [[Wet season|summer wet season]], and are lowest during the [[Dry season|winter dry season]], when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.&lt;ref name=Oliver2005 /&gt;

Central America is part of the Mesoamerican [[biodiversity hotspot]], boasting 7% of the world's [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=webng /&gt; The [[Pacific Flyway]] is a major north–south [[flyway]] for [[Bird migration|migratory birds]] in the Americas, extending from [[Alaska]] to [[Tierra del Fuego]]. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the [[Nearctic ecozone|Nearctic]] and the [[Neotropic ecozone]]s. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity.&lt;ref name=webng /&gt; The table below shows recent statistics:

Over 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are [[deforestation]], which is estimated by [[FAO]] at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of [[rainforest]]s and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.&lt;ref name=Harvey2008 /&gt;

Efforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating [[ecoregion]]s and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected.&lt;ref name=Ramos2010 /&gt; A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]]. The [[Belize Barrier Reef]] is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse [[ecosystem]]s of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 [[Alcyonacea|soft coral]] species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of [[invertebrate]] species.
So far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.&lt;ref name=westminster /&gt;

From 2001 to 2010, {{convert|5376|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest [[biome]], with {{convert|12201|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with {{convert|4730|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, and a gain in the dry forest biome at {{convert|2054|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the [[Deforestation in Central America|deforestation]] was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of {{convert|8574|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of {{convert|3050|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.&lt;ref name=Redo2012 /&gt;

The [[Central American pine-oak forests]] ecoregion, in the [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]] biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of {{convert|111400|km2|sqmi|sp=us}},&lt;ref name=WWF0303 /&gt; extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] in Mexico's [[Chiapas]] state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between {{convert|600|-|1800|m|ft}} elevation,&lt;ref name=WWF0303 /&gt; and are surrounded at lower elevations by [[tropical moist forests]] and [[tropical dry forests]]. Higher elevations above {{convert|1800|m|ft}} are usually covered with [[Central American montane forests]]. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including [[oak]], [[pine]], [[fir]], and [[cypress]].

[[Laurel forest]] is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen [[cloud forest]], found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level. Tree species include [[evergreen oak]]s, members of the [[Laurus|laurel family]], and species of ''[[Weinmannia]]'', ''[[Drimys]]'', and ''[[Magnolia]]''.&lt;ref name=WWF0167 /&gt; The cloud forest of [[Sierra de las Minas]], Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the [[Mombacho]] volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de [[Tilarán]] and [[Volcán Arenal]], called [[Monteverde]], also in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]].

The [[Central American montane forests]] are an ecoregion of the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] biome, as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref name=WWF0112 /&gt; These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer [[wet season]] and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from {{convert|1800|-|4000|m|ft}}, on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|13200|km2|sqmi|sp=us}} and has a [[temperate climate]] with relatively high [[precipitation]] levels.&lt;ref name=WWF0112 /&gt;

Ecoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the [[Talamancan montane forests]] in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the [[resplendent quetzal]] (Pharomacrus mocinno), [[three-wattled bellbird]] (Procnias tricarunculata), [[bare-necked umbrellabird]] (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and [[black guan]] (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The [[golden toad]] that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extinction are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of that frog is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. [[Jaguar]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, as well as [[tapir]]s, and [[anteater]]s live in the woods of Central America.&lt;ref name=WWF0167 /&gt; The [[Central American red brocket]] is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.

Central America is geologically very active, with [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes occurring frequently, and [[tsunami]]s occurring occasionally. Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.

Most of Central America rests atop the [[Caribbean Plate]]. This [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] converges with the [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]], [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]], and [[North American Plate|North American]] plates to form the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction]] zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some {{convert|60-160|km|mi|sp=us}} off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.&lt;ref name=Astiz1987 /&gt; For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1942 Guatemala earthquake|1942]], [[1956 Nicaragua earthquake|1956]], [[1982 El Salvador earthquake|1982]], [[1992 Nicaragua earthquake|1992]], [[2001 El Salvador earthquakes|2001]], [[2007 Guatemala earthquake|2007]], [[2012 Guatemala earthquake|2012]], [[October 2014 Nicaragua earthquake|2014]], and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.

The Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The [[Motagua Fault]] is an onshore continuation of the [[Cayman Trough]] which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This [[transform fault]] cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near [[Acapulco]]. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in [[1717 Guatemala earthquake|1717]], [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|1773]], [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976]], [[1980 Honduras earthquake|1980]], and [[2009 Honduras earthquake|2009]].

Another onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the [[Chixoy-Polochic Fault]], which runs parallel to, and roughly {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.&lt;ref name=White1985 /&gt;

[[Managua]], the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|1931]] and [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972]].

Volcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.

This region of the continent is very rich in terms of ethnic groups. The majority of the population is [[mestizo]], with sizable Mayan and African descendent populations present, including Xinca and Garifuna minorities. The immigration of Arabs, Jews, Chinese, Europeans and others brought additional groups to the area.

The predominant religion in Central America is [[Christianity]] (95.6%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwgordonconwell.com/netcommunity/CSGCResources/ChristianityinitsGlobalContext.pdf Christianity in its Global Context] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229040220/http://wwwgordonconwell.com/netcommunity/CSGCResources/ChristianityinitsGlobalContext.pdf |date=29 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Central America in the 16th century, [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] became the most popular religion in the region until the first half of the 20th century. Since the 1960s, there has been an increase in other Christian groups, particularly [[Protestantism]], as well as other religious organizations, and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion.&lt;ref name=Holland2005 /&gt;

Central America is currently undergoing a process of political, economic and cultural transformation that started in 1907 with the creation of the [[Central American Court of Justice]].

In 1951 the integration process continued with the signature of the San Salvador Treaty, which created the ODECA, the Organization of Central American States. However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.

In 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the [[Central American Integration System]] (''Sistema para la Integración Centroamericana'', or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the [[Dominican Republic]], a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.

On 6 December 2008, SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081206-central-american-leaders-agree-common-currency-|title=Central American leaders agree on common currency|work=France 24|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; No timeline for implementation was discussed.

Central America already has several supranational institutions such as the [[Central American Parliament]], the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]] and the [[Central American Common Market]].

On 22 July 2011, President [[Mauricio Funes]] of El Salvador became the first president ''[[pro tempore]]'' to SICA. El Salvador also became the headquarters of SICA with the inauguration of a new building.&lt;ref name=BESS2013 /&gt;

=== Foreign relations ===
{{See also|China–Latin America relations}}
Until recently,{{when|date=January 2019}} all Central American countries have maintained diplomatic relations with [[Taiwan]] instead of China. President [[Óscar Arias]] of Costa Rica, however, established diplomatic relations with China in 2007, severing formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.&lt;ref name=TCNYT /&gt; After breaking off relations with the Republic of China in 2017, Panama established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://america.cgtn.com/2017/06/12/panama-establishes-diplomatic-relations-with-china |title=In historic move, Panama and China establish diplomatic relations |publisher=America.cgtn.com |date=12 June 2017 |accessdate=30 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2018, El Salvador also severed ties with Taiwan to formally start recognizing the People's Republic of China as the sole China, a move many considered lacked transparency due to its abruptness and reports of the Chinese government's desires to invest in the department of La Union while also promising to fund the ruling party's reelection campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/world/asia/taiwan-el-salvador-china.amp.html | title=White House Criticizes China over el Salvador Recognition| newspaper=The New York Times| date=24 August 2018| last1=Ramzy| first1=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parliament ===
{{Main|Central American Parliament}}
[[File:Escudo-PARLACEN..jpg|thumb|Coat of Arms of the [[Central American Parliament]]]]
The Central American Parliament (also known as PARLACEN) is a political and parliamentary body of SICA. The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.

Costa Rica is not a member State of the Central American Parliament and its adhesion remains as a very unpopular topic at all levels of the Costa Rican society due to existing strong political criticism towards the regional parliament, since it is regarded by Costa Ricans as a menace to democratic accountability and effectiveness of integration efforts. Excessively high salaries for its members, legal immunity of jurisdiction from any member State, corruption, lack of a binding nature and effectiveness of the regional parliament's decisions, high operative costs and immediate membership of Central American Presidents once they leave their office and presidential terms, are the most common reasons invoked by Costa Ricans against the Central American Parliament.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Signed in 2004, the [[Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) is an agreement between the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the [[Dominican Republic]]. The treaty is aimed at promoting [[free trade]] among its members.

Guatemala has the largest economy in the region.&lt;ref name=IMFWEO2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=IMFGDP2012 /&gt; Its main exports are coffee, sugar, bananas, petroleum, clothing, and [[cardamom]]. Of its 10.29 billion dollar annual exports,&lt;ref name=ciaexport /&gt; 40.2% go to the United States, 11.1% to neighboring El Salvador, 8% to Honduras, 5.5% to Mexico, 4.7% to Nicaragua, and 4.3% to Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=ciaexportgu /&gt;

The region is particularly attractive for companies (especially clothing companies) because of its geographical proximity to the[United States], very low wages and considerable tax advantages. In addition, the decline in the prices of coffee and other export products and the structural adjustment measures promoted by the international financial institutions have partly ruined agriculture, favouring the emergence of maquiladoras. This sector accounts for 42 per cent of total exports from [[El Salvador]], 55 per cent from [[Guatemala]], and 65 per cent from [[Honduras]]. However, its contribution to the economies of these countries is disputed; raw materials are imported, jobs are precarious and low-paid, and tax exemptions weaken public finances.&lt;ref name=&quot;insumisos.com&quot;&gt;https://www.insumisos.com/diplo/NODE/663.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also criticised for the working conditions of employees: insults and physical violence, abusive dismissals (especially of pregnant workers), working hours, non-payment of overtime. According to Lucrecia Bautista, coordinator of the''maquilas'' sector of the audit firm Coverco,''labour law regulations are regularly violated in maquilas and there is no political will to enforce their application. In the case of infringements, the labour inspectorate shows remarkable leniency. It is a question of not discouraging investors. &quot;Trade unionists are subject to pressure, and sometimes to kidnapping or murder. In some cases, business leaders have used the services of the [[Maras (gang)|maras]]. Finally, black lists containing the names of trade unionists or political activists are circulating in employers' circles.&lt;ref name=&quot;insumisos.com&quot;/&gt;

Economic growth in Central America is projected to slow slightly in 2014–15, as country-specific domestic factors offset the positive effects from stronger economic activity in the United States.&lt;ref name=IMF2014 /&gt;
