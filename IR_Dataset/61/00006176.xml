'''Cecil Blount DeMille''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|ɛ|s|əl|_|d|ə|ˈ|m|ɪ|l}}; August 12, 1881 – January 21, 1959) was an American filmmaker. Between 1914 and 1958, he made a total of 70 features, both [[Silent film|silent]] and [[sound film]]s. He is acknowledged as a founding father of the [[cinema of the United States|American cinema]] and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants.

DeMille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later moved to writing and directing stage productions, some with [[Jesse Lasky]], who was then a [[vaudeville]] producer. DeMille's first film, ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914), was also the first feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story made it commercially successful and it first publicized [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] as the home of the U.S. film industry. The continued success of his productions led to the founding of [[Paramount Pictures]] with Lasky and [[Adolph Zukor]]. His first biblical epic, ''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for twenty-five years.

DeMille directed ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927), a biography of [[Jesus]], which gained approval for its sensitivity and reached more than 800 million viewers. ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' (1932) is said to be the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. ''[[Cleopatra (1934 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1934) was his first film to be nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. After more than thirty years in film production, DeMille reached a pinnacle in his career with ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949), a biblical epic which became the highest-grossing film of 1950. Along with biblical and historical narratives, he also directed films oriented toward &quot;neo-naturalism&quot;, which tried to portray the laws of man fighting the forces of nature.

He received his first nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for his circus drama ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952), which won both the [[25th Academy Awards|Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama]]. His last and best known film, ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), also a Best Picture Academy Award nominee, is currently the [[List of highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation|eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation]]. In addition to his Best Picture Awards, he received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] for his film contributions, the [[Palme d'Or]] (posthumously) for ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' (1939), a [[Directors Guild of America Award|DGA Award]] for Lifetime Achievement, and the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]]. He was the first recipient of the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]], which was named in his honor. DeMille's reputation as a filmmaker has grown over time and his work has influenced many other films and directors.

DeMille]], was born on July 25, 1878.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=17}} Henry deMille, whose ancestors were of Dutch-Belgian descent, was a [[North Carolina]]-born dramatist, actor, and lay reader in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]].{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=15-21}} DeMille's father was also an English teacher at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]] (now Columbia University).{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=1}} He worked as a [[playwright]], administrator, and faculty member during the early years of the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]], established in New York City in 1884.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=23}}

Henry deMille frequently collaborated with [[David Belasco]] when playwriting.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=22}} Their most well known collaborations include ''The Wife'', ''Lord Chumley'', ''The Charity Ball'', and ''Men and Women''.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=1}} DeMille's mother Beatice, a literary agent and scriptwriter, whose parents were both of [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] heritage, married Henry deMille July 1, 1876 despite her parents' dissent due to their differing religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2007|p=3}};{{harvnb|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Eyman|2010|pp=15–17, 138}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emigrated from England with her parents in 1871 when she was 18, and they settled in [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]].

New York: Da Capo Press. p. 6-8 {{ISBN|978-0-306-80975-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; DeMille's parents met as members of a music and literary society in New York. Henry was a tall, red-headed student.

DeMille was a brave and confident child.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=24}} He gained his love of theater while watching his father and Belasco rehearse their plays and a lasting memory for DeMille was a lunch with his father and actor [[Edwin Booth]].{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=26-27}} As a child, DeMille created an alter-ego called &quot;Champion Driver&quot;, a Robin Hood-like character, evidence of his creativity and imagination.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=18}} The family lived in Washington, North Carolina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Powell |editor1-first=William S. |title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography: Vol. 2, D-G, Volume 2 |date=1986 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill |isbn=080781329X |page=51 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BdAGnn0SZX0C&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=washington,+north+carolina+cecil+b+demille#v=onepage&amp;q=washington%2C%20north%20carolina%20cecil%20b%20demille&amp;f=false |accessdate=July 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; until Henry built a three-story [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style house for his family in [[Pompton Lakes, New Jersey]]; they named this estate &quot;Pamlico&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2007|p=13}}; {{harvnb|Eyman|2010|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Philip Sousa]] was a friend of the family and DeMille recalled throwing mud balls in the air so neighbor [[Annie Oakley]] could practice her shooting.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=28}} DeMille's sister Agnes was born on April 23, 1891; his mother nearly did not survive the birth.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=29}} Agnes would die on February 11, 1894 at the age of three from spinal meningitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Highman|1973|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Eyman|2010|pp=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|DeMille's niece and William deMille's daughter [[Agnes de Mille]] was a famed dancer-choreographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Acocella |first1=Joan |title=Agnes DeMille's Artistic Justice |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/agnes-de-milles-artistic-justice |accessdate=May 23, 2019 |work=The New Yorker |publisher=Conde Nast |date=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  DeMille's parents operated a private school in town and attended Christ Episcopal Church.

On January 8, 1893, at the age of forty, Henry de Mille died suddenly from [[typhoid fever]], leaving Beatrice with three children. To provide for her family, she opened the Henry C. DeMille School for girls in her home in February 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Highman|1973|p=8}}; {{harvnb|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the school was to teach young women to properly understand and fulfill the women's duty to herself, her home, and her country.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=14}} Before Henry deMille's death, Beatrice had &quot;enthusiastically supported&quot; her husband's theatrical aspirations. She later became the second female play broker on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=47}} On Henry DeMille's deathbed, he told his wife that he did not want his sons to become playwrights due to its uncertainty and disappointment as a career. In order to cultivate DeMille's education and life skills, DeMille's mother sent him to [[Widener University|Pennsylvania Military College]] (now Widener University) in [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2007|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Highman|1973|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fled school to join the [[Spanish–American War]], but failed to meet the age requirement.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=1}} DeMille was a neat, intelligent, athletic, and determined adolescent.{{sfn|Highman|1973|p=9}} At the military college, even though his grades were average, he reportedly excelled in personal conduct.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=17}} DeMille (Class of 1900) attended and graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he attended for free due to his father's service to the Academy. His graduation performance was the play ''The Arcady Trail''. In the audience was [[Charles Frohman]] who would cast DeMille in his play ''Hearts are Trumps'', DeMille's Broadway debut.

===1900–1912: Theater===
====Charles Frohman, Constance Adams, and David Belasco====
Cecil B. DeMille began his career as an actor on the stage in the theatrical company of [[Charles Frohman]] in 1900. He debuted as an actor on February 21, 1900, in the play ''Hearts Are Trumps'' at New York's [[Garden Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2007|p=20}}; {{harvnb|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, DeMille starred in productions of ''A Repentance'', ''To Have and to Hold'', and ''Are You a Mason?''{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=20}} At the age of twenty-one, Cecil B. DeMille married [[Constance Adams DeMille|Constance Adams]] on August 16, 1902 at Adams's father's home in East Orange, New Jersey. The wedding party was small and Beatrice deMille's family was not in attendance. It was suggested by [[Simon Louvish]] that this was to conceal DeMille's Jewish heritage. Adams was 29 years old at the time of their marriage, eight years older than DeMille.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=20–21}} They had met in a theater in Washington D.C. while they were both acting in ''Hearts Are Trumps''.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=21}}

Their age difference led to their sexual incompatibility; according to DeMille, Adams was too &quot;pure&quot; to &quot;feel such violent and evil passions&quot;.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=30–31}} DeMille had more violent sexual preferences and fetishes than his wife and Adams allowed DeMille to have several long term mistresses during their marriage as an outlet for his particular sexual kinks, while maintaining an outward appearance of a faithful marriage.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=90}} Adams did not want to have sexual relations with DeMille, but did not mind his affairs because she felt that sex and love were unrelated; she knew that she was the sole Mrs. DeMille.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=96}} One of DeMille's affairs was with his screenwriter Jeanie MacPherson.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=80}} Despite his reputation for extramarital affairs, DeMille did not like to have affairs with his stars, as he believed it would cause him to lose control as a director. He related a story that he maintained his self-control when [[Gloria Swanson]] sat on his lap, refusing to touch her.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=167–168}}

In 1902, he played a small part in ''Hamlet''.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=20}} Publicists wrote that he became an actor in order to learn how direct and produce, but DeMille admitted that he became an actor in order to pay the bills.{{Sfn|Louvish|2007|p=20}} From 1904 to 1905, DeMille attempted to make a living as a stock theatre actor with his wife Constance. DeMille made a 1905 reprise in ''Hamlet'' as Osric.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=24}} His brother William was establishing himself as a playwright and sometimes invited him to collaborate.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=18}} DeMille and William collaborated on ''The Genius'', ''The Royal Mounted'', and ''After Five''.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=2}} However, none of these were very successful; William deMille was most successful when he worked alone.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=2}} DeMille and his brother at times worked with the legendary impresario [[David Belasco]], who had been a friend and collaborator of their father.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=20}} DeMille would later adapt Belasco's ''[[The Girl of the Golden West (play)|The Girl of the Golden West]]'' and ''Rose of the Rancho'', and ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (play)|The Warrens of Virginia]]'' into films.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=32–33}} DeMille was credited with creating the premise of Belasco's ''The Return of Peter Grimm''.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=2}} ''The Return of Peter Grimm'' sparked controversy; however, because Belasco had taken DeMille's unnamed screenplay, changed the characters and named it ''The Return of Peter Grimm'', producing and presenting it as his own work. DeMille was credited in small print as &quot;based on an idea by Cecil DeMille&quot;. The play was successful and DeMille was distraught that his childhood idol had plagiarized his work.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=37}}

====Losing interest in theatre====
DeMille performed on stage with actors whom he would later direct in films: [[Charlotte Walker (actress)|Charlotte Walker]], [[Mary Pickford]], and [[Pedro de Cordoba (actor)|Pedro de Cordoba]]. DeMille also produced and directed plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=4709 &quot;Cecil B. DeMille plays&quot;]. ''Internet Broadway Database''. Retrieved: December 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His 1905 performance in ''The Prince Chap'' as the Earl of Huntington was well received by audiences.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=24}} DeMille wrote a few of his own plays in-between stage performances, but his playwriting was not as successful.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=2}} His first play was ''The Pretender-A Play in a Prologue and 4 Acts'' set in the seventeenth century Russia.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=24}} Another unperformed play he wrote was ''Son of the Winds'', a mythological Native American story.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=26}} Life was difficult for DeMille and his wife as traveling actors; however, traveling allowed him to experience part of the United States he had not yet seen.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=27}} DeMille sometimes worked with the director [[E.H. Sothern]], who influenced DeMille's later perfectionism in his work.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=27}} In 1907, due to a scandal with one of Beatrice's students, [[Evelyn Nesbit]], the Henry deMille School lost students. The school closed and Beatrice filed for bankruptcy.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=29}} DeMille wrote another play originally called ''Sergeant Devil May Care'' which was renamed ''The Royal Mounted''. He also toured with the Standard Opera Company, but there are few records to indicate DeMille's singing ability.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=31}} DeMille had a daughter, Cecilia, on November 5, 1908, who would be his only biological child.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=31}} In the 1910s, DeMille began directing and producing other writer's plays.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=38}}

DeMille was poor and struggled to find work. Consequently, his mother hired him for her agency The DeMille Play Company and taught him how to be an agent and a playwright. Eventually, he became manager of the agency and later, a junior partner with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Presley|Vieira|2014|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, DeMille became acquainted with vaudeville producer Jesse Lasky when Lasky was searching for a writer for his new musical. He initially sought out William deMille. William had been a successful playwright, but DeMille was suffering from the failure of his plays ''The Royal Mounted'' and ''The Genius''. However, Beatrice introduced Lasky to DeMille instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2007|p=45}};{{harvnb|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration of DeMille and Lasky produced a successful musical called ''California'' which opened in New York in January 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2007|pp=46–47}}; {{harvnb|Dick|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another DeMille-Lasky production that opened on January 1912 was ''The Antique Girl''.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=47}} DeMille found success in the spring of 1913 producing ''Reckless Age'' by Lee Wilson, a play about a high society girl wrongly accused of manslaughter starring [[Frederick Burton (actor)|Frederick Burton]] and [[Sydney Shields]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2010/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror%201913%20Mar-Apr%201914%20Grayscale/New%20York%20NY%20Dramatic%20Mirror%201913%20Mar-Apr%201914%20Grayscale%20-%200391.pdf &quot;News of Other Cities, Atlantic City&quot;].

Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky. p. 2. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2324-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, changes in the theater rendered DeMille's [[melodrama]]s obsolete before they were produced, and true theatrical success eluded him. He produced many flops.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=22}} Having become disinterested in working in theatre, DeMille's passion for film was ignited when he watched the 1912 French film ''[[Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth]]''.{{sfn|Dick|2001|p=7}}

===1913–1914: Entering films===
[[File:The Squaw Man (1914).webm|thumb|''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914) full film]]
Desiring a change of scene, Cecil B. DeMille, Jesse Lasky, Sam Goldfish (later [[Samuel Goldwyn]]), and a group of East Coast businessmen created the [[Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company]] in 1913 over which DeMille became director-general.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abel|2005|p=229}}; {{harvnb|Dick|2001|p=7}}; {{harvnb|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasky and DeMille were said to have sketched out the organization of the company on the back of a restaurant menu.{{sfn|Edmonds|Mimura|1980|p=38}} As director-general, DeMille's job was to make the films.{{sfn|Edmonds|Mimura|1980|p=38}} In addition to directing, DeMille was the supervisor and consultant for the first year of films made by the Lasky Feature Play Company.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=9}} Sometimes, he directed scenes for other directors at the Feature Play Company in order to release films on time.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=9}} Moreover, when he was busy directing other films, he would co-author other Lasky Company scripts as well as create screen adaptations that others directed.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=9}}

The Lasky Play Company sought out William DeMille to join the company, but he rejected the offer because he did not believe there was any promise in a film career.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=3}} When William found out that DeMille had begun working in the motion picture industry, he wrote DeMille a letter, disappointed that he was willing &quot;to throw away [his] future&quot; when he was &quot;born and raised in the finest traditions of the theater&quot;.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=66}} The Lasky Company wanted to attract high-class audiences to their films so they began producing films from literary works.{{sfn|Higashi|1994|p=1}} The Lasky Company bought the rights to the play ''[[The Squaw Man (play)|The Squaw Man]]'' by [[Edwin Milton Royle]] and cast [[Dustin Farnum]] in the lead role.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=3}} They offered Farnum a choice to have a quarter stock in the company (similar to William deMille) or $250 per week as salary. Farnum chose $250 per week.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=58}} Already $15,000 in debt to Royle for the screenplay of ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'', Lasky's relatives bought the $5,000 stock to save the Lasky Company from bankruptcy.{{sfn|Eames|1985|pp=9–10}} With no knowledge of filmmaking, DeMille was introduced to observe the process at film studios. He was eventually introduced to [[Oscar Apfel]], a stage director turned movie director.{{sfn|Edmonds|Mimura|1980|p=40}}

On December 12, 1913, DeMille, his cast, and crew boarded a Southern Pacific train bound for [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] via [[New Orleans]]. His tentative plan was to shoot a film in [[Arizona]], but he felt that Arizona did not typify the Western look they were searching for. They also learned that other filmmakers were successfully shooting in Los Angeles, even in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=3}};{{harvnb|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to Los Angeles. Once there, he chose not to shoot in [[Edendale, Los Angeles|Edendale]], where many studios were, but in Hollywood.{{sfn|Dick|2001|p=8}} DeMille rented a barn to function as their film studio.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=4}} Filming began on December 29, 1913, and lasted three weeks.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=59}} Apfel filmed most of ''The Squaw Man'' due to DeMille's inexperience; however, DeMille learned quickly and was particularly adept at impromptu screenwriting as necessary.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=10}} He made his first film run sixty minutes, as long as a short play. ''The Squaw Man'' (1914), co-directed by Oscar Apfel, was a sensation and it established the Lasky Company. This was the first feature-length film made in Hollywood.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=8}} There were problems; however, with the perforation of the film stock and it was discovered the DeMille had brought a cheap British film projector. DeMille would later need to be sure to punch in sixty-five holes per foot instead of the industry-standard sixty-four.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=65}} This was also the first American feature film; however, only by release date, as [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[Judith of Bethulia]]'' was filmed earlier than ''The Squaw Man'', but released later.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=60}} Additionally, this was the only film in which DeMille shared director's credit with Oscar C. Apfel.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=9}}

''The Squaw Man'' was a success, which led to the eventual founding of Paramount Pictures and Hollywood becoming the &quot;film capital of the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeMille At 75 Still Creating&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowe|first=Walter|title=DeMille at 75 Still Creating|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&amp;dat=19561022&amp;id=0KY0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-WYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1290,1458005|accessdate=April 29, 2014|newspaper=[[Kentucky New Era]]|date=October 22, 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed over ten times its budget after its New York premiere in February 1914.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=10}} DeMille's next project was to aid Oscar Apfel and directing ''[[Brewster's Millions (1914 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'', which was wildly successful.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=69–70}} In December 1914, Constance Adams brought home John DeMille, a fifteen-month-old, whom the couple legally adopted three years later. Biographer Scott Eyman suggested that this may have been a result of Adams's recent miscarriage.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=99}}{{refn|group=note|Unlike the other children the DeMille's adopted, John was never told about his birth parents.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=99}}}}

===1915–1928: Silent era===
====Westerns, Paradise, and World War I====
[[File:FamousPlayers-Lasky-partners, 1916.jpg|thumb|Famous Players-Lasky Corporation, DeMille is seated, second from the right|alt=Five well-dressed men seated or standing at various levels]]
Cecil B. DeMille's second film credited exclusively to him was ''[[The Virginian (1914 film)|The Virginian]]''. This is earliest of DeMille's films available in a quality, color-tinted video format. However, this version is actually a 1918 re-release.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=71}} The first few years of the Lasky Company were spent in making films nonstop, literally writing the language of film. DeMille himself directed twenty films by 1915.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=75}} The most successful films during the beginning of the Lasky Company were ''Brewster's Millions'' (co-directed by DeMille), ''[[Rose of the Rancho]]'', and ''[[The Ghost Breaker (1914 film)|The Ghost Breaker]]''.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=10}} DeMille adapted Belasco's dramatic lighting techniques to film technology, mimicking moonlight with U.S. cinema's first attempts at &quot;motivated lighting&quot; in ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (1915 film)|The Warrens of Virginia]]''.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=47}} This was the first of few film collaborations with his brother William. They struggled to adapt the play from the stage to the set. After the film was shown, viewers complained that the shadows and lighting prevented the audience from seeing the actors' full faces, complaining that they would only pay half price. However, Sam Goldwyn realized that if they called it &quot;Rembrandt&quot; lighting, the audience would pay double the price.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=84}} Additionally, because of DeMille's cordiality after the ''Peter Grimm'' incident, DeMille was able to rekindle his partnership with Belasco. He adapted several of Belasco's screenplays into film.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=76–77}}

DeMille's most successful film was ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]''; DeMille's direction in the film was acclaimed.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=11}} In 1916, exhausted from three years of nonstop filmmaking, DeMille purchased land in the [[Angeles National Forest]] for a ranch which would become his getaway. He called this place, &quot;Paradise&quot;, declaring it a wildlife sanctuary; no shooting of animals was allowed besides snakes. His wife did not like Paradise, so DeMille often brought his mistresses there with him including actress [[Julia Faye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyman|2010|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paradise&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rasmussen |first1=Cecilia |title=Echoes of Epics in DeMille's Paradise |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-21-me-34726-story.html |accessdate=July 17, 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=September 21, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his Paradise, DeMille purchased a yacht in 1921 which he called ''The Seaward''.{{refn|group=note|DeMille liked to sail and dive; he had several boats throughout his lifetime. He donated ''The Seaward'', his most cherished boat, to the merchant marine for service during World War II. The boat was returned to him destroyed. DeMille gave up the boat and never bought another one.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=370}}}}

While filming ''[[The Captive (1915 film)|The Captive]]'' in 1915, an extra, Bob Fleming, died on set when another extra failed to heed to DeMille's orders to unload all guns for rehearsal. DeMille instructed the guilty man to leave town and would never reveal his name. Lasky and DeMille maintained the widow Fleming on the payroll; however, according to leading actor [[House Peters Sr.]] DeMille refused to stop production for the funeral of Fleming. Peters claimed that he encouraged the cast to attend the funeral with him anyway since DeMille would not be able to shoot the film without him.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=95}} On July 19, 1916, the Jesse Lasky Feature Play Company merged with Adolph Zukor's [[Famous Players Film Company]], becoming [[Famous Players-Lasky]]. Zukor became president with Lasky as the vice president.{{sfn|Dick|2001|p=11}} DeMille was maintained as director-general and Goldwyn became chairman of the board.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=11}} Goldwyn was later fired from Famous Players-Lasky due to frequent clashes with Lasky, DeMille, and finally Zukor.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=11}} While on a European vacation in 1921, DeMille contracted rheumatic fever in Paris. He was confined to bed and unable to eat. His poor physical condition upon his return home affected the production of his 1922 film ''[[Manslaughter (1922 film)|Manslaughter]]''. According to Richard Birchard, DeMille's weakened state during production may have led to the film being received as uncharacteristically substandard.{{sfn|Birchard|2004|pp=172–173}}

During World War I, the Famous Players-Lasky organized a military company underneath the National Guard called the ''Home Guard'' made up of film studio employees with DeMille as captain. Eventually, the Guard was promoted to a battalion and recruited soldiers from other film studios. They took time off weekly from film production to practice military drills. Additionally, during the war, DeMille volunteered for the Justice Department's Intelligence Office, investigating friends, neighbors, and others he came in contact with in connection with the Famous Players-Lasky. He volunteered for the Intelligence Office during World War II as well.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=140–141}} Although DeMille considered enlisting in World War I, he stayed in the United States and made films. However, he did take a few months to set up a movie theater for the French front. Famous Players-Lasky donated the films.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=141}} DeMille and Adams adopted [[Katherine DeMille|Katherine Lester]] in 1920 whom Adams had found in the orphanage over which she was the director.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=162}} {{refn|group=note|Katherine's father had been killed in [[World War I]] and her mother had died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2007|p=185}}; {{harvnb|Eyman|2010|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; To DeMille's dismay, Katherine became an actress; however, she ultimately gained his approval. In 1936 she married actor Anthony Quinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bergan |first1=Ronald |title=Anthony Quinn: Colourful Hollywood star who built a career playing ethnic heroes and villains |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/05/guardianobituaries.filmnews |accessdate=May 24, 2019 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media |date=June 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1922, the couple adopted Richard deMille.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=90}}{{refn|group=note|After the death of William deMille, DeMille revealed to Richard DeMille that William was his father and he had been born to William and a mistress.

====Scandalous dramas, Biblical epics, and departure from Paramount====
Film started becoming more sophisticated and the subsequent films of the Lasky company were criticized for primitive and unrealistic set design.{{sfn|Birchard|2004|p=21}} Consequently, Beatrice deMille introduced the Famous Players-Lasky to [[Wilfred Buckland]], who DeMille had known from his time at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and he became DeMille's art director. William deMille reluctantly became a story editor. William deMille would later convert from theater to Hollywood and would spend the rest of his career as a film director.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=11}} Throughout his career, DeMille would frequently remake his own films. In his first instance, in 1917, he remade ''[[The Squaw Man (1918 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1918), only waiting four years from the 1914 original. Despite its quick turnaround, the film was fairly successful. However, DeMille's second remake at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] in 1931 would be a failure.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=17}}

After five years and thirty hit films, DeMille became the American film industry's most successful director. In the silent era, he was renowned for ''[[Male and Female]]'' (1919), ''Manslaughter'' (1922), ''[[The Volga Boatman (1926 film)|The Volga Boatman]]'' (1926), and ''[[The Godless Girl]]'' (1928). DeMille's trademark scenes included bathtubs, lion attacks, and Roman orgies.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=19}} A number of his films featured scenes in two-color [[Technicolor]]. In 1923, DeMille released a modern melodrama ''The Ten Commandments'' which was a significant change from his previous stint of irreligious films. The film was produced on a large budget of $600,000, the most expensive production at Paramount. This concerned the executives at Paramount; however, the film turned out to be the studio's highest-grossing film.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=28}} It held the Paramount record for twenty-five years until DeMille broke the record again himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;He Himself Was 'Colossal'&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=He Himself Was &quot;Colossal&quot;|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19590122&amp;id=6IoxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aKgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1891,3704755|accessdate=April 29, 2014|newspaper=[[The Montreal Gazette]]|date=January 22, 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Cecil B. DeMille 1919.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Advertisement (1919)|alt=Sepia toned advertisement for &quot;For Better, For Worse&quot; with a headshot of DeMille at the top]]In the early 1920s, scandal surrounded Paramount. Several Paramount contractees were accused of rape, murder, and drug addiction. Outcry intensified from religious groups and the media were appalled by immorality in the film industry on and off screen. A censorship board called the [[Hays Code]] was established. DeMille's depiction of on screen immorality came under fire, likely due to the scandalous film ''[[The Affairs of Anatol]]''. Furthermore, DeMille argued with Zukor over his extravagant and over-budget production costs.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=13, 23}} Consequently, DeMille left Paramount in 1924 despite having helped establish it. Instead, he joined the [[Producers Distributing Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=10}}; {{harvnb|Dick|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His first film from his new production company, DeMille Pictures Corporation, was ''[[The Road to Yesterday]]'' in 1925. He directed and produced four films on his own, working with Producers Distributing Corporation because he found front office supervision too restricting.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|pp=5–6}} Aside from ''The King of Kings'' (which was said to be DeMille's favorite film), none of DeMille's films away from Paramount were successful.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|pp=8–12}} ''The Kings of Kings'' established DeMille as &quot;master of the grandiose and of biblical sagas&quot;.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=xiv}} The most successful Christian film of the silent era. DeMille calculated that the film had been viewed over 800 million times around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bakker |first1=Freek L. |title=The Challenge of the Silver Screen: An Analysis of the Cinematic Portraits of Jesus, Rama, Buddha and Muhammad |date=2009 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=9789004168619 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YuF5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=the+king+of+kings+800+million+viewers#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20king%20of%20kings%20800%20million%20viewers&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of DeMille's ''The Godless Girl'', silent films in America became obsolete and DeMille was forced to shoot a shoddy final reel with the new sound production technique. Although this final reel looked so different from the previous eleven reels that it appeared to be from another movie, according to Simon Louvish, the film is one of DeMille's strangest and most &quot;DeMillean&quot; film.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=278}}

The immense popularity of DeMille's silent films enabled him to branch out into other areas. The [[Roaring Twenties]] were the boom years and DeMille took full advantage, opening the Mercury Aviation Company, one of America's first commercial airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Masters |first1=Nathan |title=How a Hollywood Director Almost Launched L.A.'s First Commercial Airline |url=https://www.kcet.org/shows/lost-la/how-a-hollywood-director-almost-launched-las-first-commercial-airline |accessdate=May 30, 2019 |work=KCET |publisher=Public Media Group of Southern California |date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a real estate speculator,&lt;ref name=&quot;register&quot; /&gt; an underwriter of political campaigns, and vice president of [[Bank of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Financing Hollywood through the Great Depression |url=https://about.bankofamerica.com/en-us/our-story/financing-hollywood-through-great-depression.html#fbid=dmJMGNL_I39 |website=Bank of America |publisher=Bank of America Corporation |accessdate=May 30, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was additionally vice president of the Commercial National Trust and Savings Bank in Los Angeles where he approved loans for other filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mahar |first1=Karen Ward |title=Women Filmmakers in Early Hollywood |date=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0801884365 |page=[https://archive.org/details/womenfilmmakersi0000maha/page/199 199] |url=https://archive.org/details/womenfilmmakersi0000maha |url-access=registration |quote=cecil b demille approved loans for other filmmakers. |accessdate=June 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, DeMille purchased a mansion in Hollywood.

===1929–1956: Sound era===
====MGM and return to Paramount====
When &quot;talking pictures&quot; were invented in 1928, Cecil B. DeMille made a successful transition, offering his own innovations to the painful process; he devised a microphone boom and a soundproof [[Sound blimp|camera blimp]].{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|pp=152–155}} He also popularized the camera crane.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=166}} His first three sound films were produced at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=7}} These three films, ''[[Dynamite (1929 film)|Dynamite]]'', ''[[Madame Satan]]'', and his 1931 remake of ''[[The Squaw Man (1931 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' were both critically and financially unsuccessful. He had completely adapted to the production of sound film besides despite the film's poor dialogue.{{sfn|Blanke|2018|p=129}} After his contract ended at MGM, he left, but no production studios would hire him. He attempted to create a guild of a half a dozen directors with the same creative desires called the Director's Guild. However, the idea failed due to lack of funding and commitment. Moreover, DeMille was audited by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] due to issues with his production company. This was, according to DeMille, the lowest point of his career. DeMille traveled abroad to find employment until he was offered a deal at Paramount.{{sfn|Blanke|2018|pp=129–130}}

In 1932, DeMille returned to Paramount at the request of Lasky, bringing with him his own production unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dick|2001|pp=15, 21}}; {{harvnb|Eames|1985|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first film back at Paramount, ''The Sign of the Cross'', was also his first success since leaving Paramount besides ''The King of Kings''. DeMille's return was approved by Zukor under the condition that DeMille not exceed his production budget of $650,000 for ''The Sign of the Cross''. Produced in eight weeks without exceeding budget, the film was financially successful.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=88}} ''The Sign of the Cross'' was the first film to integrate all cinematic techniques. The film was considered a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and surpassed the quality of other sound films of the time.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=198}} DeMille followed this epic uncharacteristically with two dramas released in 1933 and 1934. ''[[This Day and Age (film)|This Day and Age]]'' and ''[[Four Frightened People]]'' were box office disappointments, though ''Four Frightened People'' received good reviews. DeMille would stick to his large-budget spectaculars for the rest of his career.{{sfn|Eames|1985|pp=98–100}}

====Politics and Lux Radio Theatre====
[[File:Cecil B DeMille 1937.JPG|thumb|right|DeMille as producer of the Lux Radio Theatre, broadcast on CBS, 1937|alt=Full body photograph of DeMille wearing a blakc suit, holding a top hat in one hand and the CBS radio microphone in the other]]
Cecil B. DeMille was a conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] activist. He became more conservative as he aged, until he became a &quot;pillar of California's political right-wing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eyman|2010|pp=7, 167}}; {{harvnb|Birchard|2004|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he lived two different lives. On the one hand, DeMille lived a life of strong Christian ethics, as exemplified through his wife and children. On the other hand, DeMille's private life, which included mistresses and adultery, conflicted with the Episcopalian integrity he portrayed.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=7}} Additionally, he frequently contradicted his staunchly conservative viewpoints. His film ''The Volga Boatman'' gave a sympathetic portrayal of the Russian Revolution and he was fascinated by a trip to the Soviet Union in the 1930s.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=7}} More in line with his conservative views, he was known as anti-union and worked to prevent unionizing of film production studios.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=270–272}} However, according to DeMille himself, he was not anti-union and belonged to a few unions himself. He claimed he was rather against union leaders such as [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Harry Bridges]] whom he compared to dictators.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=376}} He supported [[Herbert Hoover]] and in 1928 made his largest campaign donation to Hoover.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=288}} However, in a contradiction, DeMille liked Franklin D. Roosevelt, finding him charismatic, tenacious, and intelligent. He agreed with Roosevelt's abhorrence of Prohibition. DeMille lent Roosevelt a car for his campaign for the [[1932 United States presidential election]] and voted for him. However, he would never again vote for a Democratic candidate in a presidential election.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=288}}

From June 1, 1936, until January 22, 1945, Cecil B. DeMille hosted and directed ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', a weekly digest of current feature films.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=367}} Broadcast on the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS) from 1935 to 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cutchins |editor1-first=Dennis |editor2-last=Krebs |editor2-first=Katja |editor3-last=Voigts |editor3-first=Eckart |title=The Routledge Companion to Adaptation |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=9781315690254 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oR9WDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT463&amp;lpg=PT463&amp;dq=lux+radio+theater+columbia+broadcast+company#v=onepage&amp;q=lux%20radio%20theater%20columbia%20broadcast%20company&amp;f=false |accessdate=July 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Lux Radio show was one of the most popular weekly shows in the history of radio.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=367}} While DeMille was host, the show had forty million weekly listeners, gaining DeMille an annual salary of $100,000.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=367}} From 1936 to 1945, he produced, hosted, and directed all shows with the occasional exception of a guest director.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=367}} He resigned from the Lux Radio Show because he refused to pay a dollar to the American Federation of Radio Artists (AFRA) because he did not believe that any organization had the right to &quot;levy a compulsory assessment upon any member.&quot;{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=368}} Consequently, he had to resign from the radio show.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=368}}

DeMille sued the union for reinstatement but lost. He then appealed to the California Supreme Court and lost again. When the AFRA expanded to television, DeMille was banned from television appearances. Consequently, he formed the DeMille Foundation for Political Freedom in order to campaign for the right to work.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=375}} He began presenting speeches across the United States for the next few years. DeMille's primary criticism was of [[closed shop]]s, but later included criticism of communism and unions in general. The United States Supreme Court declined to review his case. Despite his loss, DeMille continued to lobby for the [[Taft-Hartley Act]], which passed. This prohibited denying anyone the right to work if they refuse to pay a political assessment, however, the law did not apply retroactively. Consequently, DeMille's television and radio appearance ban lasted for the remainder of his life, though he was permitted to appear on radio or television to publicize a movie.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=375–377}} [[William Keighley]] was his replacement.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=368}}  DeMille would never again work on radio.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=368}} {{refn|group=note|Frequent actors and actresses on the show included Barbara Stanwyck, Claudette Colbert, Loretta Young, Don Ameche, and Fred MacMurray.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=369}}}}

====Adventure films and dramatic spectacles====
In 1939, DeMille's ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' was successful through DeMille's collaboration with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. The Union Pacific gave DeMille access to historical data, early period trains, and expert crews, adding to the authenticity of the film.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=140}} During pre-production of ''Union Pacific'', DeMille was dealing with his first serious health issue. In March 1938, DeMille underwent a major emergency [[prostatectomy]]. He suffered from a post-surgery infection from which he nearly did not recover, citing [[streptomycin]] as his saving grace. The surgery caused him to suffer from sexual dysfunction for the rest of his life, according to some family members.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=332–333}} Following his surgery and the success of ''Union Pacific'', in 1940, DeMille first used three-strip Technicolor in ''[[North West Mounted Police (film)|North West Mounted Police]]''. DeMille wanted to film in [[Canada]]; however, due to budget constraints, the film was instead shot in [[Oregon]] and Hollywood.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=149}} Critics were impressed with the visuals but found the scripts dull, calling it DeMille's &quot;poorest Western&quot;.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=149}} Despite the criticism, it was Paramount's highest-grossing film of the year.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=149}} Audiences liked its highly saturated color, so DeMille made no further black-and-white features.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=359–360}} DeMille was anti-communist and abandoned a project in 1940 to film Ernest Hemingway's ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' due to its communist themes despite the fact he had already paid $100,000 for the rights to the novel. He was so eager to produce the film, that he hadn't yet read the novel. He claimed he abandoned the project in order to complete a different project, but in reality, it was to preserve his reputation and avoid appearing reactionary.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=337–338}}{{refn|group=note|The project was later completed by DeMille's former assistant director [[Sam Wood]] who was notoriously anti-communist.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=337–338}}}} While concurrently filmmaking, he served in World War II at the age of sixty as his neighborhood air-raid warden.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=372}}

In 1942, DeMille worked with [[Jeanie MacPherson]] and brother William deMille in order to produce a film called ''Queen of Queens'' which was intended to be about [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]. After reading the screenplay, [[Daniel A. Lord]] warned DeMille that Catholics would find the film too irreverent, while non-Catholics would have considered the film Catholic propaganda. Consequently, the film was never made.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=271}} Jeanie MacPherson would work as a scriptwriter for many of DeMille's films.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=96–97}} {{refn|group=note|DeMille claimed that MacPherson was not a good writer, but she received credit in his films because she gave him many ideas for the screenplays.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=96–97}}}} In 1938, DeMille supervised the compilation of film ''[[Land of Liberty]]'' to represent the contribution of the American film industry to the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. DeMille used clips from his own films in ''Land of Liberty''. Though the film wasn't high-grossing, it was well-received and DeMille was asked to shorten its running time to allow for more showings per day. MGM distributed the film in 1941 and donated profits to World War II relief charities.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=336-337}}
[[File:Cecil B de Mille in The Greatest Show on Earth trailer.jpg|thumb|left|DeMille in the trailer for ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952), the film for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]|alt=Closeup of DeMille leaning on a setpiece]]
In 1942, DeMille released Paramount's most successful film, ''[[Reap the Wild Wind]]''. It was produced with a large budget and contained many special effects including an electronically operated [[giant squid]].{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=158}} After working on ''Reap the Wild Wind'', in [[U.S. presidential election, 1944|1944]], he was the [[master of ceremonies]] at the massive rally organized by [[David O.

The sets and effects were so realistic that 30 extras needed to be hospitalized due to a scene with fireballs and flaming arrows. It was very commercially successful.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=183}}

DeMille's next film, ''Samson and Delilah'' in 1949, became Paramount's highest-grossing film up to that time. A Biblical epic with sex, it was a characteristically DeMille film.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=191}} Again, 1952's ''The Greatest Show on Earth'' became Paramount's highest-grossing film to that point. Furthermore, DeMille's film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and the [[Academy Award for Best Story]]. The film began production in 1949, Ringling Brothers-Barnum and Bailey were paid $250,000 for use of the title and facilities. DeMille toured with the circus while helping write the script. Noisy and bright, it wasn't well-liked among critics, but was a favorite among audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eames|1985|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 25th Academy Awards |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1953 |website=Oscars.org |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMille signed a contract with Prentice Hall publishers in August 1953 to publish an autobiography.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=436–437}} DeMille would reminisce into a voice recorder, the recording would be transcribed, and the information would be organized in the biography based on the topic.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=481}} Art Arthur also interviewed people for the autobiography. DeMille did not like the first draft of the biography, citing that he thought the person portrayed in the biography was an &quot;SOB&quot;; he claimed it made him sound too egotistical.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=482}} Besides filmmaking and finishing his autobiography, DeMille was involved in other projects. In the early 1950s, DeMille was recruited by [[Allen Dulles]] and [[Frank Wisner]] to serve on the board of the [[anti-communist]] [[National Committee for a Free Europe]], the public face of the organization that oversaw the [[Radio Free Europe]] service.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Tim (2007). ''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA''. New York: Doubleday. p. 36. {{ISBN|978-0-3855-1445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Secretary of the Air Force [[Harold E. Talbott]] asked DeMille for help in designing the cadet uniforms at the newly established [[United States Air Force Academy]]. DeMille's designs, most notably his design of the distinctive cadet parade uniform, won praise from Air Force and Academy leadership, were ultimately adopted, and are still worn by cadets.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Bill. &quot;A Digger, A Director and A Practical Joker&quot;.

==Filmmaking==
===Influences===
DeMille believed his first influences to be his parents, Henry and Beatrice deMille.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=398}} His playwright father introduced him to the theater at a young age.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=8-9}} Henry was heavily influenced by the work of [[Charles Kingsley]] whose ideas trickled down to DeMille.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=15–16}} DeMille noted that his mother had a &quot;high sense of the dramatic&quot; and was determined to continue the artistic legacy of her husband after he died. Beatrice became a play broker and author's agent, influencing DeMille's early life and career.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=13}} DeMille's father worked with David Belasco theatrical producer, impresario, and playwright. Belasco was known for adding realistic elements in his plays such as real flowers, food, and aromas that could transport his audiences into the scenes.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=18–22}} While working in theatre, DeMille used real fruit trees in his play ''California'' as influenced by Belasco.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=51}} Similar to Belasco, DeMille's theatre was revolved around entertainment, rather than artistry.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=53}} Generally, Belasco's influence of DeMille's career can be seen in DeMille's showmanship and narration.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=5}} E.H. Sothern's early influence on DeMille's work can be seen in DeMille's perfectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Louvish|2007|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;genius&quot; /&gt; DeMille recalled that one of the most influential plays he saw was ''Hamlet'', directed by Sothern.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=48}}

===Method===
DeMille's filmmaking process always began with extensive research. Next, he would work with writers to develop the story that he was envisioning. Then, he would help writers construct a script. Finally, he would leave the script with artists and allow them to create artistic depictions and renderings of each scene.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=11}} Plot and dialogue was not a strong point of DeMille's films. Consequently, he focused his efforts on his films' visuals. He worked with visual technicians, editors, art directors, costume designers, cinematographers, and set carpenters in order to perfect the visual aspects of his films. With his editor, [[Anne Bauchens]], DeMille used editing techniques to allow the visual images to bring the plot to climax rather than dialogue.{{sfn|Blanke|2018|p=272}} DeMille had large and frequent office conferences to discuss and examine all aspects of the working film including story-boards, props, and special effects.{{sfn|Blanke|2018|pp=272–273}}

DeMille rarely gave direction to actors; he preferred to &quot;office-direct&quot; where he would work with actors in his office, going over characters and reading through scripts. Any problems on the set were often fixed by writers in the office rather than on the set. DeMille did not believe a large movie set was the place to discuss minor character or line issues.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=297–298}} DeMille was particularly adept at directing and managing large crowds in his films. [[Martin Scorsese]] recalled that DeMille had the skill to maintain control of not only the lead actors in a frame but the many extras in the frame as well.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=324–325}}  DeMille was adept at directing &quot;thousands of extras&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;register&quot; /&gt; and many of his pictures include spectacular set pieces: the toppling of the [[Paganism|pagan]] temple in ''Samson and Delilah'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/lethbridge-herald-apr-07-1951-p-3/|title=Cecil B.

DeMille experimented in his early films with photographic light and shade which created dramatic shadows instead of glare.{{sfn|Eames|1985|p=11}} His specific use of lighting, influenced by his mentor David Belasco, was for the purpose of creating &quot;striking images&quot; and heightening &quot;dramatic situations&quot;.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=94}} DeMille was unique in using this technique. In addition to his use of volatile and abrupt film editing, his lighting and composition were innovative for the time period as filmmakers were primarily concerned with a clear, realistic image.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=94}} Another important aspect of DeMille's editing technique was to put the film away for a week or two after an initial edit in order to re-edit the picture with a fresh mind. This allowed for the rapid production of his films in the early years of the Lasky Company. The cuts were sometimes rough, but the movies were always interesting.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=100}}

DeMille often edited in a manner that favored psychological space rather than physical space through his cuts. In this way, the characters thoughts and desires are the visual focus rather than the circumstances regarding the physical scene.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=112}} As DeMille's career progressed, he increasingly relied on artist Dan Sayre Groesbeck's concept, costume, and storyboard art. Groesbeck's art was circulated on set to give actors and crew members a better understanding of DeMille's vision. His art was even shown at Paramount meetings when pitching new films. DeMille adored the art of Groesbeck, even hanging it above his fireplace, but film staff found it difficult to convert his art into three-dimensional sets. As DeMille continued to rely on Groesbeck, the nervous energy of his early films transformed into more steady compositions of his later films. While visually appealing, this made the films appear more old-fashioned.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=298}}

Composer [[Elmer Bernstein]] described DeMille as, &quot;sparing no effort&quot;, when filmmaking.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=363}} Bernstein recalled that DeMille would scream, yell, or flatter, whatever it took to achieve the perfection he required in his films. DeMille was painstakingly attentive to details on set and was as critical of himself as he was of his crew.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=364}} Costume designer Dorothy Jenkins, who worked with DeMille on ''The Ten Commandments'' (1956), described that DeMille was skilled in humiliating people. Jenkins admitted that she received quality training from DeMille, but that it was necessary to become a perfectionist on a DeMille set to avoid being fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jorgensen |first1=Jay |last2=Scoggins |first2=Donald L. |title=Creating the Illusion: A Fashionable History of Hollywood Costume Designer |date=2015 |publisher=Running Press |location=Philidelphia |isbn=9780762458073 |page=300 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4G4uCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=cecil+b+demille%27s+perfectionism#v=onepage&amp;q=cecil%20b%20demille's%20perfectionism&amp;f=false |accessdate=July 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMille had an authoritarian persona on set; he required absolute attention from the cast and crew. He had a band of assistants who catered to his needs. He would speak to the entire set, sometimes enormous with countless numbers of crew members and extras, via a microphone to maintain control of the set. He was disliked by many inside and outside of the film industry due to his cold and controlling reputation.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=9–10}}{{refn|group=note|Further illustrated by his home life, DeMille required formality and politeness at home. Sons-and daughters-in-law were required to call him &quot;Mr. DeMille&quot;, and Richard deMille never recalled hugging his father, claiming he received handshakes instead.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=369}}}}

DeMille was known for autocratic behavior on the set, singling out and berating extras who were not paying attention. A number of these displays were thought to be staged, however, as an exercise in discipline.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=259}} He despised actors who were unwilling to take physical risks, especially when he had first demonstrated that the required stunt would not harm them.

===Style and themes===
Cecil B. DeMille's film production career evolved from critically significant silent films to financially significant sounds films. He began his career with reserved yet brilliant melodramas. From there, DeMille's style developed into marital comedies with outrageously melodramatic plots.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=5}} In order to attract a high-class audience, DeMille based many of his early films on stage melodramas, novels, and short stories.{{sfn|Higashi|1994|p=2}} He began the production of epics earlier in his career until they began to solidify his career in the 1920s. By 1930, DeMille had perfected his film style of mass-interest spectacle films with Western, Roman, or Biblical themes.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=5}} DeMille was often criticized for making his spectacles too colorful and for being too occupied with entertaining the audience rather than accessing the artistic and auteur possibilities that film could provide. However, others interpreted DeMille's work as visually impressive, thrilling, and nostalgic. Along the same lines, critics of DeMille often qualify him by his later spectacles and fail to consider several decades of ingenuity and energy that defined him during his generation.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=5}} Throughout his career, he did not alter his films to better adhere to contemporary or popular styles.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|pp=5–6}} Actor Charlton Heston admitted DeMille was, &quot;terribly unfashionable&quot; and [[Sidney Lumet]] called Demille, &quot;the cheap version of [[D.W. Griffith]],&quot; adding that DeMille, &quot;[didn't have]...an original thought in his head,&quot; though Heston added that DeMille was much more than that.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=6}}
[[File:Cecil-b-demille paramount-pictures.jpg|thumb|Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount Pictures|alt=DeMille posing on a chair with a pen in hand]]
According to Scott Eyman, DeMille's films were at the same time masculine and feminine due to his thematic adventurousness and his eye for the extravagant.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=6}} DeMille's distinctive style can be seen through camera and lighting effects as early as ''The Squaw Man'' with the use of daydream images; moonlight and sunset on a mountain; and side-lighting through a tent flap.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=64}} In the early age of cinema, DeMille differentiated the Lasky Company from other production companies due to the use of dramatic, low-key lighting they called &quot;Lasky lighting&quot; and marketed as &quot;[[Rembrandt lighting]]&quot; to appeal to the public. DeMille achieved international recognition for his unique use of lighting and color tint in his film ''The Cheat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Higashi|1994|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Eames|1985|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeMille's 1956 version of ''The Ten Commandments'', according to director Martin Scorsese, is renowned for its level of production and the care and detail that went into creating the film. He stated that ''The Ten Commandments'' was the final culmination of DeMille's style.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=478}}

DeMille was interested in art and his favorite artist was [[Gustave Doré]]; DeMille based some of his most well-known scenes on the work of Doré.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=11}} DeMille was the first director to connect art to filmmaking; he created the title of &quot;art director&quot; on the film set.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=16}} DeMille was also known for his use of special effects without the use of digital technology. Notably, DeMille had cinematographer [[John P. Fulton]] create the [[Crossing the Red Sea|parting of the Red Sea]] scene in his 1956 film ''The Ten Commandments'', which was one of the most expensive special effects in film history, and has been called by [[Steven Spielberg]] &quot;the greatest special effect in film history&quot;. The actual parting of the sea was created by releasing 360,000 gallons of water into a huge water tank split by a U-shaped trough, overlaying it with film of a giant waterfall that was built on the Paramount backlot, and playing the clip backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Townsend |first1=Allie |title=A Brief History of Movie Special Effects |url=http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,2055255_2247304,00.html |accessdate=July 2, 2019 |work=Time |publisher=Time, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;genius&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ten Commandments (Documentary: “Making Miracles”) (Six-Disc Limited Edition Blu-Ray/DVD Combo) Cecil B. DeMille / Paramount. Hollywood, California: Paramount Pictures.2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Aside from his Biblical and historical epics which are concerned with how man relates to God, some of DeMille's films contained themes of &quot;neo-naturalism&quot; which portray the conflict between the laws of man and the laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Watkins |first1=Daniel |title=&quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot;...or Don't: Cecil B. DeMille, the Evolving Neo-Naturalist |url=https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/reap-the-wild-windor-dont-cecil-b-demille-the-evolving-neo-naturalist |accessdate=June 20, 2019 |work=Notebook |publisher=MUBI |date=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is known for his later &quot;spectacular&quot; films, his early films are held in high regard by critics and film historians. DeMille discovered the possibilities of the &quot;bathroom&quot; or &quot;boudoir&quot; in film without being &quot;vulgar&quot; or &quot;cheap&quot;.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=5}} DeMille's films ''Male and Female'', ''[[Why Change Your Wife?]]'', and ''The Affairs of Anatol'' can be retrospectively described as [[camp (style)|high camp]] and are categorized as &quot;early DeMille films&quot; due to their particular style of production and costume and set design. However, his earlier films ''The Captive'', ''[[Kindling (film)|Kindling]]'', ''[[Carmen (1915 Cecil B. DeMille film)|Carmen]]'', and ''[[The Whispering Chorus]]'' are more serious films.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=5}} It is difficult to typify DeMille's films into one specific genre. His first three films were Westerns, and he filmed many Westerns throughout his career. However, throughout his career, he filmed comedies, periodic and contemporary romances, dramas, fantasies, propaganda, Biblical spectacles, musical comedies, suspense, and war films. At least one DeMille film can represent each film genre.{{sfn|Ringgold|Bodeen|1969|p=5}} DeMille produced the majority of his films before the 1930s, and by the time sound films were invented, film critics saw DeMille as antiquated, with his best filmmaking years behind him.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=xiv–xv}}

DeMille's film contained a number of similar themes throughout his career. However, the films of his silent era were often thematically different than the films of his sound era. His silent era films often included the &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; theme due to the era of women's suffrage and the enlarging role of women in society.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=69}} Moreover, before his religious-themed films, many of his silent era films revolved around &quot;husband-and-wife-divorce-and-remarry satires&quot;, considerably more adult-themed. According to Simon Louvish, these films reflected DeMille's inner thoughts and opinions about marriage and human sexuality.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=xv-xvi}} Religion was a theme that DeMille returned to throughout his career. Of his seventy films, five revolved around stories of the Bible and the New Testament; however many others, while not direct retellings of Biblical stories, had themes of faith and religious fanaticism in films such as ''The Crusades'' and ''The Road to Yesterday''.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=xiv}} Western and frontier American were also themes that DeMille returned to throughout his career. His first several films were westerns and he produced a chain of westerns during the sound era. Instead of portraying the danger and anarchy of the West, he portrayed the opportunity and redemption found in Western America.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=340}} Another common theme in DeMille's films is the reversal of fortune and the portrayal of the rich and the poor, including the war of the classes and man versus society conflicts such as in ''The Golden Chance'' and ''The Cheat''.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=81, 111, 178}} In relation to his own interests and sexual preferences, [[sadomasochism]] was a minor theme present in some of his films.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|pp=90, 255}} Another minor characteristic of DeMille's films include train crashes which can be found in several of his films.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=402}}

According to Sam Goldwyn, critics did not like DeMille's films, but the audiences did and &quot;they have the final word&quot;.{{sfn|Presley|Vieira|2014|p=14}} Similarly, scholar David Blanke, argued that DeMille had lost the respect of his colleagues and film critics by his late film career.

Despite his box-office success, awards, and artistic achievements, DeMille has been dismissed and ignored by critics both during his life and posthumously. He consistently was criticized for producing shallow films without talent or artistic care. Compared to other directors, few film scholars have taken the time to academically analyze his films and style. During the [[French New Wave]], critics began to categorize certain filmmakers as [[auteur]]s such as [[Howard Hawks]], [[John Ford]], and [[Raoul Walsh]]. DeMille was left off the list, determined to be too unsophisticated and antiquated to be considered an auteur.{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=270}} However, [[Simon Louvish]] wrote &quot;he was the complete master and auteur of his films&quot;{{sfn|Louvish|2007|p=xvii}} and Anton Kozlovic called him the &quot;unsung American auteur&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;samson&quot; /&gt; [[Andrew Sarris]], a leading proponent of the auteur theory, ranked DeMille highly as an auteur in the &quot;Far Side of Paradise&quot;, just below the &quot;Pantheon&quot;. Sarris added that despite the influence of styles of contemporary directors throughout his career, DeMille's style remained unchanged. [[Robert Birchard]] wrote one could argue auteurship of DeMille on the basis that DeMille's thematic and visual style remained consistent throughout his career. However, Birchard acknowledged that Sarris's point was more likely that DeMille's style was behind the development of film as an art form.{{sfn|Birchard|2004|p=xii}} Meanwhile, Sumiko Higashi sees DeMille as &quot;not only a figure who was shaped and influenced by the forces of his era but as a filmmaker who left his own signature on the [[culture industry]].&quot;{{sfn|Williams|2014|p=355}} The critic [[Camille Paglia]] has called ''The Ten Commandments'' one of the ten greatest films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Camille&amp;surname=Paglia |title=BFI - Sight &amp; Sound - Top Ten Poll 2002 - How the directors and critics voted |last=James |first=Nick |displayauthors=etal |publisher= |access-date=July 19, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915132021/http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/voter.php?forename=Camille&amp;surname=Paglia |archive-date=September 15, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Cecil b de mille directing.png|240px|thumb|DeMille directing, 1920|alt=DeMille on a stand, holding a megaphone, giving commands to crew members which surround him and several film cameras]]

DeMille was respected by his peers, yet his individual films were sometimes criticized. &quot;Directorially, I think his pictures were the most horrible things I've ever seen in my life&quot;, said director [[William Wellman]]. &quot;But he put on pictures that made a fortune. In that respect, he was better than any of us,&quot; Wellman added.&lt;ref&gt;Brownlow, K. (1976). ''The Parade's Gone by...''

As a filmmaker, DeMille was the aesthetic inspiration of many directors and films due to his early influence during the crucial development of the film industry. DeMille's early silent comedies influenced the comedies of [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and Charlie Chaplin's ''[[A Woman of Paris]]''. Additionally, DeMille's epics such as ''The Crusades'' influenced [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Navsky]]''. Moreover, DeMille's epics inspired directors such as Howard Hawks, [[Nicholas Ray]], [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]], and [[George Stevens]] to try producing epics.{{sfn|Eyman|2010|p=6}} Cecil B. DeMille has influenced the work of several well-known directors.
