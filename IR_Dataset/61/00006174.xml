[[File:Platonic Solids Transparent.svg|thumb|250px|The set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of all [[Platonic solids]] has 5 elements. Thus &lt;math&gt;|S|=5&lt;/math&gt;.]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''cardinality''' of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] is a measure of the &quot;number of [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set&quot;. For example, the set &lt;math&gt;A = \{2, 4, 6\}&lt;/math&gt; contains 3 elements, and therefore &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has a cardinality of 3. Beginning in the late 19th century, this concept was generalized to [[infinite set]]s, allowing to distinguish several stages of infinity, and to perform [[Cardinal arithmetic|arithmetic]] on them. There are two approaches to cardinality – one which compares sets directly using [[bijection]]s and [[injective function|injection]]s, and another which uses [[cardinal number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Cardinal Number |id=CardinalNumber }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cardinality of a set is also called its '''size''', when no confusion with other notions of size&lt;ref&gt;Such as [[length]] and [[area]] in [[geometry]]. – A line of finite length is a set of points that has infinite cardinality.&lt;/ref&gt; is possible.

The cardinality of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt;, with a [[vertical bar]] on each side; this is the same notation as [[absolute value]] and the meaning depends on [[Ambiguity|context]]. Alternatively, the cardinality of a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; may be denoted by &lt;math&gt;n(A)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;border-top: 3px double black;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{card}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\#A&lt;/math&gt;.

==Comparing sets==
[[File:Aplicación 2 inyectiva sobreyectiva04.svg|thumb|250px|Bijective function from '''N''' to the set ''E'' of [[even number]]s. Although ''E'' is a proper subset of '''N''', both sets have the same cardinality.]]
[[File:Diagonal argument powerset svg.svg|thumb|250px|'''N''' does not have the same cardinality as its [[power set]] ''P''('''N'''): For every function ''f'' from '''N''' to ''P''('''N'''), the set ''T'' = {''n''∈'''N''': ''n''∉''f''(''n'')} disagrees with every set in the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of ''f'', hence ''f'' cannot be surjective. The picture shows an example ''f'' and the corresponding ''T''; {{color|#800000|'''red'''}}: ''n''∈''f''(''n'')\''T'', {{color|#000080|'''blue'''}}:''n''∈''T''\''f''(''n'').]]

While the cardinality of a finite set is just the number of its elements, extending the notion to infinite sets usually starts with defining the notion of comparison of arbitrary (possibly infinite) sets.

===Definition 1: {{abs|''A''}} = {{abs|''B''}}===
:Two sets ''A'' and ''B'' have the same cardinality if there exists a [[bijection]] from ''A'' to ''B'', that is, a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from ''A'' to ''B'' that is both [[injective]] and [[surjective]]. Such sets are said to be ''equipotent'', ''equipollent'', or ''[[equinumerous]]''. This relationship can also be denoted ''A'' ≈ ''B'' or ''A'' ~ ''B''.

:For example, the set ''E'' = {0, 2, 4, 6, ...} of non-negative [[even number]]s has the same cardinality as the set '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} of [[natural numbers]], since the function ''f''(''n'') = 2''n'' is a bijection from '''N''' to ''E'', see picture.

===Definition 2: {{abs|''A''}} ≤ {{abs|''B''}}===
:''A'' has cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of ''B'' if there exists an injective function from ''A'' into ''B''.

===Definition 3: {{abs|''A''}} &lt; {{abs|''B''}}===
:''A'' has cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of ''B'' if there is an injective function, but no bijective function, from ''A'' to ''B''.

:For example, the set '''N''' of all [[natural numbers]] has cardinality strictly less than its [[power set]] ''P''('''N'''), because ''g''(''n'') = { ''n'' } is an injective function from '''N''' to ''P''('''N'''), and it can be shown that no function from '''N''' to ''P''('''N''') can be bijective, see picture. By a similar argument, '''N''' has cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of the set '''R''' of all [[real number]]s, see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]].

If {{abs|''A''}} ≤ {{abs|''B''}} and {{abs|''B''}} ≤ {{abs|''A''}} then {{abs|''A''}} = {{abs|''B''}} ([[Schröder–Bernstein theorem]]). The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the statement that {{abs|''A''}} ≤ {{abs|''B''}} or {{abs|''B''}} ≤ {{abs|''A''}} for every ''A'', ''B''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Friedrich M.

==Cardinal numbers==
{{main article|Cardinal number}}

Above, &quot;cardinality&quot; was defined functionally. That is, the &quot;cardinality&quot; of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.

The relation of having the same cardinality is called [[equinumerosity]], and this is an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all sets. The [[equivalence class]] of a set ''A'' under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as ''A''. There are two ways to define the &quot;cardinality of a set&quot;:

#The cardinality of a set ''A'' is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity.
#A representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment|initial ordinal in that class]]. This is usually taken as the definition of [[cardinal number]] in [[axiomatic set theory]].

Assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the cardinalities of the [[infinite set]]s are denoted
:&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 &lt; \aleph_1 &lt; \aleph_2 &lt; \ldots . &lt;/math&gt;
For each [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_{\alpha + 1}&lt;/math&gt; is the least cardinal number greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

The cardinality of the [[natural number]]s is denoted [[aleph number|aleph-null]] (&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;), while the cardinality of the [[real number]]s is denoted by &quot;&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;&quot; (a lowercase [[fraktur (script)|fraktur script]] &quot;c&quot;), and is also referred to as the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Cantor showed, using the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]], that &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak c} &gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. We can show that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c = 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. The [[continuum hypothesis]] says that &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1 = 2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest cardinal number bigger than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers.
The continuum hypothesis is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice|ZFC]], a standard axiomatization of set theory; that is, it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC (provided ZFC is consistent).

==Finite, countable and uncountable sets==
If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, the [[trichotomy (mathematics)|law of trichotomy]] holds for cardinality. Thus we can make the following definitions:

*Any set ''X'' with cardinality less than that of the [[natural number]]s, or | ''X'' | &lt; | '''N''' |, is said to be a [[finite set]].
*Any set ''X'' that has the same cardinality as the set of the natural numbers, or | ''X'' | = | '''N''' | = &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;, is said to be a [[countably infinite]] set.
*Any set ''X'' with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers, or | ''X'' | &gt; | '''N''' |, for example | '''R''' | = &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c &lt;/math&gt; &gt; | '''N''' |, is said to be  [[uncountable set|uncountable]].

==Infinite sets==
Our intuition gained from [[finite set]]s breaks down when dealing with [[infinite set]]s. In the late nineteenth century [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others rejected the view that the whole cannot be the same size as the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cantor.1932&quot;&gt;{{citation | author=Georg Cantor | title=Mitteilungen zur Lehre vom Transfiniten |journal=[[Zeitschrift für Philosophie und philosophische Kritik]]| volume=91 |pages=81–125 |year=1887 }}&lt;BR&gt;Reprinted in: {{citation | author=Georg Cantor |editor1=Adolf Fraenkel (Lebenslauf) |editor2=Ernst Zermelo | title=Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts| publisher= Springer | location=Berlin | year=1932 | pages=378–439 | url=http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN237853094&amp;DMDID=DMDLOG_0060}} Here: p.413 bottom&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|reason=Give more early references by Frege, Dedekind, and others. There might also be an earlier reference by Cantor?|date=November 2019}} One example of this is [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]].
Indeed, Dedekind defined an infinite set as one that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with a strict subset (that is, having the same size in Cantor's sense); this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. Cantor introduced the cardinal numbers, and showed that (according to his bijection-based definition of size) some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers (&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;).

===Cardinality of the continuum===
{{main article|Cardinality of the continuum}}

One of Cantor's most important results was that the [[cardinality of the continuum]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}&lt;/math&gt;) is greater than that of the natural numbers (&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;); that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than natural numbers '''N'''. Namely, Cantor showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\aleph_0} = \beth_1&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Beth number#Beth one|Beth one]]) satisfies:
:&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} &gt; \aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;
:(see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).

The [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there is no [[cardinal number]] between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,
:&lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;

However, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted [[ZFC]] [[axiomatic set theory]], if ZFC is consistent.

Cardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [[real number line]] is equal to the number of points in any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist [[proper subset]]s and [[proper superset]]s of an infinite set ''S'' that have the same size as ''S'', although ''S'' contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of ''S'' contain elements that are not included in it.

The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [[tangent function]], which provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (−½π, ½π) and '''R''' (see also [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]).

The second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be used to obtain [[Space-filling curve#Proof that a square and its side contain the same number of points|such a proof]].

Cantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt; exist (see his [[Cantor's diagonal argument#General sets|generalized diagonal argument]] and [[Cantor's theorem|theorem]]). They include, for instance:

:* the set of all subsets of '''R''', i.e., the [[power set]] of '''R''', written ''P''('''R''') or 2&lt;sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sup&gt;
:* the set '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;'''R'''&lt;/sup&gt; of all functions from '''R''' to '''R'''

Both have cardinality
:&lt;math&gt;2^\mathfrak {c} = \beth_2 &gt; \mathfrak c &lt;/math&gt;
:(see [[Beth number#Beth two|Beth two]]).

The [[Cardinality of the continuum#Cardinal equalities|cardinal equalities]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}^2 = \mathfrak{c},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak c,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c ^{\mathfrak c} = 2^{\mathfrak c}&lt;/math&gt; can be demonstrated using [[cardinal arithmetic]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{c}^2 = \left(2^{\aleph_0}\right)^2 = 2^{2\times{\aleph_0}} = 2^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak{c},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c^{\aleph_0} = \left(2^{\aleph_0}\right)^{\aleph_0} = 2^{{\aleph_0}\times{\aleph_0}} = 2^{\aleph_0} = \mathfrak{c},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak c ^{\mathfrak c} = \left(2^{\aleph_0}\right)^{\mathfrak c} = 2^{\mathfrak c\times\aleph_0} = 2^{\mathfrak c}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples and properties==
* If ''X'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} and ''Y'' = {apples, oranges, peaches}, then | ''X'' | = | ''Y'' | because { (''a'', apples), (''b'', oranges), (''c'', peaches)} is a bijection between the sets ''X'' and ''Y''. The cardinality of each of ''X'' and ''Y'' is 3.
* If | ''X'' | &amp;lt; | ''Y'' |, then there exists ''Z'' such that | ''X'' | = | ''Z'' | and ''Z'' ⊆ ''Y''.
*If | ''X'' | ≤ | ''Y'' | and | ''Y'' | ≤ | ''X'' |, then | ''X'' | = | ''Y'' |. This holds even for infinite cardinals, and is known as [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]].
* [[Cardinality of the continuum#Sets with cardinality of the continuum|Sets with cardinality of the continuum]]

==Union and intersection==

If ''A'' and ''B'' are [[disjoint sets]], then
:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert A \cup B \right\vert = \left\vert A \right\vert + \left\vert B \right\vert.&lt;/math&gt;

From this, one can show that in general the cardinalities of [[Union (set theory)|unions]] and  [[Intersection (set theory)|intersections]] are related by&lt;ref&gt;Applied Abstract Algebra, K.H. Kim, F.W. Roush, Ellis Horwood Series, 1983, {{ISBN|0-85312-612-7}} (student edition), {{ISBN|0-85312-563-5}} (library edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \left\vert C \cup D \right\vert + \left\vert C \cap D \right\vert = \left\vert C \right\vert + \left\vert D \right\vert \,.&lt;/math&gt;
