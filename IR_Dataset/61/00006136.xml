'''Carbon monoxide''' ('''CO''') is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless flammable gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to [[animal]]s that use [[hemoglobin]] as an oxygen carrier (both [[Invertebrate]] and [[vertebrate]]) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 [[parts-per notation|ppm]], although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of [[ground-level ozone]].
 
Carbon monoxide consists of one [[carbon]] atom and one [[oxygen]] atom, connected by a [[triple bond]] that consists of a net two pi bonds and one sigma bond. It is the simplest [[oxocarbon]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with other triply-bonded diatomic molecules having ten valence electrons, including the [[cyanide]] anion, the [[nitrosonium]] cation and molecular [[nitrogen]]. In [[coordination complex]]es the carbon monoxide [[ligand]] is called [[metal carbonyl|carbonyl]].

==History==
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes. An ancient method of execution was to shut the criminal in a bathing room with smoldering coals. What was not known was the mechanism of death. Greek physician [[Galen]] (129–199 AD) speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;Penney, David G. (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XsnPIfP0oBcC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Carbon Monoxide Toxicity''], CRC Press, p. 5, {{ISBN|0-8493-2065-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, the French chemist {{ill|de Lassone|fr|Joseph-Marie-François de Lassone}} produced CO by heating [[zinc oxide]] with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was [[hydrogen]], as it burned with a blue flame. The gas was identified as a compound containing [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] by the Scottish chemist [[William Cruickshank (chemist)|William Cruickshank]] in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, W. (1801) [https://books.google.com/books?id=t4tEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Some observations on different hydrocarbons and combinations of carbon with oxygen, etc. in reply to some of Dr. Priestley's late objections to the new system of chemistry,&quot;] ''Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts'' [a.k.a.

During [[World War II]], a gas mixture including carbon monoxide was used to keep [[motor vehicle]]s running in parts of the world where [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]] were scarce. External (with a few exceptions) charcoal or [[wood gas generator]]s were fitted, and the mixture of atmospheric nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and small amounts of other gases produced by [[gasification]] was piped to a gas mixer. The gas mixture produced by this process is known as [[wood gas]]. Carbon monoxide was also used on a large scale during [[the Holocaust]] at some [[Extermination camps in the Holocaust|Nazi German extermination camps]], the most notable by [[Nazi gas van|gas van]]s in [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], and in the [[Action T4]] &quot;[[euthanasia]]&quot; program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_04R6DoPxLoC&amp;pg=PT323|page=323|title=A history of modern Germany, 1800–2000|author=Kitchen, Martin |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-0041-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of [[carbon]]-containing compounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), such as when operating a [[stove]] or an [[internal combustion engine]] in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Mike. [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/co/coh.htm Carbon Monoxide – Molecule of the Month], Winchester College, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal gas]], which was widely used before the 1960s for domestic lighting, cooking, and heating, had carbon monoxide as a significant fuel constituent. Some processes in modern technology, such as [[blast furnace|iron smelting]], still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KQqLicqcTM8C&amp;pg=PA36|page=36|title=Crossing the Energy Divide: Moving from Fossil Fuel Dependence to a Clean-Energy Future|author1=Ayres, Robert U.  |author2=Ayres, Edward H. |publisher=Wharton School Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-13-701544-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large quantity of CO byproduct is formed during the oxidative processes for the production of chemicals.

Worldwide, the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin, due to [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reactions in the [[troposphere]] that generate about 5{{e|12}} kilograms per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.176.4032.290|title=Carbon Monoxide Balance in Nature|year=1972|last1=Weinstock|first1=B.|last2=Niki|first2=H.|journal=Science|volume=176|pages=290–2|pmid=5019781|issue=4032|bibcode = 1972Sci...176..290W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest fires, other forms of combustion, and [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].

In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

==Molecular properties==
Carbon monoxide has a [[molar mass]] of 28.0, which, according to the [[ideal gas law]], makes it slightly less dense than air, whose average molar mass is 28.8.

The [[bond length]] between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is 112.8&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]].&lt;ref name=gilliam&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Gilliam, O. R. |author2=Johnson, C. M. |author3=Gordy, W. |title=Microwave Spectroscopy in the Region from Two to Three Millimeters|year=1950|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=78|issue=2|pages=140–144|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.140|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..140G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRC91|page=9–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bond length is consistent with a triple bond, as in molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which has a similar bond length (109.76&amp;nbsp;pm) and nearly the same [[molecular mass]]. Carbon–oxygen double bonds are significantly longer, 120.8&amp;nbsp;pm in [[formaldehyde]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRC91|page=9–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boiling point (82&amp;nbsp;K) and melting point (68&amp;nbsp;K) are very similar to those of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (77&amp;nbsp;K and 63&amp;nbsp;K, respectively). The [[bond-dissociation energy]] of 1072&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol is stronger than that of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (942&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and represents the strongest chemical bond known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/data/bond_energies_lengths.html Common Bond Energies (D) and Bond Lengths (r)]. wiredchemist.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ground state|ground]] [[electronic state]] of carbon monoxide is a [[singlet state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highly Excited Triplet States of Carbon Monoxide| first=C.

===Bonding and dipole moment===
The carbon monoxide has a very high [[bond-dissociation energy]], the strongest of any neutral molecule, 11.65 eV.  Carbon and oxygen together have a total of 10 [[electrons]] in the [[valence shell]]. Following the [[octet rule]] for both carbon and oxygen, the two atoms form a [[triple bond]], with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or [[dipolar bond]]. This causes a C←O [[Chemical polarity|polarization]] of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C→O polarization, since oxygen is more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon. In the free carbon monoxide, a net negative charge δ&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small [[bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of 0.122&amp;nbsp;[[Debye|D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Scuseria | first1=Gustavo E. | last2=Miller | first2=Michael D. | last3=Jensen | first3=Frank | last4=Geertsen | first4=Jan |title=The dipole moment of carbon monoxide|journal=J.

The molecule is therefore asymmetric: oxygen has more electron density than carbon, and is also slightly positively charged compared to carbon being negative. By contrast, the [[isoelectronic]] dinitrogen molecule has no dipole moment.

Carbon monoxide has a computed fractional bond order of 2.6, indicating that the &quot;third&quot; bond is important but constitutes somewhat less than a full bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinie|first=Ryan J.|last2=Bultema|first2=Jarred J.|last3=Vander Wal|first3=Mark N.|last4=Burkhart|first4=Brandon J.|last5=Vander Griend|first5=Douglas A.|last6=DeKock|first6=Roger L.|date=2011-08-01|title=Bond Order and Chemical Properties of BF, CO, and N2|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=88|issue=8|pages=1094–1097|doi=10.1021/ed100758t|issn=0021-9584|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/32b08acb98b762ef91be755b59e48a5514d2b628}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in valence bond terms,  &lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;C≡O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the most important structure, while :C=O is non-octet, but has a neutral formal charge on each atom and represents the second most important resonance contributor.

The [[oxidation state]] of carbon in carbon monoxide is +2 in each of these structures. It is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen. Only the two non-bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon. In this count, carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom.

===Toxicity===
&lt;!--Please keep this section short, there is no need to elaborate here. Details will be more useful in the [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] article.--&gt;
{{Main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}

[[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toxicology2002-omaye&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Omaye ST| title=Metabolic modulation of carbon monoxide toxicity|journal=Toxicology|year=2002|pages=139–150|volume=180|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00387-6|pmid=12324190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, but highly toxic. It combines with [[hemoglobin]] to produce [[carboxyhemoglobin]], which usurps the space in hemoglobin that normally carries oxygen, but is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues. Concentrations as low as 667 [[Parts per notation|ppm]] may cause up to 50% of the body's hemoglobin to convert to carboxyhemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=1592720|year=1992|last1=Tikuisis|first1=P|last2=Kane|first2=DM|last3=McLellan|first3=TM|last4=Buick|first4=F|last5=Fairburn|first5=SM|title=Rate of formation of carboxyhemoglobin in exercising humans exposed to carbon monoxide|volume=72|issue=4|pages=1311–9|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|doi=10.1152/jappl.1992.72.4.1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A level of 50% carboxyhemoglobin may result in seizure, coma, and fatality. In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] limits long-term workplace exposure levels above 50 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=OSHA CO guidelines |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/carbonmonoxide/recognition.html |publisher=OSHA |accessdate=May 27, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126010501/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/carbonmonoxide/recognition.html |archivedate=January 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may resemble other types of poisonings and infections, including symptoms such as [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and a feeling of weakness. Affected families often believe they are victims of food poisoning. Infants may be irritable and feed poorly. Neurological signs include confusion, disorientation, visual disturbance, [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting), and seizures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumenthal&quot; /&gt;

Some descriptions of carbon monoxide poisoning include [[retina]]l hemorrhages, and an abnormal cherry-red blood hue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ganong|first=William F|title= Review of medical physiology|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=OLa8vDBXDD4C&amp;dq=Ganong+WF.+Review+of+Medical+Physiology.+Norwalk+Ct:+Appleton+%26+Lange,+1995&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=May 27, 2009|edition=22|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-144040-0|page=684|chapter=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most clinical diagnoses these signs are seldom noticed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumenthal&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Ivan|date=1 June 2001|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=J R Soc Med|volume=94|issue=6|pages=270–272|pmid=11387414|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty with the usefulness of this cherry-red effect is that it corrects, or masks, what would otherwise be an unhealthy appearance, since the chief effect of removing deoxygenated hemoglobin is to make an asphyxiated person appear more normal, or a dead person appear more lifelike, similar to the effect of red colorants in embalming fluid. The &quot;false&quot; or unphysiologic red-coloring effect in anoxic CO-poisoned tissue is related to the meat-coloring commercial use of carbon monoxide, discussed below.

Carbon monoxide also binds to other molecules such as [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]]. Exposures to carbon monoxide may cause significant damage to the [[heart]] and [[central nervous system]], especially to the [[globus pallidus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Prockop LD, Chichkova RI |title=Carbon monoxide intoxication: an updated review|journal=J Neurol Sci|year=2007|pages=122–130|volume=262|issue=1–2|pmid=17720201|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.037}}&lt;/ref&gt; often with [[sequelae|long-term chronic pathological conditions]].

===Normal human physiology===
{{see also|Gaseous signaling molecules}}
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the human body as a [[signaling molecule]]. Thus, carbon monoxide may have a physiological role in the body, such as a [[neurotransmitter]] or a [[vasodilation|blood vessel relaxant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;endogenous_co&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=L|title=Carbon Monoxide: Endogenous Production, Physiological Functions, and Pharmacological Applications|journal=Pharmacol Rev|volume=57|issue=4|pages=585–630|date=December 2005|pmid=16382109|doi=10.1124/pr.57.4.3|last2=Wang|first2=R|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/07b7357d23ac3cd28d3a0028b107d03f59dacf74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of carbon monoxide's role in the body, abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerations, hypertension, heart failure, and pathological inflammation.&lt;ref name=&quot;endogenous_co&quot; /&gt; Relative to inflammation, carbon monoxide has been shown to inhibit the movement of [[leukocyte]]s to inflamed tissues, stimulate leukocyte [[phagocytosis]] of bacteria, and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s by leukocytes. In animal model studies, furthermore, carbon monoxide reduced the severity of experimentally induced bacterial [[sepsis]], pancreatitis, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, colitis, osteoarthritis, lung injury, lung transplantation rejection, and neuropathic pain while promoting skin wound healing. These actions are similar to those of [[Specialized pro-resolving mediators]] which act to dampen, reverse, and repair the tissue damage due to diverse inflammation responses. Indeed, carbon monoxide can act additively with one of these mediators ([[Resolvin]] D1) to limit inflammatory responses. The studies implicate carbon monoxide as a physiological contributor to limiting inflammation and suggest that its delivery by inhalation or carbon monoxide-forming drugs may be therapeutically useful for controlling pathological inflammatory responses.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26095908&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallace JL, Ianaro A, Flannigan KL, Cirino G | title = Gaseous mediators in resolution of inflammation | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–33 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26095908 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2015.05.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26208702&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uehara EU, Shida Bde S, de Brito CA | title = Role of nitric oxide in immune responses against viruses: beyond microbicidal activity | journal = Inflammation Research | volume = 64 | issue = 11 | pages = 845–52 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26208702 | doi = 10.1007/s00011-015-0857-2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid26498251&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakahira K, Choi AM | title = Carbon monoxide in the treatment of sepsis | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

CO functions as an endogenous signaling molecule, modulates functions of the cardiovascular system, inhibits blood platelet aggregation and adhesion, suppresses, reverses, and repairs the damage caused by inflammatory responses.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is present in small amounts (about 80 ppb) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. About half of the carbon monoxide in Earth's atmosphere is from the burning of [[fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and biomass (such as [[forest fires|forest]] and [[bushfire]]s).&lt;ref name=Seinfeld2006&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seinfeld |first1=John |last2=Pandis |first2=Spyros |date=2006 |title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change |url= |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page= |isbn=978-0-471-72018-8 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rest of carbon monoxide comes from chemical reactions with [[organic compound]]s emitted by human activities and plants. Small amounts are also emitted from the ocean, and from geological activity because carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high [[pressure]]s in the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kcllhZcy53cC&amp;pg=PA243|page=243|title=Metal-Carbon Bonds in Enzymes and Cofactors|author1=Sigel, Astrid  |author2=Sigel, Roland K. O. |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84755-915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.

Carbon monoxide has an indirect effect on [[radiative forcing]] by elevating concentrations of direct [[greenhouse gas]]es, including [[methane]] and [[troposphere|tropospheric]] [[ozone]]. CO can react chemically with other atmospheric constituents (primarily the [[hydroxyl]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], OH&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;) that would otherwise destroy methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gnaNHeU4rgQC&amp;pg=PA106|page=106|title=Global climate change linkages: acid rain, air quality, and stratospheric ozone|author=White, James Carrick|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=978-0-444-01515-0|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] and ozone.

In the [[atmosphere of Venus]] carbon monoxide occurs as a result of the photodissociation of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 169 [[nanometre|nm]].

Due to its long lifetime in the mid-troposphere, carbon monoxide is also used as tracer of transport for pollutant plumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.5194/acp-10-10655-2010 | title = IASI carbon monoxide validation over the Arctic during POLARCAT spring and summer campaigns | year = 2010 | last1 = Pommier | first1 = M. | last2 = Law | first2 = K.

===Urban pollution===
Carbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas, chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines (including vehicles, portable and back-up generators, lawn mowers, power washers, etc.), but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels (including wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural gas, and trash).

Large CO pollution events can be observed from space over cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pommier | first1 = M. | last2 = McLinden | first2 = C.

====Role in ground-level ozone formation====
{{Main|Tropospheric ozone}}
Carbon monoxide is, along with [[aldehyde]]s, part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form [[photochemical smog]]. It reacts with hydroxyl radical (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH) to produce a radical intermediate &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;HOCO, which transfers rapidly its radical hydrogen to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[peroxy]] radical (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1029/2002JD002415|title=Potential for photochemical ozone formation in the troposphere over the North Atlantic as derived from aircraft observationsduring ACSOE|year=2002|author1=Reeves, Claire E. |author2=Penkett, Stuart A. |author3=Bauguitte, Stephane |author4=Law, Kathy S. |author5=Evans, Mathew J. |author6=Bandy, Brian J. |author7=Monks, Paul S. |author8=Edwards, Gavin D. |author9=Phillips, Gavin |author10=Barjat, Hannah |author11=Kent, Joss |author12=Dewey, Ken |author13=Schmitgen, Sandra |author14=Kley, Dieter |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=107|pages=4707|issue=D23|bibcode = 2002JGRD..107.4707R |url=http://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/34366}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peroxy radical subsequently reacts with [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO) to form [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydroxyl radical. NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives O(&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P) via photolysis, thereby forming O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; following reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Since hydroxyl radical is formed during the formation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the balance of the sequence of chemical reactions starting with carbon monoxide and leading to the formation of ozone is:
:CO + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + hν → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
(where hν refers to the [[photon]] of light absorbed by the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule in the sequence)

Although the creation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical step leading to low level [[ozone]] formation, it also increases this ozone in another, somewhat mutually exclusive way, by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with ozone.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QkErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23|page=23|title=Ozone and other photochemical oxidants|publisher=National Academies|year=1977|isbn=978-0-309-02531-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor pollution===
In closed environments, the concentration of carbon monoxide can easily rise to lethal levels. On average, 170 people in the United States die every year from carbon monoxide produced by non-automotive consumer products.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpsc&quot;&gt;[[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]], [http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/466.html Carbon Monoxide Questions and Answers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109204227/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PUBS/466.html |date=2010-01-09 }}, accessed 2009-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the [[Florida Department of Health]], &quot;every year more than 500 Americans die from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and thousands more across the U.S. require emergency medical care for non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;&lt;ref name=EPHT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/programs/Environmental_Public_Health_Tracking/HTML_pages/Data_Carbon_Monoxide.html |title=Tracking Carbon Monoxide |publisher=Environmental Public Health Tracking – Florida Dept. of Health |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927164735/http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/programs/Environmental_Public_Health_Tracking/HTML_pages/Data_Carbon_Monoxide.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These products include malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, ranges, water heaters, and [[gas heater|gas]] and [[kerosene heater|kerosene]] room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable generators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) reported 15,769 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning resulting in 39 deaths in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204014524/http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/NPDSPoisonData/AnnualReports/tabid/125/Default.aspx &quot;AAPCC Annual Data Reports 2007&quot;].

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimates that several thousand people go to hospital emergency rooms every year to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, [http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showCarbonMonoxideLanding.action Carbon Monoxide Poisoning], accessed 2009-12-04&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological sources===
Carbon monoxide is produced in [[heme#Degradation|heme catabolism]] and thus is present in blood.  Normal circulating levels in the blood are 0% to 3% saturation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&amp;contentid=carbon_monoxide_blood|title=Carbon Monoxide (Blood) - Health Encyclopedia - University of Rochester Medical Center|website=www.urmc.rochester.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the ratio of the amount of carboxyhaemoglobin present to the total circulating haemoglobin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/47/4/723]&lt;/ref&gt; and are higher in smokers. Carbon monoxide levels cannot be assessed through a physical exam. Laboratory testing requires a blood sample (arterial or venous) and laboratory analysis on a CO-Oximeter. Additionally, a noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) test method from Pulse CO-Oximetry exists and has been validated compared to invasive methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roth D. |author2=Herkner H. |author3=Schreiber W. |author4=Hubmann N. |author5=Gamper G. |author6=Laggner A.N. |author7=Havel C. |title=Accuracy of Noninvasive Multiwave Pulse Oximetry Compared With Carboxyhemoglobin From Blood Gas Analysis in Unselected Emergency Department Patients|pmid=21459480|url=http://www.osuem.com/education/journalClub/accuracy+of+noninvasive+multiwave+pulse+ox.pdf|year=2011|volume=58|issue=1|pages=74–9|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2010.12.024|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A carbon monoxide sensor protein, [[CooA]], has been characterized in bacteria.

=== Space ===
Outside of Earth, carbon monoxide is the second-most common molecule in the [[interstellar medium]], after [[molecular hydrogen]].  Because of its asymmetry, this [[polar molecule]] produces far brighter [[spectral line]]s than the hydrogen molecule, making CO much easier to detect.  Interstellar CO was first detected with [[radio telescope]]s in 1970. It is now the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies, as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires [[space telescopes]]. Carbon monoxide observations provide much of the information about the [[molecular cloud]]s in which most [[star formation|stars form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | year=1991 | volume=29 | pages=195–237 | author=Combes, Françoise | title=Distribution of CO in the Milky Way | doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.29.090191.001211 | bibcode=1991ARA&amp;A..29..195C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beta Pictoris]], the second brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Pictor]], shows an [[infrared excess|excess of infrared emission]] compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide)&lt;ref name=&quot;LAT-20140308&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Amina |title=Did two planets around nearby star collide?

However, there is very little CO in the atmosphere of [[Pluto]], which seems to have been formed from comets. This may be because there is (or was) liquid water inside Pluto. Carbon monoxide can react with water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|CO|2}}

This is called the [[water-gas shift reaction]] when occurring in the gas phase, but it can also take place (very slowly) in aqueous solution.
If the hydrogen partial pressure is high enough (for instance in an underground sea), [[formic acid]] will be formed:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HCOOH

These reactions can take place in only a few million years even at temperatures such as found at Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Christopher Glein and Hunter Waite |title=Primordial N2 provides a cosmo chemical explanation for the existence of Sputnik Planitia, Pluto |journal=Icarus |volume=313 |pages=79–92 |date=May 11, 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2018.05.007 |arxiv=1805.09285|bibcode=2018Icar..313...79G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
Miners refer to carbon monoxide as &quot;white damp&quot; or the &quot;silent killer&quot;. It can be found in confined areas of poor ventilation in both surface mines and underground mines. The most common sources of carbon monoxide in mining operations are the internal combustion engine and explosives, however in coal mines carbon monoxide can also be found due to the low temperature oxidation of coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/illness_prevention/healthtopics/carbonmonoxide.htm|title=MSHA - Occupational Illness and Injury Prevention Program - Health Topics - Carbon Monoxide|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Many methods have been developed for carbon monoxide's production.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. &quot;Inorganic Chemistry&quot; Academic Press: San Diego, 200. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial production===
A major industrial source of CO is [[producer gas]], a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen, formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon. In an oven, air is passed through a bed of [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. The initially produced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO. The reaction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon to give CO is described as the [[Boudouard reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Higman, C |author2=van der Burgt, M | title = Gasification | publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 12 | isbn = 978-0-7506-7707-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above 800&amp;nbsp;°C, CO is the predominant product:

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C → 2 CO (ΔH = 170 kJ/mol)

Another source is &quot;[[water gas]]&quot;, a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of [[steam]] and carbon:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + C → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO (ΔH = +131 kJ/mol)

Other similar &quot;[[syngas|synthesis gas]]es&quot; can be obtained from [[natural gas]] and other fuels.

Carbon monoxide can also be produced by [[high-temperature electrolysis]] of carbon dioxide with [[solid oxide electrolyzer cell]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Yun|last2=Wang|first2=Jianchen|last3=Yu|first3=Bo|last4=Zhang|first4=Wenqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Jing|last6=Qiao|first6=Jinli|last7=Zhang|first7=Jiujun|title=A review of high temperature co-electrolysis of H O and CO to produce sustainable fuels using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs): advanced materials and technology|journal=Chem.

Rev.|date=2017|volume=46|issue=5|pages=1427–1463|doi=10.1039/C6CS00403B|pmid=28165079}}&lt;/ref&gt; One method, developed at DTU Energy uses a cerium oxide catalyst and does not have any issues of fouling of the catalyst&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dtu.dk/english/news/2019/09/new-route-to-carbon-neutral-fuels-from-carbon-dioxide-discovered-by-stanford-dtu-team?id=4feafcd3-bf1d-4e02-80ea-ea018bfc6caf New route to carbon-neutral fuels from carbon dioxide discovered by Stanford-DTU team]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-019-0457-4 Selective high-temperature CO2 electrolysis enabled by oxidized carbon intermediates]&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Carbon monoxide is also a byproduct of the reduction of metal [[oxide]] [[ore]]s with carbon, shown in a simplified form as follows:

:MO + C → M + CO

Carbon monoxide is also produced by the direct oxidation of carbon in a limited supply of oxygen or air.

:2 C(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO(g)

Since CO is a gas, the reduction process can be driven by heating, exploiting the positive (favorable) [[entropy]] of reaction. The [[Ellingham diagram]] shows that CO formation is favored over CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in high temperatures.

===Laboratory preparation===
Carbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[formic acid]] or [[oxalic acid]], for example with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;koch&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;coleman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Georg&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Brauer|first=Georg|title=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry Vol. 1, 2nd Ed|date=1963|publisher=Academic Press|location=Newyork|isbn=978-0121266011|page=646|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TLYatwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Handbook+of+Preparative+Inorganic+Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered [[zinc]] metal and [[calcium carbonate]], which releases CO and leaves behind [[zinc oxide]] and [[calcium oxide]]:

:Zn + CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → ZnO + CaO + CO

[[Silver nitrate]] and [[iodoform]] also afford carbon monoxide:

:CHI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO + 3AgI

Finally, metal [[oxalate]] salts release CO upon heating, leaving a [[carbonate]] as byproduct:

: {{chem|Na|2|C|2|O|4}} → {{chem|Na|2|C|O|3}} + {{chem|CO}}

Most metals form [[coordination complex]]es containing covalently attached carbon monoxide. Only metals in lower oxidation states will complex with carbon monoxide [[ligands]]. This is because there must be sufficient electron density to facilitate [[back-donation]] from the metal d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;-orbital, to the π* [[molecular orbital]] from CO. The lone pair on the carbon atom in CO, also donates electron density to the d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; on the metal to form a [[sigma bond]]. This electron donation is also exhibited with the [[cis effect]], or the labilization of CO ligands in the cis position. [[Nickel carbonyl]], for example, forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide and [[nickel]] metal:
: Ni + 4 CO → Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1 bar, 55 °C)
For this reason, nickel in any tubing or part must not come into prolonged contact with carbon monoxide. Nickel carbonyl decomposes readily back to Ni and CO upon contact with hot surfaces, and this method is used for the industrial purification of [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mond L, Langer K, Quincke F | title= Action of carbon monoxide on nickel| journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|year=1890| pages=749–753|doi = 10.1039/CT8905700749| volume= 57| url=https://zenodo.org/record/2160347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nickel carbonyl and other carbonyls, the electron pair on the carbon interacts with the metal; the carbon monoxide donates the electron pair to the metal. In these situations, carbon monoxide is called the '''carbonyl''' [[ligand]]. One of the most important metal carbonyls is [[iron pentacarbonyl]], Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:

[[Image:IronPentacarbonylStructure.png|150px|Structure of iron pentacarbonyl.]]
[[Image:Iron-pentacarbonyl-3D-balls.png|120px|Iron pentacarbonyl.]]

Many metal-CO complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents, not from CO. For instance, [[iridium(III) chloride|iridium trichloride]] and [[triphenylphosphine]] react in boiling [[2-Methoxyethanol|2-methoxyethanol]] or [[dimethylformamide|DMF]] to afford [[Vaska's complex|IrCl(CO)(PPh&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;]].

Metal carbonyls in coordination chemistry are usually studied using [[infrared spectroscopy of metal carbonyls|infrared spectroscopy]].

==Organic and main group chemistry==
In the presence of strong acids and water, carbon monoxide reacts with [[alkene]]s to form [[carboxylic acids]] in a process known as the Koch–Haaf reaction.&lt;ref name = koch&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Koch, H. |author2=Haaf, W.|title=1-Adamantanecarboxylic Acid|year=1973|collvol=5|collvolpages=20|prep=cv5p0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gattermann–Koch reaction]], [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|arenes]] are converted to [[benzaldehyde]] derivatives in the presence of [[aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]].&lt;ref name = coleman&gt;{{OrgSynth|title=''p''-Tolualdehyde|author=Coleman, G. H. |author2= Craig, David |last-author-amp=yes |collvol=2|collvolpages=583|year=1943|prep=cv2p0583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organolithium compounds (e.g. [[butyl lithium]]) react with carbon monoxide, but these reactions have little scientific use.

Although CO reacts with [[carbocation]]s and [[carbanion]]s, it is relatively nonreactive toward organic compounds without the intervention of metal catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;Chatani, N.; Murai, S. &quot;Carbon Monoxide&quot; in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{doi|10.1002/047084289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With main group reagents, CO undergoes several noteworthy reactions. [[halogenation|Chlorination]] of CO is the industrial route to the important compound [[phosgene]]. With [[borane]] CO forms the adduct [[Borane carbonyl|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BCO]], which is [[isoelectronic]] with the [[acylium|acetylium]] cation [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CCO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. CO reacts with [[sodium]] to give products resulting from C-C coupling such as [[acetylenediol|sodium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|Na|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}. It reacts with molten [[potassium]] to give a mixture of an organometallic compound, [[acetylenediol|potassium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|K|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}, [[benzenehexol|potassium benzenehexolate]] 6{{chem|K|+}} {{chem|C|6|O|6|6-}},&lt;ref name=&quot;wbuechIV&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Büchner | first1 = W. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = E. | title = Zur Kenntnis der sogenannten &quot;Alkalicarbonyle&quot; IV[1] Über die Reaktion von geschmolzenem Kalium mit Kohlenmonoxid | journal = Helvetica Chimica Acta | volume =47 |issue =6 |pages =1415–1423 | year = 1964 |doi=10.1002/hlca.19640470604}}

The compounds [[cyclohexanehexone]] or triquinoyl (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[cyclopentanepentone]] or leuconic acid (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts, can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide.

==Uses==

===Chemical industry===
Carbon monoxide is an [[industrial gas]] that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elschenbroich |first1=C. |last2=Salzer |first2=A. |title=Organometallics: A Concise Introduction |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-527-28165-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of aldehydes are produced by the [[hydroformylation]] reaction of [[alkene]]s, carbon monoxide, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hydroformylation is coupled to the [[Shell higher olefin process]] to give precursors to [[detergent]]s.

[[Phosgene]], useful for preparing isocyanates, polycarbonates, and polyurethanes, is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and [[chlorine]] gas through a bed of porous [[activated carbon]], which serves as a [[catalyst]].  World production of this compound was estimated to be 2.74 million tonnes in 1989.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann's| author1 = Wolfgang Schneider | author2 =  Werner Diller | title = Phosgene | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a19_411}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Methanol]] is produced by the [[hydrogenation]] of carbon monoxide. In a related reaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C-C bond formation, as in the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This technology allows [[coal]] or biomass to be converted to diesel.

In the [[Cativa process]], carbon monoxide and [[methanol]] react in the presence of a homogeneous [[Iridium]] [[catalyst]] and [[hydroiodic acid]] to give [[acetic acid]]. This process is responsible for most of the industrial production of [[acetic acid]].

An industrial scale use for pure carbon monoxide is purifying [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].

Carbon monoxide can also be used in the [[water-gas shift reaction]] to produce [[hydrogen]].

===Meat coloring===
Carbon monoxide is used in [[modified atmosphere]] packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with [[myoglobin]] to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment [[metmyoglobin]]. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meatsci1999_SORHEIM&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sorheim, S |author2=Nissena, H |author3=Nesbakken, T |title=The storage life of beef and pork packaged in an atmosphere with low carbon monoxide and high carbon dioxide|journal=Journal of Meat Science|year=1999|pages=157–164|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0309-1740(98)00163-6|pmid=22062367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%.

The technology was first given &quot;[[generally recognized as safe]]&quot; (GRAS) status by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2002 for use as a secondary packaging system, and does not require labeling. In 2004, the FDA approved CO as primary packaging method, declaring that CO does not mask spoilage odor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meatsci2005_eilert&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Eilert EJ|title=New packaging technologies for the 21st century|journal=Journal of Meat Science |year=2005|pages=122–127|volume=71|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2005.04.003|pmid=22064057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this ruling, the process remains controversial for fears that it masks spoilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/article.asp?id=644&amp;sub=sub1|author= Huffman, Randall D. |title=Low-Oxygen Packaging with CO: A Study in Food Politics That Warrants Peer Review|publisher=FoodSafetyMagazine.com|accessdate=April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/food/foodsafety/questionable-technologoies/carbon-monoxide/|website=Food and Water Watch|title=Food Safety: Carbon Monoxide|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a bill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.3115:|title=Carbon Monoxide Treated Meat, Poultry, and Seafood Safe Handling, Labeling, and Consumer Protection Act (Introduced in House)|work=The Library of Congress|date=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives]] to label modified atmosphere carbon monoxide packaging as a color additive, but the bill died in subcommittee. The process is banned in many other countries, including Japan, [[Singapore]], and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Proof in the Pink?

===Medicine===
{{see also|Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules}}
In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,&lt;ref name = verma/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt; as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]], and encouragers of [[neovascular]] growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Li2009&quot; /&gt; However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from ''wet'' [[macular degeneration]], a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.

There is a theory that, in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] that is activated by carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot; /&gt;

Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.&lt;ref name=&quot;clinical-trial&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison gas may carry a medical benefit|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/16/poison_gas_may_carry_a_medical_benefit/?page=full|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009 | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metallurgy===

Carbon monoxide is a strong reductive agent, and whilst not known, it has been used in [[pyrometallurgy]] to reduce [[metal]]s from [[ore]]s since ancient times. Carbon monoxide strips oxygen off metal oxides, reducing them to pure metal in high temperatures, forming [[carbon dioxide]] in the process. Carbon monoxide is not usually supplied as is, in gaseous phase, in the reactor, but rather it is formed in high temperature in presence of oxygen-carrying ore, carboniferous agent such as coke and high temperature. The [[blast furnace]] process is a typical example of a process of reduction of metal from ore with carbon monoxide.

===Lasers===

Carbon monoxide has also been used as a [[active laser medium|lasing medium]] in high-powered infrared [[laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ionin | first1 = A. | last2 = Kinyaevskiy | first2 = I. | last3 = Klimachev | first3 = Y. | last4 = Kotkov | first4 = A. | last5 = Kozlov | first5 = A. | title = Novel mode-locked carbon monoxide laser system achieves high accuracy | doi = 10.1117/2.1201112.004016 | journal = SPIE Newsroom | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fdf0ae25a331cd06255b421c5167ac467c885f89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===

Carbon monoxide has been proposed for use as a fuel on Mars. [[Carbon monoxide/oxygen engine]]s have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the [[atmosphere of Mars]] by [[zirconia]] [[electrolysis]], without using any [[Water on Mars|Martian water resources]] to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen-based fuel.&lt;ref name=landis2001&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Landis |title=Mars Rocket Vehicle Using In Situ Propellants |journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets |date=2001 |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=730–735 |doi=10.2514/2.3739 |bibcode = 2001JSpRo..38..730L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[blast furnace gas]] collected at the top of blast furnace, still contains some 10% to 30% of carbon monoxide, and is used as fuel on [[Cowper stove]]s and on Siemens-Martin furnaces on [[open hearth furnace|open hearth steelmaking]].
