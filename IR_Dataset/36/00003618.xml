'''Transportation in [[Botswana]]''' is provided by internal and extensive network of railways, highways, ferry services and air routes that criss-cross the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mupimpila|first=C|date=2010-09-30|title=Internalising the Externalities of Public Transport in Botswana|journal=Botswana Journal of Economics|volume=5|issue=7|doi=10.4314/boje.v5i7.60307|issn=1810-0163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All passenger services were discontinued in 2009, with the only remaining service being an international link to Zimbabwe from Francistown. Freight trains still operate. Passenger service was expected to resume in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Passenger train is coming back, Tue 09 Dec 2014, Mmegi Online,
http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?aid=47955&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger services were later re-introduced in March 2016. 

===Freight trains===
[[File:Botswana Rail Express train3.jpg|thumb|Freight Train of Botswana]]
Over half of BRs freight traffic is in coal, grain and [[intermodal freight]], and it also ships automative parts and assembled automobiles, sulphur, fertilizers, other chemicals, soda ash, forest products and other types of the commodities.

===Regional trains===
Botswana Railways run 2 nightly passenger trains, one from [[Lobatse]] to [[Francistown]], and the other from Francistown to Lobatse, with stops in [[Gaborone]], [[Mahalapye]], [[Palapye]], and [[Serule]]. The passenger train is termed the &quot;BR Express&quot; ([[Botswana Railways]]).

===Commuter/Suburban trains===
In Botswana, the ([[Botswana Railways]]) &quot;BR Express&quot; has a commuter train between [[Lobatse]] and [[Gaborone]]. The train is scheduled to depart in [[Lobatse]] at 0530hrs and arrive at [[Gaborone]] 0649hrs. This train return to [[Lobatse]] in the evening, well departing in [[Gaborone]] at 1800hrs. Arrival time at [[Lobatse]] is 1934hrs.

The train stops at [[Otse]], [[Ramotswa]] and Commerce Park Halt.

===BR Express Sleeping &amp; Dining Department===

[[File:BR Express Dining Department.jpg|thumb|BR Express Dining Department]]
The BR decided from the very beginning that it would operate its own [[sleeping cars]]. Bigger - sized berths and more comfortable surroundings were built. Providing and operating their own cars allowed better control of the service provided as well as revenue received, although profit was never a direct result of providing food to passengers. Rather, it was for those who could afford to travel great distances expected such facilities and favourable opinion would - well attracting others to Botswana and the BR's trains.

===Locomotives===

===Road Sign===

[[File:SACU road sign W208.svg|thumb|right|60px|Botswana's old &quot;caution curves&quot; sign]]

[[File:SADC road sign W209.svg|thumb|right|65px|New sign]]

Traditionally, [[road signs in Botswana]] used blue backgrounds rather than the yellow, white, or orange that the rest of the world uses on traffic [[warning sign]]s. In the early 2010s, officials announced plans to begin phasing out the distinctive blue signs in favor of more typical signs in order to be more in line with the neighboring [[Southern African Development Community]] member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://72.167.255.126/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=821&amp;dir=2011/December/Wednesday21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121129021003/http://72.167.255.126/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=821&amp;dir=2011/December/Wednesday21|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 29, 2012|title=Old road signs are being phased out|author=&quot;Mmegi Online&quot; staff writer Maranyane Ngwanaamotho|date=Dec 21, 2011|accessdate=Oct 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass Transit==
===Taxiscab===

[[File:Public transport in Gaborone.jpg|thumb|Kombi (Minibus taxi)]]

Minibus Taxis is also known as ''Kombi'' are the predominant form of transport for people in urban areas of Botswana and mostly of them they're found within cities, towns, major villages and even least populated areas.

They also have their own minibus station within that particular area, they only transport people within that specific area, and all of them they have different routes. This is due to their availability and affordability to the public.

Most minibus taxis they do not have depart time that's allocated by the state and mostly of them they have 15 seaters. Currently, they're owned by many minibus owners.

===Coach Bus===



Coach buses are used for longer-distance services within and even outside Botswana. They're normally operated by private companies and they're the only ones that have depart time that's allocated by the ministry of transport. 

All couch buses have different time for depart and they also have different routes, and they also have their couch bus stations all over Botswana.

Phase 2 of the NSC, still under construction, will duplicate the pipeline to carry water from the [[Dikgatlhong Dam]], which was completed in 2012.

A proposed extension to deliver water from the [[Zambezi]] would add another {{convert|500|to|520|km}} to the total pipeline length.

===Lesotho-Botswana Water Transport===
The Lesotho-Botswana Water Transfer is a project which is expected to provide Two Hundred Million Cubic Meters per year, to transfer water to the South-Eastern parts of Botswana is also ongoing.

The scheme involves the supply of water to [[Gaborone]] from [[Lesotho]] via a Six to Seven Hundred kilometer {{convert|600|to|700|km}} pipeline.

The project commenced on the 1 August, 2018 and is set for completion in June, 2020.

'''Proposed'''
