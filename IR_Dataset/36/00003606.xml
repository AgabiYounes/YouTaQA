{{Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The '''Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby [[executive power]] is exercised by the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Council of Ministers and the [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Members of the Parliamentary Assembly are chosen according to a [[proportional representation]] system.

The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The system of government established by the [[Dayton Accord]] is an example of [[consociationalism]], as representation is by elites who represent the country's three major [[ethnic group]]s termed ''constituent peoples'', with each having a guaranteed share of power.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into two ''Entities'' – the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska]], which are politically autonomous to an extent, as well as the district of [[Brčko District|Brčko]], which is jointly administered by both. The Entities have their own constitutions. {{Democracy Index rating|Bosnia and Herzegovina|hybrid regime|2019}}

== Dayton Agreement ==
Due to the [[Dayton Agreement]], signed on 14 December 1995, Bosnia and Herzegovina forms an [[Declaration (law)|undeclared]] [[protectorate]] with elements of [[hegemony]] by neighboring [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] as co-signatories to the Agreement, where highest power is given to the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The intention of the Agreement was to retain Bosnia's exterior border, while creating a joint multi-ethnic and democratic government based on proportional representation similar to the former socialist régime, and charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal policy.

The Dayton Agreement established the Office of the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] (OHR) to oversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the agreement. About 250 international and 450 local staff members are employed by the OHR.

== High Representative ==
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2014}}
{{main|High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief executive officer for the international civilian presence in the country. The High Representative has power to remove government officials, including court justices, local government members, members of parliament, etc. From its establishment, the Office of the High Representative has sacked 192 Bosnian and Herzegovinian officials. The mandate of the High Representatives derives from the Dayton Agreement, as confirmed by the [[Peace Implementation Council]], a body with a Steering Board composed of representatives of [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], the [[presidency of the European Union]], the [[European Commission]], and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]]. The Peace Implementation Council has established several criteria for the OHR to be closed, two of which have been completed but must be sustained until all five are completed.

== Executive branch ==
The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates amongst three members (a [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], a [[Serb]], and a [[Croat]]) every 8 months within their 4-year term. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people, with Federation voters electing both the Bosniak and the Croat member, and Republika Srpska voters electing the Serb member. The Presidency serves as a collective [[head of state]]. The Presidency is mainly responsible for the [[foreign policy]] and proposing the [[budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928053239/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/article.php?pid=833&amp;kat=518&amp;pkat=500|title=Constitution Rules of Court European Convention: Article V, Presidency|last=|first=|date=|website=CONSTITUTIONAL COURT OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928053239/http://www.ccbh.ba/eng/article.php?pid=833&amp;kat=518&amp;pkat=500|archive-date=28 September 2011|access-date=11 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2015/568324/EPRS_ATA(2015)568324_EN.pdf|title=At a glance: Bosnia and Herzegovina: Political Parties|last=|first=|date=September 2015|website=www.europal.europa.eu|publisher=|access-date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime Minister, formally titled [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He appoints the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Foreign Trade and other ministers as may be appropriate (no more than two thirds of the ministers may be appointed from the territory of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), who assume the office upon the approval by the House of Representatives; also, the Chair appoints deputy ministers (who may not be from the same constituent people as their ministers), who assume the office upon the approval by the House of Representatives.

The Council is responsible for carrying out policies and decisions in the fields of diplomacy, economy, inter-entity relations and other matters as agreed by the entities.

The two Entities have Governments that deal with internal matters not dealt with by the Council of Ministers.

== Judicial branch ==
=== Constitutional Court ===
The [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is the supreme, final arbiter of constitutional matters. The court is composed of nine members: four selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the People's Assembly of Republika Srpska, and three are foreign citizens appointed by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after courtesy-consultation with the Presidency.

The initial term of appointee is 5 years, unless they resign or are removed by consensus of other judges. Appointed judges are not eligible for reappointment. Judges subsequently appointed will serve until the age of 70, unless they resign sooner or are removed. Appointments made 5 years into the initial appointments may be governed by a different regulation for selection, to be determined by the Parliamentary Assembly.

Proceedings of the Court are public, and decisions are published. Court rules are adopted by a majority in the Court. Court decisions are final and supposedly binding though this is not always the case, as noted.&lt;ref name=court&gt;[http://www.vecernji.ba/postoje-82-odluke-ustavnog-suda-koje-jos-nisu-provedene-913109 Postoje 82 odluke Ustavnog suda koje još nisu provedene], Večernji list 3.1.2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitutional Court has jurisdiction over deciding in constitutional disputes that arise between the Entities or amongst Bosnia and Herzegovina and an Entity or Entities. Such disputes may be referred only by a member of the Presidency, the Chair of the Council of Ministers, the Chair or Deputy Chair of either of the chambers of the Parliamentary Assembly, or by one-fourth of the legislature of either Entity.

The Court also has appellate jurisdiction within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

=== State Court ===
The [[State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] consists of three divisions – Administrative, Appellate and Criminal – having jurisdiction over cases related to the state-level law and executive, as well as appellate jurisdiction over cases initiated in the entities.

A War Crimes Chamber was introduced in January 2005, and has adopted two cases transferred from the ICTY, as well as dozens of war crimes cases originally initiated in cantonal courts.

The State Court also deals with organized crime, and economic crime including corruption cases. For example, the former and 2014 member-elect of the Presidency [[Dragan Čović]] is currently on trial for alleged involvement in organized crime.

=== Human Rights Chamber ===
The [[Human Rights Chamber for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (''Dom za ljudska prava za Bosnu i Hercegovinu'') existed between March 1996 and 31 December 2003. It was a judicial body established under the Annex 6 to the [[General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] ([[Dayton Peace Agreement]]).

=== Entities ===
The two Entities have Supreme Courts. Each entity also has a number of lower courts. There are 10 cantonal courts in the Federation, along with a number of municipal courts. The Republika Srpska has five municipal courts.
