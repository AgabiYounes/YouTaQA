{{Politics of Burkina Faso}}
[[Burkina Faso]] has good relations with the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;[https://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/burkina-faso_en/4352/Burkina%20Faso%20and%20the%20EU Delegation of European Union to Burkina Faso Webpage.]&lt;/ref&gt; African&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/africa/bf-forrel.htm Global Security Article on Burkina Faso's Foreign relations.]&lt;/ref&gt; and certain Asian countries. France, the former colonial power, in particular, continues to provide significant aid and supports [[Blaise Compaoré|Compaoré's]] developing role as a regional powerbroker.

According to the U.S. State Department, &quot;[[Burkina Faso-United States relations|U.S. relations with Burkina Faso]] are good but subject to strains in the past because of the Compaoré government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{StateDept |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2834.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burkina Faso cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in May 2018 ([[Timeline of diplomatic relations of the Republic of China|being the most populous state to do so in the 21st century]]) and the foreign ministry of China stated it approved of its decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/24/burkina-faso-cuts-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-intense-pressure-china/|title=Burkina Faso cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan after intense pressure from China|author=Our Foreign Staff|date=2018-05-24|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2147644/burkina-faso-cuts-diplomatic-ties-taiwan|title=Taiwan ‘won’t tolerate Beijing’s actions’ after it loses another ally|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the coming to power of [[Thomas Sankara]] in Burkina Faso in 1983, relations between Ghana and Burkina became both warm and close. Indeed, [[Jerry Rawlings|Rawlings]] and Sankara began discussions about uniting Ghana and Burkina in the manner of the defunct [[Ghana-Guinea-Mali Union]], which Nkrumah had sought unsuccessfully to promote as a foundation for his dream of unified continental government. Political and economic ties between Ghana and Burkina, a poorer country, were strengthened through joint commissions of cooperation and through border demarcation committee meetings. Frequent high-level consultations and joint military exercises, meant to discourage potential dissidents and to protect young &quot;revolutions&quot; in each country, were fairly regular features of Ghana-Burkina relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;cs&quot;&gt;Owusu, Maxwell. &quot;Burkina&quot;.

When [[Thomas Sankara]] came to power in 1983 relations between Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast became hostile as [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] was threatened by Sankara's revolutionary regime. That was one of the main reasons why [[Blaise Compaore]] launched his coup in 1987 killing Sankara and making himself president. Under [[Blaise Compaore]] Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso reestablished good relations and both countries supported [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]]'s [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] in their overthrow of [[Samuel Doe]]. They remain allies and are active trading partners.

Diplomatic relations between Burkina Faso and the Soviet Union were established for the first time on February 18, 1967. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, Burkina Faso recognized Russia as the USSR's successor. However financial reasons has shut the embassies between the two nations. In 1992, the embassy of the Russian Federation in [[Ouagadougou]] was closed, and in 1996, the embassy of Burkina Faso in Moscow was closed. Burkina Faso has since re-opened its embassy in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mid.ru/en/maps/bf/?currentpage=main-country Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Burkina Faso]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations are good but subject to strains in the past because of the [[Blaise Compaoré|Compaoré]] government's past involvement in arms trading and other sanctions-breaking activity. In addition to regional peace and stability, U.S. interests in Burkina are to promote continued [[democratization]] and greater respect for human rights and to encourage sustainable economic development. Although the [[Agency for International Development]] (USAID) closed its office in [[Ouagadougou]] in 1995, about $18&amp;nbsp;million annually of USAID funding goes to Burkina's development through non-governmental and regional organizations. The largest is a [[Food for Peace]] school lunch program administered by [[Catholic Relief Services]]. Burkina has been the site of several development success stories. U.S. leadership in building food security in the [[Sahel]] after the 1968–74 drought has been successful in virtually eliminating famine, despite recurrent drought years. [[River blindness]] has been eliminated from the region. In both cases, the U.S. was the main donor to inter-African organizations headquartered in Ouagadougou which through sustained efforts have achieved and consolidated these gains. In 2005, Burkina Faso and the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] (MCC) signed a $12&amp;nbsp;million Threshold Country Program to build schools and increase girls' enrollment rates. In November 2005, the Millennium Challenge Corporation selected Burkina Faso as eligible to submit a proposal for Millennium Challenge Account assistance for fiscal year 2006, making it one of only two countries eligible for threshold as well as compact funding. The Government of Burkina Faso is working closely with MCC staff to finalize its compact submission.
