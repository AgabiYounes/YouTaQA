The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] is responsible for managing the '''foreign relations of Brazil'''. [[Brazil]] is a significant political and [[economic power]] in Latin America and a key player on the world stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/south-america/brazil?profile=intRelations&amp;pg=4 Country Profile: Brazil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524124435/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/south-america/brazil?profile=intRelations&amp;pg=4 |date=2011-05-24 }} UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

Between World War II and 1990, both [[democratic government|democratic]] and [[Military dictatorship|military]] governments sought to expand Brazil's influence in the world by pursuing a state-led [[industrial policy]] and an independent foreign policy. Brazilian foreign policy has recently aimed to strengthen ties with other South American countries, engage in multilateral diplomacy through the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]], and act at times as a countervailing force to U.S. political and economic influence in Latin America.

==Overview==
Brazil's international relations are based on article 4 of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Federal Constitution]], which establishes [[Non-interventionism|non-intervention]], [[self-determination]], [[Internationalism (politics)|international cooperation]] and the [[Peacebuilding|peaceful settlement of conflicts]] as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v-brazil.com/government/laws/titleI.html Article 4 of the Federal Constitution of Brazil] V-Brazil.

The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Brazil)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], also known as Itamaraty, is the government department responsible for advising the President and conducting Brazil's foreign relations with other countries and international bodies. Itamaraty's scope includes political, commercial, economic, financial, cultural and consular relations, areas in which it performs the classical tasks of diplomacy: represent, inform and negotiate. Foreign policy priorities are established by the President.

Brazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's unique position as a [[regional power]] in Latin America, a leader among [[Developing country|developing countries]], and an emerging [[world power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/news/docs/RL33456.pdf U.S. Congressional Report on Brazil] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710013700/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/news/docs/RL33456.pdf |date=2009-07-10 }} [[United States Congress]]. Retrieved on 2009-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of [[multilateralism]], peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Georges D. Landau, &quot;The Decision-making Process in Foreign Policy: The Case of Brazil,&quot; Center for Strategic and International Studies: Washington DC: March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil engages in multilateral [[diplomacy]] through the Organization of American States and the United Nations, and has increased ties with developing countries in Africa and Asia. Brazil is currently commanding a multinational U.N. stabilization force in Haiti, the [[MINUSTAH]]. Instead of pursuing unilateral prerogatives, Brazilian foreign policy has tended to emphasize regional integration, first through the [[Mercosur|Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosul)]] and now the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Brazil is also committed to cooperation with other Portuguese-speaking nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilemb.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=144&amp;Itemid=133|title=Brasilemb.org|author=|date=|website=www.brasilemb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; through joint-collaborations with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world, in several domains which include military cooperation, financial aid, and cultural exchange. This is done in the framework of [[CPLP]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cplp.org/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; for instance.

Brazil's political, business, and military ventures are complemented by the country's [[trade policy]]. In Brazil, the [[Ministry of Foreign Relations of Brazil|Ministry of Foreign Relations]] continues to dominate trade policy, causing the country's commercial interests to be (at times) subsumed by a larger foreign policy goal, namely, enhancing Brazil's influence in Latin America and the world.&lt;ref&gt;''CRS Report RL33258, Brazilian Trade Policy and the United States'', by J. F. Hornbeck&lt;/ref&gt; For example, while concluding meaningful trade agreements with [[developed countries]] (such as the United States and the [[European Union]]) would probably be beneficial to Brazil's long-term economic self-interest, the Brazilian government has instead prioritized its leadership role within Mercosul and expanded trade ties with countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

Brazil's [[soft power]] diplomacy involves institutional strategies such as the formation of diplomatic coalitions to constrain the [[Power (politics)|power]] of the established [[great power]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RBPI&quot;&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-73292010000100008&amp;script=sci_arttext Brazil in the BRIC initiative: soft balancing in the shifting world order?] Revista Brasileira de Política Internacional.

The Brazilian foreign policy under the [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula da Silva]] administration focused on the following directives: to contribute toward the search for greater equilibrium and attenuate [[unilateralism]]; to strengthen [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] relations in order to increase the country's weight in political and economic negotiations on an international level; to deepen relations so as to benefit from greater economical, financial, technological and cultural interchange; to avoid agreements that could jeopardize development in the long term.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESP&quot;&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/8/0/4/5/pages180452/p180452-1.php Lula da Silva’s Foreign Policy: The Autonomy through Diversification Strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830113935/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/8/0/4/5/pages180452/p180452-1.php |date=2009-08-30 }} Vigevani, Tullo; Cepaluni, Gabriel.

These directives implied precise emphasis on: the search for political coordination with [[Newly industrialized country|emerging]] and [[Developing country|developing countries]], namely India, South Africa, Russia and China; creation of the [[Union of South American Nations]] and its derivative bodies, such as the South American Security Council; strengthening of [[Mercosul]]; projection at the [[Doha Development Round|Doha Round]] and [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]; maintenance of relations with [[developed country|developed countries]], including the United States; undertaking and narrowing of relations with African countries; campaign for the [[reform of the United Nations Security Council]] and for a permanent seat for Brazil; and defense of social objectives allowing for a greater equilibrium between the States and populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNESP&quot;/&gt;

The foreign policy of the [[Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff]] administration sought to deepen Brazil's regional commercial dominance and diplomacy, expand Brazil's presence in Africa, and play a major role in the [[G-20 major economies|G20]] on [[global warming]] and in other multilateral settings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/brazil/brazils-rousseff-continuity-tests/p23282 Brazil's Rousseff: Continuity and Tests] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105135451/http://www.cfr.org/brazil/brazils-rousseff-continuity-tests/p23282 |date=2011-11-05 }} Sweig, Julia E.

===Post-Workers Party administration===
After [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff's impeachment]], Brazil started reconnecting with its western allies. When [[Jair Bolsonaro]] succeeded [[Michel Temer]], the Brazilian foreign policy focused on a rapprochement with right-wing governments like the [[United States]] and [[Colombia]] in the [[Americas]]; [[Israel]], [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] in [[Asia]]; [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]] in [[Europe]]. The [[Brazil–Portugal relations]] were also strengthened, and despite disagreements over the [[crisis in Venezuela]], Brazil remained close with the BRICS countries.

|{{flag|Argentina }}||&lt;!--Date started--&gt;||See [[Argentina–Brazil relations]]
After democratization, a strong integration and partnership began between the two countries. In 1985 they signed the basis for the [[MERCOSUL]], a Regional Trade Agreement. In the field of science, the two regional giants had been rivals since the 1950s when both governments launched parallel nuclear and space programs, however, several agreements were signed since then such as the creation of the [[Brazilian–Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials]] (ABACC) to verify both countries' pledges to use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. National spaces agencies [[CONAE]] and the [[Brazilian Space Agency|AEB]] had also begun working together since the 1990s. Brazil's decision to prevent a Royal Navy ship docking in Rio de Janeiro was seen as backing Argentina over the Falklands dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/brazil/8251700/Britains-isolation-on-Falklands-grows-with-anti-colonial-Brazil-snub.html|title=Britain's isolation on Falklands grows with 'anti-colonial' Brazil snub|first=by Robin|last=Yapp|date=22 May 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also on the military side there has been greater rapprochement. In accordance with the friendship policy, both armies dissolved or moved major units previously located at their common border (for example, [[Argentine Army|Argentine]]'s 7th Jungle and 3rd Motorized Infantry Brigades). Brazilian soldiers are embedded in the Argentine [[peacekeeping]] contingent at [[UNFICYP]] in [[Cyprus]] and they are working together at [[MINUSTAH]] in [[Haiti]] and, as another example of collaboration, [[Argentine Navy]] aircraft routinely operate from the [[Brazilian Navy]] carrier [[NAe São Paulo]].
