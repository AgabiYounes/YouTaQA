'''[[Bulgaria]]''' is a country situated in [[Southeast Europe]] and occupies the eastern quarter of the [[Balkans|Balkan]] peninsula, being the largest country within its geographic boundaries. It is bordering [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[North Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. The northern border with Romania follows the river [[Danube]] until the city of [[Silistra]]. The land area of Bulgaria is {{convert|110994&lt;ref name=&quot;Penin&quot;/&gt;|km2}} ({{convert|111002&lt;ref name=&quot;Penin&quot;/&gt;|km2}}), slightly larger than that of [[Iceland]] or the U.S. state of [[Tennessee]]. Considering its relatively small size, Bulgaria has a great variety of topographical features. Even within small parts of the country, the land may be divided into plains, plateaus, hills, mountains, basins, gorges, and deep river valleys. The [[geographic center of Bulgaria]] is located in [[Uzana (Bulgaria)|Uzana]].

Bulgaria features notable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped peaks in [[Rila]], [[Pirin]] and the [[Balkan Mountains]] to the mild and sunny [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast|Black Sea coast]]; from the typically [[continental climate|continental]] [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]] (ancient [[Moesia]]) in the north to the strong [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climatic influence]] in the valleys of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and in the lowlands in the southernmost of [[Thrace]], the lowest parts of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]], along the [[Maritsa]] River, the Southern [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]]. Most of the country is situated within the [[humid continental climate]] region, with [[Alpine climate]] in the highest mountains and [[subtropical climate]] in the southernmost regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|pp=55, 59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has a dense river network but with the notable exception of the river Danube, they are mostly short and with low water flow.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev68&quot;/&gt; The average annual precipitation is 670&amp;nbsp;mm; the rainfall is lower in the lowlands and higher in the mountains. The driest region is [[Dobrudzha]] in the north-eastern part of the Danubian Plain (450&amp;nbsp;mm), while the highest rainfall has been measured in the upper valley of the river [[Ogosta]] in the western Balkan Mountains (2293&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|pp=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgaria has substantial land in agriculture and forest. In 2006 [[land use]] and [[land cover]] was 5% intensive human use, 52% agriculture including pasture, 31% forest, 11% woodland-shrub, grassland, and non-vegetated, and 1% water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2007_17|title=European Union Project CORINE, &quot;CLC2006 technical guidelines&quot;|date=18 December 2007 |accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bulgaria straddles the [[Illyria]]n and [[Euxinia]]n provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. The country falls within six terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s of the [[Palearctic ecozone]]: [[Balkan mixed forests]] (main), [[Rodope montane mixed forests]] (main in the [[List of mountains in Bulgaria|mountains]]), [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests]], [[Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests]], [[East European forest steppe]] and [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ecoregions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/178214/|title=Ecoregions of Bulgaria|publisher=The Encyclopedia of Earth|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boundaries and territory ==
The borders of Bulgaria have a total length of 1,867&amp;nbsp;km; of them 1,181&amp;nbsp;km are land boundary and 686&amp;nbsp;km are formed by rivers. The coastline is 378&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;borders&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geografia.kabinata.com/01.htm|title=Geographic Position and Borders of Bulgaria|website=Topics of Geography of Bulgaria|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern border with [[Romania]] is 609&amp;nbsp;km. Most of the frontier (470&amp;nbsp;km) is formed by the river Danube from the mouth of the river [[Timok (river)|Timok]] in the west to the city of [[Silistra]] in the east. The land border from Silistra to Cape Sivriburun at the [[Black Sea]] is 139&amp;nbsp;km long.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev16&quot;/&gt; The Danube, with steep bluffs on the Bulgarian side and a wide area of swamps and marshes on the Romanian side, is crossed by two bridges&amp;nbsp;– [[New Europe Bridge]] between [[Vidin]] and [[Calafat]], and [[Danube Bridge]] between [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] and [[Giurgiu]]. There are 48 Bulgarian and 32 Romanian islands along the river Danube; the largest one, [[Belene]] (41&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), belongs to Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land frontier has three border crossings at Silistra, [[Kardam, Dobrich Province|Kardam]] and [[Durankulak]] at the Black Sea. It is also crossed by a major gas pipeline transporting natural gas from Russia to Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev18&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:Kadiitsa IMG 9979.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=a river|A winter view of the [[Vlahina]] Mountain near the border with North Macedonia]]
The eastern border (378&amp;nbsp;km) is maritime and encompasses the [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] from Cape Sivriburun in the north to the mouth of the [[Rezovo River]] in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev18&quot;/&gt; Bulgaria's littoral forms 1/10 of the total Black Sea coastline, and includes two important gulfs, the [[Gulf of Varna]] and the [[Gulf of Burgas]], harbouring the country's two major ports.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev18&quot;/&gt;

The southern border is 752&amp;nbsp;km long, of them 259&amp;nbsp;km are with [[Turkey]] and 493&amp;nbsp;km are with [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=&quot;borders&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev19&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgaria–Turkey frontier runs from the mouth of the Rezovo River in the east through the [[Strandzha]] Mountains and the [[Dervent Heights]], crosses the river [[Tundzha]] at the village of [[Matochina]] and ends at the river [[Maritsa]] at the village of [[Kapitan Andreevo]]. There are three border crossings at [[Malko Tarnovo]], [[Lesovo]] and Kapitan Andreevo.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev19&quot;/&gt; The border with Greece runs from Kapitan Andreevo through several ridges of the [[Rhodope Mountains]], generally following the watershed of the rivers [[Arda (Maritsa)|Arda]] and [[Vacha (river)|Vacha]] on the Bulgarian side, runs through the [[Slavyanka (mountain)|Slavyanka Mountain]], crosses the river [[Struma (river)|Struma]] at the village of [[Kulata]] and runs through the crest of the [[Belasica|Belasitsa Mountain]] to the [[Tumba Peak (Belasica)|Tumba Peak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev19&quot;/&gt; There are six border checkpoints at [[Svilengrad]], [[Ivaylovgrad]], [[Makaza]], [[Zlatograd]], [[Ilinden, Blagoevgrad Province|Ilinden]] and Kulata.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev19&quot;/&gt;

The western border is 506&amp;nbsp;km long, of them 165&amp;nbsp;km are with [[North Macedonia]] and 341&amp;nbsp;km are with [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;borders&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev20&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frontier with North Macedonia runs from the Tumba Peak in the south through the mountains of [[Ograzhden (mountain)|Ograzhden]], [[Maleshevo Mountain|Maleshevo]], [[Vlahina]] and [[Osogovo]] up to mount Kitka. There are three border crossings near the town of [[Petrich]] and at the villages of [[Logodazh]] and [[Gyueshevo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev20&quot;/&gt; The border with Serbia runs from Kitka through the mountainous region Kraishte, including the [[Ruy Mountain]], crosses the valley of the river [[Nišava|Nishava]], runs through the main watershed of the western [[Balkan Mountains]] and follows the river [[Timok (river)|Timok]] for 15&amp;nbsp;km until its confluence with the Danube.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev20&quot;/&gt; There are five border checkpoints at [[Dolno Uyno]], [[Strezimirovci|Strezimirovtsi]], [[Kalotina]], [[Vrashka Chuka]] and [[Bregovo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev20&quot;/&gt;

== Topography ==
[[File:MontañasDeBulgaria.svg|thumb|250px|alt=a map|Topographic map of Bulgaria highlighting the main mountain ranges]]
The [[Terrain|relief]] of Bulgaria is varied. In the relatively small territory of the country there are extensive lowlands, plains, hills, low and high mountains, many valleys and deep gorges.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main characteristic of Bulgaria's topography is four alternating bands of high and low terrain that extend east to west across the country. From north to south, those bands, called [[geomorphological]] regions, are the [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]], the [[Balkan Mountains]], the Transitional region and the [[Rila|Rilo]]-[[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] region. The easternmost sections near the [[Black Sea]] are hilly, but they gradually gain height to the west until the westernmost part of the country is entirely high ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev25&quot;/&gt;

More than two-thirds of the country is plains, plateaus, or hilly land at an altitude less than 600&amp;nbsp;m. Plains (below 200&amp;nbsp;m) make up 31% of the land, plateaus and hills (200 to 600&amp;nbsp;m) 41%, low mountains (600 to 1,000&amp;nbsp;m) 10%, medium-high mountains (1,000 to 1,500&amp;nbsp;m) 10%, and high mountains (over 1,500&amp;nbsp;m) 3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev26&quot;/&gt; The average altitude of Bulgaria is 470&amp;nbsp;m.

The contemporary relief of Bulgaria is a result of continuous geological evolution. The Bulgarian lands were often submerged by ancient seas and lakes, some land layers rose others sank. [[Volcanic eruption]]s were common both on land and in the water basins.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev26&quot;/&gt; All three main groups of rocks, [[magmatic rocks|magmatic]], [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]], are found in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev25&quot;/&gt; The oldest rock formations in Bulgaria date from the [[Precambrian]] period than 500&amp;nbsp;million years ago. During the [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] eras (4.0&amp;nbsp;billion to 252&amp;nbsp;million years ago) the magmatic rocks were formed. Throughout most of that period the only land areas were Rila, Pirin and the western Rhodope Mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mesozoic]] era (252&amp;nbsp;million to 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago) saw the beginning of the [[Alpine orogeny]] that has formed the mountain ranges of the [[Alpide belt]], including the Balkan Mountains and [[Sredna Gora]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev27&quot;/&gt; The [[Cenozoic]] era (since 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago) is characterized with active tectonic processes, the definitive formation of the Balkan Mountains, the formation of [[graben]]s and [[Horst (geology)|horsts]] in Rila, Pirin and Kraishte region.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev27&quot;/&gt;

[[Exogeny|Exogenous processes]] such as [[weathering]], [[erosion]] and [[sedimentation]] have an important impact on modelling the land surface and creating rock formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exogenous processes have formed [[Stone run|stone rivers]] in Vitosha; [[scree]]s in the Balkan Mountains, Rila and Pirin; [[Hoodoo (geology)|earth pyramids]] in [[Melnik, Bulgaria|Melnik]], [[Stob (village)|Stob]] and Katina; [[landslide]]s, mainly along the Danube banks and the northern Black Sea coast; [[fluvial terrace]]s; [[Aeolian processes|aeolian forms]], such as [[dune]]s; [[karst]] forms, including numerous caves, [[sinkhole]]s, [[ponor]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]] encompasses the Moesian plate and extends from the river Timok in the west to the Black Sea in the east and from the river [[Danube]] in the north to the Balkan Mountains in the south, covering 31,520&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or almost 1/3 of Bulgaria's total area.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|pp=34, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its width varies from 25–30&amp;nbsp;km in the west to 120&amp;nbsp;km in the east. The highest point is Tarnov Dyal (502&amp;nbsp;m) on the [[Shumen Plateau]]; the average altitude is 178&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev92&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the rock weathering processes the relief is uneven with fertile [[alluvial plain]]s along the Danube (Vidinska, Chernopolska, [[Zlatia (region)|Zlatia]], Belenska, Pobrezhie, Aidemirska), and hilly terrain in the remaining area, including plateaus in the east. The altitude rises from west to east. The valleys of the rivers [[Vit]] and [[Yantra River|Yantra]] divide the Danubian Plain into three parts&amp;nbsp;– western, central and eastern.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev92&quot;/&gt; The topography of the plain is characterized with hilly heights and plateaus. Most of the heights and all plateaus are situated in the eastern parts. There are 14 [[basalt]] mounds between [[Svishtov]] and the village of [[Dragomirovo, Veliko Tarnovo Province|Dragomirovo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predominant soil types are [[loess]] in the north, reaching a depth of up to 100&amp;nbsp;m at the banks of the Danube, and [[chernozem]] in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev93&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate is [[Temperate climate|temperate]]. The flat relief and the openness of plain to the north facilitate arrival of moist air masses in spring, summer and autumn. In winter the Danubian Plain falls under the influence of the Eastern European anticyclone, which brings cold Arctic air masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev93&quot;/&gt; The mean temperature in January is −1&amp;nbsp;°C and in July is 24&amp;nbsp;°C, making it the geomorphological region with the highest average annual amplitude in Bulgaria&amp;nbsp;– 25&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev93&quot;/&gt;

=== Balkan Mountains ===
[[File:Panorama Ray hut &amp; Botev peak.jpg|thumb|right|540px|alt=a mountain|A view of the central Balkan Mountains]]
The [[Balkan Mountains]] range is a geological continuation of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], forming part of the [[Alpide belt|Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt]]. This region is subdivided into two geomorphological units, the Pre-Balkan and the Balkan Mountains, also known in Bulgarian as ''Стара Планина''&amp;nbsp;– &quot;Old Mountain&quot;. Their average altitude is 370&amp;nbsp;m and 735&amp;nbsp;m, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev34&quot;/&gt; Its total area is 26,720&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, of them the Pre-Balkan spans 15,730&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the Balkan Mountains&amp;nbsp;– almost 11,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev100&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain range stretches from the valley of the river Timok in the west to [[Cape Emine]] at the Black Sea coast in the east, spanning a length of 555&amp;nbsp;km and width between 20 and 70&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev99&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Balkan Mountains are divided into western, central and eastern part by the [[Zlatitsa Pass|Zlatitsa]] and [[Vratnik Pass (Bulgaria)|Vratnik Pass]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev100&quot;/&gt; The range is highest in its central part, which includes [[Botev Peak]] at 2,376&amp;nbsp;m; the altitude drops slowly to the east until it reaches the sea. The relief is varied, with many mountain passes, gorges and landforms. The southern slopes are steeper than the northern.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev34&quot;/&gt; For the most part the Balkan Range defines the most important watershed in Bulgaria with rivers draining north to the Danube or south to the river [[Maritsa]] and the [[Aegean Sea]]. Several rivers in the east drain directly into the Black Sea. In the west, the river [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]] forms a [[Iskar Gorge|65-km long gorge]] that runs north through the mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev100&quot;/&gt;

=== Transitional region ===
[[File:Rose Valey Bulgaria 01.JPG|thumb|left|250px|alt=a valley with roses|The Rose Valley]]
The Transitional geomorphological region encompasses the territory between the Balkan Mountains and the Rilo-Rhodope Massif and has complex, mosaic relief composed mainly of medium-high and low mountains, valleys and plains. The altitude decreases from west to east.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This region includes the [[Sub-Balkan valleys]]; the mountains and valleys of the Kraishte region, such as [[Ruy Mountain]], [[Miloslavska planina]] and [[Milevska Planina]]; the mountains [[Lyulin Mountain|Lyulin]], [[Vitosha]], [[Sredna Gora]], [[Strandzha]] and [[Sakar Mountain|Sakar]]; the [[Dervent Heights]]; as well as the fertile [[Upper Thracian Plain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev35&quot;/&gt; The highest point is [[Cherni Vrah]] in Vitosha at 2,290&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev35&quot;/&gt;

The Sub-Balkan valleys include nine valleys, situated between the Balkan Mountains in the north and Vitosha and Sredna Gora in the south. With an area of 1,186&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and an average altitude of 550&amp;nbsp;m, [[Sofia Valley]] is the largest of the nine and contains the nation's capital, [[Sofia]]. The [[Rose Valley, Bulgaria|Rose Valley]] encompasses the valleys of [[Karlovo]] and [[Kazanlak]] and is renowned for its [[Rosa × damascena|rose-growing industry]], which has been thriving there for centuries, producing 85% of the world's [[rose oil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donchev 2004 107&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kazanlak Valley is also known as the [[The Valley of the Thracian Rulers|Valley of the Thracian Kings]] due to the extremely high concentration and variety of monuments of the [[Thracians|Thracian culture]].

Srednogorie region stretches between the Sub-Balkan valleys in the north and the Rilo-Rhodope Massif in the south and from west to east includes the mountains [[Zavalska Mountain|Zavalska]], [[Viskyar Mountain|Viskyar]], Lyulin, Vitosha, [[Plana Mountain|Plana]] and Sredna Gora. The largest of these, Sredna Gora, is 280&amp;nbsp;km and reaches a maximum width of 50&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donchev 2004 107&quot;/&gt; Kraishte region covers the western parts of the Transitional geomorphological region and consists of two almost parallel mountain groups, Ruysko–Verilska and Konyavsko–Milevska, as well as numerous valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Upper Thracian Plain encompasses the middle valley of the river [[Maritsa]] and has a roughly triangular shape, situated between Sredna Gora in the north, the Rhodope Mountains in the south and Sakar Mountain in the east. The lowland is 180&amp;nbsp;km long and up to 50&amp;nbsp;km wide, spanning an area of 6,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the east are located the Burgas Plain, Svetliyski Heights, Manastirski Heights, Dervent Heights, and the low mountains Sakar and Strandzha.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rilo-Rhodope geomorphological region covers the south-western regions of Bulgaria and includes the [[Rhodope Mountains]], [[Rila]], [[Pirin]], [[Osogovo]], [[Vlahina]], [[Maleshevo Mountain|Maleshevo]], [[Ograzhden (mountain)|Ograzhden]], [[Slavyanka (mountain)|Slavyanka]] and [[Belasica|Belasitsa]], as well as the valleys of the rivers [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and [[Nestos (river)|Mesta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev35&quot;/&gt; The Rhodopes are the most extensive mountain range in Bulgaria, spanning an area of 14,730&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with an average altitude of 785&amp;nbsp;m, characterized with gentle and densely forested slopes. Their length from west to east is 249&amp;nbsp;km and reach width of 100&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The altitude decreases from west to east.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev35&quot;/&gt;

To the west are located Rila and Pirin, Bulgaria's two highest mountains. Rila includes [[Musala|Mount Musala]], whose 2,925&amp;nbsp;m peak is the highest in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]], while Pirin's highest peak [[Vihren]] at 2,915&amp;nbsp;m is the third-highest in the Balkans. Both Rila and Pirin have rocky peaks, stony slopes, extensive [[Alpine tundra|Alpine zone]] and hundreds [[glacial lake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further west is the Osogovo–Belasitsa mountain group along the border with North Macedonia, whose highest peak is [[Ruen (peak)|Ruen]] in Osogovo at 2,251&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black Sea coast ===
[[File:Ropotamo beach.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=coastline|The coastline at the river [[Ropotamo]]]]
The [[Bulgarian Black Sea Coast]] has a total length of 378&amp;nbsp;km from [[Durankulak]] in the north to the mouth of the river [[Rezovska River|Rezovska]] in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev146&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northernmost section between the Bulgarian-Romanian border to [[Shabla]] has extensive sandy beaches and several coastal lakes, then the elevation rises as the coast reaches Cape [[Kaliakra]], with 70&amp;nbsp;m high vertical cliffs. Near [[Balchik]] and [[Kavarna]] the limestone rocky coast is cut by wooded valleys. The landscape around the coast resorts of [[Albena]] and [[Golden Sands]] is hilly, with a clearly expressed landslides. Dense forests at the mouth of the river [[Batova]] mark the beginning of Frangensko plateau. South of [[Varna]] the coastline is densely wooded, especially at the alluvial longose groves of the [[Kamchia (biosphere reserve)|Kamchia Biosphere Reserve]]. [[Cape Emine]] marks the end of the Balkan Mountain and divides the Bulgarian Black Sea coast in northern and southern parts. The southern section has wide and long beaches, with a number of small bays and headlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev146&quot;/&gt; All Bulgarian Black Sea islands are situated in the southern coast: [[St. Anastasia Island|St. Anastasia]], [[St. Cyricus Island|St. Cyricus]], [[St. Ivan Island|St. Ivan]], [[St. Peter Island|St. Peter]] and [[St. Thomas Island|St. Thomas]]. Sandy beaches occupy 34% of the Bulgarian coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most important gulf are the [[Gulf of Varna]] in the north and the [[Gulf of Burgas]] in the south, which is the largest in the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev146&quot;/&gt;

Considering its relatively small area, Bulgaria has variable and complex climate. The country occupies the southernmost part of the [[continental climate|continental climatic zone]], with small areas in the south falling within the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climatic zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continental zone is predominant, because continental air masses flow easily into the unobstructed [[Danubian Plain (Bulgaria)|Danubian Plain]]. The continental influence, stronger during the winter, produces abundant snowfall; the Mediterranean influence increases during the second half of summer and produces hot and dry weather. Bulgaria is subdivided into five climatic zones: continental zone (Danubian Plain, Pre-Balkan and the higher valleys of the Transitional geomorphological region); transitional zone (Upper Thracian Plain, most of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the lower Sub-Balkan valleys); continental-Mediterranean zone (the southernmost areas of the Struma and Mesta valleys, the eastern Rhodope Mountains, Sakar and Strandzha); Black Sea zone along the coastline with an average length of 30–40&amp;nbsp;km inland; and alpine zone in the mountains above 1000&amp;nbsp;m altitude (central Balkan Mountains, Rila, Pirin, Vitosha, western Rhodope Mountains, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}
Despite the large distance, the most important climate-forming factor is the Atlantic Ocean through the atmospheric circulation of the [[Icelandic Low|Icelandic cyclone]] and the [[Azores High|Azores anticyclone]], which bring cool and rainy weather in summer and relatively mild weather with abundant snowfall in winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geografia.kabinata.com/04.htm|title=Climate of Bulgaria|website=Topics of Geography of Bulgaria|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is strongest in the southern parts of Bulgaria, mainly through the Mediterranean cyclones. Due to its small area, the influence of the [[Black Sea]] only affects a 30–40&amp;nbsp;km long strip along the coastline, mainly in summer, when the daily [[Sea breeze|breeze circulation]] is most pronounced.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev54&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important factor is the relief. The Bulgarian mountains and valleys act as barriers or channels for air masses, causing sharp contrasts in weather over relatively short distances. The Balkan Mountains form a barrier which effectively stops the cool air masses coming from the north and the warm masses from the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev54&quot;/&gt; The barrier effect of the Balkan Mountains is felt throughout the country: on the average, northern Bulgaria is about one degree cooler and receives about 192&amp;nbsp;mm more rain than lowlands of southern Bulgaria. The Rilo-Rhodope Massif bars the warm Mediterranean air masses and limits the Mediterranean influence to the southern valleys of the rivers Struma, Mesta, Maritsa and Tundzha, despite the close proximity of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev54&quot;/&gt;

The mean annual temperature in Bulgaria is 10.6&amp;nbsp;°C and varies from 2.9&amp;nbsp;°C at the nation's highest peak Musala to 13.9&amp;nbsp;°C at the town of [[Sandanski]] in the southern Struma valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev55&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average temperature in the Danubian Plain is 11.4&amp;nbsp;°C, in the Upper Thracian Plain 13.9&amp;nbsp;°C, in the lower mountains 8.1&amp;nbsp;°C and in the higher mountains&amp;nbsp;2.4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev55&quot;/&gt; The highest absolute temperature was measured at the town of [[Sadovo]] in 1916&amp;nbsp; 45.2&amp;nbsp;°C; the lowest absolute temperature was measured at the town of [[Tran, Bulgaria|Tran]] in 1947 –38.3&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev55&quot;/&gt; The highest temperature in the lowlands and the hilly regions is in June, while in the higher mountains the warmest month is August. The lowest temperature is measured in January and February, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev55&quot;/&gt; Many valleys experience regular [[Inversion (meteorology)|temperature inversions]] and fogs in winter. The country's lowest absolute temperature was measured during an inversion in the Tran valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev54&quot;/&gt;

The average [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in Bulgaria is about 670&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is uneven in terms of seasons and territory. In northern Bulgaria the highest precipitation is in May–June, while in southern Bulgaria it is in winter. The average amount of precipitation also varies in term of altitude&amp;nbsp;– from 450–850&amp;nbsp;mm in the plains to 850–1200&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev58&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest mean precipitation is in the eastern part of [[Dobrudzha]] and the Burgas Plain (450&amp;nbsp;mm) and in the area between [[Plovdiv]] and [[Pazardzhik]] (500&amp;nbsp;mm); the highest rainfall falls in the mountains&amp;nbsp;– the [[Petrohan Pass]] in the western Balkan Mountains and [[Zlatograd]] in the Rhodope Mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev58&quot;/&gt; The highest annual rainfall was measured in 1957 in the upper valley of the river [[Ogosta]] in the western Balkan Mountains (2293&amp;nbsp;mm); the highest daily rainfall was recorded at [[Saints Constantine and Helena, Bulgaria|Saints Constantine and Helena resort]] (342&amp;nbsp;mm) near [[Varna]] in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev58&quot;/&gt; The total annual amount of the rainfall is 74&amp;nbsp;billion km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; of them 70% evaporate, 20% flow into the rivers and 10% soak into the soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev58&quot;/&gt; Most of the country is affected by droughts in June and August. The snow cover lasts from 20–30 days in the lowlands to 9 months in the highest mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev58&quot;/&gt;

== Hydrography ==
[[File:Bulgaria drainage divide.svg|thumb|250px|Map of drainage systems and drainage divide in Bulgaria]]
Bulgaria has a dense network of about 540 rivers, but with the notable exception of the [[Danube]], most have short length and low water-level. The density is highest in the mountain areas and lowest in Dobrudzha, the Danubian Plain and the Upper Thracian Plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev68&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two catchment basins: the [[Black Sea]] (57% of the territory and 42% of the rivers) and the [[Aegean Sea]] (43% of the territory and 58% of the rivers) basins.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hydrology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geografia.kabinata.com/05.htm|title=Hydrology of Bulgaria|website=Topics of Geography of Bulgaria|accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Balkan Mountains]] divide Bulgaria into two nearly equal [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage systems]]. The larger system drains northward to the Black Sea, mainly by way of the Danube. This system includes the entire Danubian Plain and a stretch of land running 48–80&amp;nbsp;km inland from the coastline in the south. The Danube gets slightly more than 4% of its total volume from its Bulgarian tributaries. As it flows along the northern border, the Danube averages 1.6 to 2.4&amp;nbsp;km in width. The river's highest water levels usually occur during the May floods; it is frozen over an average of 40 days per year. The longest river located entirely in Bulgarian territory, the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]], with a length of 368&amp;nbsp;km and a catchment area of 8,640&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is the only Bulgarian Danubian tributary that does not rise in the Balkan Mountains. Instead, the Iskar has its origin in the Rila Mountains. It passes through Sofia's eastern suburbs and crosses the Balkan Mountains through a spectacular 65&amp;nbsp;km–long gorge.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev68&quot;/&gt; Other important tributaries of the Danube include the rivers [[Lom (river)|Lom]], [[Ogosta]], [[Vit]], [[Osam]] and [[Yantra (river)|Yantra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev68&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hydrology&quot;/&gt; The longest river flowing directly to the Black Sea is the [[Kamchiya]] (254&amp;nbsp;km), while other rivers include the [[Batova]], [[Provadiya River|Provadiya]], [[Aheloy (river)|Aheloy]], [[Ropotamo]], [[Veleka]] and [[Rezovo River|Rezovo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev69&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aegean Sea catchment basin drains the [[Thracian Plain]] and most of the higher lands to the south and southwest. Several major rivers flow directly to the Aegean Sea. Most of these streams fall swiftly from the mountains and have cut deep, scenic gorges. The 480&amp;nbsp;km–long [[Maritsa]] (of them 321&amp;nbsp;km in Bulgaria) and its tributaries drain all of the western [[Thracian Plain]], all of [[Sredna Gora]], the southern slopes of the Balkan Mountains, and the northern slopes of the eastern Rhodopes. After it leaves Bulgaria, the Maritsa forms most of the Greco-Turkish border.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev69&quot;/&gt; Maritsa's major tributaries are the [[Tundzha]], [[Arda (Maritsa)|Arda]], [[Topolnitsa River|Topolnitsa]], [[Vacha (river)|Vacha]], etc. The other Bulgarian rivers flowing directly to the Aegean are the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] and the [[Nestos (river)|Mesta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hydrology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev69&quot;/&gt;

Bulgaria has around 400 natural lakes with a total area of 95&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and volume of 278 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev71&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liman (landform)|limans]] and lagoons along the Black Sea coast include from north to south [[Durankulak|Lake Durankulak]], [[Lake Shabla]], [[Lake Varna]], [[Lake Beloslav]], [[Lake Pomorie]], [[Lake Atanasovsko]], [[Lake Burgas]] and [[Lake Mandrensko]]. Of them, Lake Burgas is the most extensive with 27,6&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Lake Varna has the largest volume with 165,5&amp;nbsp;million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hydrology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev71&quot;/&gt; The lakes along the Danube were dried to clear land for agriculture with the notable exception of the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Srebarna Nature Reserve|Lake Srebarna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev71&quot;/&gt; There are 170 [[glacial lake]]s in Rila and 164 in Pirin. They are an important tourist asset. The most renown lakes include the [[Seven Rila Lakes]], [[Popovo Lake]], [[Banderishki Lakes]], [[Vasilashki Lakes]], [[Vlahini Lakes]], etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev71&quot;/&gt; [[Swamp]]s and [[marsh]]es include [[Alepu]], [[Arkutino]], [[Aldomirovtsi Marsh]], [[Dragoman Marsh]], etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev72&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are around 2,200 reservoirs with a total volume of c. 7&amp;nbsp;billion km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hydrology&quot;/&gt; The largest ones are [[Iskar Reservoir]], [[Ogosta Reservoir]], [[Dospat Reservoir]], [[Batak Reservoir]], [[Kardzhali Reservoir]], [[Ivaylovgrad Reservoir]], [[Studen Kladenets]], [[Koprinka Reservoir]], [[Ticha Reservoir]], etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev72&quot;/&gt;

Bulgaria is rich in [[mineral water]]s, with 225 mineral springs and a total discharge of 5000 l/s, mainly in the south-western and central parts of the country along the faults between the mountains.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev66&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them, 148, are situated in southern Bulgaria, while the other 77 are in the northern part of the country. The springs in the north tend to be with cool water, while those to the south are mainly warm and hot. The hottest spring in Bulgaria and the Balkans is situated in [[Sapareva Banya]] and reaches 101.4&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev66&quot;/&gt; The Bulgarian word for spa, ''баня'', transliterated as ''banya'', appears in some of the names of more than 50 [[spa town]]s and resorts. They are located in several zones: ''Balkan Mountains zone'' ([[Varshets]], [[Shipkovo]], [[Voneshta Voda]]), ''Srednogorie zone'' (Sofia, [[Ovcha kupel]], [[Bankya]], [[Pancharevo]], [[Strelcha]], [[Hisarya, Bulgaria|Hisarya]], [[Banya, Plovdiv Province|Banya]], [[Pavel Banya]]), ''Maritsa zone'' ([[Kostenets|Kostenets (town)]], [[Kostenets (village)]], [[Dolna Banya]], [[Momin Prohod]]), ''Rilo-Rhodope zone'' ([[Devin, Bulgaria|Devin]], [[Velingrad]], [[Banite]], [[Beden, Bulgaria|Beden]], [[Mihalkovo]], Sapareva Banya), ''Struma zone'' ([[Kyustendil]], [[Sandanski]], [[Ognyanovo, Blagoevgrad Province|Ognyanovo]], [[Marikostinovo]], [[Dobrinishte]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soils ==
[[File:Bulgaria Gela 06.jpg|thumb|250px|The soils of Bulgaria support both agriculture and natural vegetation]]
The [[soil]] cover of Bulgaria is diverse. The soil resources of the country are adequately researched and include 17 [[soil type]]s and 28 sub-types.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev77&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of them, six types form 88.7% of the soil cover: cinnamon soils (22.0%); [[chernozem]] (20.4%); grey forest soils (17.0%); brown forest soils (14.8%); [[Alluvium|alluvial soils]] (9.0%) and smolnitsi (5.4%).&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev77&quot;/&gt;

There are three soil zones. The ''Northern forest-steppe zone'' covers the Danubian Plain and the Pre-Balkan up to 600–700&amp;nbsp;m altitude. The Danubian Plain is characterised by the fertile black earth chernozem, that accounts for 54% of the zone's area, while the Pre-Balkan is dominated by grey forest soils (39%), which have good physical characteristics but are low in organic matter and phosphorus.&lt;ref name=&quot;soils&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geografia.kabinata.com/06.htm|title=Soils of Bulgaria|website=Topics of Geography of Bulgaria|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fao soils&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/doc/counprof/Bulgaria/bulgaria.htm|title=Country Profile of Bulgaria|website=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Southern xerothermal zone'' encompasses Southern Bulgaria up to 700–800&amp;nbsp;m altitude and includes several specific soil types due to the more diverse topography and climate. The most common soil types are the cinnamon forest soils with acidic (cinnamonic) traces, smolnitsi and yellow-podzolic soils.&lt;ref name=&quot;soils&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fao soils&quot;/&gt; The ''Mountain zone'' covers the mountainous regions above 700–800&amp;nbsp;m altitude and has a zonal soil cover. The brown forest soils are distributed at altitudes of 1000–2000&amp;nbsp;m, the dark mountain forest soils can be found at 1700–2200&amp;nbsp;m altitude and the mountain meadow soils&amp;nbsp;– above 1700&amp;nbsp;m. These soils are typically shallow and prone to erosion and are usually acid to strongly acid.&lt;ref name=&quot;soils&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fao soils&quot;/&gt;

== Mineral resources ==
There are approximately 60 types of minerals that are extracted commercially in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mineral resources are divided into three groups: [[fossil fuel]]s, metals and [[industrial mineral]]s.

The fossil fuels include coal, petroleum and natural gas. Bulgaria possesses significant reserves of coal estimated at 4,8&amp;nbsp;billion tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev42&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 92% of them, or 4,5&amp;nbsp;billion tons,&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev42&quot;/&gt; is [[lignite]], which is the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content but is widely used for electricity generation. With reserves of 2,856&amp;nbsp;billion tons Maritsa Iztok, situated in the Upper Thracian Plain, is by far the largest coal basin in the country which powers [[Maritsa Iztok Complex]], the largest energy complex in South-Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev43&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other lignite basins include Sofia valley (reserves of 870 million tons), [[Elhovo]] (656&amp;nbsp;million tons), [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]] (277&amp;nbsp;million tons), Maritsa Zapad (170&amp;nbsp;million tons).&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev43&quot;/&gt; The reserves of [[sub-bituminous coal]] are 300 million tons, situated mainly near [[Bobov Dol]], [[Pernik]] and [[Burgas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recoverable reserves of [[bituminous coal]] and [[anthracite]] are insignificant&amp;nbsp;– only 10 and 2,5&amp;nbsp;million tons respectively. However, there is a huge basin of bituminous coal in [[Southern Dobruja]] with estimated reserves of over 1&amp;nbsp;billion tons but its large depth (1370–1950&amp;nbsp;m) is an obstacle for its commercial exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Elshitsa-mine.jpg|right|thumb|250px|alt=a mine|A copper mine near [[Elshitsa]], Pazardzhik Province. Bulgaria is an important producer of copper.]]

The Bulgarian [[exclusive economic zone]] has a total size of {{convert|110,879|km2|abbr=on}}}} in the Black Sea. Petroleum and natural gas are found in northern Bulgaria and its EEZ in the Black Sea. Crude oil is extracted in [[Dolni Dabnik]] and [[Gigen]] in Pleven Province and in [[Tyulenovo]], Dobrich Province. The proven reserves are 20 million tons but there are prospects for new discovering in the EEZ.&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev46&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gas fields have been discovered off cape [[Kaliakra]] (reserves of 3&amp;nbsp;billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Deventsi]] (6&amp;nbsp;billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), between [[Lovech]] and [[Etropole]] (est. 22&amp;nbsp;billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref name=&quot;natural gas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gas.bghot.com/zapasi_bg.php|title=Natural Gas Reserves in Bulgaria|website=Natural Gas in Bulgaria|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as near [[Devetaki]] and [[Butan, Bulgaria|Butan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donchev46&quot; /&gt; It is estimated that the 14,220&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''Khan Asparukh'' Block in the northern section of the Bulgarian EEZ has natural gas reserves of 100&amp;nbsp;billion m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;natural gas&quot; /&gt;

Bulgaria has significant reserves of metal ores, especially copper, zinc and lead, situated mainly in the southern half of the country. The two largest iron ore mines are located in [[Kremikovtsi]] near Sofia and [[Krumovo, Yambol Province]] with total reserves of 430 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donchev|Karakashev|2004|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manganese]] ore is extracted near [[Obrochishte]] in Dobrich Province (reserves of 85 million tons), as well as in the provinces of Sofia and Varna.
