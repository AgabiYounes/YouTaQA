'''Brazil''' has both modern technologies in the center-south portion, counting with [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], [[3G]] [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]], [[DSL]] [[ISDB]] based Digital TV. Other areas of the country, particularly the [[North Region, Brazil|North]] and [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]] regions, lack even basic [[Analog device|analog]] [[PSTN]] [[telephone]] lines. This is a problem that the government is trying to solve by linking the liberation of new technologies such as [[WiMax]] and [[FTTH]]) only tied with compromises on extension of the service to less populated regions.

== Telephone system==

=== Landline===
The Brazilian landline sector is fully open to competition and continues to attract operators. The bulk of the market is divided between four operators: Telefónica, América Móvil, Oi (controlled by Brazilian investors and Portugal Telecom), and GVT. Telefónica operates through Telefónica Brasil, which has integrated its landline and mobile services under the brand name Vivo. The América Móvil group in Brazil comprises long distance incumbent Embratel, mobile operator Claro, and cable TV provider Net Serviços. The group has started to integrate its landline and mobile services under the brand name Claro, previously used only for mobile services. Oi offers landline and mobile services under the Oi brand name. GVT is the country's most successful alternative network provider, offering landline services only.

===Mobile===
The history of mobile telephony in Brazil began on 30 December 1990, when the Cellular Mobile System began operating in the city of Rio de Janeiro, with a capacity for 10,000 terminals. At that time, according to Anatel (the national telecommunications agency), there were 667 devices in the country. The number of devices rose to 6,700 in the next year, to 30,000 in 1992. In November 2007 3G services were launched, and increased rapidly to almost 90% of the population in 2012 and the agreements signed as part of the auction specify a 3G coverage obligation of 100% of population by 2019. After the auction that took place in June 2012, LTE tests were undertaken in several cities, tourist locations and international conference venues.&lt;ref name=&quot;abril&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/tecnologia/noticias/claro-testa-4g-em-campos-do-jordao-sp |title=Claro testa 4G em Campos do Jordão-SP |date= 5 September 2012 |publisher=exame.abril.com.br|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first LTE-compatible devices became available in the local market and LTE services was commercially launched in 2013. Under the 4G licence terms, operators were required to have commercial networks in all twelve state capitals which are acting as host cities for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2014/01/07/all-four-4g-licensees-confirmed-as-having-met-end-2013-coverage-deadline/| title =Rostelecom All four 4G licensees confirmed as having met end-2013 coverage deadline| work =Telegrography|date=7 January 2014| accessdate = 15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mobile market is ruled by 4 companies:

*'''[[Vivo (telecommunications)|Vivo]]''', controlled by the Spanish [[Telefônica Vivo|Telefónica]], is the leading wireless and fixed company in Brazil.
*'''[[TIM Brasil|TIM]]''', controlled by the Italian [[Telecom Italia]]. It recently overcame Claro as the second wireless company in Brazil.
*'''[[Claro Americas|Claro]]''', controlled by the Mexican [[América Móvil]] (owned by [[Carlos Slim]]), ranks third in Brazilian wireless.
*'''[[Oi (telecommunications)|Oi]]''', which is the second landline company in Brazil, is the smallest wireless player of the big four.

'''Statistics'''
*Number of devices: 161,922,375
*Percentage of [[Prepaid mobile phone|prepaid]] lines: 81.91%

==International backbones==

===Submarine cables===

Several [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] link Brazil to the world:&lt;ref name=&quot;teleco2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teleco.com.br/tutoriais/tutorialcsub/pagina_2.asp |title=teleco.com.br |publisher=teleco.com.br|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Americas II''' cable entered operations on September 2000, connecting Brazil ([[Fortaleza]]) to United States.
*'''ATLANTIS-2''', with around 12&amp;nbsp;thousand kilometers in extension, operating since 2000, it connects Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Natal) to Europe, Africa and South America. This is the only cable that connects [[South America]] to [[Africa]] and [[Europe]].
*'''EMERGIA – SAM 1''' cable connects all three [[Americas]], surrounding it with a total extension of more than 25&amp;nbsp;thousand kilometers.
*'''GLOBAL CROSSING - SAC''' Connects all Americas, surrounding them with a total extension of more than 15&amp;nbsp;thousand kilometers.
*'''GLOBENET/360 NETWORK''' Another link from North America to South America.
*'''UNISUR''' Interconnects Brazil, [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]].

All these cables have a [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] from 20 [[Data rate units|Gbit/s]] to 80 Gbit/s, and some have a projected final capacity of more than 1 Tbit/s.

==Television and radio==

Under the Brazilian constitution, television and radio are not treated as forms of telecommunication, in order to avoid creating problems with a series of regulations that reduce and control how international businesses and individuals can participate. It is worth mentioning that Brazil has the 2nd largest media conglomerate in the world in terms of revenue, [[Rede Globo]].

==Internet==
{{main|Internet in Brazil}}
{{see also|List of internet service providers in Brazil}}

The Internet has become quite popular in Brazil, with steadily growing numbers of users as well as increased availability. Brazil holds the  6th spot in number of users worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;viuisso&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viuisso.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/onu_internet_br.jpg|title=Image: onu_internet_br.jpg, (1860 × 1616 px)|publisher=viuisso.com.br|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many technologies are used to bring broadband Internet to consumers, with [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] and [[Cable modem|cable]] being the most common (respectively, about 13 million and 9 million connections),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teleco.com.br/blarga1.asp|title=teleco.com.br|website=Teleco|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[3G]] technologies. 4G technologies were introduced in April 2013 and presently are available in over 90% of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teleco.com.br/4g_cobertura.asp|title=teleco.com.br|website=Teleco|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
