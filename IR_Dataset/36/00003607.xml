The '''economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina''' is a transitional economy with limited market reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;CIABK&quot;/&gt; [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared [[1992 Bosnian independence referendum|independence]] from socialist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] on [[Independence Day (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|1 March 1992]].

==Overview==
Bosnia and Herzegovina is an upper middle-income country which has accomplished a great deal since the mid-1990s. Today, it is an EU potential candidate country and is now embarking on a new growth model amid a period of slow growth and the global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bosniaandherzegovina|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Worldbank.org|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bosnia and Herzegovina is a small, open economy, dominated by services, which accounted for 55% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2016, with a moderately developed industrial and manufacturing sector (23% and 12%, respectively), and a limited agricultural base (about 6% of GDP).&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;[https://www.oecd.org/south-east-europe/programme/Unleashing_the_Transformation_potential_for_Growth_in_WB.pdf OECD 2019]&lt;/ref&gt;

The key economic challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the imbalance of its economic model: public policies and incentives are skewed toward the public rather than the private sector, consumption rather than investment, and imports rather than exports. The country needs to shift to a business environment that is conducive to private investment. The country faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing  liberty market reforms to its economy.

The [[konvertibilna marka]] (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however, has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all ; foreign banks, primarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A sizable current account deficit and very high unemployment rate remain the two most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.

The United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces the Country Commercial Guide – an annual report that delivers a comprehensive look at Bosnia and Herzegovina's commercial and economic environment, using economic, political, and market analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018193841/http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html |archive-date=2012-10-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief economic history until the 1990s ==
[[File:Real GDP growth rates RS &amp; FBH.png|250px|thumb|Real GDP growth rates in Republic of Srpska and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]

At the time of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was an important mineral processing centre and provided the other republics with basic mineral commodities in exchange for current consumption goods. While large amounts of public capital investments poured in during the 1970s, productivity levels remained low, often due to the limited capacity of public managers.&lt;ref name=OECD/&gt; Under former republican premier [[Džemal Bijedić]], and Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], metal-product industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's metal products plants.

Merging small firms into larger agglomerates was a common practice in the SFRY to preserve employment levels. As a result, four large conglomerates emerged in Bosnia and Herzegovina over time: [[Energoinvest]] (energy sector), [[Unis (Yugoslavia)|Unis]] (automotive and defence industry, which partnered with [[Volkswagen]] in the early 1970s), [[Šipad]] (wood processing) and [[RMK Zenica]] (steel industry, later acquired by ArcelorMittal). Construction and defence were important industries of the Bosnian economy, despite their low efficiency and, ultimately, supply excess. The defence industry was particularly developed in the southern districts and around [[Mostar]], which was also a relevant metallurgical centre ([[Aluminij Mostar]]). Machinery production was concentrated in the north, particularly around [[Banja Luka]]. The [[Tuzla]] district was renowned for its chemical industry. The automotive industry, which developed in the 1950s with the production of vehicle components, extended later on to passenger and commercial vehicles, with plants in [[Sarajevo]], [[Mostar]] and [[Banja Luka]]. Agriculture was not highly developed, despite its importance for employment and the presence of the large [[Agrokomerc]] conglomerate based at the north-west border with [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name=OECD/&gt;

Tito had pushed the development of metal industries, and electro-energetic sector, in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina were a host of large numbers of industrial firms. Some of them were worked with World brand names, companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, Volkswagen and SKF. Big Companies like Energoinvest, UNIS, Hidrogradnja, Vranica, RMK Zenica, TAS Sarajevo, FAMOS Sarajevo and BNT Novi Travnik, have yearly income in billions of USD$ at that time. Building sector companies bringing large amounts of income in USD$. Unemployment at that time is very low. Work force is highly skilled, with highly professional, educated managers, engineers, science experts, which use western world's newest technologies in large scale areas. Before the war, Yugoslav premier [[Ante Marković]], made some preparations for privatization, in economy, finance, and industry sectors, but the war ceased development in these actions.

The economy suffered heavily from the [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with over €200 billion in material damages&lt;ref&gt;http://balkans.aljazeera.net/video/presuda-karadzicu-materijalna-steta-u-ratu-u-bih-200-milijardi-eura&lt;/ref&gt; and GDP (excluding services) reduced by 90% between 1990 and 1995. Today, most of the abovementioned companies have been privatised. The economy remains fragile, primarily consumption driven and vulnerable to external fluctuations. This was seen with the global economic crisis, which pushed Bosnia and Herzegovina into recession in 2009 and 2012 (with GDP growth of -3% and -0.8%, respectively) and severe floods in 2014, which caused damage of approximately 15% of GDP. Since 2015, annual GDP growth has increased to more than 3%. Still, the country registered a current account deficit of 4.7% of GDP in 2017, decreasing from 5.3% in 2015, resulting from a reduction in its trade deficit, which nevertheless remains large (17.4% of GDP in 2017).&lt;ref name=OECD/&gt;

A Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in late 1997,  debt negotiations were held with the [[London Club]] in December 1997 and with the [[Paris Club]] in October 1998, and a new currency, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]], was introduced in mid-1998. In 1999, the Convertible Mark gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank dramatically increased its reserve holdings. Due to Bosnia's strict currency board regime attaching the Bosnian mark to the Euro, [[inflation]] has remained low in the entire country.

With an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996–99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000–02.
The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and [[humanitarian aid]] from the international community. Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) assistance accounts for 20%-25% of [[economic growth]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
However, growth has been uneven throughout the post-war period, with the Federation outpacing the RS. According to World Bank estimates, GDP growth was 62% in the Federation and 25% in the RS in 1996, 35% in the Federation and flat in the RS in 1997, and continued growth in the Federation in 1998.

Movement has been slow, but considerable progress has been made in economic reform since peace was re-established. [[Banking]] reform lagged, as did the implementation of [[privatization]]. Many companies (mainly factories) that were privatized faced massive problems, causing the owners to reduce salaries and deny the workers their salaries, and some of the new owners and tycoons destroy that factories.

The [[tourism]] sector has been recovering and helping the economy altogether in the process, with popular winter skiing destinations as well as summer countryside tourism. 
[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has been a top performer in recent years in terms of [[tourism]] development; tourist arrivals have grown by an average of 24% annually from 1995 to 2000. The European region's solid growth in arrivals in 2007 was due in significant part to Southern and Mediterranean Europe's strong performance (+7%). 
In particular, Bosnia and Herzegovina were among the stronger players with a growth of 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/UNWTO_Highlights08_en_HR.pdf |title=Tourism |format=PDF |website=Unwto.org |accessdate=2010-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728145219/http://unwto.org/facts/eng/pdf/highlights/UNWTO_Highlights08_en_HR.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-28 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges of doing business ==

Post-war high percentage of unemployment (19.4%)&lt;ref name=&quot;biznisinfo.ba 2&quot;/&gt; remains high, and the economical progress is very slow. Complicated bureaucracy system, complex procedures and often misconducted audition and regulation by [[Tax inspector|public officers]] also make for volatile and insecure business environment, which is considered major hindrance to [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] into the country's industrial and manufacturing potential.

The workforce is comparably cheap, with average net salary being €450,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Plaće - maj 2018 |publisher=Agencija za statistiku BiH|url = http://www.bhas.ba/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=392 |website = Bhas.ba|accessdate = 2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and average gross salary being €657,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bhas.ba/saopstenja/2018/LAB_05_2018_05_0_BS.pdf|title = Agencija za statistiku - Prosječne bruto plaće zaposlenih V-2018|date = May 2018|website =Bhas.ba |publisher = Agencija za statistiku BiH |accessdate=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{as of|May 2018|lc=1}}) and good skilled, especially in sectors present in pre-war economy. However, with slow but persistent [[know-how]] obsolescence, [[Brain-drain|workforce exodus]], high [[unemployment]] and long average time outside labor market for the unemployed, need a  foreign-owned business investing  in  [[industry sector]]s where the country could be competitive.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is also lacking a good [[e-governance]] structure, as well as good methods to enforce [[administrative accountability]], both of which are considered necessary for more conductive business climate. Today{{when|date=July 2018}} it takes between 3–5 weeks to register a company in the country (and in some business sectors it can still take months to acquire all required permits, mostly due to [[Red tape|administrative inefficiency]]), and many other business related administrative procedures are similarly convoluted and time-consuming.

[[Political corruption]] is one of the more acute problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and along with [[Public administration|size of administration]] and its inefficiency, the biggest detriment to tax money being spent where it should be spent – on services to the population and the economy.

Bosnia has been preparing for an era of declining international assistance. Country's most immediate task remains economic revitalization to create jobs and [[income]]. After the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina|2014 riots]], [[2010 Bosnian general election|both]] [[2014 Bosnian general election|administrations]] have shyly started the reform, dealing with some of the many pressing issues to local economy,&lt;ref&gt;The country is consistently lowest ranked on the ''[[Ease of doing business index]]'', in the region and Europe overall. However recent changes in legislation have caused it to rise to 107th place in 2015 from 136th in 2014&lt;/ref&gt; but the overall process is still considered slow and tenuous by the populace and local as well as foreign economic analysts.

The Bosnian government has issued an international tender for the construction of the 350&amp;nbsp;km long '''[[Corridor 5c]]''' in Bosnia and Herzegovina which will passes along the route Budapest-Osijek-Sarajevo-Ploče. The highway along this corridor is the most significant roadway in B&amp;H and the shortest communication route between Central Europe and the Southern Adriatic. The routing of the road passes through the central part of the country in the North-South direction from Donji Svilaj to the border of B&amp;H, north from the Croatian [[port of Ploče]], following the rivers Bosna and Neretva. More than 50% of the total population and the economic activity of Bosnia and Herzegovina lies within the zone of influence along this route.

As of August 2018, 200&amp;nbsp;km motorway has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.klix.ba/biznis/ovim-tempom-gradnje-autoputeva-hrvatsku-cemo-stici-za-84-godine-a-srbiju-za-46/180801024&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to annual growth of nearly 10% the [[Sarajevo International Airport]] extension of the passenger terminal, together with upgrading and expanding the taxiway and apron is planned to start in Fall 2012. The existing terminal will be expanded with 7.000 square metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exyuaviation.blogspot.com/2011/09/sarajevo-expansion-to-begin-in-2012.html|title=EX-YU Aviation News: Sarajevo expansion to begin in 2012|website=Exyuaviation.blogspot.com|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The upgraded airport will also be directly connected to the commercial retail center Sarajevo Airport Center 
making it easy for tourist and travellers to use the time before the flight for some last minute shopping.&lt;ref name=&quot;airportcentersarajevo.com&quot;/&gt;
