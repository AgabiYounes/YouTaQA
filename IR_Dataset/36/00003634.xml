From 2000 to 2012, Brazil was one of the [[economic growth|fastest-growing]] major economies in the world, with an average annual GDP growth rate of over 5%. Its GDP surpassed that of the United Kingdom in 2012, temporarily making Brazil the world's sixth-largest economy. However, Brazil's economic growth decelerated in 2013&lt;ref&gt;http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/8/17/despite-protests-wont-lead-to-radical-change-in-brazil.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the country [[2014–2016 Brazilian economic recession|entered a recession in 2014]].

In 2017, Brazil was the third most unequal country in Latin America after [[Honduras]] and [[Colombia]]. The economic crisis, the lack of public policies and corruption led to an increase in poverty in 2017. Many retired civil servants no longer received their pensions on time and some become homeless because they could not pay their rent. In 2017, the richest 5% of Brazilians hold as much wealth as the remaining 95%. Six billionaires alone are richer than the 100 million poorest Brazilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rossi |first1=Mariana |title=Seis brasileiros concentram a mesma riqueza que a metade da população mais pobre |url=https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2017/09/22/politica/1506096531_079176.html |publisher=EL PAÍS Brasil |accessdate=1 July 2019 |date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data from the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]], extreme poverty increased by 11 per cent in 2017, while inequalities also increased again (the [[Gini index]] rose from 0.555 to 0.567). The reduction in the number of [[Bolsa Família]] beneficiaries decided by the government is the main cause, according to the study.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2018/04/12/pobreza-extrema-aumenta-11-no-ultimo-ano-economistas-culpam-trabalho-informal/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|Economic history of Brazil|Economy of the Empire of Brazil}}

When the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers arrived in the 16th century, the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|native tribes of current-day Brazil]] totaled about 2.5&amp;nbsp; million people and had lived virtually unchanged since the [[Stone Age]]. From Portugal's [[Colonial Brazil|colonization of Brazil]] (1500–1822) until the late 1930s, the Brazilian economy relied on the production of [[primary products]] for [[export]]s. In the [[Portuguese Empire]], Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial [[mercantile]] policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles – sugar, gold and from the early 19th century on, coffee. The economy of Brazil was heavily dependent on African [[slave labor]] until the late 19th century (about 3 million imported African slaves in total). In that period Brazil was also the colony with the largest amount of European settlers, most of them Portuguese (including Azoreans and Madeirans) but also some Dutch (see [[Dutch Brazil]]), Spaniards, English, French, Germans, Flemish, Danish, Scottish and Sephardic [[Brazilian Jews|Jews]].

Subsequently, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic growth accompanied by mass immigration from Europe, mainly from [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portugal]] (including the Azores and Madeira), [[Italian Brazilian|Italy]], [[Spanish Brazilian|Spain]], [[German Brazilian|Germany]], [[Polish Brazilian|Poland]], [[Ukrainian Brazilian|Ukraine]], [[Swiss Brazilian|Switzerland]], [[Austrian Brazilian|Austria]] and Russia. Smaller numbers of immigrants also came from the [[Dutch Brazilian|Netherlands]], [[French Brazilian|France]], [[Finnish Brazilian|Finland]], Iceland to and the [[Scandinavian Brazilian|Scandinavian]] countries, [[Lithuanians in Brazil|Lithuania]], [[Belgian Brazilian|Belgium]], [[Bulgarian Brazilian|Bulgaria]], [[Hungarian Brazilian|Hungary]], [[Greek Brazilian|Greece]], [[Latvian Brazilian|Latvia]], [[English Brazilian|England]], [[Irish Brazilian|Ireland]], [[Scottish Brazilian|Scotland]], [[Croat Brazilian|Croatia]], [[Czech Brazilian|Czech Republic]], [[Maltese Brazilian|Malta]], [[Macedonians in Brazil|North Macedonia]] and [[Luxembourg Brazilian|Luxembourg]], the [[Arab Brazilian|Middle East]] (mainly from [[Lebanese Brazilian|Lebanon]], [[Syrian Brazilian|Syria]] and [[Armenian Brazilian|Armenia]]), Japan, the [[Confederados|United States]] and [[Afrikaners|South Africa]], until the 1930s. In the New World, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Uruguay, New Zealand, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, Paraguay, Puerto Rico and Peru (in descending order) were the countries that received most immigrants. In Brazil's case, statistics showed that 4.5&amp;nbsp; million people emigrated to the country between 1882 and 1934.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In 2007, with a population of over 209 million and abundant natural resources, Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of millions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5&amp;nbsp; million television sets, and 3&amp;nbsp; million refrigerators. In addition, about 70&amp;nbsp; million cubic meters of petroleum were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane gas, and a wide range of hundreds of petrochemicals.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://countryeconomy.com/demography/population/brazil|title=Brazil - Population 2017|work=countryeconomy.com|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important corruption cases in Brazil concerns the company [[Odebrecht]]. Since the 1980s, Odebrecht has spent several billion dollars in the form of bribes to bribe parliamentarians to vote in favour of the group. At the municipal level, Odebrecht's corruption was aimed at &quot;stimulating privatisations&quot;, particularly in water and sewer management.&lt;ref&gt;https://mondediplo.com/2017/10/08brazil&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
The service sector is the largest component of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) at 67.0 percent, followed by the industrial sector at 27.5 percent. Agriculture represents 5.5 percent of GDP (2011).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worlddiplomacy.org/Countries/Brazil/InfoBra.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian labor force is estimated at 100.77 million of which 10 percent is occupied in agriculture, 19 percent in the industry sector and 71 percent in the service sector.

{{Main|Agriculture in Brazil}}

Agribusiness contributes to Brazil's [[trade balance]], in spite of [[trade barrier]]s and subsidizing policies adopted by the developed countries.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

In the space of fifty five years (1950 to 2005), the population of Brazil grew from 51 million to approximately 187&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/disseminacao/online/popclock/popclock.php Popclock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430010335/http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/disseminacao/online/popclock/popclock.php |date=30 April 2007 }} IBGE&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of over 2 percent per year. Brazil created and expanded a complex [[agribusiness]] sector.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt; However, some of this is at the expense of the environment, including the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]].

The importance given to the rural producer takes place in the shape of the agricultural and cattle-raising plan and through another specific subsidy program geared towards family agriculture ({{ILL|Programa de Fortalecimento da Agricultura Familiar|pt}} (Pronaf)), which guarantees financing for equipment and cultivation and encourages the use of new technology. With regards to family agriculture, over 800 thousand rural inhabitants are assisted by credit, research and extension programs. A special line of credit is available for women and young farmers.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

With The Land Reform Program, on the other hand, the country's objective is to provide suitable living and working conditions for over one million families who live in areas allotted by the State, an initiative capable of generating two million [[Employment|jobs]].{{when|date=February 2018}} Through partnerships, public policies and international partnerships, the government is working towards guaranteeing [[infrastructure]] for the settlements, following the examples of schools and health outlets. The idea is that access to land represents just the first step towards the implementation of a quality land reform program.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

Over 600,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land are divided into approximately five thousand areas of rural [[property]]; an agricultural area currently with three borders: the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-western region]] ([[savannah]]), the [[North Region, Brazil|northern region]] (area of transition) and parts of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern region]] (semi-arid). At the forefront of grain crops, which produce over 110 million tonnes/year, is the [[soybean]], yielding 50&amp;nbsp;million tonnes.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

In the cattle-raising sector, the &quot;green ox,&quot; which is raised in pastures, on a diet of hay and mineral salts, conquered markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas, particularly after the &quot;[[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]]&quot; scare period. Brazil has the largest cattle herd in the world, with 198 million heads,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/indicators/ Indicators] Brazilian Government. Retrieved on 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; responsible for exports of more than US$1&amp;nbsp;billion/year.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

A pioneer and leader in the manufacture of short-fiber timber [[cellulose]], Brazil has also achieved positive results within the packaging sector, in which it is the fifth largest world producer. In the foreign markets, it answers for 25 percent of global exports of raw cane and refined sugar; it is the world leader in [[soybean]] exports and is responsible for 80 percent of the planet's [[orange juice]], and since 2003, has had the highest sales figures for beef and chicken.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGA&quot;&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/ Agriculture] Brazilian Government.

{{Main|Industry in Brazil}}
Brazil has the second-largest manufacturing sector in the Americas. Accounting for 28.5 percent of GDP, Brazil's industries range from automobiles, steel and petrochemicals to computers, aircraft, and [[consumer durable]]s. With increased economic stability provided by the [[Plano Real]], Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from US firms.

Brazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16 percent of the GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazil's financial services industry provides local businesses with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. On 8 May 2008, the São Paulo Stock Exchange ([[Bovespa]]) and the São Paulo-based Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&amp;F) merged, creating [[BM&amp;F Bovespa]], one of the largest stock exchanges in the world. Also, the previously monopolistic reinsurance sector is being opened up to third party companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u113719.shtml|title=Government breaks reinsurance monopoly, discards privatization (in Portuguese)|accessdate=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2005|alt=As of}} 31 December 2007, there were an estimated 21,304,000 broadband lines in Brazil. Over 75 percent of the broadband lines were via [[digital subscriber line|DSL]] and 10 percent via cable modems.

Proven mineral resources are extensive. Large iron and manganese reserves are important sources of industrial raw materials and export earnings. Deposits of nickel, tin, chromite, uranium, bauxite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten, zinc, gold, and other minerals are exploited. High-quality [[Coking coal|coking-grade coal]] required in the steel industry is in short supply.

=== Energy ===
{{Main|Energy policy of Brazil|Renewable energy in Brazil}}
The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported petroleum. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006–2007. Brazil is one of the world's leading producers of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]], with a current capacity of about 260,000 megawatts. Existing hydroelectric power provides 90% of the nation's electricity. Two large hydroelectric projects, the 19,900 megawatt [[Itaipu Dam]] on the [[Paraná River]] (the world's largest dam) and the Tucurui Dam in [[Pará]] in [[North Region, Brazil|northern Brazil]], are in operation. Brazil's first commercial nuclear reactor, [[Angra I]], located near [[Rio de Janeiro]], has been in operation for more than 10 years. [[Angra II]] was completed in 2002 and is in operation too. An [[Angra III]] had a planned inauguration scheduled for 2014. The three reactors would have a combined capacity of 9,000 megawatts when completed. The government also plans to build 19 more nuclear plants by the year 2020.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

=== Sustainable growth ===
Portuguese explorers arrived in 1500, but it was only in 1808 that Brazil obtained a permit from the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial government]] to set up its first factories and manufacturers. In the 21st century, Brazil became the  eighth largest economy in the world. Originally, its exports were basic raw and primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold. Today, 84% of exports are of manufactured and semi-manufactured products.

The period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875 and 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fagoyinbo|first1=Joseph Babatunde|title=The Armed Forces: Instrument of Peace, Strength, Development and Prosperity|publisher=Author House|isbn=9781477218440|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUdHBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA209|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade, domestic production increased by 32.3%. [[Agribusiness]] (agriculture and cattle-raising), which grew by 47% or 3.6% per year, was the most dynamic sector – even after having weathered international crises that demanded constant adjustments to the Brazilian economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Sustainable growth] Brazilian Government. Retrieved on 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian government also launched a program for economic development acceleration called [[Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento]], aiming to spur growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From crisis to crisis in Brazil|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9537065|work=The Economist|date=24 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's transparency rank in the international world is 75th according to [[Transparency International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table Transparency by country 2009] [[Transparency International]]. Retrieved on 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control and reform ===
Among measures recently adopted to [[Balance (accounting)|balance]] the economy, Brazil carried out reforms to its social security (state and retirement pensions) and tax systems. These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of Fiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the executive branches at federal, state and municipal levels. At the same time, investments were made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to encourage exports, industry and trade, thus creating &quot;windows of opportunity&quot; for local and international investors and producers.

With these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it doesn't import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic debt through exchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by 20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector or inflation (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a [[liquidity crisis]]. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive balance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments, services and overseas payment. Thus, respected economists say that the country won't be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Control and reform] Brazilian Government. Retrieved on 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, President [[Michel Temer]] refused to make public the list of companies accused of &quot;[[modern slavery]]&quot;. The list, made public yearly since the presidency of [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula Da Silva]] in 2003, was intended to persuade companies to settle their fines and conform to labor regulations, in a country where corruption of the political class risked compromising respect for the law. The relations of the president-in-office with the &quot;landowner lobby&quot; were denounced by dismissed president [[Dilma Rousseff]] on this occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.humanite.fr/au-bresil-temer-protege-les-esclavagistes-633475 Au Brésil, Temer protège les esclavagistes ]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consistent policies ===
Support for the productive sector has been simplified at all levels; active and independent, [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]] and the Judiciary Branch carry out the evaluation of rules and regulations. Among the main measures taken to stimulate the economy are the reduction of up to 30 percent on manufactured products tax (IPI), and the investment of $8&amp;nbsp;billion on road cargo transportation fleets, thus improving distribution logistics. Further resources guarantee the propagation of business and information telecenters.

The policy for industry, technology and foreign trade, at the forefront of this sector, for its part, invests $19.5&amp;nbsp;billion in specific sectors, following the example of the software and semiconductor, pharmaceutical and medicine product, and capital goods sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Consistent policies] Brazilian government. Retrieved on 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mergers and acquisitions ===
Between 1985 and 2017, 11,563 [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers &amp; acquisitions]] with a total known value of US$1,185&amp;nbsp;billion with the involvement of Brazilian firms were announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-statistics-countries/|title=M&amp;A Statistics by Countries - Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|work=Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances (IMAA)|access-date=2018-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with $115&amp;nbsp;billion of transactions. It is worth noticing, that in the top 100 deals by value there are only four cases of Brazilian companies acquiring a foreign company. This reflects the strong interest in the country from a direct investment perspective.

Here is a list of the largest deals where Brazilian companies took on either the role of the acquiror or the target:

=== Entrepreneurship ===
According to a search of [[Global Entrepreneurship Monitor]] in 2011 Brazil had 27 million adults aged between 18 and 64 either starting or owning a business, meaning that more than one in four Brazilian adults were entrepreneurs. In comparison to the other 54 countries studied, Brazil was the third-highest in total number of entrepreneurs. The [[Institute of Applied Economic Research]] (Ipea), a government agency, found that 37&amp;nbsp;million jobs in Brazil were associated with businesses with less than 10 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.grupomaquina.com/maquinaNet/techEngine?sid=MaquinaNet&amp;command=noticiaClippingSite&amp;action=visualizar&amp;idNoticia=2368106366895 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232504/http://web.grupomaquina.com/maquinaNet/techEngine?sid=MaquinaNet&amp;command=noticiaClippingSite&amp;action=visualizar&amp;idNoticia=2368106366895 |archivedate=26 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }} A spirit for entreprise, Finantial Times Online, May 8th,2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Brazil ranks internationally as one of the hardest countries in the region to do business due to its complicated bureaucracy, there is a healthy number of entrepreneurs, thanks to the huge internal consumer market and various government programs.

The most recent research of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor revealed in 2013 that 50.4% of Brazilian new entrepreneurs are men, 33.8% are in the 35–44 age group, 36.9% completed high school and 47.9% earn 3–6 times the Brazilian minimum wage. In contrast, 49.6% of entrepreneurs are female, only 7% are in the 55–64 age group, 1% have postgraduate education and 1.7% earn more than 9 times the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gemconsortium.org/docs/2645/gem-2012-global-report |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623235936/http://www.gemconsortium.org/docs/2645/gem-2012-global-report |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }} GEM 2012 Global Report&lt;/ref&gt;
