The implementation of the [[Dayton Accords]] of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as well as the [[international community]], on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. Relations with its neighbors of [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]] have been fairly stable since the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995.

Three Canadian organizations operate programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina: [[Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada]] (DFAIT), the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) and the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] (DND). Canada strongly supports the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] hoping it can help bring more stability to the region. Through the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] Canada has given more than [[Canadian dollar|CA$]] 144 million in development assistance.

Exports of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Canada are worth about [[United States dollar|US$]] 5.31 million per year, while exports of Canada to Bosnia and Herzegovina value about US$5.34 million per year.

|{{flag|Croatia}}||&lt;!--Date started--&gt;||See [[Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia relations]]

Discussions continue with [[Croatia]] on several small disputed sections of the boundary related to maritime access that hinder final ratification of the 1999 border agreement.

Sections of the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] river and villages at the base of Mount [[Plješevica]] are in Croatia, while some are in Bosnia, which causes an excessive number of border crossings on a single route and impedes any serious development in the region. The [[Zagreb]]-[[Bihać]]-[[Split, Croatia|Split]] railway line is still closed for major traffic due to this issue. The road [[Karlovac]]-[[Plitvice Lakes]]-[[Knin]], which is on the [[European route]] E71, is becoming increasingly unused because Croatia built a separate highway to the west of it.

The border on the Una river between [[Hrvatska Kostajnica]] on the northern, Croatian side of the river, and [[Bosanska Kostajnica]] on the southern, Bosnian side, is also being discussed. A river island between the two towns is under Croatian control, but is claimed by Bosnia. A shared border crossing point has been built and has been functioning since 2003, and is used without hindrance by either party.

The Herzegovinian municipality of [[Neum]] in the south makes the southernmost part of Croatia an exclave and the two countries are negotiating special transit rules through Neum to compensate for that. Recently Croatia has opted to build a [[Pelješac bridge|bridge to the Pelješac peninsula]] to connect the Croatian mainland with the exclave but Bosnia and Herzegovina has protested that the bridge will close its access to international waters (although Croatian territory and territorial waters surround Bosnian-Herzegovinian territory and waters completely) and has suggested that the bridge must be higher than 55 meters for free passage of all types of ships. Negotiations are still being held.

|{{flag|Germany}}||&lt;!--Date started--&gt;1994||

Germany is one of the most important partners of Bosnia and Herzegovina in foreign affairs. Bilateral relations have developed steadily since diplomatic ties were established in mid-1994. Germany was closely involved in efforts to bring about peace before and after the conclusion of the [[Dayton Agreement]]. There is also a long tradition of economic relations between Germany and Bosnia. When the country was still part of the former Yugoslavia, joint ventures and cooperation played a large role here (motor industry, metal processing, textile industry/contract processing work, steel and chemicals). After the war, Germany took on a spearheading role in investments in production in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is undergoing a transitional phase from a centrally planned to a market economy. These investments are concentrated primarily in vehicle assembly and parts supply, the construction industry/cement, raw materials processing/ aluminum and regional dairy farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/Laenderinformationen/01-Laender/BosnienHerzegowina.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220231005/http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/Laenderinformationen/01-Laender/BosnienHerzegowina.html |archive-date=2015-02-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992-1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was ended with the crucial participation of the [[United States]] in brokering the 1995 [[Dayton Accords]]. After leading the diplomatic and military effort to secure the Dayton agreement, the United States has continued to lead the effort to ensure its implementation. The United States maintains command of the [[NATO]] headquarters in Sarajevo. The United States has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help with infrastructure, humanitarian aid, economic development, and military reconstruction in Herzegovina and Bosnia. The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) has played a large role in post-war Bosnia and Herzegovina, including programs in economic development and reform, democratic reform (media &amp; elections), infrastructure development, and training programs for Bosnian professionals, among others. Additionally, there are many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have likewise played significant roles in the reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2868.htm#relations|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EU accession==
The [[accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] (SAP) is the EU's policy framework. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, member states of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm|title=European Commission - Enlargement - Bosnia and Herzegovina - Relations with the EU|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=20 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126024355/http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm|archivedate=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign support==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina receives support from donor programs of:
* [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD)
* [[European Union]]
* [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]
* [[International Monetary Fund]]
* [[USAID]]

In the 3 years since the Dayton Accords were signed, over $4 billion in foreign aid has flown into Bosnia, about $800 million of it coming from SEED funds. As stated above, this support has been key to the growth and revitalization of the economy and infrastructure in the republic. However, most of this aid has been targeted at the Federation; the previous government of the RS was anti-Dayton and not assisted by the U.S. The election of the &quot;Sloga&quot; or &quot;Unity&quot; Coalition government, led by Prime Minister Dodik, has shifted the balance of power in the [[Republika Srpska]] (RS) to a pro-Dayton stance and will result in an upsurge of funding to the RS from the international community.

In addition to SEED funding, [[USAID]] programs have been crucial to the redevelopment of Bosnia and Herzegovina. USAID has programming in the following areas: economic policy reform and restructuring; private sector development (the Business Development Program); infrastructure rebuilding; democratic reforms in the media, political process and elections, and rule of law/legal code formulation; and training programs for women and diplomats.
