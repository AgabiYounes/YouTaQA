The '''British Virgin Islands''' are located in the [[Caribbean]], between the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], east of [[Puerto Rico]]. Its geographic coordinates are {{coord|18|30|N|64|30|W|}}. Map references include [[Central America]] and the Caribbean. The area totals 151&amp;nbsp;km² (about 0.9 times the size of [[Washington, DC]]) and comprises 16 inhabited and more than 20 uninhabited islands; includes the islands of [[Tortola]], [[Anegada]], [[Virgin Gorda]] and [[Jost van Dyke]]. Maritime claims include {{convert|3|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on|lk=in}} of territorial sea and exclusive a {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}} fishing zone. In terms of land use, it is 20% arable land, 6.67% permanent crops and 73.33% other as of a 2005 figure.
It has strong ties to nearby [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

== Terrain ==
The islands' terrain consists of coral islands, and is relatively flat. The volcanic islands are steep and hilly. Its lowest point is the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its highest point is [[Mount Sage]] at {{convert|521|m|ft}} above sea level. The country contains 80&amp;nbsp;km of coastline. There is limited natural fresh water resources (except for a few seasonal streams and springs on [[Tortola]], most of the islands' water supply comes from wells and rainwater catchments).

In the capital, [[Road Town]], typical daily maxima are around {{convert|32|°C|1|lk=on}} in the summer and {{convert|29|°C|1}} in the winter. Typical daily minima are around {{convert|24|°C|1|lk=on}} in the summer and {{convert|21|°C|1}} in the winter. Rainfall averages about {{convert|1150|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year, higher in the hills and lower on the coast. Rainfall can be quite variable, but the wettest months on average are September to November and the driest months on average are February and March.
