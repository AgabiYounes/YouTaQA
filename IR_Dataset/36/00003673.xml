'''Transport in [[Bulgaria]]''' is dominated by road transport, despite nearly half of all paved roads belonging to the lowest category of roads. As of December 2015, the country had 774 kilometers of [[Highways in Bulgaria|highways]].

Buses play a significant role in long distance public transport, coaches are operated by public and private companies. Sofia has three major national bus terminals, the Central, the Western and the Southern Terminals, and a separate terminal for international routes. In the countryside [[share taxi]]s are in operation between smaller settlements.

Railway systems are mostly outdated, the average speed is very low, however, upgrading projects are underway. The national railways company is [[BDŽ]], but private freight operators are also present. The [[Sofia Metro]] has two lines, and a third is being built as of 2016.

Air traffic has been growing since the 2000s, which was facilitated by the opening of a second terminal at [[Sofia Airport]], as well as the implementation of new destinations and routes. The flag carrier is [[Bulgaria Air]], but a number of private charter companies also exist, operating domestic and international flights.

Ports along the [[Danube]] and the [[Black Sea]] are the most important concerning Bulgaria's water transport system. The two largest ports are in [[Varna, Bulgaria|Varna]] and in [[Burgas]].

After the second terminal of International Airport Sofia was built the total number of passengers for the country rose and reached 6,595,790 in 2008,&lt;ref name=&quot;nsi-air&quot;/&gt; and in April 2011 Airport Sofia serviced 282 694 passengers, 13% more than the same period of 2009, when the record was 250 000 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=128293 Sofia Airport Serviced Record Number of Passengers April 2011], Sofia News Agency, May 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 passenger traffic at Bulgaria's three major airports - Sofia, Varna and Bourgas - grew up to near 10% on the year to 3.89 million in the first half of 2011, due to rise of customers using international routes and launch of new destinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sofiaecho.com/2011/08/18/1140858_passenger-traffic-at-bulgarias-major-airports-grows-10per-cent-yy-in-h1-2011 Passenger traffic at Bulgaria's major airports grows 10% Y/Y in H1 2011], The Sofia Echo, August 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Bulgarian airports served 7,728,612 passengers and handled 23,101 tons of goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsi-air&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/7158/air-transport|title=Air transport|publisher=National Statistical Institute|accessdate=2016-04-29|date=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past aviation compared with road and railroad transport used to be a minor mode of freight movement, and only 860,000 passengers used Bulgarian airlines in 2001.&lt;ref name=cp15&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Bulgaria had 68 airports, 57 of which had paved runways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bu.html|publisher= CIA World Factbook|title= Bulgaria|accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two airports, [[Sofia Airport]] and [[Burgas Airport]], had a runway longer than 3,000 meters, and there were four heliports.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; The second- and third-largest airports, [[Varna Airport]] and [[Burgas Airport]], serve mainly charter flights and have regular domestic links with the capital.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; In the early 2000s, Sofia Airport received substantial renovation, with aid from a [[Kuwait]]i-led consortium, in anticipation of increased air connections with Europe.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; A three-phase expansion was scheduled for completion in 2010.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; The communist-era state airline, [[Balkan Airlines]], was replaced by [[Bulgaria Air]], which was privatised in 2006.&lt;ref name=cp15/&gt; In 2004 Bulgaria Air transported 365,465 passengers to international destinations, including all major European cities, while in 2014 this number was at 897,422.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caa.gateway.bg/page.php?category=27|title=Statistics|publisher=Civil Aviation Administration|accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Bulgaria had some 6,238 kilometers of open access track owned by the state company &quot;National Company Railway Infrastructure&quot;, including a 125 kilometers long 760&amp;nbsp;mm narrow gauge railway - the [[Septemvri-Dobrinishte narrow gauge line]] and 4,316&amp;nbsp;km were considered main lines.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; Sofia, Plovdiv and Gorna Oriahovitsa are the hubs of the domestic system and of international rail connections.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; 
[[Image:Railway map of Bulgaria.png|right|thumb|300px|Map of Bulgaria's railroad network]]
Bulgaria's rail system has not expanded since the 1980s, in 2014 there were 4,023 kilometers of main lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/7191/length-railway-network|title=Length of railway network|publisher=NSI|accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are upgrading projects underway.&lt;ref name=cp14&gt;Bulgaria country profile, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the Plovdiv - Dimitrovgrad [[high-speed rail|high-speed line]] on 1 July 2012 the top operating speed was raised to 200&amp;nbsp;km/h and the national top speed record of 197&amp;nbsp;km/h set between Iskar and Elin Pelin with a leased [[Siemens]] Taurus electric locomotive is soon expected to be broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=925916 |title=The trains from Plovdiv to Dimitrovgrad now with 160 km/h |publisher=Dariknews.bg|language=Bulgarian |accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also plans for upgrading for high speed operation and doubling (where needed) of the [[Plovdiv]] - [[Burgas]] railway. By the end of 2013, a total of 461&amp;nbsp;km of [[high-speed rail|high-speed lines]] were expected to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/bulgaria-to-turkey-wiring-underway.html |title=Bulgaria to Turkey wiring underway |magazine=Railway Gazette International|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paper.standartnews.com/bg/article.php?d=2011-08-05&amp;article=377091 |title=Божков строи жп &quot;Марица&quot; |newspaper=Standart |language=Bulgarian |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snews.bg/bg/statiya/vlakat-plovdiv-burgas-shte-leti-s-200-km-ch:10592 |title=Влакът Пловдив-Бургас ще лети с 200 км/ч |publisher=Snews.bg|language=Bulgarian |accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-2000s, railways remained a major mode of freight transportation, but with increasing problems with the maintenance of the infrastructure and lowering speeds, highways carried a progressively larger share of freight.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; The national passenger and freight operator is called [[Bulgarian State Railways]], but there are also a number of private operators including Bulgarian Railway Company and [[DB Schenker]] Rail Bulgaria.

In 2014 the Bulgarian railways carried 14,225,000 tons of freight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/7185/goods-carried-and-transport-performance|title=Goods carried and transport performance - National statistical institute|website=Nsi.bg|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 21,433,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/7188/passengers-carried-and-transport-performance|title=Passengers carried and transport performance - National statistical institute|website=Nsi.bg|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sofia Metro ===

{{Main|Sofia Metro}}
In 1998 the first six kilometres of an often-interrupted 52&amp;nbsp;km standard gauge subway project (the [[Sofia Metro]]) opened in Sofia.&lt;ref name=cp14/&gt; Additional stations were later built, and in 2012 a second line opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/142795/EC+President,+Bulgarian+PM+Launch+2nd+Sofia+Metro+Line|title=EC President, Bulgarian PM Launch 2nd Sofia Metro Line|publisher=Novinite |date=2012-08-31|accessdate=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2015 the total length was 36&amp;nbsp;km with 31 stations and Line 2 [[Sofia Airport Metro Station|serving Sofia Airport]]. In 2016 the expansion of the network continued, as construction works on the third line commenced, and the system reached a total length of 40&amp;nbsp;km, with 35 stations along its two lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction of Sofia subway third line to begin on Jan 20|url=http://wire.seenews.com/news/construction-of-sofia-subway-third-line-to-begin-on-jan-20-509653|accessdate=13 April 2016|publisher=SEE News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, Bulgaria had some 37,300 kilometers of roads, but nearly half of which (18,000 kilometers) fell into the lowest international rating for paved roads. 324 kilometers of high-speed highways were in service in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsi1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/7203/national-road-network-road-category |title=National road network by road category|publisher=National Statistical Institute|accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nsi2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/7205/national-road-network-type-pavement|title=National road network by type of pavement|publisher=National Statistical Institute|accessdate=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2014, {{convert|19728|km|0|abbr=on}} of national roads and {{convert|610|km|0|abbr=on}} of motorways are in service and 98% of all national roads are paved.&lt;ref name=&quot;nsi1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nsi2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: As of 2002 Category IV roads are not considered national roads but are managed directly by municipalities and are not reported to the central agency.&lt;/ref&gt; Another {{convert|109|km|0|abbr=on}} of highways are under various stages of construction.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Roads have overtaken the railroads as the chief mode of freight transportation.

Long-term plans call for upgrading higher-quality roads and integrating the road system into the European grid. The focus is on improving road connectors with the neighbouring countries and domestic connections linking Sofia, Plovdiv, Burgas and Varna. Bulgaria has delayed building some key highway connections since the 1990s, but European Union membership is a strong incentive for completion. A 114-kilometer link between eastern Bulgaria and the Turkish border is scheduled for completion in 2013. As of 2004, two international highways passed through Bulgaria, and a major highway ran from Sofia to the Black Sea coast. Proposed international corridors would pass from north to south, from Vidin to the border with Greece and from Ruse to the border with Greece, and west to east, from Serbia through Sofia to Burgas, Varna, and Edirne (Turkey). The [[New Europe Bridge|Vidin-Calafat bridge]] was completed in 2013, relieving road and railroad traffic to Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22901318|title=One-mile-long bridge across Danube due to open|date=2013-06-14|accessdate=2016-05-02|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-distance public transport===
[[File:Central Bus Station Sofia 2012 PD 08 03.jpg|thumb|250px|The Central Bus Station in Sofia]]
Buses are frequently used in Bulgaria for long-distance travel. Long-distance coaches depart from Sofia from the Central, West and South Bus Stations, international routes are served by the Serdika Station. Besides public buses, coaches are also operated by private companies, like Union-Ivkoni, Biomet or Etap-Grup. Tickets can be purchased at the offices of these companies, at stations and from the bus driver. Some companies offer online booking. International destinations include [[Saloniki]], [[Istanbul]], [[Bucharest]], [[Skopje]] and [[Belgrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flipfloppeople.com/Domestic-and-International-Bus-Routes-in-Bulgaria-26|title=Buses and Coaches in Bulgaria|publisher=Flip Flop People's|accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bulgaria/transport/getting-around/bus|title=Bulgaria: Bus|accessdate=2016-05-02|publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Share taxi]]s called ''marshrutka'' operate in Sofia, and in the countryside between smaller settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bulgaria/transport/getting-around/local-transport|title=Bulgaria: Local Transport|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
