{{Politics of Botswana}}

[[Botswana]] has put a premium on economic and political integration in southern [[Africa]]. It has sought to make the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) a working vehicle for economic development, and it has promoted efforts to make the region [[Self-governance|self-policing]] in terms of preventive diplomacy, conflict resolution, and [[good governance]].  The SADC headquarters are located in [[Gaborone]], the capital of Botswana.  It has welcomed post-apartheid [[South Africa]] as a partner in these efforts. Botswana joins the [[African Consensus|African consensus]] on most major international matters and is a member of international organizations, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[African Union]]. Botswana is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).

Botswana has a small number of [[Botswana diplomatic missions|diplomatic missions]] abroad.

Botswana and the [[Soviet Union]] initiated diplomatic relations on 6 March 1970. Despite its pro-Western orientation, Botswana [[Botswana at the 1980 Summer Olympics|participated]] in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. The present-day relations between the two countries are described as friendly and long standing. In March, the two countries also celebrated the 35th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations. According to the minister of Foreign Affairs, Russia was one of the first countries to establish full diplomatic relations with Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.botswana.mid.ru/articles_relations_e_09.html |title=WE MUST EXPLOIT RUSSIA’S POTENTIAL |access-date=9 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202131955/http://www.botswana.mid.ru/articles_relations_e_09.html |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade and economic cooperation between Russia and Botswana are stipulated by the Trade Agreement of 1987 and the Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation of 1988. The Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Republic of Botswana signed the Agreement on Cultural, Scientific and Educational Cooperation in September 1999. Russia and Botswana have had fruitful cooperation in a variety of fields, particularly in human resource development. And Russia is still offering more scholarship in key sectors such as health, which is currently experiencing a critical shortage of manpower. Botswana also is one of the countries where Russian citizens do not require a visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.botswana.mid.ru/relations_e.html |title=Botswana-Russia relations |access-date=14 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329052738/http://www.botswana.mid.ru/relations_e.html |archive-date=29 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has an embassy in Gaborone, while Botswana covers Russia from its embassy in [[Stockholm]] ([[Sweden]]) and an honorary consulate in [[Moscow]].

The United States considers Botswana an advocate of and a model for stability in [[Africa]] and has been a major partner in Botswana's development since its independence. The U.S. [[Peace Corps]] returned to Botswana in August 2002 with a focus on [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]-related programs after concluding 30 years of more broadly targeted assistance in 1997. Similarly, the [[USAID]] phased out a long-standing bilateral partnership with Botswana in 1996, after successful programs emphasizing education, training, [[entrepreneurship]], environmental management, and [[reproductive health]]. Botswana, however, continues to benefit along with its neighbours in the region from USAID's Initiative for Southern Africa, now based in [[Pretoria]], and USAID's Southern Africa Global Competitiveness Hub, headquartered in [[Gaborone]]. The United States International Board of Broadcasters (IBB) operates a major [[Voice of America]] (VOA) relay station in Botswana serving most of the African continent.

In 1995, the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) started the BOTUSA Project in collaboration with the Botswana Ministry of Health in order to generate information to improve [[tuberculosis]] control efforts in Botswana and elsewhere in the face of the TB and HIV/AIDS co-epidemics. Under the 1999 U.S. Government's Leadership and Investment in Fighting an Epidemic (LIFE) Initiative, CDC through the BOTUSA Project has undertaken many projects and has assisted many organizations in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Botswana. Botswana is one of the 15 focus countries for PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, and has received more than $230 million since the program began in January 2004 through September 2007. PEPFAR assistance to Botswana, which totalled $76.2 million in FY 2007, is contributing to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care interventions.

The Governments of Botswana and the United States entered into an agreement in July 2000 to establish an International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in Gaborone. The academy, jointly financed, managed and staffed by the two nations, provides training to [[police]] and government officials from across the Sub-Saharan region. The academy's permanent campus, in [[Otse]] outside of Gaborone, opened March 2003. Over 3,000 law enforcement professionals from Sub-Saharan Africa have received training from ILEA since it began offering classes in 2001.

Botswana still struggles to seal its border from thousands of Zimbabweans who flee economic collapse and political persecution. In 2015, 22,000 Zimbabweans were arrested and deported. This has increased to nearly 29,000 deportations in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voanews.com/africa/botswana-battles-influx-zimbabwean-illegal-immigrants|title=Botswana Battles Influx of Zimbabwean Illegal Immigrants|last=Dube|first=Mqondisi|date=August 14, 2019|website=Voice of America|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
