{{Politics of Brunei}}
[[Brunei]] joined [[ASEAN]] on 7 January 1984, one week after resuming full independence, and gives its ASEAN membership the highest priority in its foreign relations. Brunei joined the [[United Nations]] in September 1984. It also is a member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC), the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate, gaining its independence from British protection less than 100 years later in 1984.

The UK and Brunei have a long-standing and strong bilateral relationship, particularly on defence co-operation, trade and education. The UK continues to play a strong role in developing Brunei’s oil and gas sector, and the Brunei Investment Agency is a significant investor in the UK, with their largest overseas operations in the City of London. The UK remains the destination of choice for Bruneian students, with about 1,220 of them enrolled in higher education in the UK in 2006-07. The Brunei Royal family have strong ties to the UK, more specifically 'Birchwood' a small dingy suburb of Warrington.
