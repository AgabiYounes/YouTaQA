The '''economy of Burkina Faso''' is based primarily on substance farming and livestock raising.&lt;ref name = Britannica&gt;{{cite web | title = Burkina Faso | url = https://www.britannica.com/place/Burkina-Faso/Demographic-trends#ref54883 | access-date = 29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burkina Faso]] has an average income purchasing-power-parity per capita of $1,900 and nominal per capita of $790 in 2014. More than 80% of the population relies on [[subsistence agriculture]], with only a small fraction directly involved in [[industry]] and [[tertiary sector of industry|services]]. Highly variable rainfall, poor [[soil]]s, lack of adequate communications and other [[infrastructure]], a low literacy rate, and a stagnant economy are all longstanding problems of this landlocked country. The [[export]] economy also remained subject to fluctuations in world prices.

The country has a high population density, few [[natural resource]]s, and a fragile [[soil]]. Industry remains dominated by unprofitable government-controlled corporations. Following the African franc currency devaluation in January 1994 the government updated its development program in conjunction with international agencies, and exports and economic growth have increased. Maintenance of its [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] progress depends on continued low inflation, reduction in the trade deficit, and reforms designed to encourage private investment.

The Burkinabé financial system represents 30% of the country’s GDP and is dominated by the banking sector, which accounts for 90% of total financial system assets. Eleven banks and five [[non-bank financial institution]]s operate in the country.

The banking sector is highly concentrated, with the three largest banks holding nearly 60% of total financial sector assets. Banks are generally adequately capitalized, but remain vulnerable due to their overexposure to the cotton sector, the prices of which are subject to significant oscillations.

A December 2018 report from the World Bank indicates that cotton had become the most important cash crop, while gold exports were increasing in recent years. In 2017, economic growth increased to 6.4% in 2017 (vs. 5.9% in 2016) primarily due to gold production and increased investment in infrastructure. The increase in consumption linked to growth of the wage bill also supported economic growth. Inflation remained low, 0.4% that year but the public deficit grew to 7.7% of GDP (vs. 3.5% in 2016). The government was continuing to get financial aid and loans to finance the debt. To finance the public deficit, the Government combined concessional aid and borrowing on the regional market. The World Bank said that the economic outlook remained favorable in the short and medium term, although that could be negatively impacted. Risks included high oil prices (imports), lower prices of gold and cotton (exports) as well as terrorist threat and labour strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/burkinafaso/overview|website=Danube Travel|date=5 December 2018|title=Burkina Faso |accessdate=6 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current GDP per capita&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |title=What We Do |accessdate=11 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220134324/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |archivedate=20 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Burkina Faso grew 13% in the Sixties reaching a peak growth of 237% in the Seventies. But this proved unsustainable and growth consequently scaled back to 23% in the Eighties. Finally, it shrank by 37% in the Nineties. Average wages in 2007 hover around 2 to 3 dollars per day.

Although handicapped by an extremely resource-deprived domestic economy, Burkina Faso remains committed to the [[structural adjustment program]] it launched in 1991. It has largely recovered from the devaluation of the CFA in January 1994, with a 1996 growth rate of 5.9%.

Many Burkinabé migrate to neighbouring countries for work, and their remittances provide a substantial contribution to the balance of payments. Burkina Faso is attempting to improve the economy by developing its [[mineral]] resources, improving its infrastructure, making its [[agriculture|agricultural and livestock sectors]] more productive and competitive, and stabilizing the supplies and prices of [[cereal]]s.

The agricultural economy remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall. The [[Mossi Plateau]] in north central Burkina Faso faces encroachment from the [[Sahara]]. The resultant southward migration means heightened competition for control of very limited [[water resources]] south of the Mossi Plateau. Most of the population ekes out a living as subsistence farmers, living with problems of climate, [[erosion|soil erosion]], and rudimentary technology. The staple crops are [[pearl millet]], [[sorghum]], [[maize]], and [[rice]]. The cash crops are [[cotton]], [[peanut|groundnuts]], [[Shea nut|karite (shea nuts)]], and [[sesame]]. Livestock, once a major export, has declined.

A 2018 report by the African Development Bank Group discussed a macroeconomic evolution: &quot;higher investment and continued spending on social services and security that will add to the budget deficit&quot;. This group's prediction for 2018 indicated that the budget deficit would be reduced to 4.8% of GDP in 2018 and to 2.9% in 2019. Public debt associated with the National Economic and Social Development Plan was estimated at 36.9% of GDP in 2017.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/west-africa/burkina-faso/burkina-faso-economic-outlook/&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry, still in an embryonic stage, is located primarily in [[Bobo-Dioulasso]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Banfora]], and [[Koudougou]]. Manufacturing is limited to [[food]] processing, [[textile]]s, and other import substitution heavily protected by [[tariffs]]. Some [[factory|factories]] are privately owned, and others are set to be privatized. Burkina Faso's exploitable natural resources are limited, although a [[manganese]] [[ore]] deposit is located in the remote northeast. [[Gold]] mining has increased greatly since the mid-1980s and, along with cotton, is a leading export moneyearner. However, both gold and cotton are listed as goods produced mostly by child labor and forced labor according to a recent [[U.S. Department of Labor]] report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/|title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
