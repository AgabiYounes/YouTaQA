In [[Greek mythology]], '''Daedalus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɛ|d|əl|ə|s|_|ˈ|d|iː|d|əl|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Δαίδαλος}} ''Daidalos'' &quot;cunningly wrought&quot;, perhaps related to δαιδάλλω &quot;to work artfully&quot; or “of knowledge”;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|Daedalus}}; [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]: ''Taitale'') was a skillful architect, craftsman and artist, and was seen as a symbol of wisdom, knowledge, and power.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This is the workshop of Daedalus,&quot; wrote [[Philostratus of Lemnos]] in ''Immagines'' (1.16), &quot;and about it are statues, some with forms blocked out, others in a quite complete state in that they are already stepping forward and give promise of walking about. Before the time of Daedalus, you know, the art of making statues had not yet conceived such a thing.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frontisi-Ducroux|first=Françoise|title=Dédale: Mythologie de l'artisan en Grèce Ancienne|year=1975|publisher=François Maspero|location=Paris|pages=227}}. Cf. [[:fr:Françoise Frontisi-Ducroux|Frontisi-Ducroux]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the father of [[Icarus]], the uncle of [[Perdix (mythology)|Perdix]], and possibly also the father of [[Iapyx]], although this is unclear. He invented and built the [[Labyrinth]] for King [[Minos]] of [[Crete]], but shortly after finishing it King Minos had Daedalus imprisoned within the labyrinth. He and his son Icarus devised a plan to escape by using wings made of wax that Daedalus had invented. They escaped, but sadly Icarus did not heed his father's warnings and flew too close to the sun. The wax melted and Icarus fell to his death. This left Daedalus heartbroken, but instead of giving up he flew to the island of [[Sicily]].

==Family==
Daedalus's parentage was supplied as a later addition, providing him with a father in [[Metion]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Library of History'', 4. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Eupalamus,&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 39 and 274; [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on ''[[Aeneid]]'' 6. 14&lt;/ref&gt; or Palamaon,&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 9. 3. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and a mother, [[Alcippe (Greek mythology)|Alcippe]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3. 15. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iphinoe (mythology)|Iphinoe]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', 468&lt;/ref&gt; or Phrasmede.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia on [[Plato]], ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]'', p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; Daedalus had two sons: [[Icarus]]&lt;ref&gt;By Naucrate, a female slave of Minos, according to pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' Epitome of Book IV, 1. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iapyx]],&lt;ref&gt;By a certain Cretan woman, who may or may not be the same as Naucrate [[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 6. 3. 2&lt;/ref&gt; along with a nephew either [[Talos (inventor)|Talos]] or [[Perdix (mythology)|Perdix]].

[[Athens|Athenians]] transferred [[Crete|Cretan]] Daedalus to make him Athenian-born, the grandson&lt;ref&gt;The son of Eupalamus, according to [[Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 39 ([http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AthenaFavour.html#Perdix on-line translation at TheoiProject]).&lt;/ref&gt; of the ancient king [[Erechtheus]], claiming that Daedalus fled to Crete after killing his nephew [[Talos (inventor)|Talos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorecrete.com/mythology/daedalus.html|title=Daedalus, the great inventor Daedalus|website=www.explorecrete.com|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, other stories were told of Daedalus.

== Mythology ==

===The Labyrinth===
Daedalus is first mentioned by [[Homer]] as the creator of a wide dancing-ground for [[Ariadne]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' xviii, 590-3; the passage is often cited as a vivid and authentic reminiscence of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]] encapsulated in the orally transmitted tradition, as in Alfred Burns, &quot;The Chorus of Ariadne&quot; ''Classical Journal'', '''70'''.2 (December 1974 - January 1975:1-12): bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; He also created the [[Labyrinth]] on [[Crete]], in which the [[Minotaur]] (part man, part bull) was kept. In the story of the labyrinth as told by the [[Greeks#Hellenes|Hellenes]], the Athenian hero [[Theseus]] is challenged to kill the Minotaur, finding his way with the help of [[Ariadne's thread]]. Daedalus' appearance in Homer is in an extended metaphor, &quot;plainly not Homer's invention&quot;, [[Robin Lane Fox]] observes: &quot;He is a point of comparison and so he belongs in stories which Homer's audience already recognized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2009:187, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bronze Age Crete, an inscription ''da-da-re-jo-de'' has been read as referring to a place at Knossos,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The word ''da-da-re-jo-de'' on a has been interpreted as meaning Daidaleionde— &quot;towards&quot; or &quot;into the Daidaleion,&quot; and [[Karl Kerenyi|K. Kerenyi]] conjectures that it may refer to the ''choros'' that Daedalus is supposed to have built for Ariadne&quot; (Burns 1974/75:3; the Kerenyi assertion is in an article in ''Atti e memorie del primo congresso internazionale del micenologia, 1967'', vol. II, Rome 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; and a place of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Fox is unconvinced; other scholars urging caution in making connections with Daedalus are noted by Fox 2009:188 note 6: S.P. Morris, ''Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art'', 1992:76f, and L.M. Bendall, ''Economics of Religion in the Mycenaean World'', 2007:17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Homer's language, ''[[daidala]]'' refers to finely crafted objects. They are mostly objects of [[armor]], but fine bowls and furnishings are also ''daidala'', and on one occasion so are the &quot;bronze-working&quot; of &quot;clasps, twisted brooches, earrings and necklaces&quot; made by [[Hephaestus]] while cared for in secret by the goddesses of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 2009:187f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignoring Homer, later writers envisaged the Labyrinth as an edifice rather than a single dancing path to the center and out again, and gave it numberless winding passages and turns that opened into one another, seeming to have neither beginning nor end.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[labyrinth]] and [[maze]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]], in his ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', suggests that Daedalus constructed the Labyrinth so cunningly that he himself could barely escape it after he built it.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: From Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', 1992:36, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Daedalus built the labyrinth for King [[Minos]], who needed it to imprison his wife's son the Minotaur. The story is told that [[Poseidon]] had given a white bull to Minos so that he might use it as a sacrifice. Instead, Minos kept it for himself; and in revenge, Poseidon, with the help of [[Aphrodite]], made [[Pasiphaë]], King Minos's wife, lust for the bull.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Hamilton, ''Mythology'', (1942) 1998:151, {{ISBN|0-451-62702-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For Pasiphaë, as Greek mythologers interpreted it, Daedalus also built a wooden cow so she could mate with the bull, for the Greeks imagined the Minoan [[Bull (mythology)|bull of the sun]] to be an actual, earthly bull, &lt;!--Another interpretation equates the wooden cow with metaphorical human folly. Though divinely inspired, a well-meaning and loyal, yet fallible man contrived a human mechanism that facilitated the creation of a proverbial monster. The Minotaur abomination that devoured men for sustenance.--&gt; the slaying of which later required a heroic effort by Theseus.

===Daedalus and Icarus===
[[File:Charles Le Brun - Daedalus and Icarus - WGA12535.jpg|thumb| ''Daedalus and Icarus'', c. 1645, by [[Charles Le Brun]] (1619–1690) ]]
The most familiar literary telling explaining Daedalus' wings is a late one, that of Ovid: in his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (VIII:183–235) Daedalus was shut up in a tower to prevent the knowledge of his Labyrinth from spreading to the public. He could not leave Crete by sea, as the king kept a strict watch on all vessels, permitting none to sail without being carefully searched. Since Minos controlled the land and sea routes, Daedalus set to work to fabricate wings for himself and his young son [[Icarus]]. He tied feathers together, from smallest to largest so as to form an increasing surface. He secured the feathers at their midpoints with string and at their bases with wax, and gave the whole a gentle curvature like the wings of a bird. When the work was done, the artist, waving his wings, found himself buoyed upward and hung suspended, poising himself on the beaten air. He next equipped his son in the same manner, and taught him how to fly. When both were prepared for flight, Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too high, because the heat of the sun would melt the wax, nor too low, because the sea foam would soak the feathers.

[[File:Herbert Draper - The Lament for Icarus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Lament for Icarus]]'' by [[Herbert James Draper|H. J. Draper]] (1898)]]

They had passed [[Samos]], [[Delos]] and [[Lebynthos]] by the time the boy, forgetting himself, began to soar upward toward the sun. The blazing sun softened the wax that held the feathers together and they came off. Icarus quickly fell in the sea and drowned. His father cried, bitterly lamenting his own arts, and called the island near the place where Icarus fell into the ocean [[Icaria]] in memory of his child. Some time later, the goddess Athena visited Daedalus and gave him wings, telling him to fly like a god.

An early image of winged Daedalus appears on an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] jug of ca 630 BC found at [[Cerveteri]], where a winged figure captioned ''Taitale'' appears on one side of the vessel, paired on the other side, uniquely, with ''Metaia'', [[Medea]]:&lt;ref&gt;Erika Simon, &quot;Daidalos-Taitale-Daedalus: neues zu einem wohlbekannten Mythos&quot;, ''Archäologischer Anzeiger'' (2004:419-22).&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;its linking of these two mythical figures is unparalleled,&quot; Robin Lane Fox observes: &quot;The link was probably based on their wondrous, miraculous art. Magically, Daedalus could fly, and magically Medea was able to rejuvenate the old (the scene on the jug seems to show her doing just this)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fox 2009:189.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of Daedalus demonstrates that he was already well known in the West.

===Sicily===
Further to the west Daedalus arrived safely in [[Sicily]], in the care of King [[Cocalus]] of Kamikos on the island's south coast; there Daedalus built a temple to [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], and hung up his wings, an offering to the god. In an invention of [[Virgil]] (''[[Aeneid]]'' VI), Daedalus flies to [[Cumae]] and founds his temple there, rather than in Sicily; long afterward Aeneas confronts the sculpted golden doors of the temple.

[[Minos]], meanwhile, searched for Daedalus by traveling from city to city asking a riddle. He presented a spiral seashell and asked for a string to be run through it. When he reached Kamikos, King Cocalus, knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle, privately fetched the old man to him. He tied the string to an ant which, lured by a drop of honey at one end, walked through the seashell stringing it all the way through. Minos then knew Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and demanded he be handed over. Cocalus managed to convince Minos to take a bath first, where Cocalus' daughters killed Minos. In some versions, Daedalus himself poured boiling water on Minos and killed him.

The anecdotes are literary and late; however, in the founding tales of the Greek colony of [[Gela]], founded in the 680s on the southwest coast of Sicily, a tradition was preserved that the Greeks had seized [[cult image]]s wrought by Daedalus from their local predecessors, the [[Sicani]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], viii.46.2, ix.40.3-4; T.J. Dunbabin, ''The Western Greeks'', 1948; S.P. Morris, ''Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art'' (1992:199), all noted by Fox 2009:189 note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Daedalus and Perdix ===
Daedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the idea of a rival. His sister had placed her son, named variously as [[Perdix (mythology)|Perdix]], Talos, or Calos,&lt;ref&gt;In Hyginus, ''Fabulae'', 39 Perdix is the name of the nephew; but according to ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' 3. 15. 8 and the dictionary of [[Suda]] (s. v. ''Perdikos hieron''), Perdix is the name of Daedalus' sister and Talos is her son, nephew of Daedalus. The latter source also states that Perdix had a sanctuary dedicated to her near the [[Acropolis]].&lt;/ref&gt; under his charge to be taught the mechanical arts. The nephew was an art scholar and showed striking evidence of ingenuity. Walking on the seashore, he picked up the spine of a fish. According to Ovid, imitating it, he took a piece of iron and notched it on the edge, and thus invented the saw. He put two pieces of iron together, connecting them at one end with a rivet, and sharpening the other ends, and made a pair of compasses.&lt;ref&gt;Both inventions are in Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' viii.236&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--uncited assertion: It is also said that he invented a way to transfer the soul of a human being into a machine, therefore creating a machine with a soul and rendering the soul immortal.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}--&gt; Daedalus was so envious of his nephew's accomplishments that he took an opportunity and caused him to fall from the Acropolis. Athena turned Perdix into a [[Perdix|partridge]] and left a scar that looked like a partridge on Daedalus' right shoulder{{Citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Query: What original text claims this?}} and Daedalus left Athens due to this.

==Innovator==
Such anecdotal details as these were embroideries upon the reputation of Daedalus as an innovator in many arts. In [[Pliny's Natural History]] (7.198) he is credited with inventing carpentry &quot;and with it the saw, axe, plumb-line, drill, glue, and [[isinglass]]&quot;. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], in travelling around Greece, attributed to Daedalus numerous archaic wooden [[cult figure]]s (see ''[[xoanon|xoana]]'') that impressed him: &quot;All the works of this artist, though somewhat uncouth to look at, nevertheless have a touch of the divine in them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' ii.4.5. Pausanias listed existing works that were attributed to Daedalus in the second century AD, ''Description'' ix.40.3&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said he first conceived masts and sails for ships for the navy of Minos. He is said to have carved statues so well they looked as if alive; even possessing self-motion. They would have escaped if not for the chain that bound them to the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daedalus gave his name, [[eponym]]ously, to any Greek artificer and to many Greek contraptions that represented dextrous skill. At [[Plataea]] there was a festival, the [[Daedala]], in which a temporary wooden altar was fashioned, and an effigy was made from an oak-tree and dressed in bridal attire. It was carried in a cart with a woman who acted as bridesmaid. The image was called ''Daedale'' and the archaic ritual given an explanation through a myth to the purpose

In the period of [[Romanticism]], Daedalus came to denote the classic artist, a skilled mature craftsman, while [[Icarus]] symbolized the romantic artist, whose impetuous, passionate and rebellious nature, as well as his defiance of formal aesthetic and social conventions, may ultimately prove to be self-destructive. [[Stephen Dedalus]], in Joyce's ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' envisages his future artist-self &quot;a winged form flying above the waves ... a hawk-like man flying sunward above the sea, a prophecy of the end he had been born to serve”.

===Daedalus's statues===
Daedalus is said to have created statues that were so realistic that they had to be tied down to stop them from wandering off. In ''Meno'', Socrates and Meno are debating the nature of knowledge and true belief when Socrates refers to Daedalus' statues: &quot;... if they are not fastened up they play truant and run away; but, if fastened, they stay where they are.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meno|last=Beresford (translation of Plato)|first=Adam |publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=97a-98b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
