{{Table Numeral Systems}}
The '''decimal''' [[numeral system]] (also called '''base-[[10 (number)|ten]]''' [[positional numeral system]], and occasionally called '''denary''' or '''decanary''') is the standard system for denoting [[integer]] and non-integer [[number]]s. It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Arithmetic'', [[Louis Charles Karpinski]], 200pp, Rand McNally &amp; Company, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as ''decimal notation''.&lt;ref&gt;Lam Lay Yong &amp; Ang Tian Se (2004) ''Fleeting Footsteps. Tracing the Conception of Arithmetic and Algebra in Ancient China'', Revised Edition, World Scientific, Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''decimal numeral'', or just ''decimal'', or casually ''decimal number'', refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. Decimals may sometimes be identified for containing a [[decimal mark|decimal separator]] (for example the &quot;.&quot; in {{math|10.00}} or {{math|3.14159}}). &quot;Decimal&quot; may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in &quot;{{math|3.14}} is the approximation of {{pi}} to ''two decimals''&quot;.

The numbers that may be represented in the decimal system are the [[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]], that is the [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] of the form {{math|''a''/10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an integer, and {{math|''n''}} is a [[non-negative integer]]. 

The decimal system has been extended to ''infinite decimals'', for representing any [[real number]], by using an [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] of digits after the decimal separator (see [[Decimal representation]]). In this context, the decimal numerals with a finite number of non–zero places after the decimal separator are sometimes called ''terminating decimals''. A [[repeating decimal]] is an infinite decimal that after some place repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (for example {{math|1=5.123144144144144... = 5.123{{overline|144}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum (overline)]] in 5.123&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;144&lt;/span&gt; indicates that the '144' sequence repeats indefinitely, i.e. {{val|5.123144144144144|s=...}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An infinite decimal represents a [[rational number]] if and only if it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of nonzero digits.

==Origin==
[[File:Two hand, ten fingers.jpg|thumb|right|Ten fingers on two hands, the possible starting point of decimal counting.]]
Many [[numeral system]]s of ancient civilisations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, possibly because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers. Examples are [[Brahmi numerals]], [[Greek numerals]], [[Hebrew numerals]], [[Roman numerals]], and [[Chinese numerals]]. Very large numbers were difficult to represent in these old numeral systems, and only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulties were completely solved with the introduction of the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] for representing [[integer]]s. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called ''[[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]]'' or ''decimal numbers'' for forming the ''decimal numeral system''.

== Decimal notation ==
For writing numbers, the decimal  system uses ten [[decimal digit]]s, a [[decimal mark]], and, for [[negative number]]s, a [[minus sign]] &quot;−&quot;. The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;&lt;ref&gt;In some countries, such as [[Arab language|Arab speaking]] ones, other [[glyph]]s are used for the digits&lt;/ref&gt; the decimal separator is the dot &quot;{{math|.}}&quot; in many countries (including all English speaking ones), but may be a comma &quot;{{math|,}}&quot; in other countries (mainly in [[continental Europe]]).

For representing a [[non-negative number]], a decimal consists of
* either a (finite) sequence of digits such as 2017, or in full generality,
::&lt;math&gt;a_ma_{m-1}\ldots a_0&lt;/math&gt;
:(in this case, the (entire) decimal represents an integer)
* or two sequence of digits separated by a decimal mark such as 3.14159, 15.00, or in full generality
::&lt;math&gt;a_ma_{m-1}\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\ldots b_n&lt;/math&gt;
It is generally assumed that, if {{math|''m'' &gt; 0}}, the first digit {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not zero, but, in some circumstances, it may be useful to have one or more 0's on the left. This does not change the value represented by the decimal. For example, {{math|1=3.14 = 03.14 = 003.14}}. Similarly, if {{math|1=''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; =0}}, it may be removed, and conversely, trailing zeros may be added without changing the represented number: for example, {{math|1=15 = 15.0 = 15.00}} and {{math|1=5.2 = 5.20 = 5.200}}&amp;nbsp;. Sometimes the extra zeros are used for indicating the accuracy of a measurement. For example, 15.00&amp;nbsp;m may indicate that the measurement error is less than one centimeter (0.01&amp;nbsp;m), while 15&amp;nbsp;m may mean that the length is roughly fifteen meters, and that the error may exceed 10&amp;nbsp;cm.

For representing a [[negative number]], a minus sign is placed before {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The numeral &lt;math&gt;a_ma_{m-1}\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\ldots b_n&lt;/math&gt; represents the number
:&lt;math&gt;a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\cdots+a_{0}10^0+\frac{b_1}{10^1}+\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\cdots+\frac{b_n}{10^n}&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the contribution of each digit to the value of a number depends on its position in the numeral. That is, the decimal system is a [[positional numeral system]]

== Decimal fractions ==

The numbers that are represented by decimal numerals are the '''decimal fractions''' (sometimes called '''decimal numbers'''), that is, the [[rational number]]s that may be expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the [[denominator]] of which is a [[exponentiation|power]] of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Decimal_fraction|title=Decimal Fraction|work=[[Encyclopedia of Mathematics]]|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the numerals &lt;math&gt;0.8, 14.89, 0.00024&lt;/math&gt; represent the fractions {{math|{{sfrac|8|10}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|1489|100}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|24|100000}}}}. More generally, a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the separator represents the fraction with denominator {{math|10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator.

Expressed as a [[fully reduced fraction]], the decimal numbers are those whose denominator is a product of a power of 2 and a power of 5. Thus the smallest denominators of decimal numbers are
:&lt;math&gt;1=2^0\cdot 5^0, 2=2^1\cdot 5^0, 4=2^2\cdot 5^0, 5=2^0\cdot 5^1, 8=2^3\cdot 5^0, 10=2^1\cdot 5^1, 16=2^4\cdot 5^0, 25=2^0\cdot 5^2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- The remainder of the section seems misplaced here --&gt;The ''[[integer part]]'' or ''integral part'' of a decimal is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator (see also [[truncation]]). For a non-negative decimal, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the decimal separator to the right is the ''[[fractional part]]'', which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part.

When the integral part of a numeral is zero, it may occur, typically in [[computing]], that the integer part is not written (for example {{math|.1234}}, instead of {{math|0.1234}}). In normal writing, this is generally avoided because of the risk of confusion between the decimal mark and other punctuation.

==Real number approximation==

Decimal numerals do not allow an exact representation for all [[real number]]s, e.g. for the real number [[pi|{{pi}}]]. Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates the real {{pi}}, being less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; off; and so decimals are widely used in [[science]], [[engineering]] and everyday life.

More precisely, for every real number ''x'', and every positive integer ''n'', there are two decimals ''L'' and ''u'', with at most ''n'' digits after the decimal mark, such that ''L'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''u'' and (''u'' – ''L'') = 10&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

Numbers are very often obtained as the result of a [[measurement]]. As measurements are generally afflicted with some [[measurement error]] with a known [[upper bound]], the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolute measurement error is bounded from above by 10&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same decimal number, the numeral 0.080 suggests a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also [[significant figures]]).

==Infinite decimal expansion==
{{main|Decimal representation}}

For a [[real number]] ''x'' and an integer ''n'' ≥ 0, let [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the (finite) decimal expansion of the greatest number that is not greater than ''x'', which has exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark. Let ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the last digit of [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is straightforward to see that [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; may be obtained by appending ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to the right of [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''–1&lt;/sub&gt;. This way one has
:[''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,

and the difference of [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''–1&lt;/sub&gt; and [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; amounts to 
:|[''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; − [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''–1&lt;/sub&gt;| = ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ 10&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;,

which is either 0, if ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, or gets arbitrarily small, when ''n'' tends to infinity. According to the definition of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], ''x'' is the limit of [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; when ''n'' tends to [[infinity]]. This is written as &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\; x = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} [x]_n \;&lt;/math&gt; or
: ''x'' = [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;...,
which is called an '''infinite decimal expansion''' of ''x''.

Conversely, for any integer [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and any sequence of digits &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\;(d_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; the (infinite) expression  {{nowrap|[''x'']&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;...}} is an ''infinite decimal expansion'' of a real number ''x''. This expansion is  unique if neither all ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to 9 nor all ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to 0 for ''n'' large enough (for all ''n'' greater than some natural number ''N'').

If all ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' &gt; ''N'' equal to 9 and {{nowrap|[''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,}} the limit of the sequence &lt;math display=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;\;([x]_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is the decimal fraction obtained by replacing the last digit that is not a 9, i.e.: ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, by ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; + 1, and replacing all subsequent 9s by 0s (see [[0.999...]]).

Any such decimal fraction, i.e., ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for ''n'' &gt; ''N'', may be converted to its equivalent infinite decimal expansion by replacing ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; − 1, and replacing all subsequent 0s by 9s (see [[0.999...]]).

In summary, every real number that is not a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion. Each decimal fraction has exactly two infinite decimal expansions, one containing only 0s after some place, which is obtained by the above definition of [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and the other containing only 9s after some place, which is obtained by defining [''x'']&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as the greatest number that is ''less'' than ''x'', having exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark.

=== Rational numbers ===
{{main|Repeating decimal}}

[[Long division]] allows computing the infinite decimal expansion of a [[rational number]]. If the rational number is a [[#decimal fraction|decimal fraction]], the division stops eventually, producing a decimal numeral, which may be prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many zeros. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainders are less than the divisor, there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a ''repeating decimal''. For example,
:{{sfrac|81}} = 0.&amp;thinsp;012345679&amp;thinsp;012... (with the group 012345679 indefinitely repeating).

Conversely, every eventually repeating sequence of digits is the infinite decimal expansion of a rational number. This is a consequence of the fact that the recurring part of a decimal representation is, in fact, an infinite [[geometric series]] which will sum to a rational number. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;0.0123123123\ldots =\frac{123}{10000} \sum_{k=0}^\infty 0.001^k = \frac{123}{10000}\ \frac{1}{1-0.001} = \frac{123}{9990} = \frac{41}{3330}&lt;/math&gt;

== Decimal computation ==

[[File:Decimal multiplication table.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the world's earliest multiplication table ({{circa}} 305 BC) from the Warring States period]]

Most modern [[computer]] hardware and software systems commonly use a [[Binary numeral system|binary representation]] internally (although many early computers, such as the [[ENIAC]] or the [[IBM 650]], used decimal representation internally).&lt;ref&gt;''Fingers or Fists? (The Choice of Decimal or Binary Representation)'', [[Werner Buchholz]], Communications of the ACM, Vol. 2 #12, pp3–11, ACM Press, December 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;
For external use by computer specialists, this binary representation is sometimes presented in the related [[octal]] or [[hexadecimal]] systems.

For most purposes, however, binary values are converted to or from the equivalent decimal values for presentation to or input from humans; computer programs express literals in decimal by default. (123.1, for example, is written as such in a computer program, even though many computer languages are unable to encode that number precisely.)

Both computer hardware and software also use internal representations which are effectively decimal for storing decimal values and doing arithmetic. Often this arithmetic is done on data which are encoded using some variant of [[binary-coded decimal]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmid_1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |author=Schmid&lt;!-- General Electric Company, Binghamton, New York, USA --&gt; |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |orig-year=1974 |date=1983 |edition=1 (reprint) |publisher=Robert E.

Soc., June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Decimal arithmetic is used in computers so that decimal fractional results of adding (or subtracting) values with a fixed length of their fractional part always are computed to this same length of precision. This is especially important for financial calculations, e.g., requiring in their results integer multiples of the smallest currency unit for book keeping purposes. This is not possible in binary, because the negative powers of &lt;math&gt;10&lt;/math&gt; have no finite binary fractional representation; and is generally impossible for multiplication (or division).&lt;ref&gt;[http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decifaq.html Decimal Arithmetic – FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dec.usc.es/arith16/papers/paper-107.pdf Decimal Floating-Point: Algorism for Computers], [[Cowlishaw]], M.

[[File:Qinghuajian, Suan Biao.jpg|thumb|upright|The world's earliest decimal multiplication table was made from bamboo slips, dating from 305 BC, during the [[Warring States]] period in China.]]

The Egyptian hieratic numerals, the Greek alphabet numerals, the Hebrew alphabet numerals, the Roman numerals, the Chinese numerals and early Indian Brahmi numerals are all non-positional decimal systems, and required large numbers of symbols. For instance, Egyptian numerals used different symbols for 10, 20, to 90, 100, 200, to 900, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, to 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lam Lay Yong]] et al.

Decimal fractions were first developed and used by the Chinese in the end of 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0425/57954.html |title=Ancient bamboo slips for calculation enter world records book |date= |language=English |website=The Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences |accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then spread to the Middle East and from there to Europe.&lt;ref name=Lam/&gt;&lt;ref name=jnfractn1&gt;{{Cite book | author=Joseph Needham | author-link=Joseph Needham | chapter = Decimal System | title = [[Science and Civilisation in China|Science and Civilisation in China, Volume III, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth]] | year = 1959 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The written Chinese decimal fractions were non-positional.&lt;ref name=jnfractn1/&gt; However, [[Rod calculus#Fractions|counting rod fractions]] were positional.&lt;ref name=Lam&gt;[[Lam Lay Yong]], &quot;The Development of Hindu–Arabic and Traditional Chinese Arithmetic&quot;, ''Chinese Science'', 1996 p38, Kurt Vogel notation&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Lennart Berggren notes that positional decimal fractions appear for the first time in a book by the Arab mathematician [[Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi]] written in the 10th century.&lt;ref name=Berggren&gt;{{cite book | first=J.

A forerunner of modern European decimal notation was introduced by Simon Stevin in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=van&gt;{{Cite book | author = B. L. van der Waerden | author-link = Bartel Leendert van der Waerden | year = 1985 | title = A History of Algebra.

=== Natural languages ===
A method of expressing every possible [[natural number]] using a set of ten symbols emerged in India. Several Indian languages show a straightforward decimal system. Many [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian languages]] have numbers between 10 and 20 expressed in a regular pattern of addition to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html|title=Indian numerals|work=Ancient Indian mathematics|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hungarian language]] also uses a straightforward decimal system. All numbers between 10 and 20 are formed regularly (e.g. 11 is expressed as &quot;tizenegy&quot; literally &quot;one on ten&quot;), as with those between 20 and 100 (23 as &quot;huszonhárom&quot; = &quot;three on twenty&quot;).

A straightforward decimal rank system with a word for each order (10 {{lang|zh|十}}, 100 {{lang|zh|百}}, 1000 {{lang|zh|千}}, 10,000 {{lang|zh|万}}), and in which 11 is expressed as ''ten-one'' and 23 as ''two-ten-three'', and 89,345 is expressed as 8 (ten thousands) {{lang|zh|万}} 9 (thousand) {{lang|zh|千}} 3 (hundred) {{lang|zh|百}} 4 (tens) {{lang|zh|十}} 5 is found in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with a few irregularities.  [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for the numbers between 10 and 20, and decades. For example, in English 11 is  &quot;eleven&quot; not &quot;ten-one&quot; or &quot;one-teen&quot;.

Incan languages such as [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as ''ten with one'' and 23 as ''two-ten with three''.

Some psychologists suggest irregularities of the English names of numerals may hinder children's counting ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Azar| first=Beth| year=1999| title=English words may hinder math skills development| url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr99/english.html  |journal=American Psychology Association Monitor| volume=30| issue=4 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021015527/http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr99/english.html |archivedate = 2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other bases ===

Some cultures do, or did, use other bases of numbers.
* [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures such as the [[Maya numerals|Maya]] used a [[vigesimal|base-20]] system (perhaps based on using all twenty fingers and [[toe]]s).
* The [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]] language in [[California]] and the Pamean languages&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of words and glosses meaning that the count is in decimal (cognates to &quot;ten-count&quot; or &quot;tenty-wise&quot;); such would be expected if normal counting is not decimal, and unusual if it were.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The descriptions like &quot;long&quot; only appear after the &quot;small hundred&quot; of 100 appeared with the Christians. Gordon's [https://www.scribd.com/doc/49127454/Introduction-to-Old-Norse-by-E-V-Gordon Introduction to Old Norse] p 293, gives number names that belong to this system. An expression cognate to 'one hundred and eighty' translates to 200, and the cognate to 'two hundred' translates to 240. [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_123/123_395_418.pdf Goodare] details the use of the long hundred in Scotland in the Middle Ages, giving examples such as calculations where the carry implies i C (i.e. one hundred) as 120, etc. That the general population were not alarmed to encounter such numbers suggests common enough use. It is also possible to avoid hundred-like numbers by using intermediate units, such as stones and pounds, rather than a long count of pounds. Goodare gives examples of numbers like vii score, where one avoids the hundred by using extended scores. There is also a paper by W.H. Stevenson, on 'Long Hundred and its uses in England'.  {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
