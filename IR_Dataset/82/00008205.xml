After [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]]'s death in 1976, Deng gradually rose to power and led China through a series of [[Chinese economic reform|far-reaching market-economy reforms]], which earned him the reputation  as the &quot;Architect of Modern China.&quot;

Born into an educated land-owning family in [[Sichuan province]], Deng studied and worked in France in the 1920s, where he became a follower of [[Marxism–Leninism]]. He joined the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1923. Upon returning to China, Deng joined the party organization in Shanghai, becoming a political commissar for the [[Red Army of China|Red Army]] in rural regions. In 1931, he was demoted within the party due to his support of Mao Zedong, but was promoted again during the [[Zunyi Conference|1935 Zunyi Conference.]] By late 1930s, Deng was considered a &quot;revolutionary veteran&quot; because he participated in the [[Long March]]. Following the founding of the [[:People's Republic of China]] in 1949, Deng worked in [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] as well as in southwest China to consolidate Communist control. As the party's [[Secretary-general of the Communist Party of China|Secretary-general]] in the 1950s, Deng presided over the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]] launched by Mao and became instrumental in China's economic reconstruction following the [[Great Leap Forward]] (1958-1960). However, his economic policies caused him to fall out of favor with Mao Zedong and he was purged twice during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

Following Mao Zedong's death in 1976, Deng outmaneuvered the late chairman's chosen successor [[Hua Guofeng]] and became the new [[Paramount Leader of China|paramount leader of China]] in December 1978. Inheriting a country beset with social conflict, disenchantment with the Communist Party and institutional disorder resulting from the chaotic policies of the [[Mao era]], Deng began to bring the country back to order. From 1977 to early 1979, he resumed the [[National College Entrance Examination|College Entrance Examination in China]] which was interrupted by the Cultural Revolution for ten years, initiated the historic [[Reform and opening up|Reform and Opening-up of China]], and started a [[Sino-Vietnamese War|one-month Sino-Vietnamese War]]. In August 1980, he started China's political reforms by setting [[term limit]]s for officials and proposing a systematic revision of [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China's third Constitution]] which was made during the Cultural Revolution; the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|new Constitution]] embodied Chinese-style [[constitutionalism]] and was passed by the [[National People's Congress]] in December 1982, with most of its content still being effective as of today. In the 1980s, Deng supported the [[family planning policy]] to cope with China's [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation crisis]], helped establish China's [[Compulsory education#China|nine-year compulsory education]], launched the [[863 Program]] for science and technology, and revived China's political reforms which ended and failed during the [[June fourth incident|June Fourth Incident]] in 1989.

While Deng never held office as the [[List of Presidents of the People's Republic of China|head of state]], [[List of premiers of the People's Republic of China|head of government]] or [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] ([[Leader of the Communist Party of China|leader of the Communist Party]]), some called him &quot;the architect&quot; of a new brand of thinking that combined [[socialist ideology]] with [[free enterprise]], dubbed the &quot;[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]&quot;. He opened China to foreign investment and the global market, policies that are credited with developing China into one of the fastest-growing [[Economy of China|economies]] in the world for several generations and raising the [[Standard of living in China|standard of living]] of hundreds of millions. Deng was the [[Time Person of the Year|''Time'' Person of the Year]] in 1978 and 1985, the third Chinese leader and the fourth time for a communist leader to be selected. He was criticized for ordering the crackdown on the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]], but was praised for his reaffirmation of the reform program in his Southern Tour of 1992 as well as the [[Handover of Hong Kong|reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese control]] in 1997.

== Early life and family ==
[[File:Student Deng Xiaoping in France.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Deng Xiaoping at age 16, studying in France (1921)]]
Deng's ancestors can be traced back to [[Meixian District|Jiaying county]] (now renamed to Meixian), Guangdong,&lt;ref name=&quot;Asiawind.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiawind.com/pub/forum/fhakka/mhonarc/msg00475.html |title=The arrival of the Hakkas in Sichuan Province |publisher=Asiawind.com |date=29 December 1997 |accessdate=13 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104074554/http://www.asiawind.com/pub/forum/fhakka/mhonarc/msg00475.html |archive-date=4 November 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent ancestral area for the Hakka people, and had been settled in Sichuan for several generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2008-01/14/content_857292.htm|title=Luodai, a Hakkanese town in Sichuan Province|date=14 January 2008|publisher=GOV.cn|accessdate=14 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215533/http://www.gov.cn/english/2008-01/14/content_857292.htm|archive-date=17 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deng's daughter [[Deng Rong]] wrote in the book ''My father Deng Xiaoping'' ({{lang|zh-hans|我的父亲邓小平}}) that his ancestry was probably but not definitely Hakka. Sichuan was originally the origin of the Deng lineage until one of them was hired as an official in Guangdong during the Ming dynasty but during the Qing plan to increase the population in 1671 they came to Sichuan again. Deng was born on 22 August 1904 at Sichuan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dai2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Yingcong Dai|title=The Sichuan Frontier and Tibet: Imperial Strategy in the Early Qing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYHfVVAAf_kC&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage|year=2009|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98952-5|pages=25–|access-date=20 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128154047/https://books.google.com/books?id=DYHfVVAAf_kC&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage|archive-date=28 November 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deng's father, Deng Wenming, was a middle-level landowner and had studied at the University of Law and Political Science in [[Chengdu]].  He was locally prominent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Yang|title=Deng: A Political Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMHsCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|pages=11–12|isbn=9781134964765}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, surnamed Dan, died early in Deng's life, leaving Deng, his three brothers and three sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/dengxiaoping/103417.htm|title=Deng Xiaoping – Childhood|publisher=China.org.cn|accessdate=14 May 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215455/http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/dengxiaoping/103417.htm|archive-date=17 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five Deng was sent to a traditional Chinese-style private primary school, followed by a more modern primary school at the age of seven.

Deng's first wife, one of his schoolmates from Moscow, died aged 24 a few days after giving birth to Deng's first child, a baby girl who also died. His second wife, Jin Weiying, left him after Deng came under political attack in 1933. His third wife [[Zhuo Lin]] was the daughter of an industrialist in [[Yunnan]]. She became a member of the Communist Party in 1938, and married Deng a year later in front of Mao's cave dwelling in [[Yan'an]]. They had five children: three daughters (Deng Lin, [[Deng Nan]] and [[Deng Rong]]) and two sons ([[Deng Pufang]] and Deng Zhifang).

=== Education and early career ===
[[File:Deng xxixian.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Deng's name is spelled Teng Hi Hien on this employment card from the Hutchinson shoe factory in [[Châlette-sur-Loing]], France, where he worked on two occasions as seen from the dates, eight months in 1922 and again in 1923 when he was fired after one month, with the bottom annotation reading &quot;refused to work, do not take him back&quot;]]
When Deng first attended school, his tutor objected to his having the given name &quot;Xiānshèng&quot; ({{lang|zh|先聖}}), calling him &quot;Xīxián&quot; ({{lang|zh|希賢}}), which includes the characters &quot;to aspire to&quot; and &quot;goodness&quot;, with overtones of wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Richard |title=Deng Xiaoping and the Making of Modern China |date=1995 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-013945-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dengxiaopingmak00evan/page/5 5] |edition=2 |title-link=Deng Xiaoping and the Making of Modern China }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1919, Deng graduated from the [[Chongqing]] School. He and 80 schoolmates travelled by ship to France (travelling [[Steerage (deck)|steerage]]) to participate in the [[Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement]], a work-study program in which 4,001 Chinese would participate by 1927. Deng, the youngest of all the Chinese students in the group, had just turned 15.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Jonathan (1999), &quot;In Search of Modern China&quot;, 310&lt;/ref&gt; Wu Yuzhang, the local leader of the Movement in Chongqing, enrolled Deng and his paternal uncle, Deng Shaosheng, in the program. Deng's father strongly supported his son's participation in the work-study abroad program.{{sfnb|Vogel|2011| p= 18–20}} The night before his departure, Deng's father took his son aside and asked him what he hoped to learn in France. He repeated the words he had learned from his teachers: &quot;To learn knowledge and truth from the West in order to save China.&quot; Deng was aware that China was suffering greatly, and that the Chinese people must have a modern education to save their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Whitney |date=2001 |title=Deng Xiaoping: Leader in a Changing China |url= |location= |publisher=Twenty-First Century Books |page=23 |isbn=9780822549628 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1920 a French packet ship, the ''André Lyon'', sailed into [[Marseille]] with 210 Chinese students aboard including Deng. The sixteen-year-old Deng briefly attended middle schools in [[Bayeux]] and [[Châtillon, Hauts-de-Seine|Châtillon]], but he spent most of his time in France working. His first job was as a fitter at the Le Creusot Iron and Steel Plant in La Garenne-Colombes, a south-western suburb of Paris where he moved in April 1921. Coincidentally, when Deng's later political fortunes were down and he was sent to work in a tractor factory in 1974 he found himself a fitter again and proved to still be a master of the skill.&lt;ref name=&quot;sacu.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.sacu.org/dengfrance.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127081058/http://sacu.org/dengfrance.html |date=27 November 2010 }}, Wang Song. &quot;Chinese Revolutionaries in France&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In La Garenne-Colombes Deng met [[Zhou Enlai]], [[Nie Rongzhen]], [[Cai Hesen]], [[Zhao Shiyan]] and Li Wenhai.&lt;ref name=&quot;sacu.org&quot; /&gt; Under the influence of these older Chinese students in France, Deng began to study [[Marxism]] and engaged in political dissemination work.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/deng.htm|title=The Career of Deng Xiaoping|website=www.sjsu.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190410235848/http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/deng.htm|archive-date=10 April 2019|access-date=27 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921 he joined the Chinese Communist Youth League in Europe. In the second half of 1924, he joined the Chinese Communist Party and became one of the leading members of the General Branch of the Youth League in Europe. In 1926 Deng traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] and studied at [[Moscow Sun Yat-sen University]], where one of his classmates was [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], the son of [[Chiang Kai-shek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=167965&amp;sectioncode=22 |title=Exiled son who saved the state |magazine=Times Higher Education |date=22 March 2002 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201132001/http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=167965&amp;sectioncode=22 |archive-date=1 December 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to China ===
In late 1927, Deng left Moscow to return to China, where he joined the army of [[Feng Yuxiang]], a military leader in northwest China, who had requested assistance from the Soviet Union in his struggle with other local leaders in the region. At that time, the Soviet Union, through the [[Comintern]], an international organization supporting the communist movements, supported the Communists' alliance with the Nationalists of the Kuomintang (KMT) party founded by [[Sun Yat-sen]].

He arrived in [[Xi'an]], the stronghold of Feng Yuxiang, in March 1927. He was part of the [[Fengtian clique]]'s attempt to prevent the break of the alliance between the KMT and the Communists. This split resulted in part from [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s forcing them to flee areas controlled by the KMT. After the breakup of the alliance between communists and nationalists, Feng Yuxiang stood on the side of Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communists who participated in their army, such as Deng Xiaoping, were forced to flee. In 1929 Deng led the [[Baise Uprising]] in Guangxi province against the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government. The uprising failed and Deng went to the Central Soviet Area in [[Jiangxi]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

== Political rise ==
Although Deng got involved in the Marxist revolutionary movement in China, the historian Mobo Gao has argued that &quot;Deng Xiaoping and many like him [in the Chinese Communist Party] were not really Marxists, but basically revolutionary nationalists who wanted to see China standing on equal terms with the great global powers. They were primarily nationalists and they participated in the Communist revolution because that was the only viable route they could find Chinese nationalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao08|Gao 2008]]. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism in Shanghai and Wuhan ===
After leaving the army of [[Feng Yuxiang]] in the northwest, Deng ended up in the city of [[Wuhan]], where the Communists at that time had their headquarters. At that time, he began using the nickname &quot;Xiaoping&quot; and occupied prominent positions in the party apparatus. He participated in the historic emergency session on 7 August 1927 in which, by Soviet instruction, the Party dismissed its founder [[Chen Duxiu]], and [[Qu Qiubai]] became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]]. In Wuhan, Deng first established contact with Mao Zedong, who was then little valued by militant pro-Soviet leaders of the party.

Between 1927 and 1929, Deng lived in Shanghai, where he helped organize protests that would be harshly persecuted by the Kuomintang authorities. The death of many Communist militants in those years led to a decrease in the number of members of the Communist Party, which enabled Deng to quickly move up the ranks. During this stage in Shanghai, Deng married a woman he met in Moscow, Zhang Xiyuan.

=== Military campaign in Guangxi ===
Beginning in 1929, he participated in the military struggle against the Kuomintang in [[Guangxi]]. The superiority of the forces of Chiang Kai-shek caused a huge number of casualties in the Communist ranks. The confrontational strategy of the Communist Party of China (CCP) leadership was a failure that killed many militants against a stronger opponent. The response to this defeat catalyzed one of the most confusing episodes in the biography of Deng: in March 1931, he left the Communist Army seventh battalion to appear sometime later in Shanghai.

His official biography states that Deng had been charged by his superiors with deserting from the battle zone before fleeing to Shanghai, where there were leaders of the underground Communist Party. Although he was not punished in Shanghai, this episode in his biography remains unclear and would be used against him to question his devotion to the Communist Party during the [[Cultural Revolution]] era.

=== At the Jiangxi Soviet ===
The campaigns against the Communists in the cities represented a setback for the party and in particular to the Comintern Soviet advisers, who saw the mobilization of the urban proletariat as the force for the advancement of communism. Contrary to the urban vision of the revolution, based on the Soviet experience, the Communist leader Mao Zedong saw the rural peasants as the revolutionary force in China. In a mountainous area of Jiangxi province, where Mao went to establish a communist system, there developed the embryo of a future state of China under communism, which adopted the official name of the Chinese Soviet Republic, but was better known as the &quot;[[Jiangxi Soviet]]&quot;.

In one of the most important cities in the Soviet zone, [[Ruijin]], Deng took over as secretary of the Party Committee in the summer of 1931. In the winter of 1932, Deng went on to play the same position in the nearby district of [[Huichang County|Huichang]]. In 1933 he became director of the propaganda department of the Provincial Party Committee in Jiangxi. It was then that he married a young woman he had met in Shanghai named Jin Weiying.

The successes of the Soviet in Jiangxi made the party leaders decide to move to Jiangxi from Shanghai. The confrontation among Mao, the party leaders, and their Soviet advisers was increasingly tense and the struggle for power between the two factions led to the removal of Deng, who favored the ideas of Mao, from his position in the propaganda department. Despite the strife within the party, the Jiangxi Soviet became the first successful experiment of communist rule in rural China. It even issued stamps and paper money under the letterhead of the Soviet Republic of China, and the army of Chiang Kai-shek finally decided to attack the communist area.

=== Long March ===
{{Main|Long March}}
[[File:1937 Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|Deng Xiaoping in NRA uniform, 1937]]
Surrounded by the more powerful army of the Republic of China, the Communists fled Jiangxi in October 1934. Thus began the epic movement that would mark a turning point in the development of Chinese communism. The evacuation was difficult because the Army of the Republic had taken positions in all areas occupied by the Communists. Advancing through remote and mountainous terrain, some 100,000 men managed to escape Jiangxi, starting a long strategic retreat through the interior of China, which ended one year later when between 8,000 and 9,000 survivors reached the northern province of [[Shaanxi]].

During the [[Zunyi Conference]] at the beginning of the Long March, the so-called 28 Bolsheviks, led by [[Bo Gu]] and [[Wang Ming]], were ousted from power and Mao Zedong, to the dismay of the Soviet Union, had become the new leader of the Communist Party of China. The pro-Soviet Communist Party of China had ended and a new rural-inspired party emerged under the leadership of Mao. Deng had once again become a leading figure in the party when the north ended up winning the civil war against the Kuomintang.

The confrontation between the two parties was temporarily interrupted, however, by the Japanese invasion, forcing the Kuomintang to form an alliance for the second time with the Communists to defend the nation against external aggression.

=== Japanese invasion ===
The invasion of Japanese troops in 1937 marked the beginning of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. During the invasion, Deng remained in the area controlled by the Communists in the north, where he assumed the role of deputy political director of the three divisions of the restructured Communist army. From September 1937 until January 1938, he lived in Buddhist monasteries and temples in the [[Wutai Mountains]]. In January 1938, he was appointed as Political Commissar of the 129th division of the [[Eighth Route Army]] commanded by [[Liu Bocheng]], starting a long-lasting partnership with Liu.

Deng stayed for most of the conflict with the Japanese in the war front in the area bordering the provinces of [[Shanxi]], Henan and [[Hebei]], then traveled several times to the city of [[Yan'an]], where Mao had established the basis for Communist Party leadership. In one of his trips to Yan'an in 1939, he married, for the third and last time in his life, Zhuo Lin, a young native of [[Kunming]], who, like other young idealists of the time, had traveled to Yan'an to join the Communists.

Deng was considered a &quot;revolutionary veteran&quot; because his participation in the [[Long March]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUcNg8xYHtEC&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage|title=China's leaders|author=Cheng Li|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2001|isbn=9780847694976|access-date=6 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103142555/http://books.google.com/books?id=LUcNg8xYHtEC&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage|archive-date=3 January 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a leading role in the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] which boosted his standing among his comrades.&lt;ref name=&quot;jac&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/01/deng-xiaoping-china-mao-communist-party|title=Assessing Deng Xiaoping|author1=GREGOR BENTON|website=jacobinmag.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129064154/https://www.jacobinmag.com/2019/01/deng-xiaoping-china-mao-communist-party|archive-date=29 January 2019|access-date=28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resumed war against the Nationalists ===
[[File:Liudeng.jpg|thumb|Deng with [[Liu Bocheng]] (right)]]

After Japan's defeat in World War II, Deng traveled to Chongqing, the city in which Chiang Kai-shek established his government during the Japanese invasion, to participate in peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The results of those negotiations were not positive and military confrontation between the two antagonistic parties resumed shortly after the meeting in Chongqing.

While Chiang Kai-shek re-established the government in Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China, the Communists were fighting for control in the field. Following up with guerrilla tactics from their positions in rural areas against cities under the control of the government of Chiang and their supply lines, the Communists were increasing the territory under their control, and incorporating more and more soldiers who had deserted the Nationalist army.

Deng played a major part in the [[Huaihai Campaign]] against the nationalists.&lt;ref name=jac/&gt;

In the final phase of the war, Deng again exercised a key role as political leader and propaganda master as Political Commissar of the [[2nd Field Army]] commanded by [[Liu Bocheng]]. He also participated in disseminating the ideas of Mao Zedong, which turned into the ideological foundation of the Communist Party. His political and ideological work, along with his status as a veteran of the Long March, placed him in a privileged position within the party to occupy positions of power after the Communist Party managed to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and founded the People's Republic of China.

== Political career under Mao ==
{{Communism sidebar}}

=== Mayor of Chongqing ===
On 1 October 1949, Deng attended the proclamation of the People's Republic of China in Beijing. At that time, the Communist Party controlled the entire north, but there were still parts of the south held by the Kuomintang regime. He became responsible for leading the pacification of southwest China, in his capacity as the first secretary of the Department of the Southwest. This organization had the task of managing the final takeover of that part of the country still held by the Kuomintang; Tibet remained independent for another year.

The Kuomintang government was being forced to leave [[Guangzhou]], and established [[Chongqing]] as a new provisional capital. There, Chiang Kai-shek and his son [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], a former classmate of Deng in Moscow, wanted to stop the advance of the Communist Party forces.

Under the political control of Deng, the Communist army took over Chongqing in late November 1949 and entered Chengdu, the last bastion of power of Chiang Kai-shek, a few days later. At that time Deng became mayor of Chongqing, while he simultaneously was the leader of the Communist Party in the southwest, where the Communist army, now proclaiming itself the [[People's Liberation Army]], suppressed resistance loyal to the old Kuomintang regime. In 1950, the Communist Party-ruled state also seized control over Tibet.

Deng Xiaoping would spend three years in Chongqing, the city where he had studied in his teenage years before going to France. In 1952 he moved to Beijing, where he occupied different positions in the central government.

=== Political rise in Beijing ===
{{Main|Anti-Rightist Movement|Great Leap Forward}}
[[File:Dalai-dengxiaoping1954.jpg|thumb|Deng Xiaoping (far left) met with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] (third from left) in 1954]]

In July 1952, Deng came to Beijing to assume the posts of Vice Premier and Deputy Chair of the Committee on Finance. Soon after, he took the posts of Minister of Finance and Director of the Office of Communications. In 1954, he was removed from all these positions, holding only the post of Deputy Premier. In 1956, he became Head of the Communist Party's Organization Department and member of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]].

After officially supporting Mao Zedong in his [[Anti-Rightist Movement]] of 1957, Deng acted as [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|General Secretary of the Secretariat]] and ran the country's daily affairs with President [[Liu Shaoqi]] and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Deng and Liu's policies emphasized economics over ideological dogma, an implicit departure from the mass fervor of the Great Leap Forward.

Both Liu and Deng supported Mao in the mass campaigns of the 1950s, in which they attacked the bourgeois and capitalists, and promoted Mao's ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://origins.osu.edu/review/man-who-re-invented-china|title=The Man Who Re-Invented China {{!}} Origins: Current Events in Historical Perspective|website=origins.osu.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725131635/https://origins.osu.edu/review/man-who-re-invented-china|archive-date=25 July 2019|access-date=27 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the economic failure of the Great Leap Forward was seen as an indictment on the ability of Mao to manage the economy. [[Peng Dehuai]] openly criticized Mao, while Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, though more cautious, began to take charge of economic policy, leaving Mao out of day-to-day affairs of the party and state. Mao agreed to cede the presidency of the People's Republic of China (China's ''de jure'' [[head of state]] position) to Liu Shaoqi, while retaining his positions as leader of the party and the army.

At the [[8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China]] in 1956, Deng supported removing all references to &quot;Mao Zedong Thought&quot; from the party statutes.&lt;ref name=jac/&gt;

In 1963, Deng traveled to Moscow to lead a meeting of the Chinese delegation with Stalin's successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Relations between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union had worsened since the death of Stalin. After this meeting, no agreement was reached and the [[Sino–Soviet split]] was consummated; there was an almost total suspension of relations between the two major communist powers of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Guillermaz, ''The Chinese Communist Party in Power, 1949-1976'' (1976)  pp 320-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liu and Deng's economic reforms of the early 1960s were generally popular and restored many of the economic institutions previously dismantled during the Great Leap Forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Mao, sensing his loss of prestige, took action to regain control of the state. Appealing to his revolutionary spirit, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which encouraged the masses to root out the right-wing capitalists who have &quot;infiltrated the party&quot;. Deng was ridiculed as the &quot;number two [[capitalist roader]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry He|title=Dictionary of the Political Thought of the People's Republic of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCm3DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT713|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=713|isbn=9781315500430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Target of two purges ===
{{Main|Cultural Revolution}}

==== Cultural Revolution ====
[[File:Zhou Li Deng.jpg|thumb|left|Deng Xiaoping (left) with future president [[Li Xiannian]] (center) and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] in 1963]]
Mao feared that the [[reformist]] economic policies of Deng and Liu could lead to restoration of capitalism and end the Chinese Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Minqi Li | title=Socialism, capitalism, and class struggle: The Political economy of Modern china | work = Economic &amp; Political Weekly | date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other reasons, Mao launched the [[Cultural Revolution]] in 1966, during which Deng fell out of favor and was forced to retire from all his positions.

During the Cultural Revolution, he and his family were targeted by [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]], who imprisoned Deng's eldest son, [[Deng Pufang]]. Deng Pufang was tortured and jumped out, or was thrown out, of the window of a four-story building in 1968, becoming a [[paraplegic]]. In October 1969 Deng Xiaoping was sent to the Xinjian County Tractor Factory in rural Jiangxi province to work as a regular worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/10/content_6142550_5.htm | title = Deng Xiaoping − The Years of Hardship and Danger | publisher = People.com.cn | date = 10 July 2007 | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215432/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-07/10/content_6142550_5.htm | archive-date = 17 September 2018 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his four years there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newsgd.com/specials/deng100thbirthanniversary/newspictures/200407280046.htm | title=Film makers flock to tractor factory to shoot Deng's stories | publisher=News Guandong | date=26 July 2004 | access-date=18 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215515/http://www.newsgd.com/specials/deng100thbirthanniversary/newspictures/200407280046.htm | archive-date=17 September 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deng spent his spare time writing. He was purged nationally, but to a lesser scale than President [[Liu Shaoqi]].

After Mao's second official successor, the sole Vice Chairman of the party [[Lin Biao]], was killed in an air crash in 1971 (according to official reports he was trying to flee from China after unsuccessfully trying to stage a coup against Mao), Deng Xiaoping (who had been political commissar of the 2nd Field Army during the civil war) became the most influential of the remaining army leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; When Premier Zhou Enlai, who in case of living long enough should have been Mao's third successor, fell ill with cancer, Deng became Zhou's choice as successor, meaning that he could in theory also have succeeded Mao. Zhou was able to convince Mao to bring Deng back into politics in 1974 as First Vice-Premier, in practice running daily affairs. Deng focused on reconstructing the country's economy and stressed unity as the first step by raising production.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} He remained careful, however, to avoid contradicting Maoist ideology on paper. In January 1975, he was additionally elected Vice Chairman of the party by the [[10th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|10th Central Committee]] for the first time in his party career; [[Li Desheng]] had to resign in his favour. Deng was one of five Vice Chairmen, with Zhou being the First Vice Chairman.

[[File:Gerald and Betty Ford meet with Deng Xiaoping, 1975 A7598-20A.jpg|thumb|Deng Xiaoping (centre) with U.S. president [[Gerald Ford]] (left), 1975]]

During his brief ascendency, Deng established the Political Research Office, headed by intellectuals [[Hu Qiaomu]], [[Yu Guangyuan]] and [[Hu Sheng]], delegated to explore approaches to political and economic reforms. He led the group himself and managed the project within the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], in order to avoid rousing the suspicions of the [[Gang of Four]].

The Cultural Revolution was not yet over, and a radical leftist political group known as the [[Gang of Four]], led by Mao's wife [[Jiang Qing]], competed for power within the Party. The Gang saw Deng as their greatest challenge to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ls11.com/Article/jglx/gjjz/200408/4910.html |title=Deng Rong's Memoirs: Chpt 49 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227130702/http://www.ls11.com/Article/jglx/gjjz/200408/4910.html |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao, too, was suspicious that Deng would destroy the positive reputation of the Cultural Revolution, which Mao considered one of his greatest policy initiatives. Beginning in late 1975, Deng was asked to draw up a series of [[self-criticism]]s. Although he admitted to having taken an &quot;inappropriate ideological perspective&quot; while dealing with state and party affairs, he was reluctant to admit that his policies were wrong in essence. His antagonism with the Gang of Four became increasingly clear, and Mao seemed to sway in the Gang's favour. Mao refused to accept Deng's self-criticisms and asked the party's Central Committee to &quot;discuss Deng's mistakes thoroughly&quot;.

==== 'Criticize Deng' campaign ====
Zhou Enlai died in January 1976, to an outpouring of national grief. Zhou was a very important figure in Deng's political life, and his death eroded his remaining support within the Party's Central Committee. After Deng delivered Zhou's official eulogy at the state funeral,&lt;ref name=jac/&gt; the Gang of Four, with Mao's permission, began the so-called ''Criticize Deng and Oppose the Rehabilitation of Right-leaning Elements'' campaign. [[Hua Guofeng]], not Deng, was selected to become Zhou's successor as Premier on 4 February 1976.

On 2 February 1976, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] issued a Top-Priority Directive, officially transferring Deng to work on &quot;external affairs&quot; and thus removing Deng from the party's power apparatus. Deng stayed at home for several months, awaiting his fate. The Political Research Office was promptly dissolved, and Deng's advisers such as [[Yu Guangyuan]] suspended. As a result, the political turmoil halted the economic progress Deng had laboured for in the past year.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} On 3 March, Mao issued a directive reaffirming the legitimacy of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and specifically pointed to Deng as an internal, rather than external, problem. This was followed by a Central Committee directive issued to all local party organs to study Mao's directive and criticize Deng.

Deng's reputation as a reformer suffered a severe blow when the [[Qingming Festival]], after the mass public mourning of Zhou on a traditional Chinese holiday, culminated in the [[Tiananmen Incident]] on 5 April 1976, an event the Gang of Four branded as counter-revolutionary and threatening to their power. Furthermore, the Gang deemed Deng the mastermind behind the incident, and Mao himself wrote that &quot;the nature of things has changed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ls11.com/Article/jglx/gjjz/200408/4916.html |title=Deng Rong's Memoirs: Chapter 53 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227130647/http://www.ls11.com/Article/jglx/gjjz/200408/4916.html |archivedate=27 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted Mao to remove Deng from all leadership positions, although he retained his party membership. As a result, on 6 April 1976 Premier Hua Guofeng was also appointed to Deng's position as Vice Chairman and at the same time received the vacant position of First Vice Chairman, which Zhou had held, making him Mao's fourth official successor.

== Takes power and rule 1977-1989 ==
Following Mao's death on 9 September 1976 and the purge of the [[Gang of Four]] in October 1976, Deng gradually emerged as the ''de facto'' leader of China. Prior to Mao's death, the only governmental position he held was that of [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|First Vice Premier]] of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]],&lt;ref&gt;1975–1976 and 1977–1980, Europa Publications (2002) &quot;The People's Republic of Chine: Introductory Survey&quot; ''The Europa World Year Book 2003'' volume 1, (44th edition) Europa Publications, London, p. 1075, col. 1, {{ISBN|1-85743-227-4}}; and Bo, Zhiyue (2007) ''China's Elite Politics: Political Transition and Power Balancing'' World Scientific, Hackensack, New Jersey, p. 59, {{ISBN|981-270-041-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Hua Guofeng wanted to rid the Party of extremists and successfully marginalised the Gang of Four. On 22 July 1977, Deng was restored to the posts of Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee, Vice-Chairman of the Military Commission and Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/22/newsid_2516000/2516339.stm |title=1977: Deng Xiaoping back in power |work=BBC News |accessdate=21 July 2011 |date=22 July 1977 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728025020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/22/newsid_2516000/2516339.stm |archive-date=28 July 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By carefully mobilizing his supporters within the party, Deng outmaneuvered Hua, who had pardoned him, then ousted Hua from his top leadership positions by 1980. In contrast to previous leadership changes, Deng allowed Hua to retain membership in the Central Committee and quietly retire, helping to set the precedent that losing a high-level leadership struggle would not result in physical harm.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

===Allows criticism===
Deng repudiated the Cultural Revolution and, in 1977, launched the &quot;[[Beijing Spring]]&quot;, which allowed open criticism of the excesses and suffering that had occurred during the period. Meanwhile, he was the impetus for the abolition of the class background system. Under this system, the CPC removed employment barriers to Chinese deemed to be associated with the former landlord class; its removal allowed a faction favoring the restoration of the private market to enter the Communist Party.

Deng gradually outmaneuvered his political opponents. By encouraging public criticism of the Cultural Revolution, he weakened the position of those who owed their political positions to that event, while strengthening the position of those like himself who had been purged during that time. Deng also received a great deal of popular support. As Deng gradually consolidated control over the CPC, Hua was replaced by [[Zhao Ziyang]] as premier in 1980, and by [[Hu Yaobang]] as party chief in 1981, despite the fact that Hua was Mao Zedong's designated successor as the &quot;paramount leader&quot; of the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China.

Important decisions were always taken in Deng's [[Zhongnanhai#West Four Houses|home]] in [[Zhongnanhai]] with a caucus of eight senior party cadres, called &quot;[[Eight Elders]]&quot;, especially with [[Chen Yun]] and [[Li Xiannian]]. Deng ruled as &quot;paramount leader&quot; although he never held the top title of the party, and was able to successively remove three party leaders, including Hu Yaobang.&lt;ref name=scmp20120420xiang&gt;Xiang, Lanxin (20 April 2012). &quot;Bo Xilai probe shows up China's outdated system of government&quot;. ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Deng remained the most influential of the CPC cadre, although after 1987 his only official posts were as chairman of the state and Communist Party Central Military Commissions.

===Mao's place in China===
Deng's elevation to China's new number-one figure meant that the historical and ideological questions around Mao Zedong had to be addressed properly. Because Deng wished to pursue deep reforms, it was not possible for him to continue Mao's hard-line &quot;class struggle&quot; policies and mass public campaigns. In 1982 the Central Committee of the Communist Party released a document entitled ''On the Various Historical Issues since the Founding of the People's Republic of China''. Mao retained his status as a &quot;great Marxist, proletarian revolutionary, militarist, and general&quot;, and the undisputed founder and pioneer of the country and the [[People's Liberation Army]]. &quot;His accomplishments must be considered before his mistakes&quot;, the document declared. Deng personally commented that Mao was &quot;seven parts good, three parts bad.&quot; The document also steered the prime responsibility of the Cultural Revolution away from Mao (although it did state that &quot;Mao mistakenly began the Cultural Revolution&quot;) to the &quot;counter-revolutionary cliques&quot; of the Gang of Four and [[Lin Biao]].

During his paramount leadership, his official state positions were [[Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] from 1978–1983 and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] of the People's Republic of China from 1983–1990, while his official party positions were [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] from 1977–1982, Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China from 1981–1989 and Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission from 1982-1987.

=== International affairs===
In November 1978, after the country had stabilized following political turmoil, Deng visited [[Bangkok]], Kuala Lumpur and Singapore and met with Singapore's Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]]. Deng was very impressed with Singapore's economic development, greenery and housing, and later sent tens of thousands of Chinese to Singapore and countries around the world to learn from their experiences and bring back their knowledge. [[Lee Kuan Yew]], on the other hand, advised Deng to stop exporting Communist ideologies to Southeast Asia, advice that Deng later followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://app.mfa.gov.sg/2006/press/view_press_print.asp?post_id=1538 |title=MFA, Singapore Press Release |publisher=App.mfa.gov.sg |date=29 December 2005 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193654/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/2006/press/view_press_print.asp?post_id=1538 |archive-date=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee Kuan Yew, ''From Third World to First: The Singapore Story, 1965–2000, Volume 2'', (HarperCollins: 2000), pp. 595–603&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to the support of other party leaders who had already recovered their official positions, in 1978 the rise to power of Deng was inevitable. Even though Hua Guofeng formally monopolized the top positions in the People's Republic, his position, with little support, was becoming increasingly difficult. In December 1978, during the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee Congress of the Communist Party of China]], Deng took over the reins of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yu|first1=Guangyuan|title=Deng Xiaoping Shakes the World: An Eyewitness Account of China's Party Work Conference and the Third Plenum (November-December 1978)|date=2004|publisher=EastBridge|isbn=978-1891936531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1979, the economic reforms accelerated the market model, while the leaders maintained old Communist-style rhetoric. The commune system was gradually dismantled and the peasants began to have more freedom to manage the land they cultivated and sell their products on the market. At the same time, China's economy opened up to foreign trade. On 1 January 1979, the United States recognized the People's Republic of China, leaving the (Taiwan) Republic of China's nationalist government to one side, and business contacts between China and the West began to grow. In late 1978, the aerospace company [[Boeing]] announced the sale of [[Boeing 747|747 aircraft]] to various airlines in the PRC, and the beverage company [[Coca-Cola]] made public their intention to open a production plant in Shanghai.

In early 1979, Deng undertook an [[1979 visit by Deng Xiaoping to the United States|official visit to the United States]], meeting President Jimmy Carter in Washington as well as several Congressmen. The Chinese insisted that former President [[Richard Nixon]] be invited to the formal White House reception, a symbolic indication of their assertiveness on the one hand, and their desire to continue with the Nixon initiatives on the other. During the visit, Deng visited the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston]], as well as the headquarters of Coca-Cola and Boeing in [[Atlanta]] and [[Seattle]], respectively. With these visits so significant, Deng made it clear that the new Chinese regime's priorities were economic and technological development.

[[People's Republic of China–Japan relations|Sino-Japanese relations]] also improved significantly.&lt;ref&gt;(Article 2) &quot;The Contracting Parties declare that neither of them should seek [[hegemony]] in the Asia-Pacific region or in any other region and that each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony.&quot; [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/treaty78.html MOFA: Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609105736/http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/treaty78.html |date=9 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Deng used Japan as an example of a rapidly progressing power that set a good example for China economically.

===Four modernizations; economy, agriculture, science, defense===
Deng quoted the old proverb &quot;it doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, if it catches mice it is a good cat.&quot; The point was that capitalistic methods worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Naisbitt|author2=Doris Naisbitt|title=China's Megatrends: The 8 Pillars of a New Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zdrQeYccJYEC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2010|publisher=HarperBusiness|page=4|isbn=9780061963445}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Deng worked with his team, especially as [[Zhao Ziyang]], who in 1980 replaced Hua Guofeng as premier, and [[Hu Yaobang]], who in 1981 did the same with the post of party chairman. Deng thus took the reins of power and began to emphasize the goals of &quot;four modernizations&quot; (economy, agriculture, scientific and technological development and national defense). He announced an ambitious plan of opening and liberalizing the economy. In just a  few years they worked wonders as the world watched in amazement.&lt;ref&gt;David Mason, &quot;China’s Four Modernizations: Blueprint for Development or Prelude to Turmoil?.&quot; ''Asian Affairs'' 11.3 (1984): 47-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last position of power retained by Hua Guofeng, chairman of the Central Military Commission, was taken by Deng in 1981. However, progress toward military modernization went slowly. An actual border war underway with Vietnam in 1977-79 made major changes unwise. The war puzzled outside observers, but Xiaoming Zhang argues that Deng had multiple goals: stopping Soviet expansion in the region, obtain American support for his four modernizations, and mobilizing China for reform and integration into the world economy. Deng also sought to strengthen his control of the PLA, and demonstrate to the world that China was capable of fighting a real war. Zhang thinks punishment of Vietnam for its invasion of Cambodia was a minor factor.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoming Zhang,  &quot;Deng Xiaoping and China's Decision to go to War with Vietnam.&quot; ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' 12.3 (2010): 3–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, the Chinese forces did poorly, in terms of equipment, strategy, leadership, and battlefield performance.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Deng Xiaoping'' pp 526-35.&lt;/ref&gt; China's main military threat came from the Soviet Union, which was much more powerful even though it had fewer soldiers, because it was far advanced in all sorts of weapons technology. Deng decided that China first had to develop an advanced civilian scientific infrastructure before it could hope to build modern weapons. He therefore concentrated on downsizing the Army, retiring the elderly and corrupt senior officers and their cronies. He emphasized the recruitment of much better educated young men who would be able to handle the advanced technology when it finally arrived. Instead of patronage and corruption in the officer corps, he imposed strict discipline in all ranks. In 1982 he established a new Commission for Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense to plan for using technology developed in the civilian sector.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Deng Xiaoping'' pp 535-52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June Teufel Dreyer,  &quot;Deng Xiaoping and Modernization of the Chinese Military.&quot; ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'' 14.2 (1988): 215-231.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Deng Thatcher 3.JPG|thumb|A model reconstruction of Deng Xiaoping's 1984 meeting with UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], Shenzhen]]
Deng did little to improve poor relations with Brezhnev and the Kremlin. He continued to adhere to the Maoist line of the [[Sino–Soviet split]] era that the Soviet Union was a superpower as &quot;hegemonic&quot; as the United States, but even more threatening to China because of its close proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Marti in ''China and the Legacy of Deng Xiaoping'', (Brassy's, 2002) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return of Hong Kong and Macau===
From 1980 onwards, Deng led the expansion of the economy, and in political terms took over negotiations with the United Kingdom to [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|return the territory of Hong Kong]], meeting personally with then-Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Thatcher had participated in the meetings with the hopes of keeping British rule over Hong Kong Island and Kowloon - two of the three constituent territories of the colony - but this was firmly rejected by Deng. The result of these negotiations was the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], signed on 19 December 1984, which formally outlined the United Kingdom's return of the whole Hong Kong colony to China by 1997. The Chinese government pledged to respect the economic system and civil liberties of the British colony for fifty years after the handover.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Deng Xiaoping,'' pp 487-511.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy C. Jackson, &quot;The Legal Regime of Hong Kong After 1997: An Examination of the Joint Declaration of the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China.&quot; ''International Tax &amp; Business Lawyer'' (1987): 377-423. [https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1072&amp;context=bjil Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under pressure from China, Portugal agreed in 1987 to the return of [[Macau]] by 1999, with an agreement roughly equal to that of Hong Kong. The return of these two territories was based on a political principle formulated by Deng himself called &quot;[[one country, two systems]]&quot;, which refers to the co-existence under one political authority of areas with different economic systems of communism and capitalism. Although this theory was applied to Hong Kong and Macau, Deng apparently intended to also present it as an attractive option to the people of [[Taiwan]] for eventual incorporation of that island, where sovereignty over the territory is still disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, ''Deng Xiaoping,'' pp 477-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population control and crime control===
China's rapid economic growth presented several problems. The 1982 census revealed the extraordinary growth of the population, which already exceeded a billion people. Deng continued the plans initiated by Hua Guofeng to [[One-child policy|restrict birth to only one child]], limiting women to one child under pain of administrative penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-un.ch/eng/bjzl/t176938.htm|title=Family Planning in China|website=www.china-un.ch|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619013045/http://www.china-un.ch/eng/bjzl/t176938.htm|archive-date=19 June 2018|access-date=28 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy applied to urban areas, and included forced abortions&lt;ref&gt;Wang Feng, Yong Cai, and Baochang Gu, &quot;Population, policy, and politics: how will history judge China's one-child policy?.&quot; ''Population and Development Review'' 38 (2013): 115-129.

Deng launched his first &quot;strike hard&quot; anti-crime campaign in August 1983. It was reported that the government set quotas for 5,000 executions by mid-November, and sources in Taiwan claimed that as many as 60,000 people were executed in that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1985/06/in-human-rights-china-remains-in-the-maoist-era |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516232433/http://heritage.org/Research/Reports/1985/06/In-Human-Rights-China-Remains-in-the-Maoist-Era |archive-date=16 May 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; although more recent estimates have placed the number at 24,000 executed by firing squad within the first year of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Strike less hard |url=https://www.economist.com/china/2013/08/03/strike-less-hard |journal=The Economist |date=3 August 2013 |access-date=23 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323192208/https://www.economist.com/china/2013/08/03/strike-less-hard |archive-date=23 March 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing economic freedom was being translated into a greater freedom of opinion, and critics began to arise within the system, including the famous dissident [[Wei Jingsheng]], who coined the term &quot;fifth modernization&quot; in reference to democracy as a missing element in the renewal plans of Deng Xiaoping. In the late 1980s, dissatisfaction with the authoritarian regime and growing inequalities caused the biggest crisis to Deng's leadership.

===Three steps to economic development===
In October 1987, at the Plenary Session of the National People's Congress, Deng was re-elected as Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]], but he resigned as Chairman of the [[Central Advisory Commission]] and was succeeded by [[Chen Yun]]. Deng continued to chair and develop the reform and opening up as the main policy, and he advanced the three steps suitable for China's economic development strategy within seventy years: the first step, to double the 1980 GNP and ensure that the people have enough food and clothing, was attained by the end of the 1980s; the second step, to quadruple the 1980 GNP by the end of the 20th century, was achieved in 1995 ahead of schedule; the third step, to increase per capita GNP to the level of the medium-developed countries by 2050, at which point, the Chinese people will be fairly well-off and modernization will be basically realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/38199.htm|title=The Three-Step Development Strategy|publisher=china.org.cn|accessdate=28 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215520/http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/38199.htm|archive-date=17 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic reforms ===
{{Main|Chinese economic reform|Socialist market economy}}

Improving relations with the outside world was the second of two important philosophical shifts outlined in Deng's program of reform termed ''Gaige Kaifang'' (''lit.'' Reforms and Openness). China's domestic social, political, and most notably, economic systems would undergo significant changes during Deng's time. The goals of Deng's reforms were summed up by the [[Four Modernizations]], those of agriculture, industry, science and technology, and the military.

The strategy for achieving these aims of becoming a modern, industrial nation was the [[socialist market economy]]. Deng argued that China was in the [[primary stage of socialism]] and that the duty of the party was to perfect so-called &quot;[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/20/world/deng-xiaoping-is-dead-at-92-architect-of-modern-china.html|title=Deng Xiaoping Is Dead at 92; Architect of Modern China|date=20 February 1997|work=The New York Times|access-date=15 February 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123203613/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/20/world/deng-xiaoping-is-dead-at-92-architect-of-modern-china.html|archive-date=23 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jac&quot; /&gt; and &quot;[[seek truth from facts]]&quot;. (This somewhat resembles the Leninist theoretical justification of the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in the 1920s, which argued that the [[Soviet Union]] had not gone deeply enough into the capitalist phase and therefore needed limited capitalism in order to fully evolve its means of production.)

This interpretation of Maoism reduced the role of ideology in economic decision-making. Downgrading communitarian values, but not necessarily criticising the ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]], Deng emphasized that &quot;socialism does not mean shared poverty&quot;. His theoretical justification for allowing market forces was given as such:

{{quote|&quot;Planning and market forces are not the essential difference between socialism and capitalism. A planned economy is not the definition of socialism, because there is planning under capitalism; the market economy happens under socialism, too. Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cited by John Gittings in ''The Changing Face of China'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-280612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike [[Hua Guofeng]], Deng believed that no policy should be rejected outright simply because it was not associated with Mao. Unlike more conservative leaders such as [[Chen Yun]], Deng did not object to policies on the grounds that they were similar to ones that were found in capitalist nations.

This political flexibility towards the foundations of socialism is strongly supported by quotes such as:

{{quote|We mustn't fear to adopt the advanced management methods applied in capitalist countries (...) The very essence of socialism is the liberation and development of the productive systems (...) Socialism and market economy are not incompatible (...) We should be concerned about right-wing deviations, but most of all, we must be concerned about left-wing deviations.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by António Caeiro in ''Pela China Dentro'' (translated), Dom Quixote, Lisboa, 2004. {{ISBN|972-20-2696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although Deng provided the theoretical background and the political support to allow economic reform to occur, the general consensus amongst historians is that few of the economic reforms that Deng introduced were originated by Deng himself. Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], for example, pioneered the Four Modernizations years before Deng. In addition, many reforms would be introduced by local leaders, often not sanctioned by central government directives. If successful and promising, these reforms would be adopted by larger and larger areas and ultimately introduced nationally. An often cited example is the [[household responsibility system]], which was first secretly implemented by a poor rural village at the risk of being convicted as &quot;counter-revolutionary.&quot; This experiment proved very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Dali Yang, Calamity and Reform in China, Stanford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Deng openly supported it and it was later adopted nationally. Many other reforms were influenced by the experiences of the [[Four Asian Tigers|East Asian Tigers]].&lt;ref&gt;Cited by David Shambaugh in ''Deng Xiaoping: portrait of a Chinese statesman'', Oxford University, Oxford, 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-828933-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in sharp contrast to the pattern in the ''[[perestroika]]'' undertaken by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in which most of the major reforms were originated by Gorbachev himself. The bottom-up approach of the Deng reforms, in contrast to the top-down approach of ''perestroika'', was likely a key factor in the success of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Susan L. Shirk in ''The Political Logic of Economic Reform in China'', University of California, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1993. {{ISBN|0-520-07706-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deng's reforms actually included the introduction of planned, centralized management of the macro-economy by technically proficient bureaucrats, abandoning Mao's mass campaign style of economic construction. However, unlike the Soviet model, management was indirect through market mechanisms. Deng sustained Mao's legacy to the extent that he stressed the primacy of agricultural output and encouraged a significant decentralization of decision making in the rural economy teams and individual peasant households. At the local level, material incentives, rather than political appeals, were to be used to motivate the labor force, including allowing peasants to earn extra income by selling the produce of their private plots at free market value.

==== Export focus ====
In the move toward market allocation, local municipalities and provinces were allowed to invest in industries that they considered most profitable, which encouraged investment in light manufacturing. Thus, Deng's reforms shifted China's development strategy to an emphasis on light industry and [[export-oriented industrialization|export-led growth]]. Light industrial output was vital for a developing country coming from a low capital base. With the short gestation period, low capital requirements, and high foreign-exchange export earnings, revenues generated by light manufacturing were able to be reinvested in technologically more advanced production and further capital expenditures and investments.

However, in sharp contrast to the similar, but much less successful reforms in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the [[People's Republic of Hungary]], these investments were not government mandated. The capital invested in heavy industry largely came from the banking system, and most of that capital came from consumer deposits. One of the first items of the Deng reforms was to prevent reallocation of profits except through taxation or through the banking system; hence, the reallocation in state-owned industries was somewhat indirect, thus making them more or less independent from government interference. In short, Deng's reforms sparked an industrial revolution in China.&lt;ref&gt;FlorCruz, Jaime (19 December 2008) [http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/12/18/china.reform.florcruz/index.html &quot;Looking back over China's last 30 years&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230717/http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/12/18/china.reform.florcruz/index.html |date=20 March 2018 }} ''CNN''&lt;/ref&gt;

These reforms were a reversal of the Maoist policy of economic self-reliance. China decided to accelerate the modernization process by stepping up the volume of foreign trade, especially the purchase of machinery from Japan and the West. By participating in such export-led growth, China was able to step up the Four Modernizations by attaining certain foreign funds, market, advanced technologies and management experiences, thus accelerating its economic development. From 1980, Deng attracted foreign companies to a series of [[Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China|Special Economic Zones]], where foreign investment and market liberalization were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoltenberg |first1=Clyde D. |title=China's Special Economic Zones: Their Development and Prospects |journal=Asian Survey |date=1984 |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=637–654 |doi=10.2307/2644396 |issn=0004-4687|jstor=2644396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holmes |first1=Frank |title=China's New Special Economic Zone Evokes Memories Of Shenzhen |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/04/21/chinas-new-special-economic-zone-evokes-memories-of-shenzhen/ |date=21 April 2017 |website=Forbes |accessdate=22 March 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322005508/https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/04/21/chinas-new-special-economic-zone-evokes-memories-of-shenzhen/ |archive-date=22 March 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms sought to improve labor productivity. New material incentives and bonus systems were introduced. Rural markets selling peasants' homegrown products and the surplus products of communes were revived. Not only did rural markets increase agricultural output, they stimulated industrial development as well. With peasants able to sell surplus agricultural yields on the open market, domestic consumption stimulated industrialization as well and also created political support for more difficult economic reforms.

There are some parallels between Deng's [[market socialism]] especially in the early stages, and [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s NEP as well as those of [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s economic policies, in that both foresaw a role for private entrepreneurs and markets based on trade and pricing rather than central planning. An interesting anecdote on this note is the first meeting between Deng and [[Armand Hammer]]. Deng pressed the industrialist and former investor in Lenin's Soviet Union for as much information on the NEP as possible.

=== Crackdown of Tiananmen Square protests ===
{{Main|1989 Tiananmen Square protests}}

The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, culminating in the June Fourth Massacre, were a series of demonstrations in and near Tiananmen Square in the People's Republic of China (PRC) between 15 April and 5 June 1989, a year in which many other [[Revolutions of 1989|communist governments collapsed]].

The protests were sparked by the death of [[Hu Yaobang]], a reformist official backed by Deng but ousted by the [[Eight Elders]] and the conservative wing of the politburo. Many people were dissatisfied with the party's slow response and relatively subdued funeral arrangements. Public mourning began on the streets of Beijing and universities in the surrounding areas. In Beijing this was centered on the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] in Tiananmen Square. The mourning became a public conduit for anger against perceived nepotism in the government, the unfair dismissal and early death of Hu, and the behind-the-scenes role of the &quot;old men&quot;. By the eve of Hu's funeral, the demonstration had reached 100,000 people on Tiananmen Square. While the protests lacked a unified cause or leadership, participants raised the issue of corruption within the government and some voiced calls for economic liberalization&lt;ref name=&quot;nathan&quot; /&gt; and democratic reform&lt;ref name=&quot;nathan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Andrew J. |last=Nathan |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |title=The Tiananmen Papers |work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |date=January–February 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219055135/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010101faessay4257-p0/andrew-j-nathan/the-tiananmen-papers.html |archivedate=19 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; within the structure of the government while others called for a less authoritarian and less centralized form of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialanarchism.org/mod/magazine/display/32/index.php |title=Voices for Tiananmen Square: Beijing Spring and the Democracy Movement |publisher=Socialanarchism.org |date=8 February 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215455/http://www.socialanarchism.org/mod/magazine/display/32/index.php |archive-date=17 September 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Bob (8 February 2006).

During the demonstrations, Deng's pro-market ally general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] supported the demonstrators and distanced himself from the Politburo. Martial law was declared on 20 May by the socialist hardliner [[Li Peng]], but the [[People's Liberation Army at the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests#Attempt to enforce martial law on May 20–23|initial military advance on the city]] was blocked by residents. The movement lasted seven weeks. On 3–4 June, over two hundred thousand soldiers in tanks and helicopters were [[People's Liberation Army at the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests|sent into the city to quell the protests by force]], resulting in hundreds of casualties. Many ordinary people in Beijing believed that Deng had ordered the intervention, but political analysts do not know who was actually behind the order.&lt;ref name=&quot;macfarquhar&quot; /&gt; However, Deng's daughter defends the actions that occurred as a collective decision by the party leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/06/25/2003366781 Deng Xiaoping's daughter defends his Tiananmen Square massacre decision] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014133929/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/06/25/2003366781 |date=14 October 2017 }}.

To purge sympathizers of Tiananmen demonstrators, the Communist Party initiated a one-and-a-half-year-long program similar to the [[Anti-Rightist Movement]]. Old-timers like Deng Fei aimed to deal &quot;strictly with those inside the party with serious tendencies toward bourgeois liberalization&quot;, and more than 30,000 communist officers were deployed to the task.&lt;ref name=&quot;miles&quot; /&gt;

Zhao was placed under house arrest by hardliners and Deng himself was forced to make concessions to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;macfarquhar&quot; /&gt; He soon declared that &quot;the entire imperialist Western world plans to make all socialist countries discard the socialist road and then bring them under the monopoly of international capital and onto the capitalist road&quot;. A few months later he said that the &quot;United States was too deeply involved&quot; in the student movement, referring to foreign reporters who had given financial aid to the student leaders and later helped them escape to various Western countries, primarily the United States through Hong Kong and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=&quot;macfarquhar&quot; /&gt;

Although Deng initially made concessions to the socialist hardliners, he soon resumed his reforms after his 1992 southern tour. After his tour, he was able to stop the attacks of the socialist hardliners on the reforms through their &quot;named capitalist or socialist?&quot; campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, James (1997).

== Resignation and 1992 southern tour ==

Officially, Deng decided to retire from top positions when he stepped down as Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] in 1989, and retired from the political scene in 1992&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/20/world/deng-xiaoping-is-dead-at-92-architect-of-modern-china.html| title=Deng Xiaoping Is Dead at 92; Architect of Modern China| last=Faison| first=Seth| date=20 February 1997|work=The New York Times|access-date=27 July 2019|url-status=live |page = A1 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170123203613/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/20/world/deng-xiaoping-is-dead-at-92-architect-of-modern-china.html|archive-date=23 January 2017| language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/19/40-years-ago-deng-xiaoping-changed-china-and-the-world/|title=Analysis {{!}} 40 years ago, Deng Xiaoping changed China — and the world|newspaper =Washington Post| first = Abraham| last = Denmark |language=en|url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190508043643/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/19/40-years-ago-deng-xiaoping-changed-china-and-the-world/|archive-date=8 May 2019| access-date=27 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  China, however, was still in the ''era of Deng Xiaoping''. He continued to be widely regarded as the &quot;[[paramount leader]]&quot; of the country, believed to have backroom control. Deng was recognized officially as &quot;the chief architect of China's economic reforms and China's socialist modernization&quot;. To the Communist Party, he was believed to have set a good example for communist cadres who refused to retire at old age. He broke earlier conventions of holding offices for life. He was often referred to as simply ''Comrade Xiaoping'', with no title attached.

Because of the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]], Deng's power had been significantly weakened and there was a growing formalist faction opposed to Deng's reforms within the Communist Party. To reassert his economic agenda, in the spring of 1992, Deng made his famous southern tour of China, visiting [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Zhuhai]] and spending the New Year in Shanghai, using his travels as a method of reasserting his economic policy after his retirement from office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5772016/this-1989-speech-is-one-of-the-most-important-in-chinas-history-and|title=This 1989 speech is one of China's most important |last=Fisher| first=Max|date=2 June 2014|website=Vox|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190727204832/https://www.vox.com/2014/6/2/5772016/this-1989-speech-is-one-of-the-most-important-in-chinas-history-and|archive-date=27 July 2019|access-date=27 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SuishengZhao&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Zhao| first=Suisheng |date=1993| author-link= Suisheng Zhao | title=Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour: Elite Politics in Post-Tiananmen China| journal=Asian Survey| volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=739–756| doi=10.2307/2645086| issn=0004-4687| jstor=2645086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his tour, Deng made various speeches and generated large local support for his reformist platform. He stressed the importance of economic reform in China, and criticized those who were against further reform and opening up. Although there was a debate on whether or not Deng actually said it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Iritani |first=Evelyn |date=9 September 2004 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/689588251.html?dids=689588251:689588251&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+9%2C+2004&amp;author=Evelyn+Iritani&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=COLUMN+ONE%3B+Great+Idea+but+Don%27t+Quote+Him%3B+Deng+Xiaoping%27s+famous+one-liner+started+China+on+the+way+to+capitalism.+The+only+problem+is+there%27s+no+proof+he+actually+said+it |title=Great Idea but Don't Quote Him; Deng Xiaoping's famous one-liner started China on the way to capitalism.

He stated that the &quot;leftist&quot; elements of Chinese society were much more dangerous than &quot;rightist&quot; ones. Deng was instrumental in the development of Shanghai's [[Pudong]] New Area, revitalizing the city as China's economic hub.

His southern tour was at first ignored by the Beijing and national media, which were then under the control of Deng's political rivals. [[Jiang Zemin]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] since 1989, showed little support. Challenging their media control, Shanghai's ''[[Jiefang Daily|Liberation Daily]]'' newspaper published several articles supporting reforms authored by &quot;Huangfu Ping&quot;, which quickly gained support amongst local officials and populace. Deng's new wave of policy rhetoric gave way to a new political storm between factions in the Politburo. Jiang eventually sided with Deng, and the national media finally reported Deng's southern tour several months after it occurred. Observers suggest that Jiang's submission to Deng's policies had solidified his position as Deng's heir apparent. Behind the scenes, Deng's southern tour aided his reformist allies' climb to the apex of national power, and permanently changed China's direction toward economic development. In addition, the eventual outcome of the southern tour proved that Deng was still the most powerful man in China.&lt;ref name=SuishengZhao/&gt;

Deng's insistence on economic openness aided in the phenomenal growth levels of the coastal areas, especially the &quot;[[Yangtze River Delta|Golden Triangle]]&quot; region surrounding Shanghai. {{citation needed span|Deng reiterated the general policy that 'some areas must get rich before others'|date=June 2019|reason=What exactly did he say in 1992? https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiquote:Reference_desk&amp;diff=2623655&amp;oldid=2623555}}, and asserted that the wealth from coastal regions will eventually be transferred to aid economic construction inland. The theory, however, faced numerous challenges when put into practice, as provincial governments moved to protect their own interests.

== Death and reaction ==
[[File:Deng Funeral.jpg|thumb|Deng Xiaoping's ashes lie in state in Beijing whose banner reads &quot;Memorial Service of Comrade Deng Xiaoping&quot;, February 1997]]
Deng died on 19 February 1997, aged 92 from a lung infection and [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise of Modern China|last1=Hsü|first1=Immanuel C.Y.|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195125047|edition=6th|location=New York|page=974|authorlink1=Immanuel C. Y. Hsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though his successor Jiang Zemin was in firm control, government policies maintained Deng's [[Deng Xiaoping Theory|political and economic philosophies]]. Officially, Deng was eulogized as a &quot;great Marxist, great Proletarian Revolutionary, statesman, military strategist, and diplomat; one of the main leaders of the [[Communist Party of China]], the [[People's Liberation Army]] of China, and the People's Republic of China; the great architect of China's socialist opening-up and modernized construction; the founder of [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9702/24/china.deng/ CNN: China officially mourns Deng Xiaoping] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021119122614/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9702/24/china.deng/ |date=19 November 2002 }} 24 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The public was largely prepared for Deng's death, as rumors had been circulating for a long time that his health was deteriorating. At 10:00 on the morning of 24 February, people were asked by Premier [[Li Peng]] to pause in silence for three minutes. The nation's flags flew at [[half-mast]] for over a week. The nationally televised funeral, which was a simple and relatively private affair attended by the country's leaders and Deng's family, was broadcast on all cable channels.

After the funeral, his organs were donated to medical research, the remains were cremated, and his ashes were subsequently scattered at sea, according to his wishes. For the next two weeks, Chinese state media ran news stories and documentaries related to Deng's life and death, with the regular 19:00 ''[[Xinwen Lianbo|National News]]'' program in the evening lasting almost two hours over the regular broadcast time.

Certain segments of the Chinese population, notably the modern Maoists and radical reformers (the far left and the far right), had negative views on Deng. In the year that followed, songs like &quot;[[Story of Spring]]&quot; by [[Dong Wenhua]], which were created in Deng's honour shortly after Deng's southern tour in 1992, once again were widely played.

There was a significant amount of international reaction to Deng's death: UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] said Deng was to be remembered &quot;in the international community at large as a primary architect of China's modernization and dramatic economic development&quot;. French President [[Jacques Chirac]] said &quot;In the course of this century, few men have, as much as Deng, led a vast human community through such profound and determining changes&quot;; British Prime Minister [[John Major]] commented about Deng's key role in the return of Hong Kong to Chinese control; Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] called Deng a &quot;pivotal figure&quot; in Chinese history. The [[Kuomintang]] chair in Taiwan also sent its condolences, saying it longed for peace, cooperation, and prosperity. The [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] voiced regret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9702/19/deng.world.reax/index.html CNN:World leaders praise Deng's economic legacy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816133436/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9702/19/deng.world.reax/index.html |date=16 August 2007 }} 24 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memorials ==
[[File:Deng Xiaoping statue in Shenzhen.JPG|thumb|Statue of Deng in [[Shenzhen]]]]

When compared to the memorials of other CPC leaders, those dedicated to Deng have been low profile, in keeping with Deng's image of pragmatism. Moreover, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea, as opposed to being embalmed like Mao.

There are a few public displays of Deng in the country. A bronze statue of Deng was erected on 14 November 2000, at the grand plaza of [[Lianhuashan Park|Lianhua Mountain Park]] in [[Shenzhen]]. This statue is dedicated to Deng's role as a planner and contributor to the development of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, starting in 1979. The statue is {{Convert|6|m|ft|0}} high, with an additional 3.68-meter base. The statue shows Deng striding forward confidently. Many CPC high level leaders visit the statue. In addition, in coastal areas and on the island province of [[Hainan]], Deng is seen on roadside billboards with messages emphasizing economic reform or his policy of [[one country, two systems]].

Another bronze statue of Deng was dedicated 13 August 2004 in the city of [[Guang'an]], Deng's hometown, in southwest China's [[Sichuan]]. The statue was erected to commemorate Deng's 100th birthday. The statue shows Deng, dressed casually, sitting on a chair and smiling. The Chinese characters for &quot;Statue of Deng Xiaoping&quot; are inscribed on the pedestal. The original calligraphy was written by Jiang, then Chairman of the Central Military Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/14/content_365434.htm |title=China Daily article &quot;Deng Xiaoping statue unveiled&quot; |work=China Daily |accessdate=13 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503063737/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-08/14/content_365434.htm |archive-date=3 May 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Deng Xiaoping's Former Residence]] in his hometown of Paifang Village in [[Sichuan]] has been preserved as a museum telling Deng's life story.
