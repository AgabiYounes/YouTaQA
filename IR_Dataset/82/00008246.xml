== Etymology ==
&lt;!-- Please cite alternative terms with a reliable source --&gt;
The term &quot;dumpster diving&quot; emerged in the 1980s, combining &quot;diving&quot; with &quot;[[dumpster]]&quot;, a large commercial [[trash bin]].&lt;ref name=OEDdumpsterdiving&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Encyclopedia]] |title= dumpster diving, n |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/258481?redirectedFrom=dumpster+diving&amp; |access-date= September 17, 2015 |year= 1993 |publisher= University of Oxford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Dumpster&quot; itself comes from the Dempster Dumpster, a brand of bins manufactured by Dempster Brothers beginning in 1937. &quot;Dumpster&quot; became [[generic trademark|genericized]] by the 1970s.&lt;ref name=OEDDumpster&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title= dumpster, n |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/242635#eid12613926 |access-date= September 17, 2015 |year= 1993 |publisher= University of Oxford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Oxford American Dictionary|editor=Erin McKean|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|edition= second|isbn=978-0-19-517077-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term &quot;dumpster diving&quot; is chiefly found in [[American English]] and first appeared in print in 1983, with the verb &quot;dumpster-dive&quot; appearing a few years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;OEDdumpsterdiving&quot;/&gt; In [[British English]], the practice may be known as &quot;skipping&quot;, from [[Skip (container)|skip]], another term for this type of container.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewycka&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Issue 561&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title= skip, n.2 |url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/180963?rskey=tdddnG&amp;result=2#eid |access-date= September 17, 2015 |year= 1993 |publisher= University of Oxford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative names for the practice include bin-diving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2007/aug/17/wastenotwantnot |title= Why I love bin diving |first= Alex |last= Renton |date=August 17, 2007 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 28, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; containering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4881647,00.html |title=Dumpster diving stays on trend in Germany |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; D-mart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Niki D&amp;#039;Andrea |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2009-08-20/news/dumpster-dining-for-freegans-eating-garbage-is-getting-downright-trendy/ |title=Dumpster Dining: For Freegans, Eating Garbage Is Getting Downright Trendy - Page 1 - News - Phoenix |website=Phoenix New Times |date=2012-08-30 |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; dumpstering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/consumer/article451134.ece |title=One man's trash is another man's ... lunch ≤or software treat≥ |first=Dalia |last= Colon |date= April 11, 2008 |website=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=November 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; totting,&lt;ref name=HSE/&gt; and skipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureunplugged.com/play/6316/Skipping-Dinner |title=Skipping Diner |year=2010 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, garbage picking is called &quot;skip dipping.&quot;

The term &quot;binner&quot; is often used to describe individuals who collect recyclable materials for their deposit value. For example, in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, binners, or bottle collectors, search garbage cans and dumpsters for [[recycling|recyclable materials]] that can be redeemed for their [[Deposit-refund system|deposit value]]. On average, these binners earn about $40 a day for several garbage bags full of discarded containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Emily | last = Jackson | title = Vancouver fireworks a boon for city | date = 2010-07-28 | url = https://vancouversun.com/Vancouver+fireworks+boon+city+bottle+collectors/3334521/story.html | work = The Vancouver Sun | accessdate = 2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[karung guni]], [[Zabbaleen]], the [[rag and bone man]], [[waste picker]], [[junk man]] or bin hoker are terms for people who make their living by sorting and trading trash. A similar process known as [[gleaning]] was practised in rural areas and some ancient agricultural societies, where the residue from farmers' fields was collected.

Some dumpster divers, who self-identify as [[Freeganism|freegan]]s, aim to reduce their [[ecological footprint]] by living from dumpster-dived-goods,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansvelt&quot;/&gt; sometimes exclusively.

== Overview ==
The activity is performed by people out of necessity in the developing world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rufus &amp; Lawson&quot;/&gt; Some scavengers perform in organized groups, and some organize on various internet forums and social networking websites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rufus &amp; Lawson&quot;/&gt; By [[Reuse|reusing]], or repurposing, resources destined for the [[landfill]], dumpster diving is sometimes considered to be an [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] endeavor,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansvelt&quot;/&gt; and is thus practiced by many pro-green communities. The wastefulness of consumer society and throw-away culture compels some individuals to rescue usable items (for example, computers or [[smartphones]], which are frequently discarded due to the extensive use of [[planned obsolescence]] in the technology industry) from destruction&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansvelt&quot;/&gt; and divert them to those who can make use of the items.

A wide variety of things may be disposed while still repairable or in working condition, making salvage of them a source of potentially free items for personal use, or to sell for profit. Irregular, blemished or damaged items that are still otherwise functional are regularly thrown away. [[Food waste|Discarded food]] that might have slight imperfections, near its [[shelf life|expiration date]], or that is simply being replaced by newer stock is often tossed out despite being still edible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansvelt&quot;/&gt; Many retailers are reluctant to sell this stock at reduced prices because of the risks that people will buy it instead of the higher-priced newer stock, that extra handling time is required, and that there are [[Public liability|liability]] risks. In the [[United Kingdom]], cookery books have been written on the cooking and consumption of such foods, which has contributed to the popularity of skipping.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Artists often use discarded materials retrieved from trash receptacles to create works of [[found objects]] or [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31130-2004Nov6.html|title=Get Your Mind Into the Gutter|last=Sachs|first=Andrea|date=7 November 2004|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students have been known to partake in dumpster diving to obtain high tech items for technical projects, or simply to indulge their curiosity for unusual items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Dumpster Diving|first = Cyndeth|last = Allison|newspaper = North Denver News|date = 8 May 2007|url = http://northdenvernews.com/content/view/766/2/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103000805/http://northdenvernews.com/content/view/766/2/|archivedate=November 3, 2007|postscript = &lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dumpster diving can additionally be used in support of academic research. Garbage picking serves as the main tool for [[garbology|garbologist]]s, who study the [[sociology]] and [[archeology]] of trash in modern life.  Private and government investigators may pick through garbage to obtain information for their inquiries. Illegal cigarette consumption may be deduced from discarded packages.

Dumpster diving can be hazardous, due to potential exposure to [[Biological hazard|biohazardous]] matter, broken glass, and overall unsanitary conditions that may exist in dumpsters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rufus &amp; Lawson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/28/amazon-dumpster-death-homeless-man-frank-ryan|title=Death in an Amazon dumpster|first=Alastair|last=Gee|date=28 December 2017|publisher=|access-date=28 January 2018|via=www.TheGuardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against garbage picking often focus on the health and cleanliness implications of people rummaging in trash.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} This exposes the dumpster divers to potential health risks, and, especially if the dumpster diver does not return the non-usable items to their previous location, may leave trash scattered around. Divers can also be seriously injured or killed by garbage collection vehicles; in January 2012, in [[La Jolla]], Swiss-American man [[Alfonso de Bourbon]] was killed by a truck while dumpster diving.&lt;ref name=&quot;LJL&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lajollalight.com/2012/01/12/victim-in-alleyway-dumpster-death-identified-as-alfonso-de-bourbon-83/|title=Victim in alleyway dumpster death identified as Alfonso de Bourbon, 83|publisher=La Jolla Light|date=11 January 2012|last=Schwab|first=Dave|access-date=30 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220053609/http://www.lajollalight.com/2012/01/12/victim-in-alleyway-dumpster-death-identified-as-alfonso-de-bourbon-83/|archivedate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, there are also concerns around the legality of taking items that may still technically belong to the person who threw them away (or to the waste management operator), and whether the taking of some items like discarded documents is a [[Privacy laws of the United States|violation of privacy]]. In general a legal concept called abandonment of property covers this question of the subject of ownership of property that is disposed of.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Discarded billing records may be used for [[identity theft]]. As a [[privacy violation]], discarded medical records as trash led to a $140,000 penalty against  Massachusetts billing company Goldthwait Associates and a group of pathology offices in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/whitecoatnotes/2013/01/07/doctors-billing-company-pay-penalty-for-records-tossed-public-dump/FDGSf172lyc2xasT6D0DRM/story.html|title=Doctors, billing company pay $140,000 penalty for records tossed in public dump|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a $400,000 settlement between Midwest Women's Healthcare Specialists and 1,532 clients in Kansas City in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article4279093.html|title=Settlement reached in medical billing records case|website=kansascity|accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==
Since dumpsters are usually located on private premises, divers may occasionally get in trouble for [[trespassing]] while dumpster diving, though the law is enforced with varying degrees of rigor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansvelt&quot;/&gt; Some businesses may lock dumpsters to prevent pickers from congregating on their property, vandalism to their property, and to limit potential liability if a dumpster diver is injured while on their property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mansvelt&quot;/&gt; 

[[Police]] searches of discarded waste as well as similar methods are also generally not considered violations; [[evidence (law)|evidence]] [[Search and seizure|seized]] in this manner has been permitted in many [[criminal procedure|criminal trials]]. In the United States this has been affirmed by numerous courts including and up to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], in the decision ''[[California v. Greenwood]]''. The doctrine is not as well established in regards to [[civil litigation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Companies run by private investigators specializing in such techniques have emerged as a result of the need for discreet, undetected retrieval of documents and evidence for civil and criminal trials. Private investigators have also written books on &quot;P.I. technique&quot; in which dumpster diving or its equivalent &quot;wastebasket recovery&quot; figures prominently.

=== By country ===
In 2009, a Belgian dumpster diver and eco-activist nicknamed Ollie was detained for a month for removing food from a garbage can, and was accused of theft and burglary. On February 25, 2009, he was arrested for removing food from a garbage can at an [[Delhaize Group|AD Delhaize]] supermarket in Bruges. Ollie's trial evoked protests in Belgium against restrictions from taking discarded food items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Auteur: Arne Franck |url=http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=PH276CR6 |title=De Standaard: Arrogante houding houdt voedseldief in de cel |publisher=Standaard.be |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indymedia.nl/nl/2009/03/57978.shtml |title=Update Skipper in de Brugse gevangenis |publisher=Indymedia NL |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.be/en/node/32078 |title=Lawaaidemo voor Ollie aan de poorten van de Burgse gevangenis |publisher=Indymedia.be |date=2009-03-05 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ontario]], Canada, the ''[[Trespass to Property Act (Ontario)|Trespass to Property Act]]''—legislation dating back to the [[Constitution Act, 1867|''British North America Act'' of 1867]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wired509&quot;/&gt;—grants property owners and security guards the power to ban anyone from their premises, for any reason, permanently. This is done by issuing a notice to the intruder, who will only be breaking the law upon return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite canlaw|short title=Trespass to Property Act|abbr=RSO|year=1990|chapter=T.21|section=3|subsection=1|link=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-t21/latest/rso-1990-c-t21.html|linkloc=CanLII|wikilink=Trespass to Property Act of Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar laws exist in [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite canlaw|short title=Trespass to Property Act|abbr=RSPEI|year=1988|chapter=T-6|section=2|subsection=2|link=http://www.canlii.org/en/pe/laws/stat/rspei-1988-c-t-6/latest/rspei-1988-c-t-6.html|linkloc=CanLII}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite canlaw|short title=The Trespass to Property Act|abbr=SS|year=2009|chapter=T-20.2|section=11|link=http://www.canlii.org/en/sk/laws/stat/ss-2009-c-t-20.2/latest/ss-2009-c-t-20.2.html|linkloc=CanLII}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent case in Canada, which involved a police officer who retrieved a discarded weapon from a trash receptacle as evidence, created some controversy. The judge ruled the policeman's actions as legal although there was no warrant present, which led some to speculate the event as validation for any Canadian citizen to raid garbage disposals.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired509&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Cory Doctorow |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.09/es_dumpster.html |title=Wired 5.09: Dumpster Diving |website=Wired |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skipping in England and Wales may qualify as theft within the [[Theft Act 1968]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theft Act 1968|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60|publisher=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=October 2015}}  or as common-law theft in [[Scotland]], though there is very little enforcement in practice.

In Germany, dumpster diving is referred to as &quot;containern&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dR8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139 | title=Politische Mahlzeiten. Political Meals | publisher=LIT Verlag Münster | year=2014 | pages=139 | isbn=978-3643126887}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a waste container's contents are regarded as the property of the container's owner. Therefore, taking items from such a container is viewed as theft. However, the police will routinely disregard the illegality of garbage picking since the items found are generally of low value. There has only been one known instance where people were prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malkus|first=Max|date=2016|year=|title=Containern – strafbar und strafwürdig?|url=http://www.magazin-restkultur.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/MGZNRK_MaxMalkus-Containern-strafbar-strafwuerdig_.pdf|journal=Magazin für Restkultur|volume=4/2016|pages= 2|via=|doi-access=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 individuals were arrested on assumed burglary as they had surmounted a supermarket's fence which was then followed by a theft complaint by the owner; the case was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/pt/2004/12/21/a0047.nf/text |title=Archiv |website=die Tageszeitung |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the 1988 ''[[California v. Greenwood]]'' case in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] held that there is no [[common law]] [[expectation of privacy]] for [[post-consumer waste|discarded materials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=California v. Greenwood|volume=486|page=35|year=1988|pin=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, limits to what can legally be taken from a company's refuse. In a 1983 [[Minnesota]] case involving the theft of customer lists from a garbage can, ''Tennant Company v. Advance Machine Company'' (355 N.W.2d 720), the owner of the discarded information was awarded $500,000 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TENNANT CO. v. ADVANCE MACH.

[[File:Dumpster diving Linkoping.jpg|thumb|Food obtained by dumpster diving in [[Linköping]], [[Sweden]]]]

Dumpster diving is practiced differently in developed countries than in developing countries.

* '''Food'''. In many developing countries, food is rarely thrown away unless it is rotten as food is scarce in comparison to developed nations. In countries like the United States, where 40 to 50 percent of food is wasted, the trash contains a lot more food to gather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 18 November 2004|last = Harrison|first = Jeff|title = U.S. Wastes Half of Food Produced|url = http://uanews.org/node/10448|accessdate = 2010-03-07|postscript = &lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, charities collect excess food from supermarkets and restaurants and distribute it to impoverished neighbourhoods. Trash pickers, [[Karung guni]], [[Zabaleen]], and [[Rag and bone man|rag and bone men]] in these countries may concentrate on looking for usable items or scrap materials to sell rather than food items. In the United States, Canada, and Europe, some bakeries, [[Supermarket|grocery stores]], or restaurants will routinely donate food according to a [[Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act|Good Samaritan Food Donation Act]], but more often, because of health laws or company policy, they are required to discard food items by the [[shelf life|expiration date]], because of overstock, being overly ripened, spoiled, cosmetically imperfect, or blemished.
* '''Books and periodicals'''. As proof to publishing houses of unsold merchandise, booksellers will routinely remove the front covers of printed materials to render them destroyed prior to disposing of their remains in the garbage. Though readable, many damaged publications have disclaimers and legal notices against their existence or sale.
* '''Irregular or damaged goods'''. [[Office]]s, [[factory|factories]], [[department store]]s, and other commercial establishments may equally throw out non-perishable items that are irregular, were returned, have minor damages, or are replaced by newer inventory. Many items tend to be in such a state of disrepair or cosmetically flawed that they will require some work to make the items functionally usable. For this reason, employees will at times intentionally destroy their items prior to being discarded to prevent them from being reused or resold.
* '''Returned items'''. Manufacturers often find it cheaper to routinely discard items returned as defective under warranty instead of repairing them, although a device is often repairable or usable as a source of spare parts to repair other, similar discarded devices.
* '''School Supplies'''. At the end of each school year many people throw away perfectly useful supplies like pencils, pens, notebooks, art supplies.
* '''[[eWaste]]'''. Some [[consumer electronics]] are dumped because of their rapid depreciation, obsolescence, cost to repair, or expense to upgrade. Owners of functional computers may find it easier to dump them rather than donate because many nonprofit organizations and schools are unable, or unwilling, to work with used equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 6 November 2003|last = Ha|first = Tanya|title = E-waste|url = http://abc.net.au/science/features/ewaste|accessdate = 2007-06-11|publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|postscript = &lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally, vendors dispose of unsaleable, non-defective new merchandise as landfill. The [[Atari video game burial]] in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]] after the [[North American video game crash of 1983]] is a well-known example; a 2014 excavation recovered about 1300 games for curation as museum exhibits or auction.
* '''Clothing'''. While thrift stores routinely refuse used goods which they cannot cheaply and easily resell, the items which they do accept cost them nothing.
