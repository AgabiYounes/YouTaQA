Death – particularly the death of [[human]]s – has commonly been considered a [[sadness|sad]] or unpleasant occasion, due to the [[affection]] for the being that has died and the termination of social and familial [[human bonding|bonds]] with the deceased. Other concerns include [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of death]], [[necrophobia]], [[anxiety]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], [[grief]], [[emotional pain]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], [[solitude]], or [[saudade]]. Many cultures and religions have the idea of an [[afterlife]], and also hold the idea of [[Heaven|reward]] or [[Judgement (afterlife)|judgement]] and [[Hell|punishment for past sin]].

== Senescence ==
[[File:Dead magpie.jpg|thumb|alt=A dead magpie|A dead [[Eurasian magpie]]]]

[[Senescence]] refers to a scenario when a living being is able to survive all calamities, but eventually dies due to causes relating to old age. Animal and plant cells normally reproduce and function during the whole period of natural existence, but the aging process derives from deterioration of cellular activity and ruination of regular functioning. Aptitude of cells for gradual deterioration and mortality means that cells are naturally sentenced to stable and long-term loss of living capacities, even despite continuing metabolic reactions and viability. In the United Kingdom, for example, nine out of ten of all the deaths that occur on a daily basis relates to senescence, while around the world it accounts for two-thirds of 150,000 deaths that take place daily (Hayflick &amp; Moody, 2003).

Almost all [[animal]]s who survive external hazards to their biological functioning eventually die from [[Senescence|biological aging]], known in life sciences as &quot;senescence&quot;. Some organisms experience [[negligible senescence]], even exhibiting [[biological immortality]].  These include the jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |title=Turritopsis nutricula (Immortal jellyfish) |publisher=Jellyfishfacts.net |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163459/http://www.jellyfishfacts.net/turritopsis-nutricula-immortal-jellyfish.html |archivedate=13 October 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]], and the [[planarian]]. Unnatural causes of death include [[suicide]] and [[predation]]. From all causes, roughly 150,000 people die around the world each day.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aubrey D.N.J |first=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations |journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology |volume=1 |issue=1, Article 5 |year=2007 |url=http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013163622/http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/ENHANCE-PP.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, two thirds die directly or indirectly due to senescence, but in industrialized countries – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany – the rate approaches 90% (i.e., nearly nine out of ten of all deaths are related to senescence).&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011&quot; /&gt;

[[Physiological]] death is now seen as a process, more than an event: conditions once considered indicative of death are now reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crippen |first=David |website=Scientific American Surgery, Critical Care, April 2005 |url=http://www.sciamsurgery.com/sciamsurgery/institutional/payPerAdd.action?chapterId=part08_ch10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624132446/http://www.acssurgery.com/abstracts/acs/acs0812.htm |archivedate=24 June 2006 |title=Brain Failure and Brain Death |accessdate=9 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where in the process a dividing line is drawn between life and death depends on factors beyond the presence or absence of [[vital signs]].

===Signs===
{{redirects|Stages of death|the model of stages of grief prior to death|Kübler-Ross model}}
Signs of death or strong indications that a [[endotherm|warm-blooded animal]] is no longer alive are:
* [[Respiratory arrest]] (no [[breathing]])
* [[Cardiac arrest]] (no [[heart rate|pulse]])
* [[Brain death]] (no neuronal activity)

The stages that follow after death are:
* {{lang|la|[[Pallor mortis]]}}, paleness which happens in the 15–120 minutes after death
* {{lang|la|[[Algor mortis]]}}, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
* {{lang|la|[[Rigor mortis]]}}, the limbs of the corpse become stiff (Latin ''rigor'') and difficult to move or manipulate
* {{lang|la|[[Livor mortis]]}}, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
* [[Putrefaction]], the beginning signs of decomposition
* [[Decomposition]], the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.
* [[Skeletonization]], the end of decomposition, where all soft tissues have decomposed, leaving only the skeleton.
* [[Fossilization]], the natural preservation of the skeletal remains formed over a very long period

The concept of death is a key to human understanding of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=&quot;MohammadSamir&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Samir Hossain Mohammad |author2=Gilbert Peter | year = 2010 | title = Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment | url = | journal = Illness, Crisis and Loss | volume = 18 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many scientific approaches and various interpretations of the concept. Additionally, the advent of life-sustaining therapy and the numerous criteria for defining death from both a medical and legal standpoint, have made it difficult to create a single unifying definition.

One of the challenges in defining death is in distinguishing it from [[life]]. As a point in time, death would seem to refer to the moment at which life ends. Determining when death has occurred is difficult, as cessation of life functions is often not simultaneous across organ systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Crossing Over: How Science Is Redefining Life and Death |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/04/dying-death-brain-dead-body-consciousness-science/ |author=Henig, Robin Marantz |authorlink=Robin Marantz Henig |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=April 2016 |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such determination therefore requires drawing precise conceptual boundaries between life and death. This is difficult, due to there being little consensus on how to define life.

It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness. When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died. One of the flaws in this approach is that there are many organisms which are alive but probably not conscious (for example, single-celled organisms). Another problem is in defining consciousness, which has many different definitions given by modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers.  Additionally, many religious traditions, including [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] and [[Dharmic religions|Dharmic]] traditions, hold that death does not (or may not) entail the end of consciousness.  In certain cultures, death is more of a process than a single event. It implies a slow shift from one spiritual state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1991 |last=Metcalf |first=Peter |last2=Huntington |first2=Richard |title=Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual |publisher=Cambridge Press |place=New York}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other definitions for death focus on the character of cessation of something.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary{{clarify|date=January 2014|reason=This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=January 2014|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation. Use Template:Cite web or similar to provide source details. Use &lt;ref...&gt; inline in the article (see WP:CITE) to source the specific facts provided by this reference.&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} More specifically, death occurs when a living entity experiences irreversible cessation of all functioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; As it pertains to human life, death is an irreversible process where someone loses their existence as a person.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=DeGrazia|first=David|title=The Definition of Death|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/death-definition/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, attempts to define the exact moment of a human's death have been subjective, or imprecise. Death was once defined as the cessation of [[heart]]beat ([[cardiac arrest]]) and of [[breath]]ing, but the development of [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and prompt [[defibrillation]] have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. This type of death where circulatory and respiratory arrest happens is known as the circulatory definition of death (DCDD). Proponents of the DCDD believe that this definition is reasonable because a person with permanent loss of circulatory and respiratory function should be considered dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernat|first=James L.|date=2018|title=Conceptual Issues in DCDD Donor Death Determination|journal=Hastings Center Report|volume=48|issue=S4|pages=S26–S28|doi=10.1002/hast.948|pmid=30584853|issn=1552-146X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of this definition state that while cessation of these functions may be permanent, it does not mean the situation is not irreversible, because if CPR was applied, the person could be revived.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;/&gt; Thus, the arguments for and against the DCDD boil down to a matter of defining the actual words &quot;permanent&quot; and &quot;irreversible,&quot; which further complicates the challenge of defining death. Furthermore, events which were [[causality|causally]] linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of [[life support]] devices, [[organ transplants]] and [[artificial pacemaker]]s.

Today, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to &quot;brain death&quot; or &quot;biological death&quot; to define a person as being dead; people are considered dead when the electrical activity in their brain ceases. It is presumed that an end of electrical activity indicates the end of [[consciousness]]. Suspension of consciousness must be permanent, and not transient, as occurs during certain [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|sleep]] stages, and especially a [[coma]]. In the case of sleep, [[electroencephalography|EEGs]] can easily tell the difference.

The category of &quot;brain death&quot; is seen as problematic by some scholars. For instance, Dr. Franklin Miller, senior faculty member at the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes: &quot;By the late 1990s... the equation of brain death with death of the human being was increasingly challenged by scholars, based on evidence regarding the array of biological functioning displayed by patients correctly diagnosed as having this condition who were maintained on mechanical ventilation for substantial periods of time. These patients maintained the ability to sustain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and, most dramatically, to gestate fetuses (in the case of pregnant &quot;brain-dead&quot; women).&quot;&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller |first=F.G. |title=Death and organ donation: back to the future |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |date=October 2009 |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=616–620 |doi=10.1136/jme.2009.030627 |pmid=19793942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While &quot;brain death&quot; is viewed as problematic by some scholars, there are certainly proponents of it that believe this definition of death is the most reasonable for distinguishing life from death. The reasoning behind the support for this definition is that brain death has a set of criteria that is reliable and reproducible.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magnus|first=David C.|last2=Wilfond|first2=Benjamin S.|last3=Caplan|first3=Arthur L.|date=2014-03-06|title=Accepting Brain Death|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=10|pages=891–894|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1400930|issn=0028-4793|pmid=24499177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the brain is crucial in determining our identity or who we are as human beings. The distinction should be made that &quot;brain death&quot; cannot be equated with one who is in a vegetative state or coma, in that the former situation describes a state that is beyond recovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

Those people maintaining that only the [[neo-cortex]] of the brain is necessary for consciousness sometimes argue that only electrical activity should be considered when defining death. Eventually it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of [[cognition|cognitive]] function, as evidenced by the death of the [[cerebral cortex]]. All hope of recovering human thought and [[personality psychology|personality]] is then gone given current and foreseeable medical technology. At present, in most places the more conservative definition of death&amp;nbsp;– irreversible cessation of electrical activity in the whole brain, as opposed to just in the neo-cortex&amp;nbsp;– has been adopted (for example the [[Uniform Determination Of Death Act]] in the United States). In 2005, the [[Terri Schiavo case]] brought the question of brain death and artificial sustenance to the front of [[Politics of the United States|American politics]].

Even by whole-brain criteria, the determination of brain death can be complicated. EEGs can detect spurious electrical impulses, while certain [[drugs]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], or [[hypothermia]] can suppress or even stop brain activity on a temporary basis. Because of this, hospitals have protocols for determining brain death involving EEGs at widely separated intervals under defined conditions.

In the past, adoption of this whole-brain definition was a conclusion of the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Ariane|last2=Cahn-Fuller|first2=Katherine|last3=Caplan|first3=Arthur|date=March 2017|title=Shouldn't Dead Be Dead?: The Search for a Uniform Definition of Death|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|volume=45|issue=1|pages=112–128|doi=10.1177/1073110517703105|pmid=28661278|issn=1073-1105}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that this approach to defining death sufficed in reaching a uniform definition nationwide. A multitude of reasons were presented to support this definition including: uniformity of standards in law for establishing death; consumption of a family's fiscal resources for artificial life support; and legal establishment for equating brain death with death in order to proceed with organ donation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarbey|first=Ben|date=2016-12-01|title=Definitions of death: brain death and what matters in a person|journal=Journal of Law and the Biosciences|volume=3|issue=3|pages=743–752|doi=10.1093/jlb/lsw054|pmid=28852554|pmc=5570697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the issue of support of or dispute against brain death, there is another inherent problem in this categorical definition: the variability of its application in medical practice. In 1995, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), established a set of criteria that became the medical standard for diagnosing neurologic death. At that time, three clinical features had to be satisfied in order to determine “irreversible cessation” of the total brain including: coma with clear etiology, cessation of breathing, and lack of brainstem reflexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernat|first=James L.|date=March 2013|title=Controversies in defining and determining death in critical care|journal=Nature Reviews Neurology|volume=9|issue=3|pages=164–173|doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2013.12|pmid=23419370|issn=1759-4766}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of criteria was then updated again most recently in 2010, but substantial discrepancies still remain across hospitals and medical specialties.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

The problem of defining death is especially imperative as it pertains to the [[Dead donor rule]], which could be understood as one of the following interpretations of the rule: there must be an official declaration of death in a person before starting organ procurement or that organ procurement cannot result in death of the donor.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;/&gt; A great deal of controversy has surrounded the definition of death and the dead donor rule. Advocates of the rule believe the rule is legitimate in protecting organ donors while also countering against any moral or legal objection to organ procurement. Critics, on the other hand, believe that the rule does not uphold the best interests of the donors and that the rule does not effectively promote organ donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

===Legal===

The death of a person has legal consequences that may vary between different jurisdictions.
A [[death certificate]] is issued in most jurisdictions, either by a doctor, or by an administrative office upon presentation of a doctor's declaration of death.

[[File:Wiertz burial.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Wiertz]]'s painting of a man buried alive]]
There are many anecdotal references to people being declared dead by physicians and then &quot;coming back to life&quot;, sometimes days later in their own coffin, or when [[embalming]] procedures are about to begin. From the mid-18th century onwards, there was an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before [[burial]], ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet or into the [[rectum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|pp=56,&amp;nbsp;71.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1895, the physician J.C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in [[England]] and [[Wales]], although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bondeson|2001|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[electric shock]], [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) for an hour or longer can allow stunned [[nerve]]s to recover, allowing an apparently dead person to survive. People found unconscious under icy water may survive if their faces are kept continuously cold until they arrive at an [[emergency department|emergency room]].&lt;ref name=Limmer&gt;{{cite book |title=Brady Emergency Care AHA |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-159390-9 |author1=Limmer, Dan |author2=O'Keefe, Michael F. |author3=Bergeron, J.

As medical technologies advance, ideas about when death occurs may have to be re-evaluated in light of the ability to restore a person to vitality after longer periods of apparent death (as happened when CPR and defibrillation showed that cessation of heartbeat is inadequate as a decisive indicator of death). The lack of electrical brain activity may not be enough to consider someone scientifically dead. Therefore, the concept of information-theoretic death&lt;ref name=&quot;InfoDeath&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The leading cause of human death in [[developing countries]] is [[infectious disease]]. The leading causes in [[developed countries]] are [[atherosclerosis]] ([[heart disease]] and [[stroke]]), [[cancer]], and other diseases related to [[obesity]] and [[aging]]. By an extremely wide margin, the largest unifying cause of death in the developed world is biological aging,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011&quot; /&gt; leading to various complications known as [[aging-associated diseases]]. These conditions cause loss of [[homeostasis]], leading to [[cardiac arrest]], causing loss of [[oxygen]] and nutrient supply, causing irreversible deterioration of the [[Human brain|brain]] and other [[tissue (biology)|tissues]].

[[Hans Selye|Selye]] proposed a unified non-specific approach to many causes of death. He demonstrated that [[Stress (biology)|stress]] decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource, ''adaptation energy''. The animal dies when this resource is exhausted.&lt;ref name=&quot;SelyeAE2&quot;&gt;Selye, H. (1938). Experimental evidence supporting the conception of &quot;adaptation energy&quot;, Am. J. Physiol. 123 (1938), 758–765.&lt;/ref&gt; Selye assumed that  the adaptability is a finite supply, presented at birth. Later on, Goldstone proposed the concept of a production or income of adaptation energy which may be stored (up to a limit), as a capital reserve of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goldstone B |year=1952 |title=The general practitioner and the general adaptation syndrome |journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent works,  adaptation energy is considered as an internal coordinate on the &quot;dominant path&quot; in the model of adaptation.

=== Autopsy ===
[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|thumb|alt=A painting of an autopsy, by Rembrandt, entitled &quot;The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp&quot;|An autopsy is portrayed in ''[[The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]
An [[autopsy]], also known as a ''postmortem examination'' or an ''obduction'', is a [[medical procedure]] that consists of a thorough [[Medical examination|examination]] of a human [[dead body|corpse]] to determine the cause and manner of a person's death and to evaluate any [[disease]] or [[injury]] that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized [[physician|medical doctor]] called a [[pathologist]].

Autopsies are either performed for legal or medical purposes. A forensic autopsy is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter, while a clinical or academic autopsy is performed to find the medical cause of death and is used in cases of unknown or uncertain death, or for research purposes. Autopsies can be further classified into cases where external examination suffices, and those where the body is dissected and an internal examination is conducted. Permission from [[next of kin]] may be required for internal autopsy in some cases. Once an internal autopsy is complete the body is generally reconstituted by sewing it back together. Autopsy is important in a medical environment and may shed light on mistakes and help improve practices.

A necropsy, which is not always a medical procedure, was a term previously used to describe an unregulated postmortem examination . In modern times, this term is more commonly associated with the corpses of animals.

=== Cryonics ===
[[File:Cryo surgery.jpg|thumb|Technicians prepare a body for cryopreservation in 1985.]]
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]] (from Greek κρύος 'kryos-' meaning 'icy cold') is the [[cryopreservation|low-temperature preservation]] of animals and humans who cannot be sustained by contemporary medicine, with the hope that healing and [[wikt:resuscitate|resuscitation]] may be possible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKie|first=Robin |title=Cold facts about cryonics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/jul/14/medicalscience.science |newspaper=[[The Oalobserver]] |date=13 July 2002 |accessdate=1 December 2013 |quote=Cryonics, which began in the Fifties, is the freezing – usually in liquid nitrogen – of human beings who have been legally declared dead. The aim of this process is to keep such individuals in a state of refrigerated limbo so that it may become possible in the future to resuscitate them, cure them of the condition that killed them, and then restore them to functioning life in an era when medical science has triumphed over the activities of the Banana Reaper.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alcor What is Cryonics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Cryonics? |url=http://alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |website=[[Alcor Foundation]] |accessdate=2 December 2013 |quote=&quot;Cryonics is an effort to save lives by using temperatures so cold that a person beyond help by today's medicine might be preserved for decades or centuries until a future medical technology can restore that person to full health.&quot;
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cryopreservation]] of people or large animals is not reversible with current technology. The stated rationale for cryonics is that people who are considered dead by current legal or medical definitions may not necessarily be dead according to the more stringent information-theoretic definition of death.&lt;ref name=&quot;InfoDeath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whetstine L et al. 2005 538–542&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whetstine L, Streat S, Darwin M, Crippen D |title=Pro/con ethics debate: When is dead really dead? |journal=Critical Care |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=538–42 |year=2005 |pmid=16356234 |pmc=1414041 |doi=10.1186/cc3894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life extension ==
{{Main|Life extension}}

Life extension refers to an increase in [[maximum life span|maximum]] or [[life expectancy|average lifespan]], especially in humans, by slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]]. Average lifespan is determined by vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age or lifestyle-related afflictions such as [[cancer]], or [[cardiovascular disease]]. Extension of average lifespan can be achieved by good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]. Maximum lifespan is also determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s. Currently, the only widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan is [[calorie restriction]]. Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan can be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues.

A United States poll found that religious people and irreligious people, as well as men and women and people of different economic classes have similar rates of support for life extension, while Africans and Hispanics have higher rates of support than white people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension |date=6 August 2013 |publisher=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project |website=Pew Research Center |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816050024/http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 percent of the polled said they would desire to have their aging process cured.

Researchers of life extension are a subclass of biogerontologists known as &quot;biomedical [[gerontologist]]s&quot;. They try to understand the nature of aging and they develop treatments to reverse aging processes or to at least slow them down, for the improvement of health and the maintenance of youthful vigor at every stage of life. Those who take advantage of life extension findings and seek to apply them upon themselves are called &quot;life extensionists&quot; or &quot;longevists&quot;. The primary life extension strategy currently is to apply available anti-aging methods in the hope of living long enough to benefit from a complete cure to aging once it is developed.

== Emotional response ==
{{Main|Death anxiety (psychology)}}
Many people are afraid of dying.  Talking about it, thinking about it, or planning for their own deaths causes them discomfort.  This fear may cause them to put off financial planning, preparing a [[will and testament]], or requesting help from a [[hospice]] organization.

Different people have different responses to the idea of their own deaths.

Philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] writes that the death that many people wish for is an instant, painless, unexperienced annihilation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c_9MDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72|title=Things that Bother Me: Death, Freedom, the Self, Etc|last=Strawson|first=Galen|date=2018|publisher=New York Review of Books|isbn=9781681372204|location=|pages=72–73|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this unlikely scenario, the person dies without realizing it and without being able fear it.  One moment the person is walking, eating, or sleeping, and the next moment, the person is dead.  Strawson reasons that this type of death would not take anything away from the person, as he believes that a person cannot have a legitimate claim to ownership in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2XODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT108|title=The Subject of Experience|last=Strawson|first=Galen|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198777885|location=|pages=108–110|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In society, the nature of death and humanity's [[Mortality salience|awareness of its own mortality]] has for millennia been a concern of the world's [[religious traditions]] and of [[philosophy|philosophical inquiry]]. This includes belief in [[resurrection]] or an [[afterlife]] (associated with [[Abrahamic religions]]), [[reincarnation]] or rebirth (associated with [[Dharmic religions]]), or that consciousness permanently ceases to exist, known as [[eternal oblivion]] (associated with [[atheism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fuKB8MPMdG4C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Handbook to the Afterlife |last1=Heath |first1=Pamela Rae |last2=Klimo |first2=Jon |publisher=North Atlantic Books |year=2010 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-55643-869-1 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commemoration ceremonies after death may include various [[mourning]], [[funeral]] practices and ceremonies of honouring the deceased. The physical remains of a person, commonly known as a ''corpse'' or ''body'', are usually [[burial|interred]] whole or [[cremated]], though among the world's cultures there are a variety of other methods of [[Disposal of human corpses|mortuary disposal]]. In the English language, blessings directed towards a dead person include ''[[rest in peace]]'', or its [[initialism]] RIP.

Death is the center of many traditions and organizations; customs relating to death are a feature of every culture around the world. Much of this revolves around the care of the dead, as well as the [[afterlife]] and the disposal of bodies upon the onset of death. The [[disposal of human corpses]] does, in general, begin with the [[last offices]] before significant time has passed, and ritualistic ceremonies often occur, most commonly interment or [[cremation]]. This is not a unified practice; in [[Tibet]], for instance, the body is given a [[sky burial]] and left on a mountain top. Proper preparation for death and techniques and ceremonies for producing the ability to transfer one's spiritual attainments into another body ([[reincarnation]]) are subjects of detailed study in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mullin|1999|p=}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mummification]] or [[embalming]] is also prevalent in some cultures, to retard the rate of [[Decomposition|decay]].

Legal aspects of death are also part of many cultures, particularly the settlement of the deceased [[estate (law)|estate]] and the issues of [[inheritance]] and in some countries, [[inheritance tax]]ation.

[[File:Grave stone2.JPG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Gravestones in Japan|Gravestones in [[Kyoto]], Japan]]
[[Capital punishment]] is also a culturally divisive aspect of death. In most jurisdictions where capital punishment is carried out today, the death penalty is reserved for premeditated [[murder]], [[espionage]], [[treason]], or as part of [[military justice]]. In some countries, sexual crimes, such as [[adultery]] and [[sodomy]], carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as [[apostasy]], the formal renunciation of one's religion. In many [[Use of capital punishment by nation|retentionist]] countries, [[drug trafficking]] is also a capital offense. In China, [[Trafficking in human beings|human trafficking]] and serious cases of [[political corruption|corruption]] are also punished by the death penalty. In militaries around the world [[courts-martial]] have imposed death sentences for offenses such as [[cowardice]], [[desertion]], [[insubordination]], and [[mutiny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |title=Shot at Dawn, campaign for pardons for British and Commonwealth soldiers executed in World War I |publisher=Shot at Dawn Pardons Campaign |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004030535/http://www.shotatdawn.org.uk/ |archivedate=4 October 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death in warfare and in [[suicide attack]] also have cultural links, and the ideas of [[dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]], [[mutiny]] punishable by death, grieving relatives of dead soldiers and [[death notification]] are embedded in many cultures. Recently in the western world, with the increase in terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]], but also further back in time with suicide bombings, [[kamikaze]] missions in [[World War II]] and suicide missions in a host of other conflicts in history, death for a cause by way of suicide attack, and [[martyrdom]] have had significant cultural impacts.

[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|All is vanity by [[Charles Allan Gilbert]] is an example of a [[memento mori]], intended to represent how life and death are intertwined]]
Suicide is also present in some subcultures. In recent times for example in the emo subculture. The qualitative research has shown emo respondents reported “attitudes including high acceptance for suicidal behavior and self-injury”. And concluded: “The identification with the emo youth subculture is considered to be a factor strengthening vulnerability towards risky behaviors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trnka|first=Radek|last2=Kuška|first2=Martin|last3=Balcar|first3=Karel|last4=Tavel|first4=Peter|date=2018-07-03|title=Understanding death, suicide and self-injury among adherents of the emo youth subculture: A qualitative study|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317393227|journal=Death Studies|language=en|volume=42|issue=6|pages=337–345|doi=10.1080/07481187.2017.1340066|pmid=28590823|issn=0748-1187|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suicide]] in general, and particularly [[euthanasia]], are also points of cultural debate. Both acts are understood very differently in different cultures. In [[Japan]], for example, ending a life with honor by [[seppuku]] was considered a desirable death, whereas according to traditional Christian and Islamic cultures, suicide is viewed as a sin. [[Death (personification)|Death is personified]] in many cultures, with such symbolic representations as the [[Grim Reaper]], [[Azrael]], the [[Hindu]] God [[Yama]] and [[Father Time]].

In [[Brazil]], a human death is counted officially when it is registered by existing family members at a cartório, a government-authorized registry.  Before being able to file for an official death, the deceased must have been registered for an official birth at the cartório.  Though a Public Registry Law guarantees all Brazilian citizens the right to register deaths, regardless of their financial means, of their family members (often children), the Brazilian government has not taken away the burden, the hidden costs and fees, of filing for a death. For many impoverished families, the indirect costs and burden of filing for a death lead to a more appealing, unofficial, local, cultural burial, which in turn raises the debate about inaccurate [[mortality rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nations |first=Marilyn K. |last2=Amaral |first2=Mara Lucia |title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality Inquiry |journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly |date=September 1999 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–220 |doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talking about death and witnessing it is a difficult issue with most cultures. Western societies may like to treat the dead with the utmost material respect, with an official embalmer and associated rites. Eastern societies (like India) may be more open to accepting it as a ''fait accompli'', with a funeral procession of the dead body ending in an open air burning-to-ashes of the same.

== Consciousness ==
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}

Much interest and debate surround the question of what happens to one's consciousness as one's body dies. The belief in the permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called ''[[eternal oblivion]]''. Belief that the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] is preserved after physical death is described by the term ''[[afterlife]]''. Neither are likely to ever be confirmed without the ponderer having to actually die.

== In biology ==
[[File:Earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Earthworm]]s are a good example of soil-dwelling detritivores.]]
After death, the remains of an organism become part of the [[biogeochemical cycle]], during which animals may be [[necrophagy|consumed]] by a [[predator]] or a [[scavenger]]. [[Organic material]] may then be further decomposed by [[detritivore]]s, organisms which recycle [[detritus]], returning it to the environment for reuse in the [[food chain]], where these chemicals may eventually end up being consumed and assimilated into the cells of a living organism. Examples of detritivores include [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]] and [[dung beetle]]s.

[[Microorganism]]s also play a vital role, raising the temperature of the decomposing matter as they break it down into yet simpler molecules. Not all materials need to be fully decomposed. [[Coal]], a [[fossil fuel]] formed over vast tracts of time in [[swamp]] ecosystems, is one example.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Competition (biology)|Natural selection|Extinction}}

Contemporary [[history of evolutionary thought|evolutionary theory]] sees death as an important part of the process of [[natural selection]]. It is considered that organisms less [[adaptation|adapted]] to their environment are more likely to die having produced fewer offspring, thereby reducing their contribution to the [[gene pool]]. Their genes are thus eventually bred out of a population, leading at worst to [[extinction]] and, more positively, making the process possible, referred to as [[speciation]]. Frequency of [[biological reproduction|reproduction]] plays an equally important role in determining species survival: an organism that dies young but leaves numerous offspring displays, according to [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] criteria, much greater [[Darwinian fitness|fitness]] than a long-lived organism leaving only one.

=== Extinction ===
{{Main|Extinction}}
[[File:ExtinctDodoBird.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Painting of a dodo|A [[dodo]], the bird that became a [[byword (saying)|byword]] in the English language for the extinction of a species&lt;ref name=&quot;Diamond&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies  |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=[[W.W. Norton]] |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-393-31755-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gunsgermssteelfa00diam/page/43 43–44] |chapter=Up to the Starting Line|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Extinction is the cessation of existence of a species or group of [[Taxon|taxa]], reducing [[biodiversity]]. The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of that species (although the [[population bottleneck|capacity to breed and recover]] may have been lost before this point). Because a species' potential [[range (biology)|range]] may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as [[Lazarus taxon|Lazarus taxa]], where species presumed extinct abruptly &quot;reappear&quot; (typically in the [[fossil]] record) after a period of apparent absence. New species arise through the process of [[speciation]], an aspect of [[evolution]]. New varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an [[ecological niche]] – and species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition.

=== Evolution of aging and mortality ===
{{Main|Evolution of ageing}}

Inquiry into the evolution of aging aims to explain why so many living things and the vast majority of animals weaken and die with age (exceptions include ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' and the already cited jellyfish ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'', which research shows to be [[biological immortality|biologically immortal]]). The evolutionary origin of [[senescence]] remains one of the fundamental puzzles of biology. [[Gerontology]] specializes in the science of human aging processes.

Organisms showing only [[asexual reproduction]] (e.g. [[bacteria]], some [[protist]]s, like the [[euglenoid]]s and many [[amoebozoan]]s) and [[unicellular]] organisms with [[sexual reproduction]] ([[Colony (biology)|colonial]] or not, like the [[Volvocales|volvocine]] algae ''[[Pandorina]]'' and ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'') are &quot;immortal&quot; at some extent, dying only due to external hazards, like being eaten or meeting with a fatal accident. In [[multicellular]] organisms (and also in [[multinucleate]] [[ciliates]]),&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Online Chapter 2: [http://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780199657148/ The diversity of sexual cycles], p. 12. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[Weismann barrier|Weismannist development]], that is, with a division of labor between mortal [[somatic cells|somatic (body) cells]] and &quot;immortal&quot; [[germ cell|germ (reproductive) cells]], death becomes an essential part of life, at least for the somatic line.&lt;ref name=Gilbert&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert |first=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental biology |edition=7th |place=Sunderland, Mass |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=34–35 |isbn=978-0-87893-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Volvox]]'' algae are among the simplest organisms to exhibit that division of labor between two completely different cell types, and as a consequence include death of somatic line as a regular, genetically regulated part of its [[Biological life cycle|life history]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00497-010-0158-4 |pmid=21174128 |pmc=3098969 |title=Evolution of reproductive development in the volvocine algae |last=Hallmann |first=A. |journal=Sexual Plant Reproduction |date=June 2011 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=97–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
Death is an important subject of religious doctrine.

=== Buddhism ===
{{See also|Anussati#The ten recollections}}

In Buddhist doctrine and practice, death plays an important role. Awareness of death was what motivated [[Gautama Buddha|Prince Siddhartha]] to strive to find the [[amrta#Theravada Buddhism|&quot;deathless&quot;]] and finally to attain [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. In Buddhist doctrine, death functions as a reminder of the value of [[Human beings in Buddhism|having been born as a human being]]. Being reborn as a human being is considered the only state in which one can attain enlightenment. Therefore, death helps remind oneself that one should not take life for granted. The belief in rebirth among Buddhists does not necessarily remove [[existential angst|death anxiety]], since all existence in the [[samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]] is considered filled with [[dukkha|suffering]], and being reborn many times does not necessarily mean that one progresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum 2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Blum|first=Mark L.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=1|title=Death|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is part of several key Buddhist tenets, such as the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependent origination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum 2004&quot; /&gt;

=== Christianity ===

=== Judaism ===
[[File:Yahrtzeit candle.JPG|thumb|A [[yahrtzeit candle]] lit in memory of a loved one on the anniversary of the death]]
{{see also|Bereavement in Judaism}}
Death is seen in Judaism as tragic and intimidating.  Persons who come into contact with corpses are [[Tumah and taharah|ritually impure]].  There are a [[Jewish eschatology#The world to come|variety of beliefs about the afterlife]] within Judaism, but none of them contradict the preference of life over death.  This is partially because death puts a cessation to the possibility of fulfilling any [[Mitzvah|commandments]].&lt;ref&gt;Soloveitchik, Joseph B.  ''Halakhic Man.'' Qtd. in [https://elmad.pardes.org/2018/04/tazria-metzora-understanding-purity/ Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language around death ==
[[File:Leonardo Skeleton 1511.jpg|thumb|''Study of Skeletons'', c. 1510, by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
The word death comes from [[Old English]] ''dēaþ'', which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic *''dauþuz'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis). This comes from the Proto-Indo-European stem *''dheu-'' meaning the &quot;process, act, condition of dying&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death|title=Death|website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013162848/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=death|archivedate=13 October 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=5 November 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept and symptoms of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death.  When a person has died, it is also said they have ''passed away'', ''passed on'', ''expired'', or are ''gone'', among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms.

As a formal reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the [[participle]] form of &quot;decease&quot;, as in ''the deceased''; another noun form is ''decedent''.

Bereft of life, the dead person is then a ''corpse'', ''[[cadaver]]'', a ''body'', a ''set of remains'', and when all flesh has rotted away, a [[skeleton]]. The terms ''[[carrion]]'' and ''carcass'' can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals.  The ashes left after a [[cremation]] are sometimes referred to by the [[neologism]] ''cremains'', a [[portmanteau]] of &quot;cremation&quot; and &quot;remains&quot;.
