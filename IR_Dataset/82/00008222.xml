In public statements, Young claimed the alphabet was intended to replace the traditional [[Latin alphabet]] with an alternative, more phonetically accurate alphabet for the [[English language]]. This would offer immigrants an opportunity to learn to read and write English, he said, the orthography of which is often less phonetically consistent than those of many other languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|65–66}} Similar experiments have not been uncommon, the most well-known of which is the [[Shavian alphabet]].

Young also prescribed the learning of Deseret to the school system, stating &quot;It will be the means of introducing uniformity in our [[orthography]], and the years that are now required to learn to read and spell can be devoted to other studies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Young |first=Brigham |title=Journal of Discourses |location=delivered in the Tabernacle, Salt Lake City, UT |date=8 October 1868 |volume=12 |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the alphabet's heyday between 1854 and 1869, books, newspapers, street signs and correspondence used the new letters, but despite heavy and costly promotion by the early LDS Church, the alphabet never enjoyed prolonged widespread use and has been regarded by historians as a failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Spendlove  |first= Loren Blake |date=2015-01-01 |title=Say Now Shibboleth, or Maybe Cumorah |url= http://www.mormoninterpreter.com/say-now-shibboleth-or-maybe-cumorah/ |journal=Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture |language=en-US |volume=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Creation (1847–1854) ===
The Deseret alphabet was developed primarily by a committee made up of the university's board of regents, members of which included church leaders Brigham Young, [[Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Heber C. Kimball]]. According to [[Brigham Young University]] professor Richard G. Moore, most scholars believe that Watt's contribution to the alphabet was the greatest;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Kenneth R. Beesley goes so far as to credit him with &quot;plant[ing] the idea of [[spelling reform]] in Brigham Young's mind&quot; through a [[Pitman shorthand|phonography]] class he gave after the [[death of Joseph Smith]] which Young attended.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|6}} In addition, [[Jules Remy]] reported that [[W. W. Phelps (Mormon)|William W. Phelps]] helped &quot;work out the letters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jules Remy, ''A Journey to Salt Lake City'' (London, 1861) 185.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:English Phonotypic Alphabet 1847.png| left| thumb|The Deseret alphabet was based on [[Isaac Pitman]]'s ''[[English Phonotypic Alphabet]]'', and in fact, Pitman's alphabet was nearly chosen by the Board of Regents as their preferred spelling reform.]] Before they decided on the Deseret alphabet, the attention of the board of regents was mostly focused on [[English Phonotypic Alphabet|Pitman style alphabets]], and in April 1847 Brigham Young nearly purchased {{Convert|200|lb|kg}} of [[Sort (typesetting)|lead type]] to print books using Pitman's orthography.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|7}} The University of Deseret was incorporated on 28 February 1850; less than three weeks later, on 20 March, the new board of regents began to discuss  spelling reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

On 29 November 1853 the committee almost voted on using a slightly modified version of the Pitman orthography, when [[Willard Richards]], who had been deathly ill and missed the debate before the vote, saw the proposed alphabet. Richards was quick to condemn it, saying to the committee &quot;Those characters...seem like putting old wine into new bottles...I am inclined to think...we shall...throw away all characters that bear much resemblance to the English characters, and introduce an alphabet that is original.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|10}}

These words persuaded Brigham Young and the rest of the committee, and George D. Watt then endeavored to create an original alphabet. Less than two months later, on 19 January 1854, the board of regents finally approved the first 38-letter Deseret alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|11}}[[Image:1860 Utah $10 gold piece.jpeg|thumb|An 1860 $5 gold piece, with inscription &quot;Holiness to the Lord&quot; (&quot;𐐐𐐄𐐢𐐆𐐤𐐝 𐐓𐐅 𐐜 𐐢𐐃𐐡𐐔&quot;) in the Deseret alphabet]]

=== Use by the Mormon pioneers (1854–1869) ===
Upon the alphabet's acceptance, its first user was its principal architect, George D. Watt, who began writing the meeting minutes of the early [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishops]] in a cursive form of it in 1854.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|12}} Almost immediately after its publication, church members began experimenting with it, and by 1855 travel writers Jules Remy and [[Julius Brenchley]] published a chart of the new alphabet which differed heavily from the 1854 version. Some early Mormons, such as [[Thales Hastings Haskell]], began writing their personal journals in the new alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|16}} Remy further reported that during his time in [[Salt Lake City]], he saw signs on the street and above shops using the new alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

After its approval by the board of regents, Brigham Young testified before the [[Utah Legislature|Utah territorial legislature]] that the new alphabet should &quot;be thoroughly and extensively taught in all the schools.&quot; Some teaching in Utah schools did take place: John B. Milner taught the alphabet in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]], [[American Fork, Utah|American Fork]], and [[Pleasant Grove, Utah|Pleasant Grove]], while evening classes were taught in Salt Lake City and [[Farmington, Utah|Farmington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/145765007/?terms=Deseret%2Balphabet |title=The Deseret Alphabet |last= |first= |date=11 June 1855 |work=Evening Star |location=Washington D.C. |url-access=subscription  |access-date=2017-01-16 |via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several months' practice writing with the new alphabet, Watt wrote to Brigham Young that he was unhappy with it, and proposed a complete overhaul, which was never followed up on.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Beesley |first=Kenneth R. |date=14 August 2002 |title=The Deseret Alphabet in Unicode |url= http://copper.chem.ucla.edu/~jericks/Historical%20or%20Technical/History%20Looking%20Backwards/Ken%20Beesley/Deseret%20in%20Unicode.pdf |journal=22nd International Unicode Conference }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|22}}

Word of the new alphabet soon spread outside Utah, and most press reports in non-Mormon papers were critical.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/LT18580123.2.13 |title=Mormon Secretiveness |date=1858-01-23 |work=Lyttelton Times |access-date=2017-01-16 |via=National Library of New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/20321179/?terms=Deseret%2Balphabet |title=Affairs in Utah |date=4 March 1872 |work=The New York Times |page=1 |url-access=subscription  |access-date=2017-01-16 |via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt; Other writers, however, acquainted with other phonotypic and stenographic alphabets, ranged from neutral descriptions of the new alphabet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.newspapers.com/image/217513123/?terms=Deseret%2Balphabet |title=Mormon Items{{emdash}}From Salt Lake |date=10 May 1856 |work=The Chicago Tribune |url-access=subscription  |access-date=16 January 2017 |via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to praise.&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot; /&gt;

Until this point, all the printed material (mostly just charts of the alphabet and its standard orthography equivalents) had been produced with large wooden type, which was not suitable for printing at small sizes. Because the alphabet was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 the board of regents appointed [[Erastus Snow]] to procure metal type from [[St. Louis]]-based [[font foundry]] Ladew &amp; Peer. However, in May 1857 the [[Utah War]] began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew &amp; Peer kept working on the type, and the [[Punchcutting|punches]] and [[Matrix (printing)|matrices]] were delivered in the winter of 1858. The first use of the new type was to make a business card for [[George A. Smith]], an early [[Mormon historian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|15}}
[[File:Sermon on the Mount 16 Feb 1859 Deseret News.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] as it appears in the 16 February 1859 edition of the ''[[Deseret News]]''.]]
In 1859, with the new type in hand, the ''Deseret News'' began printing with it. It would print one piece per issue in the new alphabet, usually a quotation from ''[[The Book of Mormon]]'' or the [[New Testament]]. However, this only lasted for one year, after which the practice stopped; it would start again in May 1864 and stop permanently at the end of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|20}}{{Multiple image

}}[[Benn Pitman]], the brother of Isaac Pitman, was also interested in spelling reform, and by 1864 had published his own orthography, which the board of regents considered adopting. However, they ultimately decided not to and used the opportunity to re-affirm their commitment to the Deseret alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|20}}

Brigham Young blamed the failure of this first attempt at reform on the ugliness of the type developed by Ladew &amp; Peer, and so he commissioned Russell's American Steam Printing House, a [[New York City]] based [[font foundry]], to design more pleasing type. The result was the [[Bodoni]]-esque font (at right) that was used to print all of the books in this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|20}} In an 1868 article, the ''Deseret News'' wrote that &quot;the characters, to a person unaccustomed to them, may look strange, [but] to the eye to which they are familiar they are beautiful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|69}}

At least four books were published in the new alphabet, all transcribed by [[Orson Pratt]] and all using the Russell's House font: ''The First Deseret Alphabet Reader'' (1868), ''The Second Deseret Alphabet Reader'' (1868), ''The Book of Mormon'' (1869), and a ''Book of Mormon'' excerpt called ''[[First Book of Nephi|First Nephi]]–[[Book of Omni|Omni]]'' (1869).&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|69–70}}

Considerable non-printed material in the Deseret alphabet was made, including a replica headstone in [[Cedar City, Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Iron County |work= I Love History: Place: Counties |publisher=Utah Division of State History|url= http://ilovehistory.utah.gov/place/counties/iron.html#explorers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/43891466 Headstone of John Thomas Morris, 1828–1855.]&lt;/ref&gt; some coinage, letters, diaries, and meeting minutes. One of the more curious items found in the Deseret alphabet is an English-[[Hopi language|Hopi]] dictionary prepared by two Mormon missionaries. It sat unappreciated in handwritten form at the [[Church History Library|LDS Church Archives]] until 2014, when Kenneth R. Beesley, a [[writing system]] researcher and computer scientist, noticed its significance and transcribed it into standard written English.&lt;ref&gt;Beesley, Kenneth R. and Dirk Elzinga. 2014.

Despite years of heavy promotion, the Deseret alphabet was never widely adopted. This reluctance was partly due to prohibitive costs; the project had already cost the early church $20,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.chem.ucla.edu/~jericks/Historical%20or%20Technical/History%20Looking%20Backwards/Magazine%20articles/The%20Religious%20Educator/Deseret%20Alphabet%20Experiment2.pdf|title=The Deseret Alphabet Experiment|last=Moore|first=Richard G.|year=2006|website=Religious Studies Center|publisher=Brigham Young University|access-date=2017-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|76}} with $6,000 going to Pratt as remuneration for his transcription effort&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://web.chem.ucla.edu/~jericks/Historical%20or%20Technical/History%20Looking%20Backwards/Magazine%20articles/True%20Frontier/Utah's%20Strange%20Alphabet%20by%20A.%20J.%20Simmonds1968.pdf|title=Utah's Strange Alphabet|last=Simmonds|first=A.

According to Beesley, many have written that interest in the Deseret alphabet died with Brigham Young. This, however, is not true; the alphabet was already regarded as a failure during Young's time.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|29}} Only 500 copies of the full ''Book of Mormon'' translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive and even the most devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|27}} In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the ''Deseret News''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

Contemporary writers noted that thousands of copies of the US$0.15 and US$0.20 Deseret primers went unsold,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|6}} and historian Roby Wentz speculated that the LDS Church at that time had a &quot;cache&quot; of the primers in mint condition, which it was slowly selling off; according to him, one such primer sold for $250 in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;

The Mormons had planned to use the profits from sale of the earlier books to fund printing of more books, and in anticipation Orson Pratt had already transcribed the complete [[Bible]], ''[[Doctrine and Covenants]]'', and [[John Jaques (Mormon)|John Jaques]]'s ''Catechism for Children''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/improvementera7007unse|title=The Improvement Era|last=Zobell, Jr.|first=Albert L.|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|year=1967|isbn=|volume=70|issue=7|location=Salt Lake City|pages=10–11|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt had also prepared an apparent sequel to the primers, the ''Deseret Phonetic Speller''. After the sales failure, however, none of these books were ever published and were thought lost until being rediscovered in a storage area of the LDS Church Archives in Salt Lake City in May 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

Ralph Vigoda, a reporter for ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', has speculated that the completion of the [[Transcontinental railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] may have contributed to the alphabet's downfall: non-Mormons, not loyal to Brigham Young, became a large part of the city, and without the religious motivation it would be difficult indeed to get them to learn a new alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/176073436/?terms=deseret%2Balphabet|title=A churchman's failed mission: Language logic|last=Vigoda|first=Ralph|date=3 June 1990|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|page=2C|access-date=14 January 2017|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retrospective piece, historian A. J. Simmonds claims that the new railroad doomed the alphabet. According to him, easy access to &quot;the whole literature of the English speaking world&quot; rendered the alphabet useless.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

In July 1877, Young tried one more time at a spelling reform, ordering lead type designed for the orthography of [[Benn Pitman]] (Isaac's brother) with the intention of printing an edition of the ''Book of Mormon'' and ''Doctrine and Covenants'' using it. Most of the type had arrived by August, but with Young's death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used. Young's death thus marked the end of the Mormon experimentation with English spelling reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|29}}

A degree of free spelling is allowed to accommodate dialectal differences in English. For example, in the Deseret edition of ''The Book of Mormon'', the word &quot;wherefore&quot; is written as &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐸𐐶𐐯𐑉𐑁𐐬𐑉&lt;/span&gt; ({{IPA|/hwɛrfoʊr/}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofmormdeseretalpha00|title=Book of Mormon in the Deseret Alphabet|last=Smith|first=Joseph|publisher=Corporation of the Presiding Bishop, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|year=1869|isbn=|edition=1990|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that the translator of the book did not exhibit the [[wine–whine merger]]. Those who do exhibit the merger might instead prefer the spelling &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐶𐐯𐑉𐑁𐐬𐑉&lt;/span&gt; to match the pronunciation ({{IPA|/wɛrfoʊr/}}), or, depending on [[List of dialects of the English language#United States|dialect]], perhaps &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐶𐐯𐑉𐑁𐐫𐑉&lt;/span&gt; ({{IPA|/wɛrfɔːr/}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|38}}

The alphabet was designed to be able to write all of the vowels used in the dialect spoken in 19th century Utah. The vowel inventory has also been attributed to the fact that unlike other [[American pioneers]], the Mormon pioneers were from [[New England]] as opposed to the [[Southern United States|American South]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; As such, many of the vowels in the Deseret alphabet have since [[Phonological change|merged]] in the modern era: they are no longer distinguished in many dialects of English.

Speakers who exhibit the [[father–bother merger]] no longer distinguish {{IPA|/ɑː/}} (&lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐪&lt;/span&gt;) and {{IPA|/ɒ/}} (&lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐱&lt;/span&gt;), and so both father and bother would be written with &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐪&lt;/span&gt;: as &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐑁𐐪𐑄𐐲𐑉&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐺𐐪𐑄𐐲𐑉&lt;/span&gt; as opposed to &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐑁𐐪𐑄𐐲𐑉&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐺𐐱𐑄𐐲𐑉&lt;/span&gt;. For those with the [[cot–caught merger]], {{IPA|/ɔː/}} (&lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐫&lt;/span&gt;) and {{IPA|/ɒ/}} (&lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐱&lt;/span&gt;) are no longer distinguished: both cot and caught are thus written by them as &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐿𐐱𐐻&lt;/span&gt; ({{IPA|/kɒt/}}) in the case of [[North American English]] and as 𐐿𐐫𐐻 ({{IPA|/kɔːt/}}) in the case of [[Scottish English]]. For those exhibiting both mergers, both would be written &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐿𐐪𐐻&lt;/span&gt; ({{IPA|/kɑːt/}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://copper.chem.ucla.edu/~jericks/Historical%20or%20Technical/Linguistics/Deseret_Guide.pdf |title=A Complete Guide to Reading and Writing the Deseret Alphabet |website=Joshua Erickson's Deseret Alphabet Pages |last=Walker |first=Neil Alexander |publisher=Lulu.com |year=2005 |isbn=978-1411648654 |location= |pages=26 |quote= |orig-year=|via=}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}{{Rp|28}}

In the 23 February 1859 edition of the ''Deseret News'', the editors announced their approval of the two new letters and eventual intention to use them in the newsletter. However, due to the [[hot metal typesetting]] technology in use at the time, casting the new letters for use would have been a considerable expense, so it was never realized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beesley&quot; /&gt;

The Deseret alphabet does not have a distinct symbol for the [[mid central vowel]] ({{IPA|/ə/}}, &quot;schwa&quot;). The lack of a schwa has been cited as the biggest &quot;[[phonological]] flaw&quot; in the alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|3}}

Because of the lack of a schwa, the author must write the sound that would be used if the word was stressed. For example, the word ''enough'' is commonly pronounced {{IPA|[əˈnɐf]}}, but when it is stressed (as in a declaration of irritation) it is pronounced {{IPA|[iˈnɐf]}}. The Deseret spelling of the word, &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐨𐑌𐐲𐑁&lt;/span&gt;, reflects that stressed pronunciation. If {{IPA|/ə/}} does not have an inherent stressed value in a word, as is often the case before {{IPA|/r/}}, then it is written as &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐲&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|32–33}}

[[Marion J. Shelton]], an early [[Mormon missionary]], proposed the addition of a new glyph to represent the schwa, a simple vertical line of the same height as other Deseret characters with a similar appearance to the [[Turkish dotless i]] (ı). The addition of this glyph did not catch on among his contemporaries, however, and no document outside of ones penned by Shelton makes use of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|19–20}} Shelton used the new glyph in an 1860 letter to Brigham Young reporting on a recently completed mission to the [[Southern Paiute|Paiute people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite letter|last=Shelton|first=Marion J.|url=https://dcms.lds.org/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE3956499|date=3 April 1860|title=Beloved brother, it is with heartfelt gratitude to my Heavenly Father...|recipient=Brigham Young}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syllabic values===
Each letter in the Deseret alphabet has a name, and when a letter is written on its own it has the value of that name. This allows some short words to be written with a single letter, and is called a letter's &quot;syllabic value&quot;. The most common word in English, ''the'', is written simply &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐑄&lt;/span&gt;, as the letter's name is {{IPA|/ðiː/}} and that is the stressed pronunciation of the word. The consonants with syllabic values are &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐶&lt;/span&gt; (woo), &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐷&lt;/span&gt; (yee), &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐸&lt;/span&gt; (ha),  &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐹&lt;/span&gt; (pee), &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐺&lt;/span&gt; (be/bee), &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐻&lt;/span&gt; (tee/tea), &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐽&lt;/span&gt; (qi), &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐾&lt;/span&gt; (gee), &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐑀&lt;/span&gt; (gay), and &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐑄&lt;/span&gt; (the/thee).&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|25}}

Syllabic values do not apply within words, although this was formerly the case. In early documents, Watt writes &quot;people&quot; as &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐹𐐹𐑊&lt;/span&gt; with the expectation that readers will interpret the first &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐹&lt;/span&gt; as {{IPA|/pi/}}, but the second &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐹&lt;/span&gt; as {{IPA|/p/}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|13}} This contextual value switching was soon done away with, so in later documents, while &quot;bee&quot; is written &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐺&lt;/span&gt;, &quot;bees&quot; is written &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐺𐐨𐑆&lt;/span&gt;.

In 40-letter versions of the alphabet which include the letter 𐐧 (ew) which represents {{IPA|/juː/}}, the letter &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐧&lt;/span&gt; when standing alone can be used to represent the word &quot;you&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|25,51}}

== Handwriting ==
There were two main handwritten forms of the Deseret alphabet: a [[cursive]] version and a [[Block letters|printed]] version. Over the lifetime of the alphabet, the cursive form fell out of favor among most users of the alphabet and by 1856 no more cursive documents exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|21}} Its impact on the [[glyph]]s can however still be plainly seen in the loops of certain characters such as &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐑅&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐑀&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span lang=&quot;en-Dsrt&gt;𐐼&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|13}} The earliest surviving versions of the Deseret alphabet, from 1853 (one year before its January 1854 approval), have printed and cursive forms side-by-side, suggesting that a cursive form was part of the plan from the very beginning.&lt;ref&gt;University of Deseret papers: New alphabet file, circa 1853.

The cursive form of the Deseret alphabet was mainly used by two people: George D. Watt, and James Henry Martineau.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|21}} Watt, a [[stenographer]], recorded several bishops meetings and wrote other personal documents in this cursive style.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|13}} A chart of the cursive form appears below. The blue glyphs represent how to write each character, while the top row of printed glyphs shows the corresponding Unicode reference glyph.

[[File:Early Deseret cursive lineup based on a document written by its creator George D Watt.svg|border|frameless|class=descharts|600x600px]]

The cursive style has many unorthodox characteristics uncommon to [[Alphabet|Western writing systems]]. [[Vowels]] can be dropped if the writer is in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an [[abjad]], letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and 𐐮 is placed on letters after they are already written as in an [[abugida]]. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in [[Pitman shorthand]], which is written in a similar way.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|13}}

The table below shows some examples of how the cursive form is written. Dropped vowels are marked in parenthesis.

=== Block letters ===
George D. Watt found his own alphabet cumbersome to write and abandoned it. As he wrote to Brigham Young on 21 August 1854:&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watt|first=Ronald G.|date=1977-01-01|title=Sailing &quot;The Old Ship Zion&quot;: The Life of George D.

[...] I am now thoroughly convinced that it is not the most expeditious method of writing and printing, but on the contrary it retards the hand in its onward course.|sign=|source=}}
His new alphabet closely resembled an 1853 publication of Isaac Pitman, containing only 33 letters. However, at this point, Young was still enamored with the original Deseret alphabet, and so he rejected the proposal and Watt continued to publicly promote the alphabet as part of his job despite his reservations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

The Deseret alphabet was purposely designed so as to not have [[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[Descender (typography)|descenders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|14}} This was envisioned as a practical benefit for the alphabet in an era of metal type: after many uses, the edges of [[Sort (typesetting)|type sorts]] become dull, and narrow ascenders and descenders are most prone to this effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

While well intentioned, this lack has been described as a &quot;catastrophic&quot; mistake&lt;ref&gt;Nash, William V. (1957) ''The Deseret Alphabet''. Master's thesis, University of Illinois Library School: Urbana, Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; that makes type look &quot;monotonous&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; and makes all words look alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; Some have drawn comparisons between the alphabet and the [[Old Turkic script]], saying that writing in the new alphabet could be mistaken from afar as a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Ledger|tax list]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

The Mormon pioneers were apparently aware of the problems caused by its monotony:&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|76}}
{{Quote|text=President Young has decided that [the letters] are not so well adapted for the purpose designed as it was hoped they would be. There being no shanks (ascenders or descenders) to the letters, all being very even, they are trying to the eye, because of their uniformity.|sign=|source=article in the ''Juvenile Instructor'', 2 October 1875|style=overflow:inherit;}}
Other criticism of the design was harsher still. In an 18 December 1857 editorial in the ''Boston Globe'', the alphabet was described as being &quot;so arranged and named as to cause the greatest possible annoyance to outsiders&quot; and the design of the letters as &quot;incomprehensible as [...] the [[hieroglyphics]] of the [...] [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=In Another Time: Sketches of Utah History |last=Schindler |first=Harold |publisher=Utah State University Press |year=1998 |isbn=9780874212426 |location=Logan, Utah |pages=125–127 |quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 1872, ''The New York Times'' called the alphabet &quot;rude, awkward and cumbersome.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot; /&gt;

Some modern computer fonts and printed books have attempted to correct this perceived fault: in the books in John Jenkins' ''Deseret Alphabet Classics'' series, the font used adds a descender to 𐑉 and 𐐻 and an ascender to 𐐼 and 𐑇 among other tweaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=𐐜 𐐓𐐴𐑋 𐐣𐐲𐑇𐐨𐑌|last=Wells|first=H.

== Other motives ==
Officially, the Deseret alphabet was created to simplify the spelling of English words for the benefit of children and [[English as a second language]] learners. Some of the alphabet's contemporaries, however, posited an alternative motivation for its development: increasing the [[Isolationism|isolation]] of the early Mormons.

=== To keep outsiders from reading Mormon secrets ===
The charge that the Deseret alphabet's main purpose was to keep outsiders (&quot;[[Gentile#LDS Church usage|gentiles]]&quot; in LDS terminology) in the dark was brought almost immediately, as evidenced by the following 1858 ''[[Lyttelton Times]]'' reprint of an unnamed &quot;New York newspaper&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt;{{Quote|text={{small-caps|Mormon Secretiveness}}.—The new &quot;Deseret Alphabet&quot; is completed, and a fount of [[Pica (typography)|pica]] type has been cast in St. Louis. [[Type specimen|Specimens]] of the type are published in the St. Louis papers, but they are unproducible in types that common people use [...] The [[wikt:en:ukase|ukase]]s of Brother Brigham will hereafter be a sealed letter, literally, to Gentile eyes.|sign=|source=}}
Having obtained a copy of the ''Deseret News'' in 1859, the ''Richmond Dispatch'' disparaged it on April 25, writing &quot;The ''Deseret News'' is filled with a lot of hieroglyphs. It seems to be [an alphabet] which the Mormons alone are to be taught.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/79767205/?terms=Deseret+alphabet|title=Later from Utah|last=|first=|date=25 April 1859|work=|newspaper=Richmond Dispatch|page=1|language=en|url-access=subscription |access-date=2017-01-24|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians, however, doubt the veracity of this theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; For one thing, notes Kenneth R. Beesley, the ''Deseret News'' and every book published in the alphabet prominently feature the key to the alphabet,&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|36}} and anyone without a key could have gotten a copy of ''A Journey to Great-Salt-Lake City'', or traveled to Salt Lake City themselves and bought one.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Contemporary scholars [[Richard F. Burton]] and [[Jules Remy]] also dismissed the secrecy argument, in 1860 and 1855 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

=== To keep Mormons from reading outside literature ===
With the impending completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, the Mormon pioneers would have easy, cheap access to publications from the east, including [[yellow-back]]s, [[penny dreadful]]s, [[pulp magazine]]s, and other often scandalous or dirty publications that were rising to prominence in the 19th century. Indeed, in an article about the benefits of the alphabet, the ''Deseret News'' proudly wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=2601635#t_2601635|title=The Deseret Alphabet{{emdash}}Its Advantages|last=|first=|date=18 August 1868|work=Deseret News|page=2|access-date=2017-01-16|via=University of Utah: Utah Digital Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text=If our community were situated as others are, it might be [[Don Quixote|Quixotic]] to attempt the introduction of this reform among us with the hope of carrying it into practical operation.

[...] '''If they could find no better reading than much of the miserable trash that now obtains extensive circulation, it would be better if they never learned to read the present orthography.'''

In another article, the ''News'' cited an example of the kind of literature Mormons would benefit from not being able to read: ''[[The Police Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|35}} Historians A. J. Simmonds and Roby Wentz contend that while this may have been a tertiary goal of the alphabet, a sort of &quot;happy accident&quot;, the main purpose of it was simple orthographic reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt; Simmonds notes that the teaching of English to foreigners was not a mere hypothetical to mask isolationist tendencies: 35% of the [[Utah Territory]]'s population at the time was [[Scandinavia]]n, with [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speaking people also making up a considerable percentage of inhabitants; therefore, communication between the recently [[Baptism in Mormonism|baptized]] and the community was a real problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;

The Deseret alphabet (U+10400–U+1044F) was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in March 2001 with the release of version 3.1, after a request by John H. Jenkins of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], making it one of the first scripts to be added outside of the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|6}} The letters 𐐧 (ew) and 𐐦 (oi) were added to the Unicode Standard in April 2003 with the release of version 4.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/4.0-Update/UnicodeData-4.0.0.txt|title=The Unicode Standard, version 4.0: UnicodeData-4.0.0.txt|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Unicode Consortium|access-date=2017-01-25|quote=This is the first version of the standard with these characters: ''10426;DESERET CAPITAL LETTER OI;Lu;0;L;;;;;N;;;;1044E; 10427;DESERET CAPITAL LETTER EW;Lu;0;L;;;;;N;;;;1044F; 1044E;DESERET SMALL LETTER OI;Ll;0;L;;;;;N;;;10426;;10426 1044F;DESERET SMALL LETTER EW;Ll;0;L;;;;;N;;;10427;;10427''. Compare to https://www.unicode.org/Public/3.2-Update/UnicodeData-3.2.0.txt , where the last character in the block is DESERET SMALL LETTER ENG instead.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kenneth R. Beesley, who submitted the proposal to expand the encoding,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beesley&quot; /&gt; &quot;Unicode fonts based on the current heterogeneous collection of [[glyphs]] will be useless for any practical [[typesetting]] of 40-letter Deseret Alphabet documents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beesley|first=Kenneth R.|year=2004|title=Typesetting the Deseret Alphabet with LATEX and METAFONT|url=http://copper.chem.ucla.edu/~jericks/Historical%20or%20Technical/History%20Looking%20Backwards/Ken%20Beesley/Typesetting%20the%20Deseret%20Alphabet%20with%20LATEX%20and%20METAFONT.pdf|journal=Presented at the 25th Annual Meeting and Conference of TeX Users Group|volume=|pages=|via=CiteSeerX}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|29}} This is because the Unicode Consortium chose to use glyphs from 1855 as the reference glyphs, while by 1859 those glyphs were already outmoded and replaced with newer glyphs. Beesley thus recommends using [[LaTeX]] along with his [[Metafont]] {{Monospace|desalph}} font to typeset Deseret text,&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; but [[fonts]] which use the alternate glyphs for the two codepoints in question would also work for transcription of 40-letter Deseret texts written during and after 1859.

On 25 February 2016, the [[Library of Congress]] approved an [[ALA-LC romanization]] for the Deseret alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/deseret.pdf ALA-LC Deseret Romanization table]&lt;/ref&gt; The table can be used to display approximations of titles in non-Latin scripts using the [[Latin alphabet]] for use in library catalogs that do not support non-Latin alphabets.
