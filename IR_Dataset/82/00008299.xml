'''Domenico Alberti''' (c. 1710&amp;nbsp;â€“ 14 October 1740 or 1746) was an Italian singer, [[harpsichord]]ist, and composer.

Alberti was born in [[Venice]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Randel|first=Don Michael, ed.|title=The Harvard biographical dictionary of music|year=1996|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-674-37299-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/harvardbiographi00rand/page/11 11]|chapter=Alberti, Domenico|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/harvardbiographi00rand/page/11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied music with [[Antonio Lotti]]. He wrote operas, songs, and [[sonata (music)|sonatas]] for keyboard instruments, for which he is best known today. These sonatas frequently employ [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[accompaniment]] in the left hand in one of several patterns that are now collectively known as ''[[Alberti bass]]''. Alberti was one of the earliest composers to use these patterns, but was not the first or only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Classical Music|last=Downs|first=Philip G.|publisher=Norton|year=1992|isbn=0-393-95191-X|location=New York|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known of these patterns consists of regular broken [[chord (music)|chord]]s, with the lowest note sounding first, then the highest, then the middle and then the highest again. This pattern is repeated. Today, Alberti is regarded as a minor composer, and his works are played or recorded only irregularly. The Alberti bass was used by many later composers, and it became an important element in much keyboard music of the [[Classical music era]].

An example of Alberti bass ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Piano Sonata, K. 545 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata, K 545]]''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Musical performance: a guide to understanding|last=Rink|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his own lifetime, Alberti was known as a singer. He often used to accompany himself on the harpsichord. In 1736, he served as a page for Pietro Andrea Cappello, the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Ambassador (diplomacy)|ambassador]] to Spain. While at the Spanish court, the famous [[castrato]] singer [[Farinelli]] heard him sing. Farinelli was said to have been impressed, although Alberti was an amateur.

Alberti's best known pieces are his keyboard sonatas, although even they are very rarely performed. It is thought he wrote around 36 sonatas, of which 14 have survived. They all have two movements, each in [[binary form]].

It is probable that [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s first [[violin sonata]]s, written at the age of seven, were modeled on Alberti's work.

Alberti died in 1740 or 1746 in Rome.
