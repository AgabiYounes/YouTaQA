== History ==
Dayton was founded on April 1, 1796, by 12 settlers known as the Thompson Party. They traveled in March from [[Cincinnati]] up the [[Great Miami River]] by [[pirogue]] and landed at what is now St. Clair Street, where they found two small camps of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Among the Thompson Party was Benjamin Van Cleve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Dayton |author=Robert W. Steele and Mary Davies Steele |year=1896 |publisher=W.J. Shuey |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose memoirs provide insights into the Ohio Valley's history. Two other groups traveling overland arrived several days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Outline of the History of Dayton, Ohio 1796–1896|editor=Board of Education|publisher=W.J. Shuey|year=1896|url=https://archive.org/stream/outlineofhistory00dayt/outlineofhistory00dayt_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1797, [[Daniel C. Cooper]] laid out [[Mad River Road]], the first overland connection between Cincinnati and Dayton, opening the &quot;Mad River Country&quot; to settlement. Ohio was admitted into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in 1803, the village of Dayton was incorporated in 1805, and chartered as a city in 1841. The city was named after [[Jonathan Dayton]], a captain in the [[American Revolutionary War]] who signed the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and owned a significant amount of land in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief History of Dayton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofdayton.org/cco/Pages/BriefHistory.aspx |title=Brief History of Dayton |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |publisher=City of Dayton |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112155224/http://www.cityofdayton.org/cco/Pages/BriefHistory.aspx |archivedate=November 12, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, construction on the Dayton-Cincinnati canal began, which would provide a better way to transport goods from Dayton to Cincinnati and contribute significantly to Dayton's economic growth during the 1800s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief History of Dayton&quot; /&gt;

=== Innovation ===
[[File:Dayton 1870.JPG|thumb|Dayton in 1870]]
Innovation led to business growth in the region. In 1884, [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)|John Henry Patterson]] acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his [[cash register]] patents and formed the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Company]] (NCR). The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and played a crucial role in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, helped develop the first electric cash register, which propelled NCR into the national spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/NCR-Corporation-Company-History.html|title=NCR history information|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NCR also helped develop the [[US Navy Bombe]], a code-breaking machine that helped crack the [[Enigma machine]] cipher during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytonhistory.org/archives/codebreaker.htm |title=NCR WWII Codebreaking machines |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |publisher=The Archive Centre |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928023508/http://www.daytonhistory.org/archives/codebreaker.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birthplace of Aviation ===
Powered aviation began in Dayton.  Orville and Wilbur Wright were the first to construct and demonstrate powered flight.  Although the first flight was in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]], their Wright Flyer was built in Dayton, and was returned to Dayton for improvements and further flights at [[Huffman Field]], a cow pasture eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of Dayton, near the current Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

When the government tried to move development to Langley field in southern Virginia, six Dayton businessmen including Edward A. Deeds, formed the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company in Moraine and established a flying field.  Deeds also opened a field to the north in the flood plain of the Great Miami River between the confluences of that river, the Stillwater River, and the Mad River, near downtown Dayton.  Later named [[McCook Field]] for Alexander McDowell McCook, an American Civil War general, this became the Army Signal Corps' primary aviation research and training location. Wilbur Wright also purchased land near Huffman prairie to continue their research.

During World War I, the Army purchased 40 acres adjacent to Huffman Prairie for the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot.  As airplanes developed more capability, they needed more runway space than McCook could offer, and a new location was sought. The Patterson family formed the Dayton Air Service Committee, Inc which held a campaign that raised $425,000 in two days and purchased 4,520.47 acres (18.2937 km2) northeast of Dayton, including Wilbur Wright Field and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field.  Wright Field was &quot;formally dedicated&quot; on 12 October 1927.  After World War II, Wright Field and the adjacent Patterson Field, Dayton Army Air Field, and Clinton Army Air Field were merged as the Headquarters, Air Force Technical Base. On 13 January 1948, the facility was renamed [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].

=== The Dayton Flood ===
A catastrophic flood in March 1913, known as the [[Great Dayton Flood]], led to the creation of the [[Miami Conservancy District]], a series of dams and hydraulic pumps installed around Dayton, in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|title=Flood Protection|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Miami Conservancy District|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817150122/http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|archivedate=August 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II. Several locations around the city hosted the [[Dayton Project]], a branch of the larger [[Manhattan Project]], to develop [[polonium]] triggers used in early atomic bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php?id=83&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view|title=The Dayton Project|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Atomic Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war efforts led to a manufacturing boom throughout the city, including high demand for housing and other services. At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daytonology.blogspot.com/2008/11/world-war-ii-housing-daytonfairborn.html|title=WWII Emergency Housing|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Daytonology Blogspot|date=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-War Dayton ===
Between the 1940s and the 1970s, the city saw significant growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service in large numbers seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, a part of the local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the [[Interstate Highway System]] allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbadayton.com/site/publisher/files/ohio_modern.pdf|title=Dayton Modern History|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Ohio Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's population has declined, mainly due to the loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national [[United States housing bubble|housing crisis]] that began in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayton's decline – Hampton Inst&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/bigeight.html#.Uuq1A_ldXA0|title=Ohio's Cloudy Future: The Decline of the &quot;Big Eight&quot; and the Buckeye State|last=Posey|first=Sean|date=August 22, 2013|publisher=The Hampton Institute|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayton's decline – Hampton Inst&quot; /&gt; Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayton decline – NBCNews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43551895/ns/business-local_business/#.Uuq9JPldXA0|title=10 cities that will take a decade to recover from the recession|last=Stockdale|first=Charles B.|date=July 4, 2011|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current initiatives ===
Downtown expansion that began in the 2000s has helped revitalize the city and encourage growth. [[Day Air Ballpark]], home of the [[Dayton Dragons]], was built in 2000. The highly successful minor league baseball team has been an integral part of Dayton's culture.&lt;ref name=DragonsSellout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110710&amp;content_id=21677950&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Dayton Dragons all time professional sellout streak MLB|publisher=MLB Advanced Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the city's public park system, [[Five Rivers MetroParks]], built RiverScape MetroPark, an outdoor entertainment venue that attracts more than 400,000 visitors each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/riverscape-pavilion-contributes-to-the-quality-of-life-in-dayton-673708.html|title=Riverscape MetroPark project|accessdate=August 25, 2011|newspaper=Dayton Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new performance arts theater, the [[Schuster Center]], opened in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schustercenter.org/about/historical.html |title=About the Schuster Center |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |publisher=Schuster Center |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208175515/http://schustercenter.org/about/historical.html |archivedate=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large health network in the region, [[Premier Health Partners]], expanded its [[Miami Valley Hospital]] with a 12-story tower addition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamivalleyhospital.org/mvhdefault.aspx?id=55383 |title=MVH new patient tower expansion |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |publisher=Miami Valley Hospital |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812040359/http://www.miamivalleyhospital.org/mvhdefault.aspx?id=55383 |archivedate=August 12, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Downtown Dayton Partnership, in cooperation with the City of Dayton and community leaders, introduced the Greater Downtown Dayton Plan. It focuses on job creation and retention, infrastructure improvements, housing, recreation, and collaboration. The plan is to be implemented through the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtowndayton.org/plan/pdfs/priorityrecs_overview.pdf|title=The Greater Downtown Dayton Plan|website=Downtowndayton.org|accessdate=2016-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328045150/http://www.downtowndayton.org/plan/pdfs/priorityrecs_overview.pdf|archive-date=March 28, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peace accords ===
{{Main|Dayton Agreement}}
In 1995, the [[Dayton Agreement]], a peace accord between the parties to the hostilities of the [[Yugoslav wars|conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia]], was negotiated at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], near Fairborn, Ohio, from November 1 to 21.

[[Richard Holbrooke]] wrote about these events in his memoirs:
&lt;blockquote&gt; There was also a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as the birthplace of the [[Wright brothers]].&lt;!-- Not a proper name; should be &quot;Wright brothers.&quot; Preserved Holbrooke's capitalization usage in a quote. --&gt; Its citizens energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, New York City, [[Geneva]] or [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the &quot;temporary center of international peace.&quot; The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. [[Warren Christopher]] was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed &quot;candles of peace&quot; in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a &quot;peace chain,&quot; although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Holbrooke]], ''To End a War'', p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Nickname ===
Dayton is known as the &quot;Gem City.&quot; The nickname's origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. In the early 19th century, a well-known [[racehorse]] named Gem hailed from Dayton. In 1845, an article published in the ''Cincinnati Daily Chronicle'' by an author known as T stated:
{{quote|In a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it can be fairly said, without infringing on the rights of others, that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns. It possesses wealth, refinement, enterprise, and a beautiful country, beautifully developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayton FAQs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.dayton.oh.us/Public_Affairs/faq.asp |title=City of Dayton FAQ's |accessdate=July 23, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701001047/http://www.ci.dayton.oh.us/Public_Affairs/faq.asp |archivedate = July 1, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the late 1840s, Major William D. Bickham of the ''Dayton Journal'' began a campaign to nickname Dayton the &quot;Gem City.&quot; The name was adopted by the city's Board of Trade several years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayton FAQs&quot; /&gt; [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] referred to the nickname in his poem, &quot;Toast to Dayton,&quot; as noted in the following excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
She shall ever claim our duty,
For she shines—the brightest gem
That has ever decked with beauty
     Dear Ohio's diadem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunbarsite.org/gallery/AToasttoDayton.asp |title=Toast to Dayton |accessdate=March 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718091359/http://www.dunbarsite.org/gallery/AToasttoDayton.asp |archivedate=July 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dayton also plays a role in a nickname given to the state of Ohio, &quot;Birthplace of Aviation.&quot; Dayton is the hometown of the [[Wright brothers]], aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing and building the world's first successful airplane. After their first manned flights in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]], which they had chosen due to its ideal weather and climate conditions, the Wrights returned to Dayton and continued testing at nearby [[Huffman Prairie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1904/index.cfm|title=The Wright Brothers|publisher=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum|accessdate=September 3, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113201523/http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1904/index.cfm|archivedate=November 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Dayton is colloquially referred to as &quot;Little Detroit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDN Hannon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hannon|first=B.R.|title=Little Detroit|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|date=21 April 1996|location=Dayton, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nickname comes from Dayton's prominence as a Midwestern manufacturing center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaffney |first=Bill |title=Outsourcing – Facts, Myths, Realities |url=http://www.jhacareers.com/Outsourcing.htm |work=John Hadley Associates |publisher=John Hadley Associates |accessdate=27 March 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627003856/http://www.jhacareers.com/Outsourcing.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|56.50|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|55.65|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.85|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazetteer files&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=January 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
Dayton's climate features hot, muggy summers and cold, dry winters, and is classified as a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), using the {{convert|0|°C|0}} isotherm. Unless otherwise noted, all normal figures quoted within the text below are from the official climatology station, Dayton International Airport, at an elevation of {{convert|304.8|m|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} about {{convert|10|mi|abbr=on}} to the north of downtown Dayton, which lies within the valley of the [[Great Miami River|Miami River]]; thus temperatures there are typically cooler than in downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | title=Weather.com historical temperature data for Dayton
  | publisher = The Weather Channel
  | accessdate=October 4, 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the airport, monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|27.5|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|74.1|°F|1}} in July. The highest temperature ever recorded in Dayton was {{convert|108|°F|0}} on July 22, 1901, and the coldest was {{convert|-28|°F|0}} on February 13 during the [[Great Blizzard of 1899]]. On average, there are 14 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs and 4.5 nights of sub-{{convert|0|°F|0}} lows annually. Snow is moderate, with a normal seasonal accumulation of {{convert|23.3|in|cm|abbr=on}},{{efn|This is far less than the snowbelt regions of [[northeast Ohio]] due to distance from the [[Great Lakes]] and slightly less than the generally warmer [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].&lt;ref name = NOAA /&gt;}} usually occurring from November to March, occasionally April, and rarely October. Precipitation averages {{convert|41.1|in|mm|sigfig=3}} annually, with total rainfall peaking in May.

Dayton is subject to severe weather typical of the Midwestern United States. [[Tornado]]es are possible from the spring to the fall. Floods, blizzards, and severe thunderstorms can also occur.

Around midnight May 27–28, 2019, 14 tornadoes cut a path through the region, causing extensive property damage, but only one death. The tornadoes closed several streets, including portions of I-75 and North Dixie Street.  64,000 residents lost power and much of the region's water supply was cut off. Although some of the tornadoes were only [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF0]] and remained on the ground for less than a mile, an EF4 tornado passed through the communities of Brookville, Trotwood, Dayton, and Riverside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/05/28/727439670/multiple-tornadoes-touch-down-in-dayton-ohio-catastrophic-damage-reported|title=Multiple Tornadoes Touch Down In Dayton, Ohio, Catastrophic Damage Reported |website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.wdtn.com/news/local-news/6th-tornado-confirmed-in-memorial-day-tornado-outbreak/2036443902 |title=14th tornado confirmed in Memorial Day tornado outbreak|publisher=WDTN News|date=2019-05-30|accessdate=2019-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
The Dayton Audubon Society is the [[National Audubon Society]]'s local chapter.  The Dayton chapter manages local activities contributing to the annual, hemisphere-wide [[Christmas Bird Count]]. The Chapter began participation in the National Count in 1924.  The local Count was initially coordinated by Ben Blincoe, who was succeeded by Jim Hill in 1970. In the mid-1960s, the freezing of Lake Erie and associated marshlands led species of waterfowl to appear in the Dayton-area, where surface waters remained unfrozen.  Nine varieties of birds have been observed every year in the Dayton area: [[downy woodpecker]], [[Carolina chickadee]], [[tufted titmouse]], [[brown creeper]], [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinal]], [[junco]], [[tree sparrow]], [[song sparrow]] and [[crow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23210504/watch_count_be_merry/|title=Watch, count, be merry|last=Robey|first=Jim|date=December 16, 1990|work=Dayton Daily News|access-date=August 27, 2018|publisher=Brad Tillson|issue=98|department=Ohio Outdoors|location=Dayton, Ohio|volume=114|page=6–D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- citation covers this paragraph --&gt;

{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Dayton|National Register of Historic Places listings in Dayton, Ohio}}
Unlike many [[Midwest]]ern cities its age, Dayton has very broad and straight downtown streets (generally two or three full lanes in each direction) that improved access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and shipping center from its beginning; streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to turn around. Also, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.
