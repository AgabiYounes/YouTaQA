'''Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie''' (September 9, 1941 – {{circa}} October 12, 2011)&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=RobPike /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt; was an American [[computer science|computer scientist]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; He created the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] and, with long-time colleague [[Ken Thompson]], the [[Unix]] [[operating system]] and [[B (programming language)|B programming language]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the [[Turing Award]] from the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] in 1983, the [[IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal|Hamming Medal]] from the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] in 1990 and the [[National Medal of Technology]] from [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] in 1999. Ritchie was the head of [[Lucent|Lucent Technologies]] System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the &quot;R&quot; in [[The C Programming Language|K&amp;R C]], and commonly known by his [[User (computing)|username]] '''dmr'''.

== Personal life and career ==
Dennis Ritchie was born in [[Bronxville, New York]]. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime [[Bell Labs]] scientist and co-author of ''The Design of Switching Circuits'' on [[switching circuit theory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ-2018&quot; /&gt; As a child, Dennis moved with his family to [[Summit, New Jersey]], where he graduated from [[Summit High School (New Jersey)|Summit High School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NJ-2011&quot; /&gt; He graduated from [[Harvard University]] with [[academic degree|degree]]s in [[physics]] and [[applied mathematics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ-2018&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Version 7 Unix SIMH PDP11 Emulation DMR.png|thumb|[[Version 7 Unix]] for the [[PDP-11]], including Dennis Ritchie's home directory: &lt;tt&gt;/usr/dmr&lt;/tt&gt;]]
In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center, and in 1968, he defended his PhD thesis on &quot;Program Structure and Computational Complexity&quot; at Harvard under the supervision of [[Patrick C. Fischer]]. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Renesse |first=Robbert |date=January 2014 |title=The First SIGOPS Dennis M. Ritchie Doctoral Dissertation Award |journal=ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Review |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2626421 |volume=48 |issue=1 |page=100 |doi=10.1145/2626401.2626421}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- I will have more information about this (and another reference) when I buy the book &quot;Go To: The Story of the Math Majors, ...&quot; (OriumX) --&gt;

During the 1960s, Ritchie and [[Ken Thompson]] worked on the [[Multics]] operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson then found an old [[PDP-7]] machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970, [[Brian Kernighan]] suggested the name &quot;[[Unix]]&quot;, a pun on the name &quot;Multics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evolution&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Dennis M.|last=Ritchie|title=The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/hist.html|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created [[B (programming language)|B]]. Later, B was replaced by [[C (programming language)|C]], created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;c&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/chist.html|title=The Development of the C Language|publisher=[[Bell Labs]]|accessdate=October 31, 2016|first=Dennis|last=Ritchie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and [[Robert Morris (cryptographer)|Robert Morris]] on a [[ciphertext-only attack]] on the [[M-209]] US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ritchiec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/crypt.html |title=Dabbling in Cryptography |website=Bell-labs.com |date=May 5, 2000 |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritchie relates that, after discussions with the [[NSA]], the authors decided not to publish it, as they were told that the principle was applicable to machines still in use by foreign governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ritchiec&quot;/&gt;

Ritchie was also involved with the development of the [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan 9]] and [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]] operating systems, and the programming language [[Limbo (programming language)|Limbo]].

As part of an AT&amp;T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/dennis-ritchie-father-of-c-programming-language-dies/|title= Dennis Ritchie, father of C programming language, dies | date=October 13, 2011 | publisher=cnet }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== C and Unix ==
Ritchie is best known as the creator of the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], a key developer of the [[Unix]] operating system, and co-author of the book ''[[The C Programming Language]]''; he was the 'R' in ''K&amp;R'' (a common reference to the book's authors [[Brian Kernighan|Kernighan]] and Ritchie). Ritchie worked together with [[Ken Thompson]], who is credited with writing the original version of Unix; one of Ritchie's most important contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[Pioneer Programmer Shaped the Evolution of Computers, Wall Street Journal, October 14, 2011, p.A7]&lt;/ref&gt; They were so influential on [[Research Unix]] that [[Doug McIlroy]] later wrote, &quot;The names of Ritchie and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reader&quot;&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=M. D. |last1=McIlroy |authorlink1=Doug McIlroy |year=1987 |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/reader.pdf |title=A Research Unix reader: annotated excerpts from the Programmer's Manual, 1971–1986 |series=CSTR |number=139 |institution=Bell Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritchie liked to emphasize that he was just one member of a group. He suggested that many of the improvements he introduced simply &quot;looked like a good thing to do,&quot; and that anyone else in the same place at the same time might have done the same thing.

Nowadays, the C language is widely used in application, [[operating system]], and [[embedded system]] development, and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. Unix has also been influential, establishing computing concepts and principles that have been widely adopted.

In an interview from 1999, Ritchie clarified that he saw [[Linux]] and [[BSD]] operating systems as a continuation of the basis of the Unix operating system, and as derivatives of Unix:&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview_1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Benet, Manuel|url=http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/July1999/article79.html|title=Interview With Dennis M. Ritchie|date=1999|publisher=LinuxFocus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I think the Linux phenomenon is quite delightful, because it draws so strongly on the basis that Unix provided. Linux seems to be among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the [[workstation]] and [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] manufacturers.}}

In the same interview, he stated that he viewed both Unix and Linux as &quot;the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview_1999&quot; /&gt;

== Awards ==
In 1983, Ritchie and Thompson received the [[Turing Award]] &quot;for their development of generic operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ritchie&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=A.M.

On April 21, 1999, Thompson and Ritchie jointly received the [[National Medal of Technology]] of 1998 from President [[Bill Clinton]] for co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal, &quot;led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NationalMedalAnnouncement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1998/december/9/1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327052807/http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1998/december/9/1.html |archivedate=March 27, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NationalMedalPressRelease&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1999/april/28/1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031011075017/http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1999/april/28/1.html |archivedate=October 11, 2003 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting upon his death, a commentator compared the relative importance of [[Steve Jobs]] and Ritchie, concluding that &quot;[Ritchie's] work played a key role in spawning the technological revolution of the last forty years—including technology on which Apple went on to build its fortune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duncan |first=Geoff |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/was-dennis-ritchie-more-important-than-steve-jobs/ |title=Was Dennis Ritchie more important than Steve Jobs? |publisher=Digital Trends |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another commentator said, &quot;Ritchie, on the other hand, invented and co-invented two key software technologies which make up the DNA of effectively every single computer software product we use directly or even indirectly in the modern age. It sounds like a wild claim, but it really is true.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlow |first=Jason |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/without-dennis-ritchie-there-would-be-no-jobs/ |title=Without Dennis Ritchie, there would be no Steve Jobs |website=ZDNet.com |date=October 9, 2015 |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another said, &quot;many in computer science and related fields knew of Ritchie’s importance to the growth and development of, well, everything to do with computing,...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/15/what-can-we-learn-from-dennis-ritchie/ |title=What Can We Learn From Dennis Ritchie? |website=TechCrunch.com |date=October 15, 2011 |accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
