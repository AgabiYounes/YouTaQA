'''Dilation''' (or '''dilatation''') '''and curettage''' ('''D&amp;C''') refers to the [[Cervical dilation|dilation]] (widening/opening) of the [[cervix]] and surgical removal of part of the lining of the [[uterus]] and/or contents of the uterus by scraping and scooping ([[curettage]]). It is a therapeutic [[gynecological]] procedure as well as the most often used method of first trimester [[miscarriage]] or [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abortion Statistics in the U.S., 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Pazol|first=Karen|title=Ph.D|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6208a1.htm?s_cid=ss6208a1_w#tab11|website=Center for Disease control|publisher=Center for Disease Control|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webmd abort&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dilation and sharp curettage (D&amp;C) for abortion | website = Women's Health | publisher = WebMD | date = 2004-10-07 | url = http://women.webmd.com/dilation-and-sharp-curettage-dc-for-abortion | accessdate = 2007-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webmd gyne&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayden |first=Merrill |title=Dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) for dysfunctional uterine bleeding |website=Healthwise |publisher=WebMD |date=2006-02-22 |url=http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/Dilation-and-curettage-DC-for-dysfunctional-uterine-bleeding |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071021223925/http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/Dilation-and-curettage-DC-for-dysfunctional-uterine-bleeding |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-21 |accessdate=2007-04-29 }}{{cite web|last=Nissl |first=Jan |title=Dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) for bleeding during menopause |website=Healthwise |publisher=WebMD |date=2005-01-18 |url=http://www.webmd.com/menopause/Dilation-and-curettage-DC-for-bleeding-during-menopause |accessdate=2007-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

D&amp;C normally refers to a procedure involving a [[curette]], also called ''sharp curettage''.&lt;ref name=&quot;webmd abort&quot; /&gt; However, some sources use the term D&amp;C to refer more generally to any procedure that involves the processes of dilation and removal of uterine contents, which includes the more common ''suction curettage'' procedures of manual and electric [[vacuum aspiration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;webmd miscar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/pregnancy-loss-neonatal-death?page=3|title=What Every Pregnant Woman Needs to Know About Pregnancy Loss and Neonatal Death|date=2004-10-07|website=The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby|publisher=WebMD|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528141252/http://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-loss-neonatal-death?page=3|archive-date=28 May 2008|url-status=|accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
[[File:Dilation &amp; curettage.svg|thumb|An illustration of a dilation and curettage]] Depending on the anticipated duration and difficulty expected with the procedure, as well as the clinical indication and patient preferences, a D&amp;C may be performed with [[local anesthesia]], [[Conscious sedation|moderate sedation]], deep sedation, or [[General anaesthesia|general anesthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=Rebecca H.|last2=Singh|first2=Rameet|date=2018-06-01|title=Society of Family Planning clinical guidelines pain control in surgical abortion part 1 — local anesthesia and minimal sedation|url=https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(18)30036-2/abstract|journal=Contraception|language=English|volume=97|issue=6|pages=471–477|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2018.01.014|issn=0010-7824|pmid=29407363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in a D&amp;C is to place a speculum in the vagina so as to see the cervix. Next, the provider will dilate the [[cervix]]. This can be done with [[Hegar dilators]] or similar dilators.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Dilation-and-Curettage|title=ACOG: FAQ: Dilation and Curettage|last=|first=|date=|website=American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=10 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of dilation depends on the amount of tissue to be removed as well as the size of the instruments to be used. After sufficient dilation, a curette, a metal rod with a handle on one end and a loop on the other, is then inserted into the uterus through the dilated cervix. The curette is used to gently scrape the lining of the uterus and remove the tissue in the uterus. If a [[Suction curettage|suction curette]] is used, a plastic tubular curette will be introduced into the uterus and connected to suction to remove all tissue in the uterus. This tissue is examined for completeness (in the case of abortion or miscarriage treatment) or by [[pathology]] for abnormalities (in the case of treatment for [[Dysfunctional uterine bleeding|abnormal bleeding]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;webmd abort&quot; /&gt;

==Clinical uses==
D&amp;amp;Cs may be performed in pregnant and non-pregnant patients, for different clinical indications.

=== During pregnancy or postpartum ===
A D&amp;C may be performed early in pregnancy to remove pregnancy tissue, either in the case of a non-viable pregnancy, such as a [[Missed abortion|missed]] or [[incomplete miscarriage]], or an [[undesired pregnancy]], as in a [[Abortion|surgical abortion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Medical management of miscarriage and medical abortion using drugs such as [[misoprostol]] and [[mifepristone]] are safe, non-invasive and potentially less expensive alternatives to D&amp;C.

Because medication-based non-invasive methods of abortion now exist, dilation and curettage has been declining as a method of abortion, although suction curettage is still the most common method used for termination of a first trimester pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-06/esoh-msp061015.php|title=Minor surgical procedure common in O&amp;G associated with increased risk of preterm delivery|date=16 June 2015|website=EurekAlert!|publisher=European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states|title=Induced Abortion in the United States|last=|first=|date=September 2019|website=Guttmacher Institute|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends D&amp;amp;C with a sharp curette as a method of surgical abortion only when manual [[vacuum aspiration]] with a suction curette is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Managing complications in pregnancy and childbirth: a guide for midwives and doctors|year=2017|isbn=9789241565493|location=|pages=P-71|authors=[[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], United Nations Population Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For patient who have recently given birth, a D&amp;C may be indicated to remove retained placental tissue that does not pass spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wolman I, Altman E, Fait G, Har-Toov J, Gull I, Amster R, Jaffa A|year=2009|title=Evacuating retained products of conception in the setting of an ultrasound unit|journal=Fertil. Steril.|volume=91|issue=4 Suppl|pages=1586–88|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.10.032|pmid=19064261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-pregnant patients ===

D&amp;Cs for non-pregnant patients are commonly performed for the diagnosis of gynecological conditions leading to abnormal uterine bleeding;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anastasiadis PG, Koutlaki NG, Skaphida PG, Galazios GC, Tsikouras PN, Liberis VA | title = Endometrial polyps: prevalence, detection, and malignant potential in women with abnormal uterine bleeding | journal = Eur J Gynaecol Oncol. | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 180–183 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10843481 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; to remove the excess uterine lining in women who have conditions such as [[polycystic ovary syndrome]];&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phyllisgeemd.com/Home/PatientEducation/tabid/10903/ctl/View/mid/18015/Default.aspx?ContentPubID=445|title=Dilation and Curettage (D&amp;C)|date=2016|website=www.phyllisgeemd.com|publisher=Practice Builders &amp; Health Central Women's Care, PA|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; to remove tissue in the uterus that may be causing abnormal uterine bleeding, such as endometrial [[Endometrial polyp|polyps]] or [[uterine fibroid]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;webmd gyne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webmd abort&quot; /&gt; or to diagnose the cause of [[post-menopausal bleeding]].

[[Hysteroscopy]] is a valid alternative or addition to D&amp;C for many surgical indications, from diagnosis of uterine pathology to the removal of fibroids and even retained products of conception. It allows direct visualization of the inside of the uterus and may allow targeted sampling and removal of tissue inside the uterus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/10142-hysteroscopy|title=Hysteroscopy|last=|first=|date=|website=Cleveland Clinic|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
The most common complications associated with D&amp;C are infection, bleeding, or damage to nearby organs, including through uterine perforation. Aside from the surgery itself, complications related to [[anesthesia]] administration may also occur.

[[Infection]] is uncommon after D&amp;C for a non-pregnant patient, and society practice guidelines do not recommend routine prophylactic antibiotics to patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=June 2018|title=Prevention of Infection After Gynecologic Procedures: ACOG Practice Bulletin, Number 195|journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|volume=131|issue=6|pages=e172–e189|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000002670|pmid=29794678|issn=0029-7844}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for curettage of a pregnant patient, the risk of infection is higher, and patients should receive antibiotics that cover the bacteria commonly found in the vagina and gastrointestinal tract; [[doxycycline]] is a common recommendation, though azithromycin may also be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

Another risk of D&amp;C is [[uterine perforation]]. The highest rate of uterine perforation appears to be in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage (5.1%) compared with a lower rate in diagnostic curettage in non-pregnant patients (0.3% in the premenopausal patient and 2.6% in the postmenopausal patient).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hefler|first=Lukas|last2=Lemach|first2=Andrea|last3=Seebacher|first3=Veronika|last4=Polterauer|first4=Stephan|last5=Tempfer|first5=Clemens|last6=Reinthaller|first6=Alexander|date=June 2009|title=The Intraoperative Complication Rate of Nonobstetric Dilation and Curettage|journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|volume=113|issue=6|pages=1268–1271|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e3181a66f91|pmid=19461421|issn=0029-7844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perforation may cause excessive bleeding or damage to organs outside the uterus. If the provider is concerned about ongoing bleeding or the possibility of injury to organs outside the uterus, a [[laparoscopy]] may be done to verify that there has been no undiagnosed injury.

Another risk is intrauterine adhesions, or [[Asherman's syndrome]]. One study found that in women who had one or two sharp curettage procedures for miscarriage, 14-16% developed some adhesions.&lt;ref name=&quot;freidler&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedler S, Margalioth EJ, Kafka I, Yaffe H | title = Incidence of post-abortion intra-uterine adhesions evaluated by hysteroscopy--a prospective study | journal = Hum.
