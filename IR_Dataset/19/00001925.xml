In [[Greek mythology]], '''Andromeda''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|d|r|ɒ|m|ɪ|d|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἀνδρομέδα, ''Androméda'' or Ἀνδρομέδη, ''Andromédē'') is the daughter of the [[Aethiopia|Ethiopian]] king [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and his wife [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]]. When Cassiopeia's [[hubris]] leads her to boast that she is more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], [[Poseidon]] sends the [[sea monster]] [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage the coast of Ethiopia as divine punishment. Andromeda is chained to a rock as a sacrifice to sate the monster, but is saved from death by [[Perseus]], who marries her and takes her to Greece to reign as his queen.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Classical Mythology'', Michael Grant &amp; John Hazel, Oxford University Press, 1973, 1993, p. 31, {{ISBN|0-19-521030-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kerenyi |first1=Carl |title=The heroes of the Greeks |date=1997 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=050027049X |pages=52-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her name is the [[Latin language|Latinized]] form of the Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδα}} (''Androméda'') or {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδη}} (''Andromédē''): &quot;ruler of men&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The traditional [[etymology]] of the name is, &quot;she who has bravery in her mind&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀνήρ|ἀνήρ]], ἀνδρός}} (''anēr, andrós'') &quot;man&quot;, and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:μέδω|μέδω]]}} (''medō'') &quot;I protect, rule over&quot;.

As a subject, Andromeda has been popular in art since classical times; it is one of several Greek myths of a [[Greek hero]]'s rescue of the intended victim of an archaic ''[[hieros gamos]]'' (sacred marriage), giving rise to the &quot;[[princess and dragon]]&quot; [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]. From the [[Renaissance]], interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (4.665ff).

==Mythology==

[[File:Cratere a volute con la liberazione di Andromeda, inv. 19.M325-1.6 - Marta -Mitomania (9).jpg|left|thumb|Andromeda being tied for sacrifice, Apulian Red Figure Vase, ca. 430-420 BC]]

Andromeda was the daughter of [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Aethiopia)|Cassiopeia]], king and queen of ancient [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]]. Her mother Cassiopeia boasted that she was more beautiful than the [[Nereids]],&lt;ref&gt;Both ''[[Catasterismi]]'' (1.17) and ''[[De Astronomica]]'' (2.9-12) cite [[Sophocles]]' lost play ''Andromeda'' as their source for this.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] (''Fabulae'' 64) says that Cassoipeia was boasting of her daughter Andromeda's beauty rather than of her own.&lt;/ref&gt; a display of [[hubris]] by a human that was unacceptable to the gods. To punish the queen for her arrogance, [[Poseidon]] flooded the Ethiopian coast and sent a [[sea monster]] named [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage the kingdom's inhabitants. In desperation, King Cepheus consulted the [[oracle]] of [[Amun|Ammon]], who announced that no respite would be found until the king [[Sacrifice|sacrificed]] his daughter, Andromeda, to the monster. She was thus chained to a rock on the coast to await her death.

[[File:Corinthian amphora, Andromeda, Perseus, Cetus, 575-550 BC, Berlin F 1652, 141650.jpg|thumb|Perseus fights the monster Cetus with stones as Andromeda assists, Corinthian amphora, 575-550 BC]]

[[Perseus]] was just then flying near the coast of Ethiopia on his [[winged sandals]], having slain the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] and carrying her severed head, which could instantly turn to stone any who looked at it. Upon seeing Andromeda bound to the rock, Perseus fell in love with her, and he secured Cepheus' promise of her hand in marriage if he could save her. Perseus killed the monster with the [[Harpe|magical sword]] he had used against Medusa (another version says he held up the head of Medusa to the sea monster, turning it to stone). After Perseus had saved Andromeda, preparations were made for their marriage, in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle, [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Perseus was forced to show Medusa's head to Phineus and his allies, turning them to stone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (4.663-752; 5.1-235)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Library'']] (2.35-44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of this story include:
* In [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]'s account (''[[Fabulae]]'', 64) Perseus does not ask for Andromeda's hand in marriage before saving her, and when he afterwards intends to keep her for his wife, both her father Cepheus and her uncle Phineas plot against him, and Perseus resorts to using Medusa's head to turn them to stone.
* The 12th century [[Byzantine]] writer [[John Tzetzes]], in his ''Scholiast'' (notes) on [[Lycophron]]'s ''Alexandra'' (836), says that Cetus swallows Perseus, who kills the monster by hacking his way out with his sword. 
* [[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]] (''Narrations'', 40) places the story in Joppa (Iope or [[Jaffa]], on the  coast of modern [[Israel]]), and seeks to rationalize it by making Andromeda's uncles Phineus and Phoinix rivals for her hand in marriage; her father Cepheus contrives to have Phoinix abduct her in a ship named ''Cetos'' from a small island she visits to ''make sacrifices'' to Aphrodite, and Perseus, sailing nearby, intercedes and destroys ''Cetos'' and its crew, who are &quot;petrified by shock&quot; at his bravery. Conon thus explains away all the exotic and magical elements of the story.

Andromeda followed her husband to his native island of [[Serifos]], where he rescued his mother [[Danaë]]. They next went to [[Argos]], where Perseus was the rightful heir to the throne. After accidentally killing his grandfather [[Acrisius]], however, Perseus chose to become king of [[Tiryns]] instead. Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]] (who, according to folk etymology, was the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]]), [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]] as well as two daughters, [[Autochthe]] and [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]]. Their descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] down to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom.  The great hero [[Heracles]] was also a descendant, his mother [[Alcmene]] being Electryon's daughter, while (like his grandfather Perseus) his father was the god [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]], [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|''Library'']] (2.45-59)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (5.236-249)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The goddess [[Athena]] (or her Roman version [[Minerva]]) placed Andromeda in the northern sky at her death as the [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation Andromeda]], along with [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]] and her parents [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], in commemoration of Perseus' bravery in fighting the sea monster [[Cetus constellation|Cetus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eratosthenes]], ''[[Catasterismi]]'' (1.17)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Astronomica]]'' (2.9-12)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Manilius]], ''[[Astronomica (Manilius)|Astronomica]]'' (5.549-552)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethnicities of Andromeda ==
Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of Ethiopia ([[Aethiopia|Aithiopia/Aethiopia]]), which in ancient times was thought to lie at the edge of the world. The term ''Aithiops'' was generally applied to peoples who dwelt above the equator, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, being derived from the Greek words ''αἴθω'' and ''ὤψ'' (''aitho'' “I burn” + ''ops'' “face”), translating as ''burnt-face'' or &quot;sun-burnt&quot; in noun form and ''red-brown'' in adjectival form, as a reference to the natural light-to-dark red-brown skin tones of the North Africans, Middle Easterners and Indians. [[Homer]] (''[[Odyssey]]'' 1.22-24) said the Ethiopians lived &quot;at the world's end, and lie in two halves, the one looking West and the other East,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Homer also established a long-standing literary tradition that Ethiopia was an idyllic land of plenty where the gods went to feast (see: Bonnie MacLachlan, &quot;Feasting with Ethiopians: Life on the Fringe,&quot; ''Quaderni Urbinati di Cultura Classica'', New Series, Vol. 40, No. 1 (1992), pp. 15-33 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/20547123)) &lt;/ref&gt; an idea echoed by [[Ovid]] ([[Metamorphoses]] 1.1076-1084), who located Ethiopia next to India, close to where the sun rises each day. The 5th century BC historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that &quot;Where south inclines westwards, the part of the world stretching farthest towards the sunset is Ethiopia&quot;, while also claiming that there were Ethiopians who lived in Asia (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 3.114; 3.94; 7.70). Thus Andromeda was originally thought to come from a distant land, either to the south or east, whose people were dark-skinned.

By the 1st century BC a rival location for Andromeda's story had been established, however: an outcrop of rocks near the harbor of the ancient port city of Joppa (Iope or [[Jaffa]], today part of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]) had become associated with the place of Andromeda's chaining and rescue, as reported by [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' 5.69), the traveler [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (4.35.9), the geographer [[Strabo]] (16.2.28), and the historian [[Josephus]] (''[[The Jewish War|Jewish War]]'' 3.9.3). Paul Harvey Jr. and Ted Kaizer have noted that Joppa was already connected with the [[Bible|biblical]] story of [[Jonah]], which also involved a huge sea creature, and have made the case that this new version of the myth was exploited to enhance the city's fame and serve the local tourist trade.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Paul Jr. &quot;The death of mythology: the case of Joppa,&quot; Journal of Early Christian Studies , January 1994, Vol. 2 Issue: Number 1 p 1-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ted Kaizer, &quot;Interpretations of the myth of Andromeda at Iope,&quot; ''Syria'', T. 88 (2011), pp. 323-339 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/41682313)&lt;/ref&gt; This was, of course, at odds with Andromeda's Ethiopian origins, adding confusion to her ethnicity.

Elizabeth McGrath, in her article ''The Black Andromeda'',&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth McGrath, &quot;The Black Andromeda&quot;, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes Vol. 55 (1992), pp. 1-18 (https://www.jstor.org/stable/751417)&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the tradition, as promoted by the influential Roman poet [[Ovid]], of Andromeda being a dark-skinned woman of either Ethiopian or Indian origin. In his ''[[Heroides]]'' Ovid has Sappho explain to Phaon: &quot;though I'm not pure white, Cepheus's dark Andromeda/charmed Perseus with her native color./White doves often choose mates of different hue/and the parrot loves the black turtle dove&quot; (xv, 35-38); the Latin word ''fuscae'' Ovid uses here for &quot;dark Andromeda&quot; refers to the color black or brown. In ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' Ovid says that Perseus brought Andromeda from &quot;darkest&quot; India (1.53) and declares “Nor was Andromeda’s color any problem/to her wing-footed aerial lover” (2.643-44), adding that “White suits dark girls; you looked so attractive in white, Andromeda” (3.191-192). Ovid's account of Andromeda's story in [[Metamorphoses]] (4.665ff) follows [[Euripides]]' play [[Andromeda (play)|''Andromeda'']] in having Perseus initially mistake the chained Andromeda for a statue of marble, which has been taken to mean she was light-skinned; but since statues in Ovid's time were commonly painted to look like living people, her skin tone could have been of any color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gods in color : polychromy in the ancient world |first=Ulrike |last=Koch-Brinkmann |first2=Renée |last2=Dreyfus |first3=Vinzenz |last3=Brinkmann |publisher=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Legion of Honor |isbn=978-3-7913-5707-2|location=San Francisco |oclc=982089362}}&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;white marble&quot; misconception of Andromeda has been often used as an excuse to ignore Ovid's repeated references to Andromeda's dark beauty, however.

The ''[[Aethiopica]]'', a Greek romance attributed to the 3rd century AD writer [[Heliodorus of Emesa]], reflects the ambiguity between dark-skinned and light-skinned Andromedas in the minds of the multicultural Romans. In the kingdom of [[Meroë]] (modern [[Sudan]]), Queen Persinna gives birth to her daughter, Chariclea who, despite having black parents, is born with white skin. The mother's explanation is that, during the moment of conception, she was gazing at a picture of a white-skinned Andromeda &quot;brought down by Perseus naked from the rock, and so by mishap engendered presently a thing like to her.&quot; After being long separated from her parents, living in Egypt and Greece, Princess Chariclea returns home with her lover Theagnes and proves both her heritage and her mother's story as true by showing her parents a single black spot upon her elbow. Like the mythical Andromeda, Chariclea thus 'passes' as a member of the Greek/Roman world as well as of her African birthplace.

This ambiguity is also reflected in a description by the 2nd century AD [[sophist]] [[Philostratus]] of a painting depicting Perseus and Andromeda ([[Imagines (work by Philostratus)|''Imagines'']] 1.29). He emphasizes the painting's Ethiopian setting, and notes that Andromeda &quot;is charming in that she is fair of skin ''though in Ethiopia'',&quot; in clear contrast to the other &quot;charming Ethiopians with their strange coloring and their grim smiles&quot; who have assembled to cheer Perseus in this picture.

Through the centuries, Ovid's descriptions of Andromeda and/or other authors' references to her Ethiopian/Indian origins have influenced some Western artists, but not the majority. The alternative tradition of Andromeda's story taking place at Joppa (on the coast of modern [[Israel]]) suggested that she was of light complexion to some artists, while others simply followed the tendency of artists everywhere to make the main subjects of their works look like themselves and the people around them. Roman [[Fresco|frescoes]] from [[Pompeii]] show light-skinned Andromedas, for instance, but a 2nd-3rd century AD Roman [[Mosaic|mosaic]] found at [[Zeugma (Commagene)|Zeugma]] in modern [[Turkey]] shows her with darker skin tones, which would be more common in the [[Middle East]] (see illustrations). A few Renaissance and Baroque artists, such as Piero di Cosimo, Titian, Giorgio Vasari, and Abraham van Diepenbeeck, painted Andromedas with darker or dusky-colored skin tones (see Gallery), but Ovid's tradition was not continued by their contemporaries or later artists.

===Constellations===
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Gloria Frederici, Andromeda, and Triangula.jpg|thumb|Andromeda as depicted in [[Urania's Mirror]], a set of constellation cards by [[Sidney Hall]] published in London c. 1825]]

Andromeda is represented in the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|Northern sky]] by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].

Several constellations are associated with the myth. Viewing the fainter stars visible to the naked eye, the constellations are rendered as:
* A maiden ([[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]) chained up, facing or turning away from the [[ecliptic]].
* A warrior ([[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]), often depicted holding the head of [[Medusa]], next to [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], .
* A huge man ([[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]]) wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], upside down with respect to the ecliptic.
* A smaller figure ([[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]) next to the man, sitting on a chair; as it is near the [[Polaris|pole star]], it may be seen by observers in the Northern Hemisphere through the whole year, although sometimes upside down.
* A [[whale]] or sea monster ([[Cetus]]) just under the ecliptic.
* The flying horse [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], who was born from the stump of [[Medusa]]'s neck after Perseus had decapitated her.
* The paired fish of the constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], that in myth were caught by [[Dictys]] the [[fisherman]] who was brother of [[Polydectes]], king of [[Seriphos]], the place where Perseus and his mother [[Danaë]] were stranded.

===In art===
Andromeda, and her role in the popular myth of Perseus, has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, where she is represented as an innocent, typically beautiful, young woman placed in terrible danger, who must be saved through the unswerving courage of a hero who loves her. Although ancient images typically presented her fully clothed, from the [[Renaissance]] onward the chained nude figure of Andromeda, either alone or being rescued, has been the standard, as seen in works by [[Titian]], [[Joachim Wtewael]], [[Giuseppe Cesari]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]], and [[Edward Burne-Jones]]. While these depictions of Andromeda have dwelt on her physical beauty, some artists such as [[Rembrandt]], [[Théodore Chassériau]], [[Gustave Doré|Paul Gustave Doré]], and [[Frederic, Lord Leighton]] have focused on her terror and vulnerability as she awaits the monster, while others, such as [[Piero di Cosimo]], Jan Keynooghe, [[Jacob Matham]], and [[Pierre Mignard]], have shown Andromeda in relation to her parents and onlookers (see [[#Gallery|Gallery]]).

[[File:Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres - Roger Delivering Angelica.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], Roger Delivering Angelica (1819)]]
[[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s influential epic poem ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (1532) features a [[pagan]] princess named [[Angelica (character)|Angelica]] who at one point is in exactly the same situation as Andromeda, chained naked to a rock on the sea as a sacrifice to a sea monster, and is saved at the last minute by the [[Saracen]] knight [[Ruggiero (character)|Ruggiero]]. Artists were drawn to this subject for the same reasons they appreciated the Andromeda myth, and images of Angelica and Ruggiero (or Roggiero/Roger) are often hard to distinguish from those of Andromeda and Perseus.

Gerard Manley Hopkins
Andromeda (1879)

Now Time's Andromeda on this rock rude,
With not her either beauty's equal or
Her injury's, looks off by both horns of shore,
Her flower, her piece of being, doomed dragon's food.
⁠Time past she has been attempted and pursued
By many blows and banes; but now hears roar
A wilder beast from West than all were, more
Rife in her wrongs, more lawless, and more lewd.

⁠Her Perseus linger and leave her tó her extremes?—
Pillowy air he treads a time and hangs
His thoughts on her, forsaken that she seems,
⁠All while her patience, morselled into pangs,
Mounts; then to alight disarming, no one dreams,
With Gorgon's gear and barebill, thongs and fangs.

===In films===
* In 1973, an animated film called ''Perseus'' (20 minutes) was made in the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the Soviet animated film collection called ''Legends and Mуths of Ancient Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&amp;fid=2626|title=тПУУЙКУЛБС БОЙНБГЙС Ч ВХЛЧБИ Й ЖЙЗХТБИ - жЙМШНЩ - &quot;ретуек&quot;|work=animator.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/315858/|title=КиноПоиск.ru - Все фильмы планеты|work=kinopoisk.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1981 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' is loosely based on the story of Perseus, Andromeda, and Cassiopeia, and makes quite a few changes to the original myth. In the film Cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than the single Nereid [[Thetis]], rather than the Nereids as a group. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' &quot;son&quot; Calibos (a made-up character introduced to provide Perseus with a dramatic rival), whereas in the myth they first meet when Perseus finds Andromeda chained to the rock as he is returning home from having ''already'' slain Medusa. In the film the monster is called a ''[[kraken]]'' (which was the name of a giant squid-like sea monster in [[Norse mythology]]) and looks very different from the whale-like [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetos]] of Greek myth. Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face to turn it into stone, even though all ancient sources say he killed the monster with his magical sword. Ancient myth also says [[Pegasus]] leaped from the stump of Medusa's neck after Perseus had beheaded her, but never that Perseus then tamed and rode the flying horse ([[Bellerephon]] did this); this, along with turning the monster to stone, was a later addition to Perseus' myth.
* In the Japanese anime ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' (1986-    ), the character [[Andromeda Shun|Shun]] represents the [[Andromeda constellation]] using chains as his main weapons, reminiscent of Andromeda being chained before she was saved by Perseus. In order to attain the Andromeda Cloth, he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him, also reminiscent of this myth.
* Andromeda appears in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' (1998-1999) as a new student of &quot;Prometheus Academy&quot; which Hercules and other characters from Greek mythology attend.
* Andromeda is full name of the main character in ''[[My Sister's Keeper (film)|My Sister's Keeper's]]'' (2010), in reference to her being expected to sacrifice organs to keep her sister alive.
* Andromeda is featured in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version which strays so much further from the myth's ancient sources, and Greek mythology in general, that there is little reason to draw comparisons. The 2012 sequel, ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', draws more from [[Norse mythology]]'s twilight of the gods ([[Ragnarök]]), than Greek mythology.
