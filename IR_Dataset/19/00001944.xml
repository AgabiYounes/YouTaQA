The '''Australian Capital Territory''', formerly known as the '''Federal Capital Territory''' until 1938 and commonly referred to as the '''ACT''', is a [[federal territory]] of [[Australia]] containing the Australian capital city of [[Canberra]] and some surrounding [[township#Australia|township]]s. It is located in the south-east of the country and is an [[enclave and exclave|enclave]] within the state of [[New South Wales]]. Founded after [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] as the seat of government for the new nation, all important institutions of the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] are centred in the territory.

On 1 January 1901, [[Federation of Australia|federation of the colonies]] of Australia was achieved. Section 125 of the new [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] provided that land, situated in New South Wales and at least {{convert|100|miles|km|abbr=}} from [[Sydney]], would be ceded to the new [[Government of Australia|federal government]]. Following discussion and exploration of various areas within New South Wales, the ''[[Seat of Government Act 1908]]'' was passed in 1908 which specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region. The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by [[New South Wales]] in 1911, two years prior to the capital city being founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913.

While the overwhelming majority of the population reside in the city of [[Canberra]] in the ACT's north-east, the territory also includes some surrounding townships such as [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Naas (valley)|Naas]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]]. The ACT also includes the [[Namadgi National Park]] which comprises the majority of land area of the territory. Despite a common misconception, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] is not part of the ACT although the laws of the Australian Capital Territory apply as if Jervis Bay did form part of the ACT.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx|title=Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration|website=Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The territory has a relatively dry, continental climate experiencing warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters.

The Australian Capital Territory is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. This includes the [[Parliament of Australia]], the [[High Court of Australia]], the [[Australian Defence Force Academy]] and the [[Australian War Memorial]]. It also hosts the majority of foreign embassies in Australia as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations. Several major universities also have campuses in the ACT including the [[Australian National University]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[University of New South Wales]], [[Charles Sturt University]] and the [[Australian Catholic University]].

A locally elected legislative assembly has governed the territory since 1988. However, the Commonwealth maintains authority over the territory and may overturn local laws. It still maintains control over the area known as the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]] through the [[National Capital Authority]]. Residents of the territory elect three members to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and two Senators to the [[Australian Senate]].

With 423,800 residents, the Australian Capital Territory is the second smallest mainland state or territory by population. At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, the median weekly income for people in the territory aged over 15 was $998 and higher than the national average of $662.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot; /&gt; The average level of degree qualification in the ACT is also higher than the national average. Within the ACT, 37.1% of the population hold a bachelor's degree level or above education compared to the national figure of 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot; /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of the Australian Capital Territory}}

=== Aboriginal inhabitants ===
Indigenous Australian peoples have long inhabited the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canberra in two centuries: A pictorial history|last=Fitzgerald|first=Alan|publisher=Clareville Press|year=1987|isbn=0-909278-02-4|location=|pages=4–5,12,92–93,115,128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence indicates habitation dating back at least 25,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Osborne |first1=Tegan |title=New dating shows 25,000 years of history at Birrigai rock shelter in ACT |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/specials/curious-canberra/2016-04-04/new-research-shows-human-occupation-in-act-extends-25,000-years/7288132 |accessdate=20 August 2019 |agency=ABC News |date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that the area was inhabited for considerably longer, with evidence of an Aboriginal presence at [[Lake Mungo remains|Lake Mungo]] in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bowler JM, Johnston H, Olley JM, Prescott JR, Roberts RG, Shawcross W, Spooner NA |title = New ages for human occupation and climatic change at Lake Mungo, Australia. | journal = Nature  |volume = 421 |issue = 6925 | year = 2003 | pages = 837–40 | pmid = 12594511 | doi = 10.1038/nature01383  | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal group occupying the region were the [[Ngunnawal]] people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillespie84&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillespie|first=Lyall|title=Aborigines of the Canberra Region|publisher=Wizard (Lyall Gillespie)|location=Canberra|year=1984|pages=1–25|isbn=0-9590255-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European exploration ===
Following European settlement, the growth of the new colony of New South Wales led to an increasing demand for [[arable land]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillespie84&quot; /&gt; Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] supported expeditions to open up new lands to the south of [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canberra 1820–1913|last=Gillespie|first=Lyall|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|year=1991|isbn=0-644-08060-4|location=|pages=3–9,110–111,149,278,303}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1820s saw further exploration in the Canberra area associated with the construction of a road from Sydney to the [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] plains. While working on the project, [[Charles Throsby]] learned of a nearby lake and river from the local Indigenous peoples and he accordingly sent Wild to lead a small party to investigate the site. The search was unsuccessful, but they did discover the [[Yass River]] and it is surmised that they would have set foot on part of the future territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old Canberra and the search for a capital|last=Fitzhardinge|first=L. F.|publisher=Canberra &amp; District Historical Society|year=1975|isbn=0-909655-02-2|location=|pages=1–3, 31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second expedition was mounted shortly thereafter and they became the first Europeans to camp at the [[Molonglo River|Molonglo]] (Ngambri) and [[Queanbeyan River|Queanbeyan]] (Jullergung) Rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; However, they failed to find the Murrumbidgee River.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; The issue of the Murrumbidgee was solved in 1821 when Throsby mounted a third expedition and successfully reached the watercourse, on the way providing the first detailed account of the land where Canberra now resides.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; The last expedition in the region before settlement was undertaken by [[Allan Cunningham (botanist)|Allan Cunningham]] in 1824.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; He reported that the region was suitable for grazing and the settlement of the Limestone Plains followed immediately thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=F.|date=1931|title=Special Article: Canberra Past and Present|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/4e782ee652d0db0aca2569de001fb2dd?OpenDocument|journal=Year Book Australia|volume=|pages=|access-date=8 April 2019|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early settlement ===
[[Image:ACT historic buildings map-MJC2.png|thumb|alt=Map locations concentrated in the northeast and east, west and south largely deserted except for the southern tip|Significant homesteads, structures and settlements in the ACT prior to 1909.]]
The first land grant in the region was made to Joshua John Moore in 1823 and European settlement in the area began in 1824 with the construction of a homestead by his stockmen on what is now the [[Acton Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Moore formally purchased the site in 1826 and named the property ''Canberry'' or ''Canberra''.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

A significant influx of population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s [[Australian gold rushes|goldrushes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South-Wales/Kiandra/2005/02/17/1108500196974.html |title=Kiandra |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=5 February 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goldrushes prompted the establishment of communication between Sydney and the region by way of the [[Cobb and Co|Cobb &amp; Co]] coaches, which transported mail and passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canberra: history of Australia's national capital|last=Wigmore|first=Lionel|publisher=Dalton Publishing Company|year=1971|isbn=0-909906-06-8|location=|pages=20,113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first post offices opened in [[Ginninderra]] in 1859 and at Lanyon in 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

During colonial times, the European communities of Ginninderra, [[Molonglo Plains|Molonglo]] and Tuggeranong settled and farmed the surrounding land. The region was also called the [[Queanbeyan]]-[[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]] district, after the two largest towns in the area. The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities.

During the first 20 years of settlement, there was only limited contact between the settlers and Aboriginal people. Over the succeeding years, the Ngunnawal and other local indigenous people effectively ceased to exist as cohesive and independent communities adhering to their traditional ways of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Those who had not succumbed to disease and other predations either dispersed to the local settlements or were relocated to more distant [[Aboriginal reserve]]s set up by the New South Wales government in the latter part of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

=== Creation of the territory ===
[[Image:Surveyors camp Canberra.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Single wooden cabin and many white tents in open dusty field with single tree in foreground|The Federal Capital survey camp was established c. 1909. An extensive survey of the ACT was completed by Charles Scrivener and his team in 1915.]]
In 1898, a referendum on a proposed Constitution was held in four of the colonies – [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. Although the referendum achieved a majority in all four colonies, the New South Wales referendum failed to gain the minimum number of votes needed for the bill to pass. Following this result, a meeting of the four Premiers in 1898 heard from [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]], the [[Premier of New South Wales]], who argued that locating the future capital in New South Wales would be sufficient to ensure the passage of the Bill. The 1899 referendum on this revised bill was successful and passed with sufficient numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-etsav.upc.es/personals/iphs2004/pdf/017_p.pdf|title=Contested places for Australia’s capital city|last=Birtles|first=Terry G.|date=2004|website=11th Annual Planning History Conference|access-date=8 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 125 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] thus provided that, following Federation in 1901, land would be ceded freely to the new [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

This, however, left open the question of where to locate the capital. In 1906 and after significant deliberations, New South Wales agreed to cede sufficient land on the condition that it was in the [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]]-[[Canberra]] region,&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; this site being closer to Sydney.&lt;ref name=&quot;ausmap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ga.gov.au/products/servlet/controller?event=GEOCAT_DETAILS&amp;catno=47987|title=A4 Report Map of Australia|date=16 November 2009|website=Geoscience Australia|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, [[Dalgety, New South Wales]] remained at the forefront, but Yass-Canberra prevailed after voting by federal representatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt; The ''[[Seat of Government Act 1908]]'' was passed in 1908, which repealed the 1904 Act and specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=110|title=Seat of Government Act 1908 (Cth)|publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017025122/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=110|archivedate=17 October 2009|url-status=dead|accessdate=31 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government surveyor [[Charles Scrivener]] was deployed to the region in the same year to map out a specific site and, after an extensive search, settled upon the present location.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

The territory was transferred to the Commonwealth by [[New South Wales]] in 1911, two years before the naming of Canberra as the national capital in 1913.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

=== Development throughout 20th century ===

To his right is the Governor-General, [[Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman|Lord Denman]], and to his left, [[Gertrude Denman, Baroness Denman|Lady Denman]].]]
In 1911, an international competition to design the future capital was held, which was won by the Chicago architect [[Walter Burley Griffin]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; The official naming of Canberra occurred on 12 March 1913 and construction began immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

After Griffin's departure following difficulty in implementing his project,&lt;ref name=&quot;act&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcapital.gov.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=136&amp;Itemid=171|title=History of the NCA|date=11 June 2009|website=National Capital Authority|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Capital Advisory Committee]] was established in 1920 to advise the government of the construction efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; The Committee had limited success meeting its goals. However, the chairman, [[John Sulman]], was instrumental in applying the ideas of the [[garden city movement]] to Griffin's plan. The Committee was replaced in 1925 by the [[Federal Capital Commission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

In 1930, the ACT Advisory Council was established to advise the minister for territories on the community's concerns. In 1934, [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]] was established.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

From 1938 to 1957, the [[National Capital Planning and Development Committee]] continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra. However, the [[National Capital Planning and Development Committee]] did not have executive power, and decisions were made on the development of Canberra without the Committee's consultation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt; During this time, Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canberra 1954–1980|last=Sparke|first=Eric|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|year=1988|isbn=0-644-08060-4|location=|pages=30,170–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, there was a shortage of housing and office space in Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canberra 1913–1953|last=Gibbney|first=Jim|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|year=1988|isbn=0-644-08060-4|location=|pages=231–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Senate Select Committee hearing was held in 1954 to address its development requirements. This Committee recommended the creation of a single planning body with executive power. Consequently, the [[National Capital Planning and Development Committee]] was replaced by the [[National Capital Development Commission]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canberra's Engineering Heritage|last=Andrews|first=W.C.|publisher=Institution of Engineers Australia|year=1990|isbn=0-85825-496-4|location=|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Capital Development Commission]] ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of [[Lake Burley Griffin]] and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work. The completion of the centrepiece of Griffin's design finally the laid the platform for the development of Griffin's [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

=== Self-government ===
In 1988, the new minister for the Australian Capital Territory [[Gary Punch]] received a report recommending the abolition of the [[National Capital Development Commission]] and the formation of a locally elected government. Punch recommended that the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke government]] accept the report's recommendations and subsequently [[Clyde Holding]] introduced legislation to grant self-government to the territory in October 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canberra: yesterday, today &amp; tomorrow: a personal memoir|last=Overall|first=John|publisher=Federal Capital Press of Australia|year=1995|isbn=0-9593910-6-1|location=|pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enactment on 6 December 1988 of the ''[[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988]]'' established the framework for self-government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACT1988&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=117 |title=Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cth) |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |accessdate=21 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050716075342/http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?sdID=117 |archivedate=16 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1989 Australian Capital Territory general election|first election]] for the 17-member [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] was held on 4 March 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Past ACT Legislative Assembly Elections | publisher = ACT Electoral Commission | url= http://www.elections.act.gov.au/elections_and_voting/past_act_legislative_assembly_elections | accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial years of self-government were difficult and unstable.&lt;ref name=anniv&gt;{{cite web |title=Turbulent 20yrs of self-government |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/11/2566162.htm|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=31 January 2010   |date= 11 May 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of ACT residents had opposed self-government and had it imposed upon them by the federal parliament. At the first election, 4 of the 17 seats were won by anti-self-government single-issue parties due to a protest vote by disgruntled territorians and a total of 8 were won by minor parties and independents.&lt;ref name=anniv/&gt;

In 1992, Labor won eight seats and the minor parties and independents won only three. Stability increased, and in 1995, [[Kate Carnell]] became the first elected Liberal chief minister. In 1998, Carnell became the first chief minister to be re-elected.

==Geography==
[[Image:ACT-Jervis Bay-Sydney-MJC.png|left|thumb|125px|Location of the ACT and Jervis Bay]]
The Australian Capital Territory is the smallest mainland territory (aside from the [[Jervis Bay Territory]]) and covers a total land area of {{convert|2280|km2|mi2|abbr=}}.

It is bounded by the [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]]-[[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]] railway line in the east, the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of [[Naas (valley)|Naas Creek]] in the south, the watershed of the [[Cotter River]] in the west and the watershed of the [[Molonglo River]] in the north-east. These boundaries were set to give the ACT an adequate water supply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/specials/curious-canberra/2016-04-11/how-the-act-borders-were-determined/7304358 How were the ACT's boundaries determined?]&lt;/ref&gt; The ACT extends about {{convert|88.5|km|mi}} North-South between 35.124°S and 35.921°S, and {{convert|57.75|km|mi}} West-East between 148.763°E and 149.399°E.&lt;ref name=&quot;gmaps&quot;&gt;Limits plotted on Google Maps: 
north: 35.12452°S, 149.12091°E (Gungahlin);
east: 35.31918°S, 149.39928°E (Kings Highway);
south: 35.92076°S, 149.04608°E (near Bumbalong);
west: 35.49551°S, 148.76268°E (Mount Franklin Rd, near Bimberi);&lt;/ref&gt; The city area of [[Canberra]] occupies the north-eastern corner of this area.

The Australian Capital Territory includes the city of [[Canberra]] and some other townships such as [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Naas (valley)|Naas]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]]. The Australian Capital Territory also contains agricultural land ([[domestic sheep|sheep]], [[dairy cattle]], [[vineyard]]s and small amounts of crops) and a large area of national park ([[Namadgi National Park]]), much of it mountainous and forested.
[[File:Swans on molonglo river.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Molonglo River]], located in the north-east of the region.]]
Tidbinbilla is a locality to the south-west of Canberra that features the [[Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve]] and the [[Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex]], operated by the United States' [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) as part of its [[Deep Space Network]].

There are a large range of mountains, rivers and creeks throughout the territory and are largely contained within the [[Namadgi National Park]]. These include the Naas and Murrumbidgee Rivers.

===Climate===
The territory has a relatively dry, continental climate experiencing warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/nsw/canberra/climate.shtml|title=Climate of Canberra Area|date=2009-07-12|website=Bureau of Meteorology|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712100903/http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/nsw/canberra/climate.shtml|archive-date=2009-07-12|url-status=|access-date=2019-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen-Geiger classification]], the territory has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/oceania/australia/australian-capital-territory-905/|title=Climate: Australian Capital Territory|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=2019-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

January is the hottest month with an average high of {{convert|27.7|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; July is the coldest month when the average high drops to {{convert|11.2|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The highest maximum temperature recorded in the territory was {{convert|44.0|°C|1|abbr=}} on 4 January 2020. The lowest minimum temperature was {{convert|−10.0|°C|1|abbr=}} on 11 July 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Rainfall varies significantly across the territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Much higher rainfall occurs in the mountains to the west of Canberra compared to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The mountains act as a barrier during winter with the city receiving less rainfall.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Average annual rainfall in the territory is {{convert|629|mm|inch|abbr=}} and there is an average of 108 rain days annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The wettest month is October with an average rainfall of {{convert|65.3|mm|inch|abbr=}} and the driest month is June with an average of {{convert|39.6|mm|inch|abbr=}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Frost is common in the winter months. Snow is rare in Canberra's city centre, but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow-capped mountains can be seen from the city. The last significant snowfall in the city centre was in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Smoke haze became synonymous with the 2019/2020 Australian summer. On 1st January 2020 Canberra had the worst air quality of any major city in the world, with an AQI of 7700 (USAQI 949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/03/canberra-chokes-on-worlds-worst-air-quality-as-city-all-but-shut-down|title=Canberra chokes on world's worst air quality as city all but shut down|date=3 January 2020|accessdate=5 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flora and fauna ===
{{main|Fauna of the Australian Capital Territory|Flora of the Australian Capital Territory}}
The environments range from [[Alpine climate|alpine]] area on the higher mountains, to [[sclerophyll]] forest and to [[woodland]]. Much of the ACT has been cleared for grazing and is also burnt off by [[bushfire]]s several times per century. The kinds of plants can be grouped into [[vascular plants]], that include [[gymnosperm]]s, flowering plants, and [[fern]]s, as well as [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]]s, [[fungi]] and freshwater [[algae]]. Four flowering plants are endemic to the ACT. Several lichens are unique to the territory. Most plants in the ACT are characteristic of the [[Australian flora|Flora of Australia]] and include well known plants such as [[Grevillea]], [[Eucalyptus]] trees and [[kangaroo grass]].

The native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly [[Eucalyptus|eucalypt]] species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|title=Inquiry into the Operational Response to the January 2003 Bushfires in the ACT|last=McLeod|first=Ron|year=2003|isbn=0-642-60216-6|location=Canberra, ACT|ref=harv|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514031921/http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/113939/McLeodInquiry.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fauna of the territory includes representatives from most major [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animal groups]]. This includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, platypus, echidna, emu, kookaburras and dragon lizards.

===Geology===
{{main|Geology of the Australian Capital Territory}}
Notable geological formations in the Australian Capital Territory include the ''Canberra Formation'', the ''Pittman Formation'', ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' and ''State Circle Shale''.

In the 1840s [[fossil]]s of [[brachiopod]]s and [[trilobite]]s from the [[Silurian]] period were discovered at Woolshed Creek near [[Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory|Duntroon]]. At the time, these were the oldest fossils discovered in Australia, though this record has now been far surpassed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051022162853/http://www.environment.act.gov.au/Files/heritageregister20010.pdf|archivedate=22 October 2005|publisher=ACT Heritage Council|title=Entry to the ACT Heritage Register – 20010. Woolshed Creek Fossil Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other specific geological places of interest include the State Circle cutting and the Deakin anticline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AHD|105733|State Circle Cutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.act.nationaltrust.org.au/places/deak-anti.html|title=National Trust of Australia – Deakin Anticline|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040706073745/http://www.act.nationaltrust.org.au/places/deak-anti.html|archivedate=6 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest rocks in the ACT date from the [[Ordovician]] around 480 million years ago. During this period the region along with most of Eastern Australia was part of the ocean floor; formations from this period include the ''Black Mountain Sandstone'' formation and the ''Pittman Formation'' consisting largely of [[quartz]]-rich [[sandstone]], [[siltstone]] and [[shale]]. These formations became exposed when the ocean floor was raised by a major [[orogeny|volcanic activity]] in the [[Devonian]] forming much of the east coast of Australia.

[[File:Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|The ACT Legislative Assembly building]]

=== Territory government ===
{{See also|Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories}}

The ACT has internal self-government, but [[Constitution of Australia|Australia's Constitution]] does not afford a territory legislature the high degree of independence provided to that of a state. Instead, each territory is governed under a Commonwealth statute&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Australia]], s 122.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdash}}for the ACT, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00802|title=Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 (Cth)|website=[[Federal Register of Legislation]]|accessdate=14 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chief minister performs many of the roles that a state governor normally holds in the context of a state; however, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly gazettes the laws and summons meetings of the Assembly.

Laws are made in a 25-member [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] that combines both state and local government functions (prior to 2016, the Assembly was made up of 17 members).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2016/09/summary-of-candidates-and-parties-contesting-2016-act-election.html|title=Summary of Candidates and Parties Contesting 2016 ACT Election|work=ABC Elections|author=[[Antony Green]]|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/three_levels_law-making.html|title=Three Levels of Law-Making|publisher=Parliamentary Education Office|archivedate=16 May 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516042422/http://www.peo.gov.au/students/fact_sheets/three_levels_law-making.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected via the [[Hare–Clark electoral system|Hare–Clark]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.elections.act.gov.au/publications/act_electoral_commission_fact_sheets/elections_act_factsheet_hare-clark_electoral_system|title=Factsheet – Hare-Clark electoral system|date=5 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606055358/http://www.elections.act.gov.au/publications/act_electoral_commission_fact_sheets/elections_act_factsheet_hare-clark_electoral_system|archivedate=6 June 2013|publisher=ACT Electoral Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive of the Australian Capital Territory, also known as the [[ACT Government]], consists of the chief minister and such other [[ACT Government|ministers]] as are appointed by the chief minister.  The [[Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory|ACT chief minister]] (currently [[Andrew Barr]], [[Australian Labor Party (ACT Branch)|Labor]]) is elected by members of the Legislative Assembly. The chief minister represents the ACT Government as a member of the [[Council of Australian Governments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_members|title=COAG Members|publisher=Council of Australian Governments|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719002952/http://www.coag.gov.au/coag_members|archivedate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other self-governing Australian territories (for example, the [[Northern Territory]]), the ACT does not have an Administrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1301.0~2012~Main%20Features~Territory%20government~89|title=Territory Government|work=1301.0 – Year Book Australia, 2012 |date=24 May 2012|publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crown is represented in government of the ACT by the Australian [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. Until 4 December 2011, the decisions of the assembly could be overruled by the Governor-General (effectively by the national government) under section 35 of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, although the federal parliament voted in 2011 to abolish this veto power, instead requiring a majority of both houses of the federal parliament to override an enactment of the ACT.&lt;ref name=vetopower&gt;{{cite web|title=Disallowance powers removed from ACT self-government legislation |url=http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/index.asp?ID=7487 |work=News, Events and Conferences |publisher=ACT Legislative Assembly |accessdate=5 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523073454/http://www.parliament.act.gov.au/index.asp?ID=7487 |archivedate=23 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Territories Self-Government Legislation Amendment (Disallowance and Amendment of Laws) Act 2011 (Cth)|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2011A00166

=== Judiciary and policing ===
{{See also|Crime in the Australian Capital Territory}}
The court system of the territory consists of the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory]], the [[Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal]]. It is unique in that the territory does not have an intermediary court like other mainland states and territories; there is only the superior court and a court of summary jurisdiction. {{as of|April 2019}} the Chief Justice is [[Helen Murrell]] and the current Chief Magistrate is [[Lorraine Walker]].

[[ACT Policing]] (part of the [[Australian Federal Police]]) is responsible for providing policing services to the ACT. [[Canberra]] had the lowest rate of crime of any capital city in [[Australia]] {{as of|lc=yes|February 2019}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://police.act.gov.au/crime|title=Crime|website=Australian Federal Police. ACT Policing|accessdate=23 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:ACTPol Toyota LC-2011.jpg|thumb|AFP vehicle in Canberra]]

=== Federal representation ===
In Australia's [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]], the ACT is represented by five federal members: three members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] represent the [[Division of Bean]], the [[Division of Canberra]] and the [[Division of Fenner]], and it is one of only two territories to be represented in the Senate, with two [[Australian Senate|Senators]] (the other being the Northern Territory). The Member for Bean and the ACT Senators also represent the constituents of [[Norfolk Island]]. The Member for Fenner and the ACT Senators also represent the constituents of the [[Jervis Bay Territory]].

=== Jervis Bay Territory ===
{{main|Jervis Bay Territory}}
In 1915, the ''[[Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915]]'' created the [[Jervis Bay Territory]] as an annexe to the Federal Capital Territory. While the Act's use of the language of &quot;annexed&quot; is sometimes interpreted as implying that the Jervis Bay Territory was to form part of the Federal Capital Territory, the accepted legal position is that it has been a legally distinct territory from its creation despite being subject to ACT law and, prior to ACT self-government in 1988, being administratively treated as part of the ACT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spagnolo2015&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlKXCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|title=The Continuity of Legal Systems in Theory and Practice|author=Benjamin Spagnolo|date=22 October 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-84946-884-8|page=65|quote=While the Jervis Bay Territory was constituted as a separate Territory on acceptance by the Commonwealth, it was 'annexed' to the Federal Capital Territory, to the extent that the laws there in force from time to time were 'applied' in the still legally distinct Jervis Bay Territory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, when the ACT gained self-government, Jervis Bay was formally pronounced as a separate territory administered by the Commonwealth known as the Jervis Bay Territory. However, the laws of the ACT continue to apply to the Jervis Bay Territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Magistrates from the ACT regularly travel to the Jervis Bay Territory to conduct court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/courts/jervis_bay_court|title=Jervis Bay Court|date=2016-10-09|website=www.courts.act.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2019-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321014818/https://courts.act.gov.au/magistrates/courts/jervis_bay_court|archive-date=21 March 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another occasional misconception is that the ACT retains a small area of territory on the coast on the [[Beecroft Peninsula]], consisting of a strip of coastline around the northern headland of Jervis Bay. While the land is owned by the Commonwealth Government, that area itself is still considered to be under the jurisdiction of New South Wales government, not a separate territory nor a part of the ACT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00038|title=Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] estimates that the population of the territory was 419,200 on 31 March 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABSPop&quot; /&gt; The population is projected to reach to approximately 700,000 by 2058.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.treasury.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/1305581/ACT-Population-Projections-Paper-FINAL.pdf|title=ACT Population Projections: 2018 to 2058|date=January 2019|website=ACT Government|access-date=2019-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of the population reside in the city of Canberra.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABSPop&quot; /&gt;

At the {{CensusAU|2016}}, the median weekly income for people in the territory aged over 15 was $998 while the national average was $662.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot;&gt;{{Census 2016 AUS|id=8|name=Australian Capital Territory|accessdate=27 June 2017|quick=on}}[[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Attribution International] license.&lt;/ref&gt;

The average level of degree qualification in the ACT is higher than the national average. Within the ACT, 37.1% of the population hold a bachelor's degree level or above education compared to the national figure of 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Inner-canberra 01MJC.png|right|thumb|Inner Canberra demonstrates some aspects of the Griffin plan, in particular the [[Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra|Parliamentary Triangle]].]]The Australian Capital Territory consists of the city of [[Canberra]] and some surrounding townships including [[Williamsdale, Australian Capital Territory|Williamsdale]], [[Naas (valley)|Naas]], [[Uriarra, Australian Capital Territory|Uriarra]], [[Tharwa, Australian Capital Territory|Tharwa]] and [[Hall, Australian Capital Territory|Hall]].

The urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven districts (with an eighth currently under construction), each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities. The districts were settled in the following chronological order:
* [[North Canberra]]: mostly settled in the 1920s and '30s, with expansion up to the 1960s, now 14 suburbs;
* [[South Canberra]]: settled from the 1920s to '60s, 13 suburbs;
* [[Woden Valley]]: first settled in 1963, 12 suburbs;
* [[Belconnen]]: first settled in 1967, 25 suburbs;
* [[Weston Creek]]: settled in 1969, 8 suburbs;
* [[Tuggeranong]]: settled in 1974, 19 suburbs;
* [[Gungahlin]]: settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs although only 15 are developed or under development;
* [[Molonglo Valley]]: first suburbs currently under construction.

The North and South Canberra districts are substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.{{sfn|Wigmore|1971|p=64}} In 1967, the then [[National Capital Development Commission]] adopted the &quot;Y Plan&quot; which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154–155}} with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.{{sfn|Sparke|1988|pp=154–155}}

{{Main|Economy of the Australian Capital Territory}}
The economic activity of the Australian Capital Territory is heavily concentrated around the city of Canberra.

A stable housing market, steady employment and rapid population growth in the 21st century have led to economic prosperity and, in 2011, [[Commsec|CommSec]] ranked the ACT as the second best performing economic region in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/australian-capital-territory-australias-best-economy-1277250|title=Australian Capital Territory is Australia's best economy|date=18 January 2011|work=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued into 2016, when the territory was ranked the third best performing out of all of Australia's states and territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-27/commsec-state-of-the-states-puts-nsw-economy-1/7115154|title=CommSec State of the States places NSW economy first|date=27 January 2016|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017-18, the ACT had the fastest rate of growth in the nation due to a rapid growth in population, a strongly performing higher education sector as well as a significant housing and infrastructure investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/5996178/glitter-starting-to-fade-act-economic-growth-to-slow/|title='Glitter starting to fade': ACT economic growth to slow|last=Jervis-Bardy|first=Dan|date=2019-01-29|website=The Canberra Times|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education is the territory's largest export industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/Documents/act.pdf|title=Fact sheets for countries, economies and regions: Australian Capital Territory|date=2018|website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|access-date=9 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canberra is home to a significant number of universities and higher education providers. The other major services exports of the ACT in 2017-18 were government services and personal travel.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; The major goods exports of the territory in 2017-18 were gold coin, legal tender coin, metal structures and fish, though these represent a small proportion of the economy compared to services exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;

The economy of the ACT is largely dependent on the public sector with 30% of the jobs in the territory being in the public sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dixon.com.au/insights/the-act-economy|title=The ACT economy still going strong|last=Kennedy|first=Maddison|date=July 2017|website=Dixon Advisory|access-date=2019-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions by the federal government regarding the public service can have a significant impact on the territory's economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:9&quot; /&gt;

The ACT's gross state product in 2017-18 was $39,792,000,000 and the territory's economy represented 2.2% of the overall gross domestic product of Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt; In 2017-18 the ACT economy grew by 4.0 per cent, the highest growth rate of any jurisdiction in Australia. This brought real economic growth over the three years to June 2018 to 12 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.treasury.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1318151/2018-19-Budget-Review-Web-Version-PDF.pdf|title=Australian Capital Territory BUDGET 2018-19 Budget Review|last=ACT Government|access-date=2019-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
