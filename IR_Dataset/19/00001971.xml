'''Apollo 17''' (December 7–19, 1972) was the final Moon landing mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]], and remains the most recent time humans have travelled beyond [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;astronautix&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alsjoverview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17ov.html|title=Apollo 17 Mission Overview|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its crew consisted of Commander [[Eugene Cernan]], Lunar Module Pilot [[Harrison Schmitt]], and Command Module Pilot [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]], and it carried a biological experiment containing [[Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey|five mice]].

Launched at 12:33&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 7, 1972, Apollo 17 was a &quot;[[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|J-type mission]]&quot; that included three days on the lunar surface, extended scientific capability, and the use of the third [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV).

Cernan and Schmitt landed in the [[Taurus–Littrow]] valley and completed three [[extravehicular activity|moonwalks]], taking [[Moon rock|lunar samples]] and deploying [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|scientific instruments]]. The landing site had been chosen to further the mission's main goals: to sample [[Lunar highlands|lunar highland]] material older than [[Mare Imbrium]], and to investigate the possibility of relatively recent [[Volcano|volcanic activity]].&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; Evans remained in [[lunar orbit]] in the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module]] (CSM), taking scientific measurements and photographs.

Cernan, Evans, Schmitt, and the mice returned to Earth on December 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;astronautix&quot; /&gt;

Apollo 17 was the first mission to have no one on board who had been a [[test pilot]]; [[X-15]] test pilot [[Joe Engle]] lost the lunar module pilot assignment to Schmitt, a [[geologist]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Harrison Schmitt]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[see [[:File:AstronautAssignmentsChart.PNG|chart]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission included the first night launch of a U.S. human spaceflight and the final crewed launch of a [[Saturn V|Saturn{{nbsp}}V]] rocket. It was also the final use of Apollo hardware for its original purpose (extra [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]] were later used in the [[Skylab]] and [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project|Apollo–Soyuz]] programs).

The mission broke several crewed spaceflight records: the longest Moon landing, longest total extravehicular activities (moonwalks),&lt;ref name=&quot;evarecord&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Extravehicular Activity|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-30_Extravehicular_Activity.htm|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118103553/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-30_Extravehicular_Activity.htm|archivedate=November 18, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; largest lunar sample, longest time in lunar orbit,&lt;ref name=&quot;records&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronaut Bio: Harrison Schmitt|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/schmitt-hh.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=December 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317220959/http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/schmitt-hh.html|archive-date=March 17, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, at 75, most lunar orbits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_17a_Summary.htm NASA Apollo 17 page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, NASA announced&lt;ref name=&quot;a17pre&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.prepdi.html|title=A Running Start – Apollo 17 up to Powered Descent Initiation|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320233958/http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.prepdi.html|archivedate=March 20, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the backup crew of [[Apollo 14]], slated to fly in 1971, would be Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and former [[North American X-15|X-15]] pilot [[Joe Engle]] (whose 16 flights in the X-15 had thrice taken him past the {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} border of space).&lt;ref name=englebio&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronaut Bio: Joe Henry Engle|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/engle-jh.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the Apollo program generally slated a backup crew to fly as prime crew three missions later, Cernan, Evans, and Engle were in line to be prime crew of Apollo 17. Meanwhile, Harrison Schmitt—a professional geologist—was assigned to the backup crew of [[Apollo 15]] and slated to fly as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 18.

However, [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo 18 was cancelled]] in September 1970. The scientific community subsequently pressed [[NASA]] to find a way to assign a geologist—and not just a pilot with geology training—to an Apollo landing. So NASA assigned Schmitt as the Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 17,&lt;ref name=&quot;a17pre&quot; /&gt; bumping astronaut [[Curt Michel]], who had a Ph.D in physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;RiceU Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rice.edu/2015/02/27/professor-emeritus-curt-michel-dies/|title=Professor emeritus Curt Michel dies|last=Williams|first=Mike|date=February 27, 2015|publisher=Rice University News &amp; Media|accessdate=October 11, 2015|quote=He maintained that his decision to return to research prompted a shuffle among flight crews that led to one scientist, Harrison &quot;Jack&quot; Schmitt, landing on the Moon with Apollo 17. &quot;The National Academy of Sciences got all pushed out of shape when I left,&quot; Michel said. &quot;I think that was largely influential in Jack getting his flight. When it looked like their primary idea of getting a scientist to the moon was going to flop, they finally started pushing their weight around.&quot; (Full interview at [http://news.rice.edu/2009/07/17/from-astrophysicist-to-astronaut-and-back/ http://news.rice.edu/2009/07/17/from-astrophysicist-to-astronaut-and-back/])}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That opened the question of who would fill the other two Apollo 17 slots: the rest of the Apollo 15 backup crew ([[Richard F. Gordon Jr.|Dick Gordon]] and [[Vance D. Brand|Vance Brand]]) or the Apollo 14 backup crew (minus Engle)? NASA Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]] ultimately chose Cernan and Evans.&lt;ref name=&quot;a17pre&quot; /&gt;

The Apollo 15 prime crew received the backup assignment since this was to be the last lunar mission and the backup crew would not rotate to another mission. However, when the [[Apollo 15 postage stamp incident]] became public in early 1972 the crew was reprimanded by NASA and the [[United States Air Force]] (they were active duty officers). Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton removed them from flight status and replaced them with Young and Duke from the [[Apollo 16]] prime crew and Roosa from the Apollo 14 prime and Apollo 16 backup crews.&lt;ref name=15dropped&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Astronauts Quitting Jobs And Military|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=plwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6wEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7112,4977778&amp;dq=roosa+apollo+17|accessdate=August 26, 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=May 24, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1994|Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1994]], p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mission insignia ===
[[File:Apollo 17 Flown Silver Robbins Medallion (SN-F39).jpg|thumb|Apollo 17 space-flown silver [[NASA space-flown Robbins medallions of the Apollo missions|Robbins medallion]]]]

The insignia's most prominent feature is an image of the Greek sun god [[Apollo]] backdropped by a rendering of an [[Bald eagle|American eagle]], the red bars on the eagle mirroring those on the [[flag of the United States]]. Three white stars above the red bars represent the three crewmen of the mission. The background includes the Moon, the planet [[Saturn]], and a galaxy or nebula. The wing of the eagle partially overlays the Moon, suggesting man's established presence there. The gaze of Apollo and the direction of the eagle's motion embody man's intention to explore further destinations in space.&lt;ref name=insignia&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Mission Insignias|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-18_Mission_Insignias.htm|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 25, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110721234247/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-18_Mission_Insignias.htm| archivedate=July 21, 2011| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patch includes, along with the colors of the U.S. flag (red, white, and blue), the color gold, representative of a &quot;golden age&quot; of spaceflight that was to begin with Apollo 17. The image of Apollo in the mission insignia is a rendering of the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'' sculpture. The insignia was designed by [[Robert McCall (artist)|Robert McCall]], with input from the crew.&lt;ref name=insignia/&gt;

== Planning and training ==
[[File:Apollo 17 - Gene Cernan training in Sudbury.jpg|thumb|right|Gene Cernan participates in geology training in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]], in May 1972]]

Like Apollo 15 and Apollo 16, Apollo 17 was slated to be a &quot;[[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|J-mission]]&quot;, an Apollo mission type that featured lunar surface stays of three days, higher scientific capability, and the usage of the Lunar Roving Vehicle. Since Apollo 17 was to be the final lunar landing of the Apollo program, high-priority landing sites that had not been visited previously were given consideration for potential exploration. A landing in the crater [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] was considered, but was ultimately rejected because [[Apollo 12]] had already obtained samples from that impact, and three other Apollo expeditions had already visited the vicinity of Mare Imbrium. A landing in the lunar highlands near the crater [[Tycho (lunar crater)|Tycho]] was also considered, but was rejected because of the rough terrain found there and a landing on the [[Far side of the Moon|lunar far side]] in the crater [[Tsiolkovskiy (crater)|Tsiolkovskiy]] was rejected due to technical considerations and the operational costs of maintaining communication during surface operations. A landing in a region southwest of [[Mare Crisium]] was also considered, but rejected on the grounds that a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft could easily access the site; [[Luna 21]] eventually did so shortly after the Apollo 17 site selection was made.&lt;ref name=lpi&gt;{{cite web|title=Landing Site Overview|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_17/landing_site/|work=Apollo 17 Mission|publisher=[[Lunar and Planetary Institute]]|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elimination of several sites, three sites made the final consideration for Apollo 17: [[Alphonsus (crater)|Alphonsus crater]], [[Gassendi (crater)|Gassendi crater]], and the Taurus-Littrow valley. In making the final landing site decision, mission planners took into consideration the primary objectives for Apollo 17: obtaining old highlands material from a substantial distance from Mare Imbrium, sampling material from young volcanic activity (i.e., less than three billion years), and having minimal ground overlap with the orbital ground tracks of Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 to maximize the amount of new data obtained.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

The Taurus-Littrow site was selected with the prediction that the crew would be able to obtain samples of old highland material from the remnants of a landslide event that occurred on the south wall of the valley and the possibility of relatively young, explosive volcanic activity in the area. Although the valley is similar to the [[Hadley–Apennine (Moon)|landing site of Apollo 15]] in that it is on the border of a [[lunar mare]], the advantages of Taurus-Littrow were believed to outweigh the drawbacks, thus leading to its selection as the Apollo 17 landing site.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

As with previous lunar landings, the Apollo 17 astronauts underwent an extensive training program that included training to collect samples on the surface, usage of the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|spacesuits]], navigation in the Lunar Roving Vehicle, field geology training, survival training, [[splashdown]] and recovery training, and equipment training.&lt;ref name=training&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Betsy|title=The Incredible Things NASA Did to Train Apollo Astronauts|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/moon-landing-gallery/?pid=1688&amp;viewall=true|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Science]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |accessdate=August 23, 2011|date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Launch and outbound trip ===
[[File:Apollo 17 liftoff.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 17 launches on December 7, 1972]]

Apollo 17 was the last crewed Saturn{{nbsp}}V launch and the only night launch. The launch was delayed by two hours and forty minutes due to an automatic cutoff in the launch sequencer at the T-30 second mark in the countdown. The issue was quickly determined to be a minor technical error. The clock was reset and held at the T-22 minute mark while technicians worked around the malfunction in order to continue with the launch. This pause was the only launch delay in the Apollo program caused by this type of hardware failure. The countdown then resumed, and the liftoff occurred at 12:33&amp;nbsp;am [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=launchops&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 17 Launch Operations|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch23-7.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 500,000 people were estimated to have observed the launch in the immediate vicinity of Kennedy Space Center, despite the early morning hour. The launch was visible as far away as {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}}; observers in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], saw a &quot;red streak&quot; crossing the northern sky.&lt;ref name=launchops/&gt;

At 3:46&amp;nbsp;am EST, the [[S-IVB]] third stage was [[Trans-lunar injection|re-ignited]] to propel the spacecraft towards the Moon.&lt;ref name=astronautix&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=Apollo 17|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo17.htm|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=August 22, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812193502/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo17.htm|archivedate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately 2:47&amp;nbsp;pm EST on December 10, the [[service propulsion system]] engine on the CSM ignited to slow down the CSM/LM stack into lunar orbit. Following orbit insertion and orbital stabilization, the crew began preparations for landing in the Taurus-Littrow valley.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

=== Moon landing ===
After separating from the CSM, the LM ''Challenger'' and its crew of two, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, adjusted their orbit and began preparations for the descent to Taurus-Littrow. While Cernan and Schmitt prepared for landing, Command Module Pilot Ron Evans remained in orbit to take observations, perform experiments and await the return of his crew-mates a few days later.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjland&gt;{{cite web|title=Landing at Taurus-Littrow|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.landing.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after completing their preparations for landing, Cernan and Schmitt began their descent to the Taurus-Littrow valley on the lunar surface. Several minutes after the descent phase was initiated, the LM pitched over, giving the crew their first look at the landing site during the descent phase and allowing Cernan to guide the spacecraft to a desirable landing target while Schmitt provided data from the flight computer essential for landing. The LM touched down on the lunar surface at 2:55&amp;nbsp;pm EST on December 11. Shortly thereafter, the two astronauts began re-configuring the LM for their stay on the surface and began preparations for the first moonwalk of the mission, or EVA-1.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjland/&gt;

=== Lunar surface ===
[[File:Apollo 17 Cernan on moon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eugene Cernan]] on the lunar surface, December 13, 1972]]

Over three moonwalks ([[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]]), Cernan and Schmitt deployed the LRV, the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) and seismic explosive charges.  They parked the LRV at nine planned geological survey stations to collect samples and make observations.  Additionally, twelve short sampling stops were made at Schmitt's discretion while riding the LRV, during which the astronauts rapidly collected lunar material without dismounting.&lt;ref name=&quot;geostations&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_17/surface_opp/ |title=Apollo 17 Mission: Surface Operations Overview |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute |website=Universities Space Research Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first lunar excursion began four hours after landing, at 6:54&amp;nbsp;p.m. EST on December 11. The first task was to offload the rover and other equipment from the LM. While working near the rover, Cernan caught his hammer under the right-rear fender extension, accidentally breaking it off. A similar incident occurred on Apollo 16 as [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] maneuvered around the rover. Although this was not a mission-critical issue, the loss of the part caused Cernan and Schmitt to be covered with dust thrown up when the rover was in motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;brokenfender&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ALSEP Off-load|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.alsepoff.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=August 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew attempted a short-lived fix using [[duct tape]], attaching a map to the damaged fender.  However lunar dust stuck to the tape's surface, preventing it from adhering properly.  The crew deployed the ALSEP just west of the landing site. This task done, they departed for the first geological survey station: [[Steno-Apollo (crater)|Steno crater]] to the south of the landing site.  The astronauts gathered {{convert|14|kg|lbs}} of samples, took seven gravimeter measurements, and deployed two explosive packages.  The latter were detonated remotely to test [[geophone]]s placed by the astronauts, and also [[seismometers]] left during previous missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brzostowski |first1=Matthew |last2=Brzostowski |first2=Adam |date=April 2009 |title=Archiving the Apollo active seismic data |url=http://tle.geoscienceworld.org/content/28/4/414.abstract |journal=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists#Journals, books, and newsletters|The Leading Edge]] |location=Tulsa, OK |publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=414–416 |doi=10.1190/1.3112756 |issn=1070-485X |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EVA ended after seven hours and twelve minutes.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjeva1&gt;{{cite web|title=The First EVA|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=August 22, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716040118/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.html| archivedate=July 16, 2011| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronauts were at the extremity of their &quot;walkback limit&quot;, a safety constraint meant to ensure that they could walk back to the LM if for whatever reason the rover failed.  They began a return trip, traveling northeast.  Stopping at station 4—[[Shorty (crater)|Shorty crater]]—the astronauts discovered orange soil, which proved to be very small beads of volcanic glass formed over 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;cortright&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cortright |editor1-first=Edgar M. |title=Apollo Expeditions to the Moon |publisher=Dover |year=2019 |page=276 |ISBN=9780486836522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final stop before returning to the LM was [[Camelot (crater)|Camelot crater]]; throughout the sojourn, the astronauts collected {{convert|34|kg|lbs}} of samples, took another seven gravimeter measurements, and deployed three more explosive packages.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;  Concluding the EVA at seven hours and thirty-seven minutes, Cernan and Schmitt had completed the longest-duration EVA in history to-date, traveling further away from a spacecraft and covering more ground on a planetary body during a single EVA than any other spacefarers.&lt;ref name=&quot;eva table&quot; /&gt; Once the LM was repressurized, CAPCOM Bob Parker was particularly impressed, saying: &quot;Absolutely outstanding.  I can't say more than that.  And I mean it from the bottom of my heart or the bottom of my soul or something, my conscience.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;transcript&quot; /&gt;{{rp|1363}}

The third moonwalk, the last of the Apollo program, began at 5:25&amp;nbsp;pm EST on December 13.  Cernan and Schmitt rode the rover northeast of the landing site, exploring the base of the North Massif and the Sculptured Hills.  Stopping at station 6, they examined a house-sized split boulder dubbed [[Tracy's Rock]] (or Split Rock), after Cernan's daughter.  The ninth and final planned station was conducted at [[Van Serg (crater)|Van Serg crater]].  The crew collected {{convert|66|kg|lbs}} of lunar samples and took another nine gravimeter measurements. Before concluding the moonwalk, the crew collected a [[breccia]] rock, dedicating it to the nations of Earth, several of which were represented in [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Houston (1965–present)|Mission Control Center]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], at the time.  A plaque located on the LM, commemorating the achievements made during the Apollo program, was then unveiled. Before reentering the LM for the final time, Gene Cernan expressed his thoughts:&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

{{quote|text= ...{{nbsp}}I'm on the surface; and, as I take man's last step from the surface, back home for some time to come - but we believe not too long into the future - I'd like to just [say] what I believe history will record.

Cernan then followed Schmitt into the LM; the final lunar excursion had a duration of seven hours and fifteen minutes.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

=== Return to Earth ===

Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt successfully lifted off from the lunar surface in the ascent stage of the LM on December 14, at 5:55&amp;nbsp;pm EST. After a successful rendezvous and docking with Ron Evans in the CSM in orbit, the crew transferred equipment and lunar samples between the LM and the CSM for return to Earth. Following this, the LM ascent stage was sealed off and jettisoned at 1:31&amp;nbsp;am on December 15. The ascent stage was then deliberately crashed into the Moon in a collision recorded by [[seismometer]]s deployed on Apollo 17 and previous Apollo expeditions.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjreturn&gt;{{cite web|title=Return to Earth|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.homeward.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the return to Earth, Evans performed a 65 minute EVA to retrieve film cassettes from the service module's scientific instrument module (SIM) bay, with assistance from Schmitt who remained at the command module's hatch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drew&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drewexmachina.com/2017/12/17/a-history-of-deep-space-evas/ |title=A History of Deep Space EVAs |last=LePage |first=Andrew |date=December 17, 2017 |website=Drew Ex Machina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=astronautix /&gt;  At approximately 160,000 nautical miles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/AS17_PAO.PDF |title=Apollo 17 Transcripts: Apollo 17 (PAO) Spacecraft Commentary) |website=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1730}} (184,000 mi; 296,000 km) from Earth, it was the third &quot;deep space&quot; EVA in history, performed at great distance from any planetary body.  As of {{year}}, it remains one of only three such EVAs, all performed during Apollo's J-missions under similar circumstances.  It was the last EVA of the Apollo program.

On December 19, the crew jettisoned the no-longer-needed SM, leaving only the CM for return to Earth. The Apollo 17 spacecraft [[Atmospheric entry|reentered Earth's atmosphere]] and landed safely in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at 2:25&amp;nbsp;p.m., {{convert|6.4|km|mi|sp=us}} from the recovery ship, {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}. Cernan, Evans, and Schmitt were then retrieved by a recovery helicopter and were safely aboard the recovery ship 52 minutes after landing.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjreturn/&gt;

Apollo 17 was the third mission (the others being Apollo 15 and Apollo 16) to make use of a [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]. The LRV, in addition to being used by the astronauts for transport from station to station on the mission's three moonwalks, was used to transport the astronauts' tools, communications equipment, and samples.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt; The Apollo 17 LRV was also used to carry experiments unique to the mission, such as the Traverse Gravimeter and Surface Electrical Properties experiment.&lt;ref name=alsjtge/&gt;&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Electrical Properties|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_17/experiments/sep/|work=Apollo 17 Science Experiments|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo 17 LRV traveled a cumulative distance of approximately {{convert|35.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a total drive time of about four hours and twenty-six minutes; the greatest distance Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt traveled from the lunar module was about {{convert|7.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=lunarrover&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_lrv.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=August 26, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715222253/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_lrv.html| archivedate= July 15, 2011 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological cosmic ray experiment ===
{{Main|Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey}}

Apollo 17 included a biological cosmic ray experiment (BIOCORE), carrying [[Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey|five mice]] that had been implanted with radiation monitors to see whether they suffered damage from cosmic rays.&lt;ref name=biocoreSPP330&gt;{{cite book |author = Bailey.

The five pocket mice (''[[Perognathus longimembris]]'') were implanted with radiation monitors under their scalps and flown on the mission. The species was chosen because it was well-documented, small, easy to maintain in an isolated state (not requiring drinking water for the duration of the mission and with highly concentrated waste), and for its ability to withstand environmental stress. Four of the five mice survived the flight; the cause of death of the fifth mouse was not determined.&lt;ref name=biocoreSPP330/&gt;

The study found [[lesion]]s in the scalp itself and liver. The scalp lesions and liver lesions appeared to be unrelated to one another, and were not thought to be the result of cosmic rays. No damage was found in the mice's retinas or viscera.&lt;ref name=biocoreSPP330/&gt; At the time of the publication of the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report, the mouse brains had not yet been examined.&lt;ref name=biocoreSPP330/&gt; However, subsequent studies showed no significant effect on the brains.&lt;ref name=bioCoreSP368&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haymaker |first1=Webb |last2=Look |first2=Bonne C. |last3=Benton |first3=Eugene V. |last4=Simmonds |first4=Richard C. |date=January 1, 1975 |chapter=The Apollo 17 Pocket Mouse Experiment (Biocore) |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s4ch4.htm |editor1-last=Johnston |editor1-first=Richard S. |editor2-last=Berry |editor2-first=Charles A. |editor3-last=Dietlein |editor3-first=Lawrence F. |title=SP-368 Biomedical Results of Apollo (SP-368) |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/sp368.htm |publisher=Lyndon B.

=== Scientific instrument module ===
[[File:Apollo 17 CSM SIM bay.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 17 SIM bay on the service module ''America'', seen from the Lunar Module ''Challenger'' in orbit around the Moon]]

Sector one of the Apollo 17 SM contained the scientific instrument module (SIM) bay. The SIM bay housed three experiments for use in lunar orbit: a lunar sounder, an [[infrared]] scanning [[radiometer]], and a [[Ultraviolet|far-ultraviolet]] spectrometer. A mapping camera, panoramic camera, and a [[Lidar|laser altimeter]] were also included in the SIM bay.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The lunar sounder beamed [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] impulses toward the lunar surface, which were designed with the objective of obtaining data to assist in developing a geological model of the interior of the Moon to an approximate depth of {{convert|1.3|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The infrared scanning radiometer was designed with the objective of generating a temperature map of the lunar surface to aid in locating surface features such as rock fields, structural differences in the [[Internal structure of the Moon|lunar crust]], and volcanic activity.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The far-ultraviolet spectrometer was to be used to obtain data pertaining to the composition, density, and constituency of the [[Atmosphere of the Moon|lunar atmosphere]]. The spectrometer was also designed to detect far-UV radiation emitted by the Sun that has been reflected off the lunar surface.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The laser altimeter was designed with the intention of measuring the altitude of the spacecraft above the lunar surface within approximately {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}}, and providing altitude information to the panoramic and mapping cameras.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

=== Light-flash phenomenon ===
{{main|Cosmic ray visual phenomena}}

Throughout the Apollo lunar missions, the crew members observed light flashes that penetrated closed eyelids. These flashes, described as &quot;streaks&quot; or &quot;specks&quot; of light, were usually observed by astronauts while the spacecraft was darkened during a sleep period. These flashes, while not observed on the lunar surface, would average about two per minute and were observed by the crew members during the trip out to the Moon, back to Earth, and in lunar orbit.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The Apollo 17 crew conducted an experiment, also conducted on Apollo 16, with the objective of linking these light flashes with [[cosmic ray]]s. As part of an experiment conducted by NASA and the [[University of Houston]], one astronaut wore a device that recorded the time, strength, and path of high-energy atomic particles that penetrated the device. Evidence supports the hypothesis that these flashes occur when charged particles travel through the [[retina]] in the eye.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;&lt;ref name=lightflash&gt;{{cite book |last1=Osborne |first1=W.

=== Traverse gravimeter ===
Apollo 17 was the only Apollo lunar landing mission to carry the Traverse [[Gravimeter]] Experiment (TGE), built by [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|Draper Laboratory]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. As gravimeters had proven to be useful in the geologic investigation of the Earth, the objective of this experiment was to determine the feasibility of using the same techniques on the Moon to learn about its internal structure. The gravimeter was used to obtain relative gravity measurements at the landing site in the immediate vicinity of the lunar module, as well as various locations on the mission's traverse routes.

The TGE was carried on the Lunar Roving Vehicle; measurements were taken by the astronauts while the LRV was not in motion or after the gravimeter was placed on the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;presskit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mira.hq.nasa.gov/history/ws/hdmshrc/all/main/DDD/17980.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327002922/https://mira.hq.nasa.gov/history/ws/hdmshrc/all/main/DDD/17980.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 27, 2009 |title=Apollo 17 Press Kit |date=November 26, 1972 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |format=PDF |id=72-220K |accessdate=August 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of twenty-six measurements were taken with the TGE during the mission's three moonwalks, with productive results. As part of the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP), the astronauts also deployed the Lunar Surface Gravimeter, a similar experiment, which ultimately failed to function properly.&lt;ref name=alsjtge/&gt;

=== Surface electrical properties experiment ===
Apollo 17 was the only lunar surface expedition to include the surface electrical properties (SEP) experiment. The experiment included two major components: a transmitting antenna deployed near the lunar module and a receiving antenna located on the Lunar Roving Vehicle. At different stops during the mission's traverses, electrical signals traveled from the transmitting device, through the ground, and were received at the LRV. The electrical properties of the [[lunar soil]] could be determined by comparison of the transmitted and received electrical signals. The results of this experiment, which are consistent with [[Moon rock|lunar rock]] composition, show that the top {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the Moon are extremely dry.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

The crew of Apollo 17 carried a small [[Panamanian flag]] to the Moon during the mission.&lt;ref name=ellas/&gt; In 1973, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] gave the flag and a Moon rock to the government of [[Panama]].&lt;ref name=ellas&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Así recuerdo la llegada del hombre a la Luna Entrevistas, Mundo Ellas |url=https://www.ellas.pa/mundo-ellas/asi-recuerdo-la-llegada-del-hombre-a-la-luna/ |work=Ellas |date=2019-07-26 |accessdate=2019-12-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191227032425/https://www.ellas.pa/mundo-ellas/asi-recuerdo-la-llegada-del-hombre-a-la-luna/ |archivedate=2019-12-26 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depiction of mission in fiction and popular culture ==
Portions of the Apollo 17 mission are dramatized in the 1998 [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|&quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune.&quot;]]&lt;ref name=hbomin&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Earth to the Moon - Season 1, Episode 12: Le Voyage Dans La Lune|url=http://www.tv.com/from-the-earth-to-the-moon/le-voyage-dans-la-lune/episode/159367/summary.html|work=[[TV.com]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|location=San Francisco, CA|accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prologue to the 1999 novel ''[[Back to the Moon]]'', by [[Homer Hickam]], begins with a dramatized depiction of the end of the second Apollo 17 EVA. The orange soil then becomes the major driver of the plot of the rest of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hickam 1999|Hickam 1999]], pp. 3–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 novel ''[[Tyrannosaur Canyon]]'' by [[Douglas Preston]] opens with a depiction of the Apollo 17 moonwalks using quotes taken from the official mission transcript.&lt;ref name=tycanyon&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Patrick|title=Rex Marks the Spot|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/18/AR2005091801146.html|accessdate=August 24, 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 19, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there have been fictional astronauts in film, literature and television who have been described as &quot;the last man to walk on the Moon&quot;, implying they were crew members on Apollo 17. One such character was [[Steve Austin (fictional character)|Steve Austin]] in the television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. In the 1972 novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'', upon which the series was based, Austin remembers watching the Earth &quot;fall away during Apollo XVII.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Caidin 1972|Caidin 1972]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1998 film ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' fictional astronaut Spurgeon &quot;Fish&quot; Tanner, portrayed by [[Robert Duvall]], was described at a Presidential press conference as the &quot;last man to walk on the Moon&quot; by the President of the United States, portrayed by [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subzin.com/search.php?title=Deep+Impact&amp;imdb=&amp;q=You+were+the+last+man+to+walk+on+the+moon%2C+weren%27t+you&amp;search_sort=Popularity&amp;genre=-1&amp;type=All |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130724114616/http://www.subzin.com/search.php?title=Deep+Impact&amp;imdb=&amp;q=You+were+the+last+man+to+walk+on+the+moon,+weren't+you&amp;search_sort=Popularity&amp;genre=-1&amp;type=All |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 24, 2013 |title=Deep Impact quotes |work=Subzin.com |accessdate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anime ''[[Aldnoah.Zero]]'', the Apollo 17 mission locates an ancient transporter gate leading to Mars left by an unknown, extinct alien race. This discovery is the divergence point for the story's alternative history.

The song &quot;[[Contact (Daft Punk song)|Contact]]&quot; from Daft Punk includes audio from the Apollo 17 mission, courtesy of NASA and Captain Eugene Cernan.

The song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; by [[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]] also includes audio of Commander Eugene A. Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot Harrison Schmitt from the mission.
