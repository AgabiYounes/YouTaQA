'''Apollo 12''' was the sixth crewed flight in the United States [[Apollo program]] and the second to land on the [[Moon]]. It was launched on November 14, 1969, from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]], four months after [[Apollo 11]]. Commander [[Pete Conrad|Charles &quot;Pete&quot; Conrad]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module]] Pilot [[Alan Bean|Alan L. Bean]] performed just over one day and seven hours of lunar surface activity while Command Module Pilot [[Richard F. Gordon Jr.|Richard F. Gordon]] remained in lunar orbit. The landing site for the mission was located in the southeastern portion of the [[Ocean of Storms]].

On November 19 Conrad and Bean achieved a precise landing at their expected location within walking distance of the site of the [[Surveyor 3]] robotic probe, which had landed on April 20, 1967. They carried the first color television camera to the lunar surface on an Apollo flight, but transmission was lost after Bean accidentally pointed the camera at the Sun and the camera's sensor was destroyed. On one of two moonwalks they visited Surveyor 3 and removed some parts for return to Earth.

Lunar Module ''Intrepid'' lifted off from the Moon on November 20 and docked with the command module, which then, after completing its 45th lunar orbit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_12a_Summary.htm |title=Apollo 12 – The Sixth Mission: The Second Lunar Landing |publisher=NASA |location=US |access-date=June 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveled back to Earth. The Apollo 12 mission ended on November 24 with a successful [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]].

Commander [[Pete Conrad]] flew on [[Gemini 5]] in 1965, and as command pilot on [[Gemini 11]] in 1966. Command Module Pilot [[Richard F. Gordon Jr.]] flew with Conrad on Gemini 11. Originally, Conrad's Lunar Module pilot was [[Clifton Williams|Clifton C.

===Launch and transfer===
[[File:Apollo 12 launches from Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|left|Apollo 12 launches from Kennedy Space Center, November 14, 1969]]

Apollo 12 launched on schedule from Kennedy Space Center, under completely overcast rainy skies, encountering wind speeds of {{Convert|151.7|kn||abbr=}} during ascent, the highest of any Apollo mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-15_Launch_Weather.htm|title=Launch Weather|website=history.nasa.gov|access-date=2019-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightning struck the Saturn V 36.5 seconds after lift-off, triggered by the vehicle itself, discharging down to the Earth through the ionized exhaust plume. Protective circuits on the [[fuel cell]]s in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module (SM)]] detected overloads and took all three fuel cells offline, along with much of the [[Apollo command and service module|command and service module (CSM)]] instrumentation. A second strike at 52 seconds knocked out the &quot;8-ball&quot; [[attitude indicator]]. The [[telemetry]] stream at [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Houston (1965–present)|Mission Control]] was garbled. However, the Saturn V continued to fly normally; the strikes had not affected the [[Saturn V instrument unit]] guidance system, which functions independently from the CSM.

The loss of all three fuel cells put the CSM entirely on batteries, which were unable to maintain normal 75-ampere launch loads on the 28-volt DC bus. One of the [[Inverter (electrical)|AC inverter]]s dropped offline. These power supply problems lit nearly every warning light on the control panel and caused much of the instrumentation to malfunction.

[[Flight controller#EECOM|Electrical, Environmental and Consumables Manager (EECOM)]] [[John Aaron]] remembered the telemetry failure pattern from an earlier test when a power supply malfunctioned in the CSM signal conditioning electronics (SCE), which converted raw signals from instrumentation to standard voltages for the spacecraft instrument displays and telemetry encoders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kranz |first1=Eugene F. |authorlink1=Gene Kranz |last2=Covington |first2=James Otis |title=What Made Apollo a Success? |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-287/sp287.htm |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |origyear=&quot;A series of eight articles reprinted by permission from the March 1970 issue of ''Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics'', a publication of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]].&quot; |year=1971 |work=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=69849598 |id=NASA SP-287 |chapter=Flight Control in the Apollo Program |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-287/ch5.htm}} Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaron made a call, &quot;Flight, EECOM. Try SCE to Aux&quot;, which switched the SCE to a backup power supply. The switch was fairly obscure, and neither [[Flight Director]] [[Gerald D. Griffin|Gerald Griffin]], [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]] [[Gerald P. Carr|Gerald Carr]], nor Mission Commander Pete Conrad immediately recognized it. Lunar Module Pilot Alan Bean, flying in the right seat as the spacecraft systems engineer, remembered the SCE switch from a training incident a year earlier when the same failure had been [[simulated]]. Aaron's quick thinking and Bean's memory saved what could have been an [[Apollo abort modes|aborted mission]], and earned Aaron the reputation of a &quot;steely-eyed missile man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lost Moon 1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kluger |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Lovell |first2=James |title=Lost Moon |date=October 1994 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-395-67029-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/lostmoonperilous00love }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bean put the fuel cells back on line, and with telemetry restored, the launch continued successfully. Once in Earth [[parking orbit]], the crew carefully checked out their spacecraft before re-igniting the [[S-IVB]] third stage for [[trans-lunar injection]]. The lightning strikes had caused no serious permanent damage.

Initially, it was feared that the lightning strike could have caused the explosive bolts that open the Command Module's parachute compartment to fire prematurely, rendering the parachutes useless which would have made safe return impossible. The decision was made not to share this with the astronauts since there was little that could be done to verify or resolve the problem if it existed. The parachutes deployed and functioned normally at the end of the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Apollo : the mission to land a man on the Moon|last=Cimino |first=Al|publisher=|isbn=978-0-7858-3703-9|location=New York, NY|pages=150|oclc=1056779871|date = May 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After LM separation, the S-IVB was intended to fly into solar orbit. The S-IVB auxiliary propulsion system was fired, and the remaining propellants vented to slow it down to fly past the Moon's trailing edge (the Apollo spacecraft always approached the Moon's leading edge). The Moon's gravity would then slingshot the stage into solar orbit. However, a small error in the state vector in the Saturn's guidance system caused the S-IVB to fly past the Moon at too high an altitude to achieve Earth escape velocity. It remained in a semi-stable Earth orbit after passing the Moon on November 18, 1969. It finally escaped Earth orbit in 1971 but was briefly recaptured in Earth orbit 31 years later. It was discovered by amateur astronomer [[William Kwong Yu Yeung|Bill Yeung]] who gave it the temporary designation [[J002E3]] before it was determined to be an artificial object.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news136.html |title=J002E3: An Update |publisher=nasa.gov |first1=Paul |last1=Chodas |first2=Steve |last2=Chesley|date=October 9, 2002 |accessdate=September 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030503111617/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news136.html |archive-date=May 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jorgensen&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jorgensen |first1=K. |last2=Rivkin |first2=A. |last3=Binzel |first3=R. |last4=Whitely |first4=R. |last5=Hergenrother |first5=C. |last6=Chodas |first6=P. |last7=Chesley |first7=S. |last8=Vilas |first8=F |title=Observations of J002E3: Possible Discovery of an Apollo Rocket Body |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |date =May 2003 |volume=35 |page=981 |bibcode = 2003DPS....35.3602J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo 12 mission landed on November 19, 1969, on an area of the Ocean of Storms (Latin ''Oceanus Procellarum'') that had been visited earlier by several robotic missions (''[[Luna 5]]'', [[Surveyor 3]], and [[Ranger 7]]). The [[International Astronomical Union]], recognizing this, christened this region ''[[Mare Cognitum]] (Known Sea)''. The [[Selenographic coordinates|Lunar coordinates]] of the landing site were 3.01239° S latitude, 23.42157° W longitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/imagery/apollo/landsites.htm |title=Landing Sites |work=The Apollo Program |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The landing site would thereafter be listed as ''Statio Cognitum'' on lunar maps. Conrad and Bean did not formally name their landing site, though Conrad nicknamed the intended touchdown area &quot;Pete's Parking Lot&quot;.

The second lunar landing was an exercise in precision targeting, which would be needed for future Apollo missions. Most of the descent was automatic, with manual control assumed by Conrad during the final few hundred feet of descent. Unlike [[Apollo 11]], where [[Neil Armstrong]] had to use the manual control to direct his lander downrange of the computer's target, which was strewn with boulders, Apollo 12 succeeded in landing at its intended target – within walking distance of the ''Surveyor 3'' probe, which had landed on the Moon in April 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin 1995&quot;&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first – and, to date, only – occasion in which humans have &quot;caught up&quot; to a probe sent to land on another world.

Conrad actually landed ''Intrepid'' {{convert|580|ft|m|round=5|0}} short of &quot;Pete's Parking Lot&quot;, because it looked rougher during final approach than anticipated, and was a little under {{convert|1180|ft|m|round=5|0}} from Surveyor{{nbsp}}3, a distance that was chosen to eliminate the possibility of lunar dust (being kicked up by ''Intrepid's'' descent engine during landing) from covering Surveyor{{nbsp}}3.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1969&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=1969 Year in Review: Apollo 11 |url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1969/Apollo-11/12303189849225-2/ |work=UPI.com |publisher=[[United Press International]] |year=1969 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the actual touchdown point – approximately {{convert|600|ft|m|round=5|0}} from Surveyor{{nbsp}}3 – did cause high velocity sandblasting of the probe. It was later determined that the sandblasting removed more dust than it delivered onto the Surveyor, because the probe was covered by a thin layer that gave it a tan hue as observed by the astronauts, and every portion of the surface exposed to the direct sandblasting was lightened back toward the original white color through the removal of lunar dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Immer |first1=Christopher A. |last2=Metzger |first2=Philip |last3=Hintze |first3=Paul E. |last4=Nick|first4=Andrew |last5=Horan |first5=Ryan |date=February 2011 |title=Apollo 12 Lunar Module Exhaust Plume Impingement on Lunar ''Surveyor III'' |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=211 |issue=2 |pages=1089–1102 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |bibcode=2011Icar..211.1089I |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.013 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pete Conrad First Steps on Moon Quote.ogg|thumb|Pete Conrad's quote while descending the LEM ladder]]
When Conrad, who was somewhat shorter than Neil Armstrong, stepped onto the lunar surface, his first words were &quot;Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin 1995&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=YEEIJYrXn9s|title=&quot;Apollo 12 First Steps&quot;|link=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not an off-the-cuff remark: Conrad had made a {{USD|500}} bet with reporter [[Oriana Fallaci]] he would say these words, after she had queried whether NASA had instructed Neil Armstrong what to say as he stepped onto the Moon. Conrad later said he was never able to collect the money.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 1995]], p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Conrad: Pioneer of the Final Frontier |first=Kathy |last=Sawyer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/july99/conrad10.htm |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=C1 |date=July 10, 1999 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve the quality of television pictures from the Moon, a color camera was carried on Apollo 12 (unlike the monochrome camera on Apollo 11). Unfortunately, when Bean carried the camera to the place near the LM where it was to be set up, he inadvertently pointed it directly into the Sun, destroying the [[Apollo TV camera#Westinghouse Lunar Color Camera|Secondary Electron Conduction (SEC) tube]]. Television coverage of this mission was thus terminated almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html |title=One Small Step |year=1995 |editor-last=Jones |editor-first=Eric M. |work=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 7, 2011}} Note at 109:57:55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo 12 successfully landed within walking distance of the [[Surveyor 3]] probe. Conrad and Bean removed pieces of the probe to be taken back to Earth for analysis. It is claimed that the common [[bacterium]] ''[[Streptococcus mitis]]'' was found to have accidentally contaminated the spacecraft's camera prior to launch and survived dormant in this harsh environment for two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/1998/ast01sep98_1/ |title=Earth Microbes on the Moon |last=Noever |first=David |date=September 1, 1998 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding has since been disputed: see [[Reports of Streptococcus mitis on the Moon|Reports of ''Streptococcus mitis'' on the Moon]].

Astronauts Conrad and Bean also collected rocks and set up equipment that took measurements of the Moon's [[Lunar seismology|seismicity]], [[solar wind]] flux and [[magnetic field]], and relayed the measurements to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_12/experiments/ |title=Apollo 12 Science Experiments |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute |access-date=April 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instruments were part of the first complete nuclear-powered [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|ALSEP]] station set up by astronauts on the Moon to relay long-term data from the lunar surface. The instruments on Apollo 11 were not as extensive or designed to operate long term. The astronauts also took photographs, although by accident Bean left several rolls of exposed film on the lunar surface. Meanwhile, Gordon, on board the ''Yankee Clipper'' in lunar orbit, took multi-spectral photographs of the surface.

[[Image:a12-plaque.jpg|right|thumb|Replica of the plaque attached to the Apollo 12 LM]]

The [[lunar plaque]] attached to the descent stage of ''Intrepid'' is unique in that unlike the other plaques, it (a) did not have a depiction of the Earth, and (b) it was textured differently: The other plaques had black lettering on polished stainless steel while the Apollo 12 plaque had the lettering in polished stainless steel while the background was brushed flat.

===Return===
[[File:Apollo 12 view of Solar Eclipse (5052129615).jpg|thumb|A solar eclipse seen from Apollo 12]]
[[File:SH-3D of HS-4 flies over Apollo 12 command module near USS Hornet (CVS-12) on 24 November 1969.jpg|thumb|Apollo 12 recovery by {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}]]

''Intrepid's'' ascent stage was dropped (per normal procedures) after Conrad and Bean rejoined Gordon in orbit. It impacted the Moon on November 20, 1969, at {{Coord|3.94|S|21.20|W|type:event_globe:moon|name=Apollo 12 Intrepid lunar module impact}}. The seismometers the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the vibrations for more than an hour.

The crew stayed an extra day in lunar orbit taking photographs, for a total lunar surface stay of 31 and a half hours and a total time in lunar orbit of eighty-nine hours.

On the return flight to Earth after leaving lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo 12 witnessed (and photographed) a [[solar eclipse]], though this one was of the Earth eclipsing the Sun.

===Splashdown===
''Yankee Clipper'' returned to Earth on November 24, 1969 at 20:58 [[UTC]] (3:58pm [[Eastern Time Zone (North America)|EST]], 10:58am [[Hawaii-Aleutian time zone|HST]]), in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 500 nautical miles (800&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[American Samoa]]. During [[splashdown]], a [[16 mm film]] camera dislodged from storage and struck Bean in the forehead, rendering him briefly unconscious. He suffered a mild concussion and needed six stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a12/A12_MissionReport.pdf |title=Apollo 12 Mission Report |date=March 1970 |work=Apollo 12 Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |id=MSC-01855 |accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recovery by {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}, they were flown to [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] for a reception, before being flown on a [[C-141]] cargo plane to [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]].

==Stunts and mementos==
* Alan Bean smuggled a camera-shutter [[self-timer]] device on to the mission with the intent of taking a [[Selfie|photograph with himself]], Pete Conrad and the Surveyor{{nbsp}}3 probe in the frame. As the timer was not part of their standard equipment, such an image would have thrown post-mission photo analysts into confusion over how the photo was taken. However, the self-timer was misplaced during the [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA) and the plan was never executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moonshots and snapshots of Project Apollo : a rare photographic history|last=Bisney, John|date=2015|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|others=Pickering, J.

* As one of the many pranks pulled during the friendly rivalry between the all-Navy prime crew and the all-Air Force backup crew, the Apollo 12 backup crew managed to insert into the astronauts' lunar checklist (attached to the wrists of Conrad's and Bean's [[space suit]]s) reduced-sized pictures of ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmates, surprising Conrad and Bean when they looked through the checklist flip-book during their first EVA.

At the back of Conrad's checklist they had also prepared two pages of complex geological terminology, added as a joke to give him the option to sound to Mission Control like he was as skilled as a professional career geologist. The third crewmember orbiting the Moon was not left out of the ''Playboy'' prank, as a November 1969 calendar featuring [[DeDe Lind]], Miss August 1967, had been stowed in a locker that Dick Gordon found while his crewmates were on the lunar surface. In 2011, he put this calendar up for auction.

* Alan Bean left a memento on the Moon: his silver [[astronaut pin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin 1995&quot;/&gt; This pin signified an astronaut who completed training but had not yet flown in space; he had worn it for six years. He was to get a gold astronaut pin for successfully completing the mission after the flight and felt he wouldn't need the silver pin thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin 1995&quot;/&gt; Tossing his pin into a lunar crater extended the common tradition among military pilots to ceremonially dispose of their originally awarded flight wings.

The Apollo 12 mission patch shows the crew's navy background; all three astronauts at the time of the mission were [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Commander (United States)|commanders]]. It features a [[clipper ship]] arriving at the Moon, representing the CM ''Yankee Clipper''. The ship trails fire, and flies the flag of the United States. The mission name APOLLO XII and the crew names are on a wide gold border, with a small blue trim. Blue and gold are traditional U.S. Navy colors. The patch has four stars on it – one each for the three astronauts who flew the mission and one for [[Clifton Williams]], a U.S. Marine Corps aviator and astronaut who was killed on October 5, 1967, after a mechanical failure caused the controls of his [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38]] trainer to stop responding, resulting in a crash. He trained with Conrad and Gordon as part of the backup crew for what would be the [[Apollo 9]] mission, and would have been assigned as lunar module pilot for Apollo 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin 1995&quot;/&gt;

==Orbital leftovers==
The Apollo 12 [[third stage]], an [[S-IVB]]&lt;!-- S-IVB-507, according to the S-IVB article --&gt;, after passing the Moon on 18 November 1969 and not entering a Lunar orbit like the Command Module and Lunar Lander, entered an [[elliptical orbit|elliptical]] [[Earth orbit]] with a period of approximately 43 days,&lt;ref name=jpl20020911/&gt; and thus became a [[derelict satellite]] orbiting Earth. Some time later, the spent third stage entered a [[heliocentric orbit]], but was not observed doing so. The likely mechanism was via one of the Sun-Earth Lagrangian points, which serve &quot;as a 'portal' between the regions of space gravitationally controlled by the Earth and Sun.&quot;&lt;ref name=jpl20020911/&gt;

Notably, in April 2002, it reentered a [[Temporary satellite|temporary orbit]] around the Earth-Moon system near the [[Sun-Earth L1|Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point]]—&quot;a location where the gravity of the Earth and Sun approximately cancel&quot;&lt;ref name=jpl20020911/&gt;—and remained in orbital synchrony with both the Moon and the Earth for a little over a year, reentering a heliocentric orbit in May 2003. The object was &quot;discovered&quot; by [[near-Earth object]] watcher Bill Yeung on 3{{nbsp}}September 2002, labeled object &quot;J002E3&quot; by the [[Minor Planet Center]], and was subsequently identified as the former Apollo 12 stage only several days later. The rocket stage is &quot;the first known case of an object being captured by the Earth, although [[Jupiter]] has been known to capture comets via the same mechanism.&quot;&lt;ref name=jpl20020911&gt;{{cite news |title=Newly Discovered Object Could be a Leftover Apollo Rocket Stage |work=Center for Near-Earth Object Studies |publisher=[[California Institute of Technology]], [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |date=11 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2019|9|4|df=US}}&lt;!-- what happened with this derelict satellite after 2003? --&gt;

==Depiction in media==
Portions of the Apollo 12 mission are dramatized in the 1998 miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled &quot;[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)#Episodes|That's All There Is]].&quot; Conrad, Gordon, and Bean were portrayed by [[Paul McCrane]], [[Tom Verica]], and [[Dave Foley]], respectively. Conrad had been portrayed by a different actor, [[Peter Scolari]], in the first episode.
