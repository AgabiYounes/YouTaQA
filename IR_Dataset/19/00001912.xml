&lt;!-- Definition and uses --&gt;
'''Ampicillin''' is an [[antibiotic]] used to prevent and treat a number of [[bacterial infection]]s, such as [[respiratory tract infection]]s, [[urinary tract infections]], [[meningitis]], [[salmonellosis]], and [[endocarditis]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; It may also be used to prevent [[group B streptococcal infection]] in newborns.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; It is used by mouth, by [[intramuscular injection|injection into a muscle]], or intravenously.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Ampicillin|url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/ampicillin.html|publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists|access-date=1 August 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712001731/http://www.drugs.com/monograph/ampicillin.html|archive-date=12 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like all antibiotics, it is not useful for the treatment of viral infections.

Ampicillin crosses the [[placenta]] and remains in the [[amniotic fluid]] at 50–100% of the concentration in maternal [[Plasma (blood)|plasma]]; this can lead to high concentrations of ampicillin in the newborn.&lt;ref name=&quot;rello&quot; /&gt;

While lactating mothers secrete some ampicillin into their breast milk, the amount is minimal.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHFS2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weiner&quot; /&gt;

In newborns, ampicillin has a longer half-life and lower plasma protein binding.&lt;ref name=eghianruwa&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CtfIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|title=Essential Drug Data for Rational Therapy in Veterinary Practice|last=Eghianruwa|first=Kingsley|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4918-0010-2|location=|pages=26|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clearance by the kidneys is lower, as kidney function has not fully developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHFS2015&quot; /&gt;

== Contraindications ==
Ampicillin is contraindicated in those with a [[Penicillin allergy|hypersensitivity to penicillins]], as they can cause fatal [[anaphylactic]] reactions. Hypersensitivity reactions can include frequent skin [[rash]]es and [[hives]], [[exfoliative dermatitis]], [[erythema multiforme]], and a temporary decrease in both [[Red blood cell|red]] and [[white blood cells]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed&quot; /&gt;

Ampicillin is not recommended in people with concurrent mononucleosis, as over 40% of patients develop a skin rash.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed&quot; /&gt;

Ampicillin is comparatively less toxic than other antibiotics, and side effects are more likely in those who are sensitive to penicillins and those with a history of [[asthma]] or [[allergies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed&quot; /&gt; In very rare cases, it causes severe side effects such as [[angioedema]], anaphylaxis, and ''[[C. difficile]]'' infection (that can range from mild [[diarrhea]] to serious [[pseudomembranous colitis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed&quot; /&gt; Some develop [[Black hairy tongue|black &quot;furry&quot; tongue]]. Serious adverse effects also include [[seizure]]s and [[serum sickness]]. The most common side effects, experienced by about 10% of users are diarrhea and rash. Less common side effects can be [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[itching]], and blood [[dyscrasia#Modern use|dyscrasia]]s. The gastrointestinal effects, such as hairy tongue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and colitis, are more common with the oral form of penicillin.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed&quot; /&gt; Other conditions may develop up several weeks after treatment.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

=== Overdose ===
Ampicillin overdose can cause behavioral changes, [[confusion]], blackouts, and convulsions, as well as neuromuscular hypersensitivity, [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed&quot; /&gt;

== Interactions ==

Ampicillin reacts with [[probenecid]] and [[methotrexate]] to decrease [[renal excretion]]. Large doses of ampicillin can increase the risk of bleeding with concurrent use of [[warfarin]] and other oral anticoagulants, possibly by inhibiting platelet aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/ampicillin-with-anisindione-196-0-210-0.html?professional=1|title=Drug interactions between ampicillin and anisindione|last=|first=|date=|work=Drugs.com|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ampicillin has been said to make [[oral contraceptives]] less effective,&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; but this has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94x8C5pbhqoC&amp;pg=PA213|title=Drug Interactions in Infectious Diseases|last1=Piscitelli|first1=Stephen C.|last2=Rodvold|first2=Keith A.|last3=Pai|first3=Manjunath P.| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2011|isbn=978-1-61779-213-7|pages=213–214|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be made less effective by other antibiotic, such as [[chloramphenicol]], [[erythromycin]], [[cephalosporins]], and [[tetracyclines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wanamaker&quot; /&gt; For example, tetracyclines inhibit protein synthesis in bacteria, reducing the target against which ampicillin acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/ampicillin-with-bismuth-subcitrate-potassium-metronidazole-tetracycline-196-0-388-0.html?professional=1|title=Drug interactions between ampicillin and bismuth subcitrate potassium / metronidazole / tetracycline|last=|first=|date=|work=Drugs.com|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If given at the same time as aminoglycosides, it can bind to it and inactivate it. When administered separately, aminoglycosides and ampicillin can potentiate each other instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHFS2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/amikacin-with-ampicillin-153-0-196-0.html?professional=1|title=Drug interactions between amikacin and ampicillin|last=|first=|date=|work=Drugs.com|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ampicillin causes skin rashes more often when given with [[allopurinol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed&quot; /&gt;

Both the live cholera vaccine and live typhoid vaccine can be made ineffective if given with ampicillin. Ampicillin is normally used to treat cholera and typhoid fever, lowering the immunological response that the body has to mount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/ampicillin-with-cholera-vaccine-live-196-0-3772-0.html?professional=1|title=Drug interactions between ampicillin and cholera vaccine, live|last=|first=|date=|work=Drugs.com|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/ampicillin-with-typhoid-vaccine-live-196-0-2271-0.html?professional=1|title=Drug interactions between ampicillin and typhoid vaccine, live|work=Drugs.com|access-date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/962643-medication|title=Cholera Medication|last=Handa|first=Sajeev|date=22 June 2017|work=Medscape|access-date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
[[File:Ampicillin with amine highlighted.svg|thumb|The amino group (highlighted in magenta) is present on ampicillin but not [[penicillin G]].]]
Ampicillin is in the [[penicillin]] group of [[β-Lactam antibiotic|beta-lactam antibiotic]]s and is part of the [[aminopenicillin]] family. It is roughly equivalent to [[amoxicillin]] in terms of activity.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; Ampicillin is able to penetrate Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. It differs from [[Benzylpenicillin|penicillin G]], or benzylpenicillin, only by the presence of an [[amino]] group. This amino group, present on both ampicillin and amoxicillin, helps these antibiotics pass through the pores of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, such as ''E. coli'', ''[[Proteus mirabilis]]'', ''[[Salmonella enterica]]'', and ''[[Shigella]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hauser&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Delcour AH | title = Outer membrane permeability and antibiotic resistance | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1794 | issue = 5 | pages = 808–16 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19100346 | pmc = 2696358 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2008.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ampicillin acts as an irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme [[DD-transpeptidase|transpeptidase]], which is needed by bacteria to make the cell wall.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHFS2015&quot; /&gt; It inhibits the third and final stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis in [[binary fission]], which ultimately leads to cell [[lysis]]; therefore, ampicillin is usually bacteriolytic.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHFS2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman&quot;&gt;{{cite book | editor-last=Brunton | editor-first=Laurence | editor-last2=Chabner | editor-first2=Bruce | editor-last3=Knollman | editor-first3=Bjorn | last=Petri | name-list-format = vanc | title=Goodman and Gilman's the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Twelfth Edition | chapter=Penicillins, Cephalosporins, and Other Beta-Lactam Antibiotics | location=New York | year=2011 | pages=1477–1504 | edition=12th | publisher=McGraw Hill Professional | isbn=978-0-07-176939-6 | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacokinetics===
Ampicillin is well-absorbed from the [[GI tract]] (though food reduces its absorption), and reaches peak concentrations in one to two hours. The [[bioavailability]] is around 62% for parenteral routes. Unlike other penicillins, which usually have bind 60–90% to [[plasma proteins]], ampicillin binds to only 15–20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHFS2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eghianruwa&quot; /&gt;

Ampicillin is distributed through most tissues, though it is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. It can also be found in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] when the meninges become inflamed (such as, for example, meningitis).&lt;ref name=&quot;eghianruwa&quot; /&gt; Some ampicillin is metabolized by hydrolyzing the beta-lactam ring to [[penicilloic acid]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AHFS2015&quot; /&gt; though most of it is excreted unchanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed&quot; /&gt; In the kidneys, it is filtered out mostly by [[tubular secretion]]; some also undergoes [[glomerular filtration]], and the rest is excreted in the [[feces]] and [[bile]].

[[Hetacillin]] and [[pivampicillin]] are ampicillin [[esters]] that have been developed to increase bioavailability.&lt;ref name=giguere&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ybA2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PT166|title=Antimicrobial Therapy in Veterinary Medicine|last1=Giguère|first1=S.|last2=Prescott|first2=John F.|last3=Dowling|first3=Patricia M.| name-list-format = vanc |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2013|isbn=978-1-118-67507-6|location=|pages=167–170|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ampicillin has been used extensively to treat bacterial infections since 1961.&lt;ref name = acred&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Acred P, Brown DM, Turner DH, Wilson MJ | title = Pharmacology and chemotherapy of ampicillin--a new broad-spectrum penicillin | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology and Chemotherapy | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 356–69 | date = April 1962 | pmid = 13859205 | pmc = 1482127 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.1962.tb01416.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the introduction of ampicillin by the British company [[Beecham (pharmaceutical company)|Beecham]], penicillin therapies had only been effective against Gram-positive organisms such as [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]] and [[Streptococcus|streptococci]].&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt; Ampicillin (originally branded as &quot;Penbritin&quot;) also demonstrated activity against Gram-negative organisms such as ''H. influenzae'', [[coliform]]s, and ''[[Proteus (bacterium)|Proteus]]'' spp.&lt;ref name = acred/&gt;

==Cost==
{{As of|2014}}, ampicillin's wholesale cost is between US$0.13 and 1.20 for a vial of the intravenous solution.&lt;ref name=Erc2015/&gt; In the United States, it is available as a [[generic medication]]: 10 days of treatment cost about $13.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

==Veterinary use==
In veterinary medicine, ampicillin is used in cats, dogs, and farm animals to treat:&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymed-vet&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- If ref is not specified for bullet point, info is from this ref --&gt;
* [[Anal gland]] infections
* Cutaneous infections, such as [[abscesses]], [[cellulitis]], and pustular [[dermatitis]]
* ''E. coli'' and ''Salmonella'' infections in [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[goats]] (oral form). Ampicillin use for this purpose had declined as bacterial resistance has increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;giguere&quot; /&gt; 
* [[Mastitis]] in [[Pig|sows]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/reproductive-system/mastitis-in-large-animals/mastitis-in-sows|title=Mastitis in Sows|last=Erskine|first=Ronald|work=Merck Veterinary Manual|access-date=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mixed aerobic–anaerobic infections, such as from cat bites&lt;ref name=&quot;giguere&quot; /&gt;
* Multidrug-resistant ''Enterococcus faecalis'' and ''E. faecium''&lt;ref name=&quot;magdesian&quot; /&gt;
* Prophylactic use in [[poultry]] against ''Salmonella'' and sepsis from ''E. coli'' or ''Staphylococcus aureus''&lt;ref name=&quot;giguere&quot; /&gt;
* [[Respiratory tract infections]], including [[tonsilitis]], [[bovine respiratory disease]], [[shipping fever]], [[bronchopneumonia]], and calf and bovine pneumonia
* Urinary tract infections in dogs
Horses are generally not treated with ampicillin, as they have low bioavailability of beta-lactams.&lt;ref name=&quot;magdesian&quot; /&gt;

The half-life in animals is around that same of that in humans (just over an hour). Oral absorption is less than 50% in cats and dogs, and less than 4% in horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;papich&quot; /&gt;
