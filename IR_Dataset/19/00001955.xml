'''Adobe Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|oʊ|b|iː}} {{respell|ə-DOH-bee}}, until October 3, 2018 as '''Adobe Systems Incorporated''') is an American multinational [[software|computer software]] company headquartered in [[San Jose, California]]. It has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more recent foray towards digital marketing software. Adobe is best known for its [[Adobe Flash]] web software ecosystem, [[Photoshop]] image editing software, [[Adobe Illustrator]] vector graphics editor, [[Acrobat Reader]], the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF), and [[Adobe Creative Suite]], as well as its successor [[Adobe Creative Cloud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TNW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/05/06/after-nearly-10-years-adobe-abandons-its-creative-suite-entirely-to-focus-on-creative-cloud/|title=Adobe Abandons Its Creative Suite to Focus on Creative Cloud|last=Weber|first=Harrison|date=May 26, 2013|work=The Next Web|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Adobe Systems logo and wordmark.svg|thumb|100px|right|Adobe logo from 1993 to 2017.]]
The company was started in John Warnock's garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Computer Technology Innovators|last=Rholetter|first=Wylene|publisher=Salem Press|year=2013|isbn=9781429838054|location=Ipswich, Massachusetts|pages=104-[108]|chapter=Charles Geschke: Cofounder and cochairman of Adobe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the company, ''Adobe'', comes from [[Adobe Creek (Santa Clara County, California)|Adobe Creek]] in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], California, which ran behind Warnock's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastfacts&quot; /&gt; Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized &quot;A&quot; and was designed by Marva Warnock, graphic designer and John Warnock's wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/adobe-logo/|title=Adobe Logo: Design and History| publisher=Famouslogos.net|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Jobs attempted to buy the company for five million dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the company of giants: candid conversations with the visionaries of the digital world|last=Jager|first=Rama Dev|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1982, but Warnock and Geschke refused. Their investors urged them to work something out with Jobs, so they agreed to sell him shares worth 19 percent of the company. Jobs paid a five-times multiple of their company's valuation at the time, plus a five-year license fee for PostScript, in advance. The purchase and advance made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become profitable in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fearless genius : the digital revolution in Silicon Valley, 1985-2000|last=Menuez|first=Doug|publisher=Atria Books|year=2014|isbn=9781476752730|location=New York|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warnock and Geschke considered various business options including a copy-service business and a turnkey system for office printing. Then they chose to focus on developing specialized printing software and created the Adobe PostScript page description language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radicals and visionaries|last=Wawro|first=Thaddeus|publisher=Entrepreneur Press|year=2000|isbn=1891984136|location=|pages=143|chapter=Charles Geschke &amp; John Warnock: the fathers of desktop publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PostScript was the first truly international standard for computer printing as it included algorithms describing the letter-forms of many languages. Adobe added kanji printer products in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fearless genius : the digital revolution in Silicon Valley, 1985-2000|last=Menuez|first=Doug|publisher=Atria Books|year=2014|isbn=9781476752730|location=New York|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warnock and Geschke were also able to bolster the credibility of Postscript by connecting with a typesetting manufacturer. They weren't able to work with Compugraphic, but then worked with Linotype to license the Helvetica and Times Roman fonts (through the Linotron 100).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Print unchained: fifty years of digital printing, 1950-2000 and beyond: A saga of invention and enterprise|last=Wester|first=Edward|publisher=DRA of Vermont|year=2000|isbn=0970261705|location=West Dover, VT|pages=162|chapter=Chapter 6: The Eighties: PDLs, Adobe, and John Warnock}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987, PostScript had become the industry-standard printer language with more than 400 third-party software programs and licensing agreements with 19 printer companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Radicals and visionaries|last=Wawro|first=Thaddeus|publisher=Entrepreneur Press|year=2000|isbn=1891984136|location=|pages=144|chapter=Charles Geschke &amp; John Warnock: the fathers of desktop publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warnock described the language as &quot;extensible&quot;, in its ability to apply graphic arts standards to office printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Print unchained: fifty years of digital printing, 1950-2000 and beyond: A saga of invention and enterprise|last=Webster|first=Edward|publisher=DRA of Vermont, Inc.|year=2000|isbn=0970261705|location=West Dover, VT|pages=63|chapter=Chapter 2: Overture: The Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe's first products after [[PostScript]] were [[digital font]]s, which they released in a proprietary format called [[Type 1 font|Type 1]], worked on by Bill Paxton after he left Stanford. Apple subsequently developed a competing standard, [[TrueType]], which provided full scalability and precise control of the [[pixel]] pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to [[Microsoft]].

In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer [[software]] market with [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]], a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drawing program for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers.

Adobe entered [[NASDAQ]] in August 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to $4 billion in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ADBE|publisher=Google Finance|title=Adobe Incorporated Company Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November.  For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.

In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its [[flagship]] product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.

In 1993, Adobe introduced [[PDF]], the Portable Document Format, and its [[Adobe acrobat|Adobe Acrobat and Reader]] software. PDF is now an International Standard: [[PDF|ISO 32000-1:2008]].

In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded as [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] in 2003. In 1992, Adobe acquired OCR Systems, Inc. In 1994, Adobe acquired [[Aldus]] and added [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] and [[Adobe After Effects|After Effects]] to its product line later in the year; it also controls the [[TIFF]] file format. In the same year, Adobe acquired LaserTools Corp and Compution Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verespej|first=Michael A.|date=5 February 1996|title=Empire without emperors|url=|journal=Industry Week|volume=245|issue=3|pages=13–16|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Adobe added [[Adobe FrameMaker|FrameMaker]], the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Inc added [[Ares]] Software Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18422328.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011162644/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18422328.html |url-status = dead|archive-date=October 11, 2013 |title= Adobe gets font technology.

In May 2003 Adobe purchased Audio editing and multitrack recording software Cool Edit Pro from Syntrillium Software for $16.5 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/pdfs/q2_fy03_form_10q.pdf |title=United States SEC Form 10-Q, Adobe Systems, Inc., May 30, 2003 |access-date=August 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030212330/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/invrelations/pdfs/q2_fy03_form_10q.pdf |archive-date=October 30, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a large [[music loop|loop]] library called &quot;Loopology&quot;. Adobe then renamed Cool Edit Pro to &quot;[[Adobe Audition]]&quot; and included it in the Creative Suite.

On December 3, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival, [[Macromedia]], in a [[stock swap]] valued at about $3.4 billion, adding [[Adobe ColdFusion|ColdFusion]], [[Adobe Contribute|Contribute]], [[Adobe Captivate|Captivate]], [[Adobe Connect]] (formerly Macromedia Breeze), [[Adobe Director|Director]], [[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]], [[Adobe Fireworks|Fireworks]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], [[FlashPaper]], [[Adobe Flex|Flex]], [[Adobe FreeHand|FreeHand]], [[Adobe HomeSite|HomeSite]], [[Adobe JRun|JRun]], [[Adobe Presenter|Presenter]], and [[Adobe Authorware|Authorware]] to Adobe's product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jefferson|last=Graham|title=Adobe buys Macromedia in $3.4B deal|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2005-04-18-adobe-macromedia_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=April 18, 2005|accessdate=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Martin LaMonica, CNET. &quot;[https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/now-playing-adobe-media-player-1-0/ Now playing: Adobe Media Player 1.0].&quot; 11 April 2008.

Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance.

== Criticisms ==
===Pricing===
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39497760,00.htm?r=1|title=Adobe responds to CS4 pricing criticism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builderau.com.au/news/soa/Adobe-defends-CS4-pricing/0,339028227,339292472,00.htm |title=Adobe defends CS4 pricing |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927105212/http://www.builderau.com.au/news/soa/Adobe-defends-CS4-pricing/0%2C339028227%2C339292472%2C00.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with retail prices being up to twice as much in non-US countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativepro.com/article/creative-suite-pricing-varies-throughout-world|title=Adobe responds to customer protests against perceived unfair pricing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/02/dont-believe-the-adobe-price-cut-hype-its-still-gauging-you-silly/| title=Don't Believe The Adobe Price Cut Hype, It's Still Gouging You Silly|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/adobe-has-its-head-in-the-clouds-over-pricing-20130215-2ehat.html| title=Adobe has its head in the clouds over pricing|publisher=The Age - Technology | location=Melbourne | accessdate=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/uk-will-pay-1000-more-for-adobe-cs3-3039286561/ |title=UK will pay £1,000 more for Adobe CS3 |work=ZDNet |date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a petition to protest over &quot;unfair pricing&quot; was published and signed by 10,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photo.net/photography-news-forum/00LDbS |title=10,000 sign Adobe CS3 European pricing petition |publisher=Photo.net |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/254173/adobe-hikes-uk-prices-by-10.html|title=Adobe hikes UK prices by 10% &amp;#124; News|publisher=PC Pro|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and UK users were not allowed to buy from the US store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charles Arthur |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jun/04/adobe-software |title=Adobe widens the price gap |newspaper=The Guardian |date= June 3, 2009|accessdate=2014-05-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe's [[Adobe Reader|Reader]] and [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] programs were listed on &quot;The 10 most hated programs of all time&quot; article by ''[[TechRadar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/the-10-most-hated-programs-of-all-time-1060129 |title=The 10 most hated programs of all time: Terrible software that made everybody see red|work=TechRadar|author=Gary Marshall|date= |accessdate=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
Hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pagliery |first=Jose |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/08/technology/security/adobe-security/ |title=Adobe has an espically abysmal security record - CNNMoney |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2013-10-08 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see [[Flash player#Criticism|criticism of Flash Player]]). A report by security researchers from [[Kaspersky Lab]] criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff James in Security Blog |url=http://windowsitpro.com/blog/adobe-fares-poorly-kaspersky-lab-security-report |title=Adobe Fares Poorly in Kaspersky Lab Security Report |publisher=WindowsITPro |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers noted that Adobe was spying on its customers by including [[spyware]] in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named [[Omniture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20071228/020818.shtml |title=Adobe Spying On Its Customers |publisher=Techdirt |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: &quot;could and should do a better job taking security concerns into account&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2007/12/adobe_ate_me_baby.html |title=John Nack on Adobe: Adobe ate me baby!! |publisher=Blogs.adobe.com |date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brewster|first=Thomas |url=https://www.silicon.co.uk/workspace/adobe-creative-suite-patch-backtrac-77760|title=Adobe Backtracks On Patching 'PR Disaster' |publisher=TechWeekEurope |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the software patch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brenner |first=Bill |url=http://blogs.csoonline.com/data-protection/2178/was-stupid-adobe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630154428/http://blogs.csoonline.com/data-protection/2178/was-stupid-adobe |url-status = dead|archive-date=2012-06-30 |title=That was stupid, Adobe &amp;#124; CSO Blogs |publisher=Blogs.csoonline.com |date=2012-05-14 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software including third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] update process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/adobe-and-skype-top-my-foistware-hall-of-shame/3195 |title=Adobe and Skype top my Foistware Hall of Shame |work=ZDNet |date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for pushing a third-party [[scareware]] program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/adobes-latest-critical-security-update-pushes-scareware/4681 |title=Adobe's latest critical security update pushes scareware |work=ZDNet |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer data breach===
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24392819 |title=Adobe in source code and customer data security breach|publisher=BBC |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adobe accounts hacked, data exposed for 2.9 million customers - Digital Photography Review |url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2013/10/03/adobe-accounts-hacked-data-exposed-for-2-9-million-customers }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Rachel |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57605962-83/adobe-hacked-3-million-accounts-compromised/ |title=Adobe hacked, 3 million accounts compromised &amp;#124; Security &amp; Privacy - CNET News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57609753-83/adobe-hack-attack-affected-38-million-accounts/ |title=Adobe hack attack affected 38 million accounts &amp;#124; Security &amp; Privacy - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/adobe-security-breach-actually-affected-closer-to-38-million-users-7000022560/ |title=Adobe security breach actually affected closer to 38 million users|work=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though [[data privacy|data]] [[privacy law]]s in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.kioskea.net/news/24146-adobe-cyber-attack-was-a-lesson-for-corporations|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022214739/http://en.kioskea.net/news/24146-adobe-cyber-attack-was-a-lesson-for-corporations|url-status = dead|archive-date=2013-10-22|title=Adobe Cyber Attack was a Lesson for Corporations - Kioskea.net|date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/10/09/how-safe-is-encrypted-card-data-adobe/ |title=After Security Breach Exposes 2.9 Million Adobe Users, How Safe Is Encrypted Credit Card Data? |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=2014-05-23 |first=Alex |last=Konrad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodin |first=Dan |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/how-an-epic-blunder-by-adobe-could-strengthen-hand-of-password-crackers/ |title=How an epic blunder by Adobe could strengthen hand of password crackers &amp;#124; Ars Technica  |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LastPass]], a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not [[Salt (cryptography)|salted]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkle |first=Jim |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/07/us-adobe-cyberattack-idUKBRE9A61D220131107 |title=Trove of Adobe user data found on Web after breach: security firm &amp;#124; Reuters  |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/742570/adobe-confirms-stolen-passwords-were-encrypted-not-hashed|title=Adobe confirms stolen passwords were encrypted, not hashed - CSO Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another security firm, [[Sophos]], showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on 5th November 2013 by Gareth Halfacree |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2013/11/05/adobe-breach-2/1 |title=Adobe data breach far worse than first claimed |publisher=bit-tech.net |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Information technology|IT]] expert Simon Bain, Adobe has failed its customers and 'should hang their heads in shame'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Matt |url=http://business-technology.co.uk/2013/11/adobe-should-hang-their-heads-in-shame-following-cyber-attack/ |title=Adobe 'should hang their heads in shame' following cyber attack |publisher=Business Technology |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2014-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054029/http://business-technology.co.uk/2013/11/adobe-should-hang-their-heads-in-shame-following-cyber-attack/ |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the credit cards were tied to the [[Creative Cloud]] software-by-subscription service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243010/Adobe_hack_shows_subscription_software_vendors_lucrative_targets?pageNumber=1|title=Adobe hack shows subscription software vendors lucrative targets {{!}} Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/10/massive-adobe-security-breach-change-your-passwords-now/ | title=Massive Adobe Security Breach: Change Your Passwords Now {{!}} Lifehacker Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/10/adobe-treating-australians-as-lesser-beings-even-after-details-of-2-9-million-accounts-were-stolen/| title=Adobe Treating Australians As Lesser Beings Even After Details Of 2.9 Million Accounts Were Stolen {{!}} Gizmodo Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[data breach]] occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/25/us-adobe-cyberattack-idUKBRE9AO10R20131125|title=Adobe says breach notification taking longer than anticipated &amp;#124; Reuters | date=November 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's [[source code]] repository, likely in mid-August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-security/adobe-fesses-hack-fudges-details-228189|title=Adobe fesses up to hack but fudges on details {{!}} Application security - InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] acquired copies of the source code of Adobe [[proprietary software|proprietary]] products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/04/adobe-hacked_n_4042351.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004112712/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/04/adobe-hacked_n_4042351.html|url-status = dead|archive-date=October 4, 2013|title=BBC Adobe Hacked: Cyber-Thieves Accessed Credit Card Information Of Nearly 3 Million Customers | work=Huffington Post | date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/technology/adobe-announces-security-breach.html|title=Adobe Announces Security Breach {{!}} The New York Times | first=David | last=Kocieniewski|date=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security researcher [[Alex Holden]], chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected [[Adobe Acrobat|Acrobat]], [[ColdFusion]] and numerous other applications, as &quot;one of the worst in US history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/10/07/ruh-roh-adobe-breach-is-just-the-beginning-researcher-says/ |title=Ruh-roh: Adobe breach is just the beginning, researcher says |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=2013-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of [[Photoshop]], which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24740873 |title=BBC News - Adobe hack: At least 38 million accounts breached |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-levin/why-the-adobe-hack-scares_b_4277064.html |title=Why the Adobe Hack Scares Me - And Why It Should Scare You &amp;#124; Adam Levin |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Published on a server of a Russian-speaking [[hacker group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2054160/adobes-source-code-was-parked-on-hackers-unprotected-server.html| title=Adobe's source code was parked on hackers' unprotected server {{!}} PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data&quot; and may have opened the gateway to new generation [[zero-day attack]]s. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of [[PR Newswire]]'s customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 200,000 Social Security numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/hackers-breached-washington-state-court-with-adobe-coldfusion-flaw-7000015199/|title=Hackers breached Washington state court with Adobe ColdFusion flaw {{!}} ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-competitive practices===
In 1994, Adobe acquired Aldus Corp., a software vendor that sold FreeHand, a competing product.&lt;ref name=&quot;law360&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twff&quot;/&gt; [[Adobe Freehand|Freehand]] was direct competition to [[Adobe Illustrator]], Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor.&lt;ref name=&quot;law360&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law360.com/articles/243049/adobe-hit-with-class-action-over-freehand-app|title=Adobe Hit With Class Action Over FreeHand App|first=Dan|last=Rivoli|date=2011-05-03|publisher=Law360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twff&quot;/&gt; The [[Federal Trade Commission]] intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar program for the next 10 years (1994-2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;law360&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twff&quot;/&gt; Altsys was then bought by [[Macromedia]], which released versions 5 to 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;twff&quot;/&gt; When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of [[Adobe FreeHand|Freehand]] in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;law360&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cwff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/news/it-vendors/adobe-sued-by-freehand-user-group-3280625/|title=Adobe sued by FreeHand user group|date=2011-05-18|publisher=[[Computerworld]] UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;law360&quot;/&gt;

In 2011, a group of 5,000 Freehand graphic designers convened under the banner ''Free Freehand'', and filed a civil antitrust complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Adobe.&lt;ref name=&quot;law360&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techworld.com/news/apps/adobe-accused-of-software-monopoly-not-by-apple-3222555/|title=Adobe accused of software monopoly (not by Apple)|first=Lexton|last=Snol|date=2010-05-05|publisher=Tech World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;quarkff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetquark.com/2011/05/05/adobe-sued-for-killing-freehand/|title=Adobe Sued for Killing FreeHand|first=Jay|last=Nelson|date=2011-05-03|publisher=Planet Quark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macff&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1159949/freehand_lawsuit.html|title=FreeHand users sue Adobe for 'killing' the application|date=2011-05-18|magazine=[[Macworld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged that ''Adobe has violated federal and state antitrust laws by abusing its dominant position in the professional vector graphic illustration software market'' and that ''Adobe has engaged in a series of exclusionary and anti-competitive acts and strategies designed to kill FreeHand, the dominant competitor to Adobe's Illustrator software product, instead of competing on the basis of product merit according to the principals of free market capitalism.''&lt;ref name=&quot;law360&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;quarkff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macff&quot;/&gt; Adobe had no response to the claims and the lawsuit was eventually settled.&lt;ref name=&quot;law360&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cwff&quot;/&gt; The FreeHand community believes Adobe should release the product to an open-source community if it cannot update it internally.&lt;ref name=&quot;twff&quot;/&gt;

{{as of|2010}}, on its FreeHand product page, Adobe stated, &quot;While we recognize FreeHand has a loyal customer base, we encourage users to migrate to the new Adobe Illustrator CS4 software which supports both PowerPC and Intel-based Macs and Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista.&quot; {{as of|2016}}, the Freehand page no longer exists and simply redirects to the Illustrator page. Adobe's software FTP server still contains a directory for FreeHand, but it is empty.
