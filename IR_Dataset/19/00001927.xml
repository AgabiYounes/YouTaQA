'''Ara''' (Latin: &quot;The Altar&quot;) is a southern [[constellation]] situated between [[Scorpius]] and [[Triangulum Australe]]. Ara (Greek: Βωμός) was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the [[International Astronomical Union]].

The orange supergiant [[Beta Arae]] is the brightest star in the constellation, with an [[apparent magnitude]] of 2.85—marginally brighter than the blue-white [[Alpha Arae]]. Seven star systems are known to host planets. The sunlike star [[Mu Arae]] hosts four known planets, while [[Gliese 676]] is a binary red dwarf system with four known planets. The Milky Way crosses the northwestern part of Ara. Within the constellation's borders is [[Westerlund 1]], a [[super star cluster]] that contains the [[red hypergiant]] [[Westerlund 1-26]], which is possibly the [[List of largest stars|largest star known]].

In ancient [[Greek mythology]], Ara was identified as the [[altar]] where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance before defeating the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}} One of the southernmost constellations depicted by [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref name=barentine&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lost Constellations | author=Barentine, John C. | chapter= Officina Typographica | page=13 | isbn=978-3-319-22794-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had been recorded by [[Aratus]] in 270 BC as lying close to the horizon, and the [[Almagest]] portrays stars as far south as [[Gamma Arae]]. Professor of astronomy [[Bradley Schaefer]] has proposed that ancient observers must have been able to see as far south as [[Zeta Arae]] to define a pattern that looked like an altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The latitude and epoch for the formation of the southern Greek constellations | author=Schaefer, Bradley E. |journal= Journal for the History of Astronomy| issn= 0021-8286|volume= 33| series= 4|issue=113| pages= 313–50 |year=2002| bibcode=2002JHA....33..313S| doi=10.1177/002182860203300401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ara Bode.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johann Elert Bode]]'s illustration of Ara, from his ''Uranographia'' (1801)]]
In illustrations, Ara is usually depicted as compact classical [[altar]] with its smoke 'rising' southward.{{sfn|Ridpath, ''Star Tales'' Ara}} However, depictions often vary. In the early days of printing, a 1482 [[woodcut]] of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]'s classic ''Poeticon Astronomicon'' depicts the altar as surrounded by demons.&lt;ref name=Kanas&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanas|first=Nick|title=History, Artistry, and Cartography|edition=Second|date=2012|publisher=Praxis Publishing|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-1-4614-0916-8|page=136|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-0917-5|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1481587}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603 depicted Ara as an altar with burning incense. [[Hyginus]] depicted the same though his featured devils on either side of the flames. [[Willem Blaeu]], a Dutch uranographer active in the 16th and 17th centuries, drew Ara as an altar designed for sacrifice, with a burning animal offering unusually whose smoke rises northward, represented by [[Alpha Arae]].  

''The Castle of Knowledge'' by [[Robert Record]] of 1556 lists the constellation stating that &quot;Under the Scorpions tayle, standeth the Altar.&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''The Castle of Knowledge containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celestiall and Materiall, etc.'', 1st edition, 1556; Robert Record, London; R. Wolfe (printer) STC 20796&lt;/ref&gt; a decade later a translation of a fairly recent mainly astrological work by [[Marcellus Palingenius]] of 1565, by [[Barnabe Googe]] states &quot;Here mayst thou both the Altar, and the myghty Cup beholde.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The zodiake of life written by the godly and zealous poet Marcellus Palingenius Stellatus, wherein are conteyned twelve bookes, new edition'', 1565 (1 vol.); Barnabe Googe, London; Henry Denham (printer), for Rafe Newberye dwelling in Fleete streate, Anno. 1565.

Bayer gave eight stars [[Bayer designation]]s, labelling them Alpha through to Theta, though he had never seen the constellation directly as it never rises above the horizon in Germany. After charting the southern constellations, French astronomer [[Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille]] recharted the stars of Ara from Alpha though to Sigma, including three pairs of stars next to each other as Epsilon, Kappa and Nu.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|pp=42–43}}

Ara contains part of the Milky Way to the south of [[Scorpius]] and thus has rich star fields.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}} Within the constellation's borders, there are 71 stars brighter than or equal to [[apparent magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;6.5.{{efn|1=Objects of magnitude 6.5 are among the faintest visible to the unaided eye in suburban-rural transition night skies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/resources/darksky/3304011.html?page=1&amp;c=y|title=The Bortle Dark-Sky Scale|last=Bortle|first=John E.|date=February 2001|work=[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;

[[HD 152079]] is a sunlike star with a planet. [[HD 154672]] is an ageing sunlike star with a [[Hot Jupiter]]. [[HD 154857]] is a sunlike star with one confirmed and one suspected planet. [[HD 156411]] is a star hotter and larger than the sun with a gas giant planet in orbit. [[Gliese 674]] is a nearby red dwarf star with a planet. [[Gliese 676]] is a binary star system composed of two red dwarves with four planets.

The northwest corner of Ara is crossed by the [[galactic plane]] of the [[Milky Way]] and contains several [[open cluster]]s (notably [[NGC 6200]]) and [[diffuse nebula]]e (including the bright cluster/nebula pair [[NGC 6188]] and [[NGC 6193]]). The brightest of the [[globular cluster]]s, sixth magnitude [[NGC 6397]], lies at a distance of just {{convert|6500|ly|km}}, making it one of the closest globular clusters to the [[Solar System]].{{sfn|Dunlop|2005}}

Ara also contains [[Westerlund 1]], a [[super star cluster]] that contains the [[red hypergiant]] [[Westerlund 1-26]], which is possibly the [[List of largest stars|largest star known]] with an estimate varying between {{solar radius|1,530|link=y}}&lt;ref name=wright&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=N.

Although Ara lies close to the heart of the Milky Way, two [[spiral galaxies]] ([[NGC 6215]] and [[NGC 6221]]) are visible near star [[Eta Arae]].{{sfn|Dunlop|2005}}

==== Open clusters ====

* [[NGC 6193]] is an [[open cluster]] containing approximately 30 stars with an overall magnitude of 5.0 and a size of 0.25 square degrees, about half the size of the [[full Moon]]. It is approximately 4200 light-years from Earth. It has one bright member, a double star with a blue-white hued primary of magnitude 5.6 and a secondary of magnitude 6.9. NGC 6193 is surrounded by [[NGC 6188]], a faint [[nebula]] only normally visible in [[astrophotography|long-exposure photographs]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}
* [[NGC 6200]]
* [[NGC 6204]]
* [[NGC 6208]]
* [[NGC 6250]]
* [[NGC 6253]]
* [[IC 4651]]

==== Globular clusters ====

* [[NGC 6352]]
* [[NGC 6362]]
* [[NGC 6397]] is a [[globular cluster]] with an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is visible to the naked eye under exceptionally dark skies and is normally visible in binoculars. It is a fairly close globular cluster, at a distance of 10,500 light-years.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=82–83}}

=== Planetary Nebulae ===

* The [[Stingray Nebula]] (Hen 3-1357), the youngest known planetary nebula as of 2010, formed in Ara; the light from its formation was first observable around 1987.
* [[NGC 6326]].  A planetary nebula that might have a binary system at its center.
