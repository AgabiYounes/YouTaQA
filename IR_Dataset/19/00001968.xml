'''Apollo 14''' was the eighth crewed mission in the United States [[Apollo program]], the third to [[Moon landing|land]] on the [[Moon]], and the first to land in the [[Geology of the Moon#Highlands|lunar highlands]]. It was the last of the &quot;[[List of Apollo missions#Alphabetical mission types|H missions]],&quot; targeted landings with two-day stays on the Moon with two lunar [[Extravehicular activity|EVA]]s, or moonwalks.

Commander [[Alan Shepard]], [[Command Module Pilot]] [[Stuart Roosa]], and [[Lunar Module Pilot]] [[Edgar Mitchell]] launched on their nine-day mission on Sunday, January 31, 1971, at 4:03:02&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]. Liftoff was delayed forty minutes and two seconds, due to launch site weather restrictions, the first such delay in the Apollo program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/afj/launchwindow/lw1.html |title=Apollo lunar landing launch window: The controlling factors and constraints |last=Wheeler |first=Robin |year=2009 |work=Apollo Flight Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402101131/https://history.nasa.gov/afj/launchwindow/lw1.html|archivedate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard and Mitchell made their lunar landing on February{{nbsp}}5 in the [[Fra Mauro formation|Fra Mauro highlands]] â€“ originally the target of the aborted [[Apollo 13]] mission. During the two lunar EVAs, {{convert|94.35|lb}} of [[Moon rock]]s were collected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |chapter=Extravehicular Activity |chapterurl=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-30_Extravehicular_Activity.htm |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |series=The NASA History Series |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |work=NASA History Division, Office of Policy and Plans |publisher=[[NASA]] |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-16-050631-X |lccn=00061677 |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |ref=Orloff}} For some reason, the total reported does not match the sum of the two EVAs.&lt;/ref&gt; and several [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|scientific experiments]] were performed. Shepard hit two [[golf ball]]s on the lunar surface with a makeshift club he had brought with him. Shepard and Mitchell spent 33{{frac|2}} hours on the Moon, with almost 9{{frac|2}} hours of EVA.

In the aftermath of Apollo 13, several modifications had been made to the [[Apollo service module|service module]] electrical power system to prevent a repeat of that accident, including a redesign of the oxygen tanks and the addition of a third tank. The launch had been scheduled for October{{nbsp}}1, {{nowrap|1970,&lt;ref name=sovwoe&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e6xVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=POEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4752%2C4003691 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=Next Moon flight to await solving Apollo's woes |date=April 18, 1970 |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and was delayed about {{nowrap|four months.&lt;ref name=afvolev&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=guVVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5-ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4627%2C5425873 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Astronauts, families visit on launch eve |date=January 30, 1971 |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While Shepard and Mitchell were on the surface, Roosa remained in [[lunar orbit]] aboard the [[command and service module]] ''Kittyhawk'',&lt;ref&gt;  Most references cite the name as ''Kitty Hawk,'' which is incorrect.  Email message from Ed Mitchell, 09JAN12, &quot;Stu chose Kittyhawk, not Kitty Hawk, for the command module.  He would be quite upset at the error were he still alive.  I've tried in vain to point out the error (one word, not two).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; performing scientific experiments and photographing the Moon, including the landing site of the future [[Apollo 16]] mission. He took several hundred seeds on the mission, many of which were [[Germination|germinated]] on return, resulting in the so-called [[Moon tree]]s.

Shepard and Mitchell successfully lifted ''Antares'' off the Moon to dock with the command module and, after a total of 34 lunar orbits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_14a_Summary.htm|title=Apollo by the Numbers|id=SP-4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ship was flown back to Earth where the three astronauts landed in the [[Pacific Ocean]] on February 9.

Another of the original seven, [[Gordon Cooper]], had (as [[Apollo 10]]'s backup commander) tentatively been scheduled to command the mission, but according to author [[Andrew Chaikin]], his casual attitude toward training, along with problems with [[NASA]] hierarchy (reaching all the way back to the [[Mercury-Atlas 9]] flight), resulted in his removal.

The mission was a personal triumph for Shepard, who had battled back from [[MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease]] which grounded him from 1964 to 1968. He and his crew were originally scheduled to fly on Apollo 13, but in 1969 NASA officials switched the scheduled crews for Apollos 13 and 14. This was done to allow Shepard more time to train for his flight, as he had been grounded for four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chaikin2009&quot;&gt;[[#Chaikin 2009|Chaikin 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During projects Mercury and Gemini, each mission had a prime and a backup crew. [[Apollo 9]] commander [[James McDivitt]] believed meetings that required a member of the flight crew were being missed, so for Apollo a third crew of astronauts was added, known as the support crew.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=184}} Usually low in seniority, support crew members assembled the mission's rules, [[flight plan]], and checklists, and kept them updated;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hersch|first=Matthew|date=July 19, 2009|title=The fourth crewmember|journal=[[Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian]]|accessdate=October 4, 2019|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/space/the-fourth-crewmember-37046329/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brooks|Grimwood|Swenson|1979|p=261}} for Apollo 14, they were [[Philip K.

[[File:Apollo 14 Saturn V climbs.jpg|thumb|Launch of Apollo 14]]

=== Launch and flight to lunar orbit ===
Apollo 14 launched during heavy cloud cover and the Saturn V booster quickly disappeared from view. NASA's long-range cameras, based 60 miles south in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], had a clear shot of the remainder of the launch. Following the launch, the [[Launch Control Center]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] was visited by [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] [[Spiro Agnew|Spiro T. Agnew]], [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Prince Juan Carlos]] of [[Spain]], and his wife, [[Queen SofÃ­a of Spain|Princess SofÃ­a]].

At the beginning of the mission, the [[Apollo CSM]] ''Kittyhawk'' had difficulty achieving capture and docking with the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]] ''Antares''. Repeated attempts to dock went on for 1{{nbsp}}hour and 42 minutes, until it was suggested that Roosa hold ''Kittyhawk'' against ''Antares'' using its thrusters, then the docking probe would be retracted out of the way, hopefully triggering the docking latches. The sixth attempt was successful, and no further docking problems were encountered during the mission.

=== Lunar descent ===
After separating from the command module in lunar orbit, the LM ''Antares'' had two serious problems. First, the LM computer began getting an ABORT signal from a faulty switch. NASA believed the computer might be getting erroneous readings like this if a tiny ball of solder had shaken loose and was floating between the switch and the contact, closing the circuit. The immediate solution&amp;nbsp;â€“ tapping on the panel next to the switch&amp;nbsp;â€“ did work briefly, but the circuit soon closed again. If the problem recurred after the descent engine fired, the computer would think the signal was real and would initiate an auto-abort, causing the [[Apollo Lunar Module#Ascent stage|ascent stage]] to separate from the [[Apollo Lunar Module#Descent stage|descent stage]] and climb back into orbit. NASA and the software teams at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] scrambled to find a solution. The software was hard-wired, preventing it from being updated directly. The fix involved indicating that abort mode was already active, so that if the signal were to arise again, it would be ignored rather than initiating what would have appeared to the software to be a second abort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Adler |first1=Doug |title=How an MIT computer scientist saved Apollo 14 |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2019/06/hacking-apollo-14-how-an-mit-computer-scientists-saved-a-lunar-landing |accessdate=June 27, 2019 |work=Astronomy |publisher=Kalmbach Media |date=June 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[patch (computing)|software modifications]] were transmitted to the crew via voice communication, and Mitchell manually entered the changes (amounting to over 80 keystrokes on the LM computer pad) just in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/video/aerospace/space-flight/don-eyles-space-hacker |publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |title=Don Eyles: Space Hacker |first=Stephen |last=Cass |first2=Christina |last2=Dabney |date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second problem occurred during the powered descent, when the LM [[Doppler radar|landing radar]] failed to lock automatically onto the Moon's surface, depriving the navigation computer of vital information on the vehicle's altitude and vertical descent speed (this was not a result of the modifications to the ABORT command; rather, the post-mission report indicated it was an unrelated bug in the radar's operation). After the astronauts cycled the landing radar breaker, the unit successfully acquired a signal near {{convert|18000|ft|m}}, again just in time. Shepard then manually landed the LM closer to its intended target than any of the other five Moon landing missions. Mitchell believed Shepard would have continued with the landing attempt without the radar, using the LM inertial guidance system and visual cues. A post-flight review of the descent data showed the inertial system alone would have been inadequate, and the astronauts probably would have been forced to abort the landing as they approached the surface.

=== Lunar surface operations ===
[[Image:a14-plaque.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lunar plaque|plaque]] left on the Moon by Apollo 14]]

Shepard and Mitchell named their landing site ''Fra Mauro Base'', and this designation is recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (depicted in Latin on lunar maps as ''Statio Fra Mauro'').

Shepard's first words, after stepping onto the lunar surface were, &quot;And it's been a long way, but we're here.&quot; Unlike [[Neil Armstrong]] on [[Apollo 11]] and [[Pete Conrad]] on Apollo 12, Shepard had already stepped off the LM footpad and was a few yards away before he spoke.

Shepard's moonwalking suit was the first to utilize red stripes on the arms and legs and on the top of the lunar EVA sunshade &quot;hood,&quot; so as to allow easy identification between the commander and LM pilot on the surface;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=von Braun |first=Wernher |authorlink=Wernher von Braun |title=Space Suitsâ€”from Pressurized Prison to Mini-Spacecraft |date=July 1972 |journal=[[Popular Science]] |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ6okH8FCs4C&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Apollo 12]] pictures, it had been almost impossible to distinguish between the two crewmen, causing a great deal of confusion. This feature was included on [[Jim Lovell]]'s Apollo 13 suit; because no landing was made on that mission, Apollo 14 was the first to make use of it. This feature was used for the remaining Apollo missions, and for the [[Extravehicular activity|EVA]]s of [[Space Shuttle]] flights afterwards, and it is still in use today on both the U.S. and the Russian [[space suit]]s on the [[International Space Station]].

After landing in the Fra Mauro formationâ€”the destination for Apollo 13â€”Shepard and Mitchell took two moonwalks, adding new [[Apollo 14 Passive Seismic Experiment|seismic studies]]&lt;ref&gt;Brzostowski and Brzostowski, pp 414â€“416&lt;/ref&gt; to the by now familiar [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP), and using the [[Modular Equipment Transporter]] (MET), a pull-cart for carrying equipment and samples, nicknamed &quot;lunar rickshaw&quot;. Roosa, meanwhile, took pictures from on board command module ''Kittyhawk'' in lunar orbit.

[[File:A14mrf3-1.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the first and second EVAs]]

The second moonwalk, or EVA, was intended to reach the rim of the {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} wide [[Cone (crater)|Cone crater]]. The two astronauts were not able to find the rim amid the rolling terrain of the crater's slopes. They became physically exhausted from the attempt and, with their suits' oxygen supplies starting to run low, the effort was called off. Later analysis using the pictures they took determined that they had come within an estimated {{convert|65|ft|m}} of the crater's rim. Images from the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) show the tracks of the astronauts and the MET come to within 30&amp;nbsp;m of the rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/91-Trail-of-Discovery-at-Fra-Mauro.html |title=Trail of Discovery at Fra Mauro |last=Lawrence |first=Samuel |date=August 19, 2009 |work=Featured Images |publisher=LROC News System |location=Tempe, Arizona |access-date=May 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410062244/http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?%2Farchives%2F91-Trail-of-Discovery-at-Fra-Mauro.html |archive-date=April 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard and Mitchell deployed and activated various scientific instruments and experiments and collected almost {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of lunar samples for return to Earth, including the 20 pound (9&amp;nbsp;kg) [[Big Bertha (lunar sample)|Big Bertha]] rock. Other Apollo 14 achievements included the only use of MET; longest distance traversed by foot on the lunar surface; first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; and the first extensive orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.

[[Image:Apollo 14 golf.jpg|thumb|left|Lunar surface [[Apollo TV camera|television]] showing Shepard taking a couple of [[Golf#Stroke mechanics|golf swings]]]]

The astronauts also engaged in less serious activities on the Moon. Shepard brought along a [[Golf club#Iron|six iron golf club head]] which he could attach to the handle of a lunar excavation tool, and two golf balls, and took several one-handed swings (due to the limited flexibility of the EVA suit). He exuberantly exclaimed that the second ball went &quot;miles and miles and miles&quot; in the low lunar [[gravity]], but later estimated the distance as {{convert|200|to|400|yd|sp=us}}. Mitchell then threw a lunar scoop handle as if it were a [[Javelin throw|javelin]].

[[File:A14 basalt sample 14053.png|thumb|right|240px|Lunar sample 14053, a basalt found during Apollo 14]]

The Moon rocks, or lunar samples, from Apollo 14 are unique in that most of the 94 pounds of rocks are [[breccia]], which are rocks composed of fragments of other, older rocks. Breccias form when the heat and pressure of meteorite impacts fuse small rock fragments together. There were a few basalts that were collected in this mission in the form of clasts (fragments) in breccia. The Apollo 14 basalts are generally richer in aluminum and sometimes richer in potassium than other lunar basalts. Most [[lunar mare]] basalts collected during the Apollo program were formed from 3.0 to 3.8 billion years ago. The Apollo 14 basalts were formed 4.0 to 4.3 billion years ago, older than the volcanism observed at any of the mare locations studied during the Apollo program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_14/samples/ |title=Apollo 14 Mission Lunar Sample Overview |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute |format=URL |access-date=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2019 research showed that [[Big Bertha (lunar sample)|Big Bertha]], a 19.837 pound rock, has numerous characteristics that make it likely to be a terrestrial (Earth) meteorite. Granite and quartz, which are commonly found on Earth but very rare to find on the Moon, were confirmed to exist on Big Bertha. To find the sample's age, the research team from [[Curtin University]] looked at bits of the mineral zircon embedded in its structure. &quot;By determining the age of zircon found in the sample, we were able to pinpoint the age of the host rock at about four billion years old, making it similar to the oldest rocks on Earth,&quot; researcher Alexander Nemchin said, adding that &quot;the chemistry of the zircon in this sample is very different from that of every other zircon grain ever analyzed in lunar samples, and remarkably similar to that of zircons found on Earth.&quot; This means Big Bertha is both the first discovered terrestrial meteorite and the oldest known Earth rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Terrestrial-like zircon in a clast from an Apollo 14 breccia |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=510 |pages=173â€“185 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2019.01.010 |year=2019 |last1=Bellucci |first1=J.J. |last2=Nemchin |first2=A.A. |last3=Grange |first3=M. |last4=Robinson |first4=K.L. |last5=Collins |first5=G. |last6=Whitehouse |first6=M.J. |last7=Snape |first7=J.F. |last8=Norman |first8=M.D. |last9=Kring |first9=D.A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2019/01/a-moon-rock-collected-by-apollo-14-astronauts-likely-originated-on-earth |title=A lunar rock sample found by Apollo 14 astronauts likely came from Earth |publisher=Astronomy |format=URL |access-date=26 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return, splashdown and quarantine ===
[[File:Apollo14 - Landung.jpg|thumb|Apollo 14 landing]]
On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space.

The command module ''Kittyhawk'' splashed down in the South Pacific Ocean on February 9, 1971 at 21:05 [UTC], approximately {{convert|760|nmi|km}} south of [[American Samoa]]. After recovery by the ship [[USS New Orleans (LPH-11)|USS ''New Orleans'']], the crew was flown to [[Pago Pago International Airport]] in [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] for a reception before being flown on a [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter|C-141]] cargo plane to [[Honolulu]]. The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be [[Mobile Quarantine Facility|quarantined]] on their return from the Moon.

Roosa, who worked in forestry in his youth, took several hundred tree seeds on the flight. These were germinated after the return to Earth, and widely distributed around the world as commemorative [[Moon tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/moon_tree.html| title=The 'Moon Trees'| first=David R.| last=Williams| publisher=NASA| work=[[Goddard Space Flight Center]]| date=28 July 2009| accessdate=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
