[[Image:Argo Navis Hevelius.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The constellation Argo Navis drawn by [[Johannes Hevelius]]]]
'''Argo Navis''' (the Ship Argo), or simply '''Argo''', was a large [[constellation]] in the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern sky]] that has since been divided into the three constellations of [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], [[Puppis (constellation)|Puppis]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]]. The genitive was &quot;Argus Navis&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Arg&quot;. [[John Flamsteed|Flamsteed]] and other early modern astronomers called the constellation just '''Navis''' (the Ship), genitive &quot;Navis&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Nav&quot;.

It was identified in [[Greek mythology]] with the ''[[Argo]]'', the ship used by [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] that sailed to Colchis in search of the [[Golden Fleece]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridpath&quot; /&gt; The original constellation is presently found near the southern horizon of the Mediterranean sky, becoming visible in springtime and sailed westward, skimming along the &quot;river of the Milky Way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Massey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massey|first1=Gerald|title=Ancient Egypt – Light Of The World, Volume 2|publisher=Jazzybee Verlag|isbn=978-3-8496-7820-3|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXUtDwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[precession|precession of the equinoxes]], many of the stars of Argo have been shifted farther south since Classical times, and far fewer of its stars are visible today from the latitudes of the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
===Development of the Greek Constellation===
Argo Navis was long-known to Greek observers, who are believed to have derived it from Egypt around 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE. For example, [[Plutarch]] identified Argo with the Egyptian constellation called the &quot;Boat of [[Osiris]].&quot;  Although some academics theorized a [[Sumer]]ian origin related to the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], this hypothesis has been rejected as there is no evidence that the Sumerians or other Mesopotamian culture considered these stars, or any portion of them, to form a boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barentine |first=John |title=A History of Obsolete, Extinct, or Forgotten Star Lore |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-22795-5 |pages=72–73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_7NCgAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |ref=Barentine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the constellation became identified specifically with ancient Greek myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. In his [[Almagest]], Claudius [[Ptolemy]] described Argo Navis as occupying the portion of the Milky Way between [[Canis Major]] and [[Centaurus]], and identified stars comprising such details as the &quot;little shield&quot;, the &quot;steering-oar&quot;, the &quot;mast-holder&quot;, and the &quot;stern-ornament&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toomer |first=G.J. |title=Ptolemy's Almagest |date=1984 |publisher=Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd. |isbn=0715615882 |page=403 |url=https://isidore.co/calibre/get/pdf/Ptolemy%26%2339%3Bs%20Almagest%20-%20Ptolemy%2C%20Claudius%20%26amp%3B%20Toomer%2C%20G.%20J__5114.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which continued to be reflected in cartographic representations in celestial atlases into the nineteenth century (see below). Another interesting feature of the constellation is that it appeared to be moving backwards against the backdrop of the night sky. [[Aratus]], the Greek poet / historian living in the third century&amp;nbsp;BCE, noted this backward progression writing, &quot;Argo by the ''Great Dog's'' [Canis Major's] tail is drawn; for hers is not a usual course, but backward turned she comes&amp;nbsp;...&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown Jr.&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Robert Jr. |title=The ''Phainomena'', or the ''Heavenly Display'' of Aratos, done into English Verse |date=1885 |publisher=Longmans, Green |location=Oxford University |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Constituent Modern Constellations===
In modern times, Argo Navis was considered unwieldy due to its enormous size (28% larger than [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], the largest modern constellation).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridpath&quot; /&gt; In his 1763 star atlas, [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] explained that there were more than a hundred and sixty stars clearly visible to the naked eye in Navis, and so he used the set of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters three times on portions of the constellation referred to as &quot;''Argûs in carina''&quot; ([[Carina (constellation)|Carina]], the [[keel]] or hull), &quot;''Argûs in puppi''&quot; ([[Puppis (constellation)|Puppis]], the [[poop deck]] or [[stern]]), and &quot;''Argûs in velis''&quot; ([[Vela (constellation)|Vela]], the [[sail]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Nicolas Louis de Lacaille |first=Nicolas-Louis |last=de&amp;nbsp;Lacaille |year=1763 |title=Coelum Australe Stelliferum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacaille replaced Bayer's [[Bayer designation|designations]] with new ones that followed stellar magnitudes more closely, but used only a single Greek-letter sequence and described the constellation for those stars as &quot;Argûs&quot;. Similarly, faint unlettered stars were listed only as in &quot;Argûs&quot;.&lt;ref name=lacaille/&gt;

The final breakup and abolition of Argo Navis was proposed by [[Sir John Herschel]] in 1841 and again in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herschel |first=John F. W. |year=1844 |title=Further remarks on the revision of the constellations |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=6 |issue=5 |page=60 |bibcode=1844MNRAS...6...60H |doi=10.1093/mnras/6.5.60|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2353007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the constellation remained in use in parallel with its constituent parts into the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. In 1922, along with the other constellations, it received a three-letter abbreviation: ''Arg''.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R |title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations |journal=Popular Astronomy |volume=30 |pages=469 |author=Russell |first1=Henry Norris |year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakup and relegation to a [[former constellation]] occurred in 1930 when the IAU defined the [[88 modern constellations|88&amp;nbsp;modern]] constellations, formally instituting ''Carina'', ''Puppis'', and ''Vela'', and declaring ''Argo'' obsolete.&lt;ref name=iau&gt;{{cite book |last=del&amp;nbsp;Porte |first=E. |year=1930 |title=Delimitation scientifique des constellations (tables et cartes) |bibcode=1930dsct.book.....D |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacaille's designations were kept in the three separate constellations, so ''Carina'' has α, β, and ε; ''Vela'' has γ and δ; ''Puppis'' has ζ; and so on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagman&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagman |first=M. |year=2003 |title=Lost Stars: Lost, missing, and troublesome stars from the catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas-Louis de&amp;nbsp;Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and sundry others |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYLvAAAAMAAJ |publisher=McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-939923-78-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}} As a result of this breakup, Argo Navis is the only one of the 48&amp;nbsp;constellations listed by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' that is no longer officially recognized as a single constellation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ley196312&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=December 1963 |title=The Names of the Constellations |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v22n02_1963-12#page/n46/mode/1up |department=For Your Information |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=90–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the constellation ''[[Pyxis]]'' (the [[mariner's compass]]) occupies an area near that which in antiquity was considered part of Argo's mast. Some recent authors state that modern Pyxis was part of the ancient Greek conception of Argo Navis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Scalzi, John |title=Rough Guide to the Universe |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetouniv0000scal |url-access=registration |date=1 May 2008 |publisher=[[Rough Guides Limited]] |isbn=978-1-84353-800-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kelley, David H. |author2=Milone, Eugene F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A survey of ancient and cultural astronomy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC |date=16 February 2011 |publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]] |isbn=978-1-4419-7624-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but magnetic compasses were unknown in ancient Greek times, nor does it appear that the stars now in Pyxis were included in the original conception of Argo Navis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridpath&quot; /&gt; Lacaille considered it a separate constellation representing a modern scientific instrument (like ''[[Microscopium]]'' and ''[[Telescopium]]''), that he created for maps of the stars of the southern hemisphere. Pyxis was listed among his 14&amp;nbsp;new constellations, separate from Argo.{{efn|Lacaille assigned Bayer designations to ''Pyxis'' separate from those of ''Argo'', and his illustration shows an isolated instrument not related to the figure of the ship.&lt;ref name=lacaille&gt;{{cite book |last=de&amp;nbsp;Lacaille |first=N.L. |year=1763 |title=Coelum australe stelliferum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIo_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PP7 |publisher=H.L.

Delatour |pages=7ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=lacaille/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wagman&quot; /&gt;{{rp|262}} In 1844, John Herschel suggested formalizing the mast as a new constellation, [[Malus (constellation)|''Malus'']], to replace Lacaille's ''Pyxis'', but the idea did not catch on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ridpath&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/argo.htm |title=Argo Navis |author=Ridpath, Ian |author-link=Ian Ridpath |website=Star Tales |accessdate=14 Mar 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an effort by [[Edmond Halley]] to detach the [[IC 2602|&quot;cloud of mist&quot;]] at the prow of Argo Navis to form a new constellation named ''[[Robur Carolinum]]'' (Charles' Oak) in honor of [[Charles II of England|King Charles&amp;nbsp;II]], his patron, was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnetine |first=John C. |title=The Lost Constellations: A history of obsolete, extinct, or forgotten star lore |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-22795-5 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_7NCgAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |ref=Barentine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representations in other cultures==
The [[Māori people|Māori]] had several names for what was the constellation ''Argo'', including ''Te Waka-o-Tamarereti'' (the canoe of Tamarereti),&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robertson |first1=Margaret |last2=Po Eung |first2=Eric |title=Everyday Knowledge, Education, and Sustainable Futures: Transdisciplinary approaches in the Asia-Pacific region |date=June 1, 2016 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-9811002168 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Te Kohi-a-Autahi'' (an expression meaning &quot;cold of autumn settling down on land and water&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Best&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Best |first=Elsdon |title=Food Products of Tuhoeland: being notes on the food-supplies of non-agricultural tribes of the natives of New Zealand; together with some account of various customs, superstitions, &amp;c., pertaining to foods |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of New Zealand |date=July 1903 |volume=35 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Te Kohi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Maud Worcester Makemson |title=The Morning Star Rises: An account of Polynesian astronomy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pj0eAAAAIAAJ |via=Google Books |year=1941 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
