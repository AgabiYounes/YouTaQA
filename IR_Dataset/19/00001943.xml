The party's inaugural leader was [[Don Chipp]], a former Liberal cabinet minister, who famously promised to &quot;keep the bastards honest&quot;. At the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]], the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|lower house]]. The party's share of the vote collapsed at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]] and was further diminished [[2007 Australian federal election|in 2007]] with the last senators leaving office in 2008.

Due to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST). Ideologically, the Democrats were usually regarded as [[Centrism|centrists]], occupying the political middle ground between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party.

The party was formally deregistered in 2016 for not having the required 500 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/democrats.htm|title=The Australian Democrats|last=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street|first=Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23 26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=8 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 the Australian Democrats merged with [[CountryMinded|Country Minded]], an Australian political party seeking accountable regional and agricultural representation.&lt;ref name=chan&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/11/alex-turnbull-would-fund-moderate-independents-to-fight-abbott-and-joyce|title=Alex Turnbull would fund moderate independents to fight Abbott and Joyce|last=Chan|first=Gabrielle|date=2018-11-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On 7 April 2019 the merged entity regained registration of the name &quot;Australian Democrats&quot; with the Australian Electoral Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registration_Decisions/index.htm|title=Party registration decisions and changes|last=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street|first=Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23 26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party unsuccessfully contested the lower-house seat of Adelaide and a total of six Senate seats (two in each state of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.australian-democrats.org.au/our-candidates/ Our candidates]. Australian Democrats website, Retrieved 26 May 2019&lt;/ref&gt;  at the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://tallyroom.aec.gov.au/SenateStateResultsMenu-24310.htm State and territory [Senate] results]. Australian Electoral Commission, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The party was founded on principles of honesty, tolerance, compassion and [[direct democracy]] through postal ballots of all members, so that &quot;there should be no [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure ... by which a carefully engineered elite could make decisions for the members.&quot;&lt;ref name=thirdman&gt;Chipp D and Larkin J ''The Third Man'' Rigby, Melbourne (1978) {{ISBN|0-7270-0827-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p187}} From the outset, members' participation was fiercely protected in national and divisional constitutions prescribing internal elections, regular meeting protocols, annual conferences—and monthly journals for open discussion and balloting. Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.

Policies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.

The Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause célèbre'' of the [[Franklin Dam controversy#Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election|Franklin River Dam]].

The party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].&lt;/ref&gt; This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming &quot;the electoral objective&quot; as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their numbers on the cross benches during the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]—which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices.

Over three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004]] and [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;results.aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[2010 South Australian state election#Upper house|2010]].

==History==

===1977–1986: Foundation and Don Chipp's leadership===
The Australian Democrats were formed in May 1977 from an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New Liberal Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp25|title=Australian Democrats: the passing of an era|last=7111|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two groups found a common basis for a new political movement in the widespread discontent with the two major parties. In the former Liberal Government Minister, Don Chipp, the two groups found their leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;aph.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp25#_ftn7|title=Australian Democrats: the passing of an era|last=7111|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Australian Democrat to sit in the federal parliamentarian was Senator [[Janine Haines]] who in 1977 was nominated by the South Australian Parliament to fill the casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Liberal Senator [[Steele Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aph.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

The party's broad aim was to achieve a balance of power in one or more parliaments and to exercise it responsibly in line with policies determined by membership.

In 1977, the Australian Democrats secured two seats in the Senate with the election of Colin Mason (NSW) and Don Chipp (VIC). In 1980, this increased to five seats with the election of Michael Macklin (QLD) and John Siddons (VIC) and the re-election of Janine Haines (SA). Thereafter they frequently held enough seats to give them the balance of power in the upper chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Australian-Democrats|title=Australian Democrats {{!}} political party, Australia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Melbourne media conference on 19 September 1980, in the midst of the [[1980 Australian federal election|1980 election campaign]], Chipp described his party's aim as to &quot;keep the bastards honest&quot;—the &quot;bastards&quot; being the major parties and/or politicians in general. This became a long-lived slogan for the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/rp/2008-09/09rp25.pdf Cathy Madden, Research Paper, &quot;Australian Democrats: the passing of an era&quot;, p. 2 and note 6, 27 March 2009]; Retrieved 1 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Australia, the New Liberal Movement dissolved and merged with the Democrats, making its sole parliamentary representative, [[Robin Millhouse]], the Democrats' first member of the South Australian parliament. Millhouse held his seat ([[Electoral district of Mitcham (South Australia)|Mitcham]]) at the [[1977 South Australian state election|1977]] and [[1979 South Australian state election|1979]] state elections. In 1982, Millhouse resigned to take up a senior judicial appointment, and [[Heather Southcott]] won the [[1982 Mitcham state by-election|by-election]] for the Democrats, but lost the seat to the Liberals later that year at the [[1982 South Australian state election|1982 state election]]. Mitcham was the only single-member lower-house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats.

===1986–1990: Janine Haines' leadership===
[[File:HainesChipp.jpg|thumb|[[Janine Haines]] and [[Don Chipp]], the first two leaders of the Australian Democrats]]
Don Chipp resigned from the Senate on 18 August 1986, being succeeded as party leader by Janine Haines and replaced as a senator for Victoria by [[Janet Powell]].

At the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 election]] following a [[double dissolution]], the reduced [[Australian Senate#Voting system|quota]] of 7.7% necessary to win a seat assisted the election of three new senators. 6-year terms were won by [[Paul McLean (politician)|Paul McLean]] (NSW) and incumbents Janine Haines (South Australia) and Janet Powell (Victoria). In South Australia, a second senator, [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]], was elected for a 3-year term, as were incumbent Michael Macklin (Queensland) and [[Jean Jenkins (politician)|Jean Jenkins]] (Western Australia).
1990 saw the voluntary departure from the Senate of Janine Haines (a step with which not all Democrats agreed) and the failure of her strategic goal of winning the House of Representatives seat of [[Division of Kingston|Kingston]].

The casual vacancy was filled by [[Meg Lees]] several months before the election of [[Cheryl Kernot]] in place of retired deputy leader Michael Macklin. The ambitious Kernot immediately contested the party's national parliamentary deputy leadership. Being unemployed at the time, she requested and obtained party funds to pay for her travel to address members in all seven divisions.&lt;ref&gt;AD ''National Journal'' June 1990, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Victorian [[Janet Powell]] was elected as leader and [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]] was chosen as deputy leader.

===1990-1993: Janet Powell and John Coulter===

Despite the loss of Haines and the WA Senate seat (through an inconsistent national preference agreement with the ALP), the 1990 federal election heralded something of a rebirth for the party, with a dramatic rise in primary vote. This was at the same time as an economic [[recession]] was building, and events such as the [[Gulf War]] in Kuwait were beginning to shepherd issues of globalisation and transnational trade on to national government agendas.

The Australian Democrats had a long-standing policy to oppose war and so opposed Australia's support of, and participation in, the Gulf War. Whereas the House of Representatives was able to avoid any debate about the war and Australia's participation,&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;The sole independent member in the House, [[Ted Mack (politician)|Ted Mack]], was unable to launch his critical motion for lack of a seconder.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Iraq%20%20Dataset%3Ahansardr,hansards,hansardr80,hansards80%20%28%28SpeakerId%3AAT4%29%29%20Date%3A01%2F08%2F1990%20%3E%3E%2001%2F04%2F1992;rec=0;resCount=Default |title=Ted Mack's speech on Gulf War |publisher=Parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Democrats took full advantage of the opportunity to move for a debate in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=393706&amp;TABLE=HANSARDS |title=Senate Hansard, 21&amp;nbsp;Jan 1991 |publisher=Parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604000618/http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?ID=393706&amp;TABLE=HANSARDS |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the party's [[Pacifism|pacifist]]-based opposition to the Gulf War, there was mass-media antipathy and negative publicity which some construed as poor media performance by Janet Powell, the party's standing having stalled at about 10%. Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party's first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell's alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support. When this charge was deemed insufficient, interested party officers and senators reinforced it with negative [[News leak|media 'leaks']] concerning her openly established relationship with [[Sid Spindler]]&lt;ref&gt;Paas, Hans. [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/07/04/1025667033717.html A cautionary tale of hypocrisy and ambition]. ''[[The Age]]'', 5 July 2002. Accessed 22 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and exposure of administrative failings resulting in excessive overtime to a staff member. With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]]. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip [[Paul McLean (politician)|Paul McLean]] who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by [[Karin Sowada]]. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired. In later years, she campaigned for the Australian Greens.

===1993–1997: Cheryl Kernot===

The party's parliamentary influence was weakened in 1996 after the [[Howard Government]] was elected, and a Labor senator, [[Mal Colston]], resigned from the Labor Party. Since the Democrats now shared the parliamentary balance of power with two Independent senators, the Coalition government was able on occasion to pass legislation by negotiating with Colston and [[Brian Harradine]].

In October 1997, party leader [[Cheryl Kernot]] resigned, announcing that she would be joining the [[Australian Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/97-10-15kernot-resigns.shtml |title=Cheryl Kernot's Resignation Speech |publisher=AustralianPolitics.com |date=15 October 1997 |accessdate=23 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526164818/https://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/97-10-15kernot-resigns.shtml |archivedate=26 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Five years later it was revealed that she had been in a sexual relationship with Labor deputy leader [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===1997-2004: Meg Lees, Natasha Stott Despoja and Andrew Bartlett===
Under Lees' leadership, in the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], the Democrats' candidate [[John Schumann]] came within 2 per cent of taking Liberal Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]]'s seat of [[Division of Mayo|Mayo]] in the Adelaide Hills under Australia's [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system. The party's representation increased to nine senators, and they regained the balance of power, holding it until the Coalition gained a Senate majority at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]].

Internal conflict and leadership tensions from 2000 to 2002, blamed on the party's support for the Government's [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST), was damaging to the Democrats. Opposed by the Labor Party, the [[Australian Greens]] and independent Senator Harradine, the GST required Democrat support to pass. In an election fought on tax, the Democrats publicly stated that they liked neither the Liberal (GST) tax package nor the Labor package, but pledged to work with whichever party was elected to make their tax package better. They campaigned with the slogan &quot;No GST on food&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/elections/1998/news3.shtml |title=(Day 21) Democrats Support GST, Want Food Exempt |publisher=AustralianPolitics.com |date=19 September 1998 |accessdate=22 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405091416/http://australianpolitics.com/elections/1998/news3.shtml |archivedate=5 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, after negotiations with Prime Minister [[John Howard|Howard]], Meg Lees, [[Andrew Murray (Australian politician)|Andrew Murray]] and the party room senators agreed to support the A New Tax System (ANTS) legislation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov.au/contentitem.asp?ContentID=167&amp;NavID= |title=Australian Treasury: Tax Reform: Not a New Tax, A New Tax System |publisher=Treasury.gov.au |date=1 August 1998 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315151452/https://www.treasury.gov.au/contentitem.asp?ContentID=167&amp;NavID= |archivedate=15 March 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with exemptions from GST for most food and some medicines, as well as many environmental and social concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Democrats: [http://www.democrats.org.au/docs/2004/TAXATION_GST.pdf The GST and the New Tax System] Election 2004 Issue Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senator Meg Lees's address to the Australian Democrats' National Conference, Brisbane, 20 January 2001 {{cite web |url=http://australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/01-01-20lees-speech.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927184311/http://australianpolitics.com/parties/democrats/01-01-20lees-speech.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Five Australian Democrats senators voted in favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|first=Alexandra|last= Kirk|title=Democrats make good on GST compromise deal|date=19 June 1999|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s31775.htm|work=ABC PM, Radio National}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two dissident senators on the party's left [[Natasha Stott Despoja]] and [[Andrew Bartlett]] voted against the GST.&lt;ref&gt;ABC TV: 7.30 Report: 7/6/1999: [&quot;GST deal sparks Democrat crisis&quot; http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s28235.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111043021/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s28235.htm |date=11 November 2012 }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Kehoe &quot;Lees has no regrets Democrats gave their support&quot; ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' 30 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a leadership spill saw Meg Lees replaced as leader&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Coorey &quot;Democrats in Denial&quot; in David Solomon (ed) ''Howard's Race – Winning the Unwinnable Election'', Harper Collins, 2002, p42-44&lt;/ref&gt; by Natasha Stott Despoja after a very public and bitter leadership battle.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Rogers, ''The Natasha Factor'', Lothian Books, 2004, pp29ff&lt;/ref&gt; Despite criticism of Stott Despoja's youth and lack of experience, the 2001 election saw the Democrats receive similar media coverage to the previous election.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Coorey &quot;Democrats Opt for Leadership&quot; in David Solomon (ed) ''Howard's Race – Winning the Unwinnable Election'', Harper Collins, 2002, p180&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the internal divisions, the Australian Democrats' election result in 2001 was quite good. However, it was not enough to prevent the loss of [[Vicki Bourne]]'s Senate seat in NSW.

The [[2002 South Australian state election|2002 South Australian election]] was the last time an Australian Democrat would be elected to an Australian parliament. [[Sandra Kanck]] was re-elected to a second eight-year term from an upper house primary vote of 7.3 percent.

Resulting tensions between Stott Despoja and Lees led to Meg Lees leaving the party in 2002, becoming an independent and forming the [[Australian Progressive Alliance]].  Stott Despoja stood down from the leadership following a loss of confidence by her party room colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s655339.htm Stott Despoja resigns as Democrats leader] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115013317/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s655339.htm |date=15 January 2005 }}, ABC 7.30 Report, 21 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; It led to a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator [[Andrew Bartlett]] as leader.  While the public fighting stopped, the public support for the party remained at record lows.

On 6 December 2003, Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he swore at [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Senator [[Jeannie Ferris]] on the floor of [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] while intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/06/1070625583872.html |title=Disgraced leader steps aside |work=The Age |date= 7 December 2003 |accessdate=3 April 2007 |location=Melbourne, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party issued a statement stating that deputy leader [[Lyn Allison]] would serve as the acting leader of the party. Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On 29 January 2004, after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Australian Democrats leadership, vowing to abstain from alcohol.

===Decline===
Following internal conflict over [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] (1998–2001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline occurred in the Democrats' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the [[Australian Greens]] who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial [[third party (politics)|third party]]. The trend was noted that year by political scientists [[Dean Jaensch]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;the Australian Democrats appear to be in decline, having performed very poorly at the 2004 federal election and look to be replaced by the Greens as the major 'minor' party&quot;. --Jaensch D. et al. ''[http://democratic.audit.anu.edu.au/papers/focussed_audits/200501_jaensch_parties.pdf Australian Political Parties in the Spotlight] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026234626/http://democratic.audit.anu.edu.au/papers/focussed_audits/200501_jaensch_parties.pdf |date=26 October 2009 }}'' pp 40–41. Australian National University, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Support for the Australian Democrats fell significantly at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]] in which they achieved only 2.4 per cent of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban [[Adelaide]] in South Australia, where they received between 1 and 4 percent of the lower house vote; by comparison, they tallied between 7 and 31 per cent of the vote in 2001. Three incumbent senators were defeated—[[Aden Ridgeway]] (NSW), [[Brian Greig]] (WA) and [[John Cherry (Australian politician)|John Cherry]] (Qld). Following the loss, the customary post-election leadership ballot installed Allison as leader, with Bartlett as her deputy. From 1 July 2005 the Australian Democrats lost official parliamentary party status, being represented by only four senators while the governing Liberal-National Coalition gained a majority and potential control of the Senate—the first time this advantage had been enjoyed by any government since 1980.

====Death of Chipp====
On 28 August 2006, the founder of the Australian Democrats, Don Chipp, died. Former prime minister Bob Hawke said: &quot;... there is a coincidental timing almost between the passing of Don Chipp and what I think is the death throes of the Democrats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200608/s1727334.htm |title=Hawke predicts end is near for Democrats |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205091132/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200608/s1727334.htm |archivedate=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, the Australian Democrats fared very poorly in the Victorian state election, receiving a Legislative Council vote tally of only 0.83%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/state2006resultbypartyUH.html |title=Victorian Electoral Commission: Results for Upper House, 2006 |publisher=Vec.vic.gov.au |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416165522/http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/State2006resultbypartyUH.html |archivedate=16 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; less than half of the party's result in 2002 (1.79 per cent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/state2002resultbypartyprovince.html |title=Victorian Electoral Commission: Results for Upper House, 2006 |publisher=Vec.vic.gov.au |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405222227/http://www.vec.vic.gov.au/State2002resultbypartyprovince.html |archivedate=5 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State/territory losses====
The Tasmanian division of the party was deregistered for having insufficient members in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/items/200601/1542299.htm?tasmania |title=Australian Democrats Deregistered in Tasmania |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 January 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622171235/http://www.abc.net.au/news/items/200601/1542299.htm?tasmania |archivedate=22 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2006, at the [[2006 South Australian state election|2006 South Australian election]], the Australian Democrats were reduced to 1.7 per cent of the Legislative Council (upper house) vote. Their sole councillor up for re-election, [[Kate Reynolds]], was defeated. In July 2006, Richard Pascoe, national and [[South Australia]]n party president, resigned, citing slumping opinion polls and the poor result in the 2006 South Australian election as well as South Australian parliamentary leader [[Sandra Kanck]]'s comments regarding the drug [[MDMA]] which he saw as damaging to the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-11/political-analyst-predicts-democrats-demise/1798378|title=Political analyst predicts Democrats' demise|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation  |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1683993.htm |title=Former leader sees Democrats in 'tatters' |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205083545/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200607/s1683993.htm |archivedate=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060706220404/http://www.theadvertiser.news.com.au/common/story_page/0%2C5936%2C19698296%5E910%2C00.html Kanck says rave party safer than the front bar, ''The Advertiser'' 5 July 2006] Article no longer available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the New South Wales state election of March 2007, the Australian Democrats lost their last remaining NSW Upper House representative, [[Arthur Chesterfield-Evans]]. The party fared poorly, gaining only 1.8 per cent of the Legislative Council vote. On 13 September 2007, the ACT Democrats (Australian Capital Territory Division of the party) was deregistered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ni/2007-279/default.asp |title=ACT legislation register – Electoral (Cancellation of the Registration of the Australian Democrats) Notice 2007 – main page |publisher=Legislation.act.gov.au |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123082003/http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ni/2007-279/default.asp |archivedate=23 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the ACT Electoral Commissioner, being unable to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100 electors.

The Democrats had no success at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]]. Two incumbent senators, Lyn Allison (Victoria) and [[Andrew Bartlett]] (Queensland), were defeated, their seats both reverting to major parties. Their two remaining colleagues, Andrew Murray (WA) and Natasha Stott Despoja (SA), retired. All four senators' terms expired on 30 June 2008—leaving the Australian Democrats with no federal representation for the first time since its founding in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell A ''[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/11/26/2101885.htm?site=elections/federal/2007 Democrats to lose parliamentary representation]'' 26 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2009, Jaensch suggested it was possible the Democrats could make a political comeback at the [[2010 South Australian state election|2010 South Australian election]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dean Jaensch]] radio interview, [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2631202.htm Last remaining Democrat MP could become independent], at [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation#Radio|ABC PM]], 20 July 2009. Retrieved 12 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but this did not occur.

====Deregistration====
The last of the party's state upper-house members, [[David Winderlich]], resigned from the party in October 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,26177316-2682,00.html?from=public_rss |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130627101506/http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,26177316-2682,00.html?from=public_rss |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 June 2013 |title=David Winderlich quits, Democrats are no more |publisher=News.com.au |date=7 October 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | first1=Russell | last1=Emmerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was defeated as an independent at the 2010 election.

On 16 April 2015, the Australian Electoral Commission deregistered the Australian Democrats as a political party for failure to demonstrate the requisite 500 members to maintain registration.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec deregister&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/democrats.htm|title=The Australian Democrats|work=Funding, Disclosure and Political Parties: Political Party Registration: Deregistered/renamed political parties|publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|date=16 April 2015|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the party did run candidates and remain registered for a period of time thereafter in the New South Wales Democrats and [[Queensland Democrats|Queensland Democrat]] divisions. 

===Renewed registration===
In November 2018 there was a report that [[CountryMinded]], a de-registered microparty, would merge with the Australian Democrats in a new bid to seek membership growth, electoral re-registration and financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Gabrielle. &quot;[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/nov/11/alex-turnbull-would-fund-moderate-independents-to-fight-abbott-and-joyce Alex Turnbull would fund moderate independents to fight Abbott and Joyce]&quot;. [[The Guardian]], 11 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2019, application for registration was submitted to the AEC and was upheld on 7 April 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registration_Decisions/index.htm|title=Party registration decisions and changes|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date= |access-date=10 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registration_Decisions/2019/the-great-australian-party-statement-of-reasons.pdf|title=Notices |accessdate=6 March 2019 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite an objection from the [[Australian Democrats (Queensland Division)]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/applications/files/2019/australian-democrats-objection-01-redacted.pdfReasons for registration], 25 March 2019.
