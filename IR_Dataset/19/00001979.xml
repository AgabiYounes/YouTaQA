Alpha Centauri A and B are [[Sun-like]] stars ([[G-type main-sequence star|Class G]] and [[K-type main-sequence star|K]]), and together they form the [[binary star]] Alpha Centauri AB. To the [[naked eye]], the two main components appear to be a single star with an [[apparent magnitude]] of −0.27, the brightest star in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Centaurus]] and the [[List of brightest stars|third-brightest]] in the [[night sky]], outshone only by [[Sirius]] and [[Canopus]].

Alpha Centauri A has 1.1 times the mass and 1.519 times the [[Solar luminosity|luminosity of the Sun]], while Alpha Centauri B is smaller and cooler, at 0.907 times the [[Solar mass|Sun's mass]] and 0.445 times its luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Nomenclature ==
''α Centauri'' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] to ''Alpha Centauri'') is the system's [[Bayer designation|designation]] given by [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603. It bears the traditional name ''Rigil Kentaurus'', which is a Latinisation of the Arabic name {{lang|ar|رِجْل القِنْطورُس|rtl=yes}} ''Rijl al-Qinṭūrus,'' meaning 'the Foot of the [[Centaurus|Centaur]]'.&lt;ref name=&quot;K&amp;S&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name is frequently abbreviated to ''Rigil Kent'' or even ''Rigil'', though the latter name is better known for Beta Orionis ([[Rigel]]).&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;R.H. Allen, ''Star Names and their Meanings''.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative name found in European sources, ''Toliman'', is an approximation of the Arabic {{lang|ar|الظَّلِيمَان|rtl=yes}} ''aẓ-Ẓalīmān'' (in older transcription, ''aṭ-Ṭhalīmān''), meaning 'the (two male) Ostriches', an appellation Kazwini had applied to [[Lambda Sagittarii|Lambda]] and [[Mu Sagittarii]], also in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;ظَلِيمٌ ذ, in Edward William Lane, ''An Arabic–English Lexicon''&lt;/ref&gt;

A third name that has been applied is ''Bungula'' {{IPAc-en|'|b|V|N|g|juː|l|@}}, of obscure origin. Allen can only surmise it may have been coined from [[β]] and Latin ''ungula'' 'hoof'.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

== Stellar system ==
Alpha Centauri is a triple star system, with its two main stars, Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A and Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B, being a [[Binary star|binary]] component. The ''AB'' designation, or older ''A×B'', denotes the mass centre of a main binary system relative to companion star(s) in a multiple star system.&lt;ref name=&quot;DoubleStarsHeintz&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''AB-C'' refers to the component of Proxima Centauri in relation to the central binary, being the distance between the centre of mass and the outlying companion. Because the distance between Proxima (C) and either of Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A or B is similar, the AB binary system is sometimes treated as a single gravitational object.&lt;ref name=&quot;wds1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The large proper motion of Alpha Centauri AB was discovered by [[Manuel John Johnson]], observing from [[Saint Helena]], who informed [[Thomas Henderson (astronomer)|Thomas Henderson]] at the [[Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope]] of it. The parallax of Alpha Centauri was subsequently determined by Henderson from many exacting positional observations of the AB system between April 1832 and May 1833. He withheld his results, however, because he suspected they were too large to be true, but eventually published them in 1839 after [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] released his own accurately determined parallax for [[61 Cygni]] in 1838.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated345&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==== Alpha Centauri Bb{{Anchor|Alpha Centauri Bc}}====
{{Main|Alpha Centauri Bb}}
In 2012, a planet around Alpha Centauri B was announced, Alpha Centauri Bb, but in 2015 a new analysis concluded that it almost certainly does not exist and was just a spurious artefact of the data analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a18003/no-alpha-centauri-b-planet/|title=It Turns Out the Closest Exoplanet to Us Doesn't Actually Exist|last=Wenz|first=John|date=2015-10-29|website=Popular Mechanics|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151028-planet-disappears-alpha-centauri-astronomy-science/|title=Poof!

==== Unconfirmed discovery ====
Whilst ruling out the existence of Alpha Centauri Bb, a possible transit of a separate exoplanet in 2013 was observed. The transit event could correspond to a planetary body with a radius around {{Earth radius|0.92|link=y}}. This planet would most likely orbit Alpha Centauri B with an orbital period of 20.4 days or less, with only a 5 percent chance of it having a longer orbit. The median of the likely orbits is 12.4 days with an impact parameter of around 0–0.3. Its orbit would likely have an eccentricity of 0.24 or less.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demory2015&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Demory|first1=Brice-Olivier|last2=Ehrenreich|first2=David|last3=Queloz|first3=Didier|last4=Seager|first4=Sara|last5=Gilliland|first5=Ronald|last6=Chaplin|first6=William J.|last7=Proffitt|first7=Charles|last8=Gillon|first8=Michael|last9=Guenther|first9=Maximilian N.|display-authors=1|date=June 2015|title=Hubble Space Telescope search for the transit of the Earth-mass exoplanet Alpha Centauri Bb|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=450|issue=2|pages=2043–2051|arxiv=1503.07528|bibcode=2015MNRAS.450.2043D|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv673|last10=Benneke|first10=Bjoern|last11=Dumusque|first11=Xavier|last12=Lovis|first12=Christophe|last13=Pepe|first13=Francesco|last14=Segransan|first14=Damien|last15=Triaud|first15=Amaury|last16=Udry|first16=Stephane}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--If confirmed, this planet might be called Alpha Centauri Bc.

==== Hypothetical planets ====
Additional planets may exist in the Alpha Centauri system, either orbiting Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A or Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B individually, or in large orbits around Alpha Centauri AB. Because both stars are fairly similar to the Sun (for example, in age and [[metallicity]]), astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams have used various [[radial velocity]] or star [[Astronomical transit|transit]] methods in their searches around these two bright stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;universetoday.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 2009, computer simulations showed that a planet might have been able to form near the inner edge of Alpha Centauri B's habitable zone, which extends from 0.5 to 0.9 AU from the star. Certain special assumptions, such as considering that the Alpha Centauri pair may have initially formed with a wider separation and later moved closer to each other (as might be possible if they formed in a dense [[Open cluster|star cluster]]), would permit an accretion-friendly environment farther from the star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thebault 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Sun from Alpha Centauri.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Sun in the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] as seen from Alpha Centauri]]
The sky from Alpha Centauri AB would appear much as it does from the [[Earth]], except that [[Centaurus]] would be missing its brightest star. The [[Sun]] would appear as a yellow star of [[apparent magnitude]] +0.47, roughly the same as the average brightness of [[Betelgeuse]] from Earth. It would be at the [[antipodal point]] of Alpha Centauri AB's current [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], at {{RA|02|39|35}} {{DEC|+60|50}} (2000), in eastern [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], easily outshining all the rest of the stars in the [[constellation]]. With the placement of the Sun east of the magnitude 3.4 star [[Epsilon Cassiopeiae]], nearly in front of the [[Heart Nebula]], the &quot;W&quot; line of stars of Cassiopeia would have a &quot;/W&quot; shape.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The coordinates of the Sun would be diametrically opposite Alpha Centauri AB, at ''α''={{RA|02|39|36.4951}}, ''δ''={{DEC|+60|50|02.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The [[Winter Triangle]] would not look [[Equilateral triangle|equilateral]], but very thin and long, with [[Procyon]] outshining [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]] in the middle of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], and [[Sirius]] lying less than a degree from Betelgeuse in [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. With a magnitude of −1.2, Sirius would be a little fainter than from Earth but still the brightest star in the night sky. Both [[Vega]] and [[Altair]] would be shifted northwestward relative to [[Deneb]], giving the [[Summer Triangle]] a more equilateral appearance.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
