His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname &quot;''El Pibe de Oro''&quot; (&quot;The Golden Boy&quot;), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pibe&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/10/sezioni/sport/calcio/maradona-ct-argentina/maradona-ct-argentina/maradona-ct-argentina.html |title=La nuova vita del Pibe de Oro Maradona ct dell'Argentina |publisher=la Repubblica |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advanced [[playmaker]] who operated in the [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|classic number 10 position]], Maradona was the first player in football history to set the [[World football transfer record|world record transfer fee]] twice, first when he transferred to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] for a then world record £5 million, and second, when he transferred to [[S.S.C.

In his international career with [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], he earned 91 [[cap (sport)|caps]] and scored 34 goals. Maradona played in four [[FIFA World Cup]]s, including the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico where he captained Argentina and led them to [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|victory over West Germany]] in the final, and won the [[Golden Ball (FIFA)|Golden Ball]] as the tournament's best player. In the [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)|1986 World Cup quarter final]], he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over [[England national football team|England]] that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the &quot;[[The hand of God|Hand of God]]&quot;, while the second goal followed a {{convert|60|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} dribble past five England players, voted &quot;[[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The Goal of the Century|Goal of the Century]]&quot; by FIFA.com voters in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;voted&quot;&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=82406/index.html &quot;Diego Maradona goal voted the FIFA World Cup™ Goal of the Century&quot;].

[[File:Maradona passing caniggia.jpg|thumb|Maradona making the defence splitting pass to [[Claudio Caniggia]] (top right) for the winning goal against Brazil in the last 16 game on 24 June 1990]]
Maradona captained Argentina again in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy to yet another World Cup final. An ankle injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier. After losing their opening game to [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], Argentina were almost eliminated in the first round, only qualifying in third position from their group. In the round of 16 match against Brazil in [[Turin]], [[Claudio Caniggia]] scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fifa90&quot;&gt;[http://www.espnfc.com/feature/_/id/696774?cc=5739 &quot;World Cup 1990&quot;].ESPN.

In the quarter-final, Argentina faced [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in [[Florence]]; the match ended 0–0 after 120 minutes, with Argentina advancing in a penalty shootout even though Maradona's kick, a weak shot to the goalkeeper's right, was saved.   The semi-final against the host nation Italy at Maradona's club stadium in Naples, the Stadio San Paolo, was also resolved on penalties after a 1–1 draw. This time, however, Maradona was successful with his effort, daringly rolling the ball into the net with an almost exact replica of his unsuccessful kick in the previous round. At the [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] in [[Rome]], Argentina lost 1–0 to West Germany, the only goal being a penalty by [[Andreas Brehme]] in the 85th minute after a controversial foul on [[Rudi Völler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fifa90&quot;/&gt;

===1994 World Cup===
At the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the United States, Maradona played in only two games (both at the [[Foxboro Stadium]] near [[Boston]]), scoring one goal against [[Greece national football team|Greece]], before being sent home after failing a [[drug test]] for [[ephedrine]] [[doping (sport)|doping]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=After Second Test, Maradona Is Out of World Cup |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/01/sports/world-cup-94-after-second-test-maradona-is-out-of-world-cup.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring against Greece, Maradona had one of the most infamous World Cup [[goal celebration]]s as he ran towards one of the sideline cameras shouting with a distorted face and bulging eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;celebration&quot;/&gt; This turned out to be Maradona's last international goal for Argentina in what was his last appearance for his country.&lt;ref name=&quot;celebration&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/columns/story?id=790168&amp;cc=5739&amp;ver=global |title=First XI: World Cup celebrations |author=Jon Carter |journal=[[ESPN]] |date=26 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603233147/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/columns/story?id=790168&amp;cc=5739&amp;ver=global |archivedate=3 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the power drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA expelled him from USA '94, and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the second round by [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Maradona has also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play.&lt;ref&gt;Hylands, Alan.

The [[Captain (association football)|team leader]] on and off the field – he would speak up on a range of issues on behalf of the players – Maradona's ability as a player and his overpowering personality had a major positive effect on his team, with his 1986 World Cup teammate [[Jorge Valdano]] stating: &quot;Maradona was a technical leader: a guy who resolved all difficulties that may come up on the pitch. Firstly, he was in charge of making the miracles happen, that's something that gives team-mates a lot of confidence. Secondly, the scope of his celebrity was such that he absorbed all the pressures on behalf of his team-mates. What I mean is: one slept soundly the night before a game not just because you knew you were playing next to Diego and Diego did things no other player in the world could do, but also because unconsciously we knew that if it was the case that we lost then Maradona would shoulder more of the burden, would be blamed more, than the rest of us.

Born to a [[Roman Catholic]] family, his parents are Diego Maradona Senior and Dalma Salvadora Franco.  Maradona married long-time fiancée Claudia Villafañe on 7 November 1984 in Buenos Aires, and they had two daughters, Dalma Nerea (born 2 April 1987) and Gianinna Dinorah (born 16 May 1989), by whom he became a grandfather in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=La Liga |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/722/la-liga/2009/02/19/1117562/diego-maradona-becomes-a-grandfather-as-sergio-aguero-junior-is-b |title=Diego Maradona Becomes A Grandfather As Sergio Aguero Junior Is Born |publisher=Goal.com |date=19 February 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maradona and Villafañe divorced in 2004. Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all, as her parents remained on friendly terms.

Having previously been vocal in his support of [[neoliberal]] Argentine President [[Carlos Menem]] and his [[Harvard University]]-educated economist [[Domingo Cavallo]], Maradona has shown sympathy to [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideologies. He became friends with Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]] while receiving treatment on the island, with Castro stating, &quot;Diego is a great friend and very noble, too. There's also no question he’s a wonderful athlete and has maintained a friendship with Cuba to no material gain of his own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Maradona FIFA&quot;/&gt; He has a portrait of Castro [[tattoo]]ed on his left leg and one of Fidel's second in command, fellow Argentine [[Che Guevara]] on his right arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/argentina/story/0,,1635417,00.html |title=A big hand |work=The Observer |location=UK |accessdate=19 June 2006 |date=6 November 2005 |first=Chris |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, ''El Diego'', he dedicated the book to various people, including Castro.

Maradona was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez]]. In 2005, he came to Venezuela to meet Chávez, who received him in the [[Miraflores Palace]]. After this meeting, Maradona claimed that he had come with the aim of meeting a &quot;great man&quot; (&quot;''un grande''&quot; in Spanish), but he had met instead a gigantic man (&quot;''un gigante''&quot; in Spanish, meaning he was more than great). &quot;I believe in Chávez, I am [[Chavista]].
