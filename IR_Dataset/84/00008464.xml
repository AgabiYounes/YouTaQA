A '''disaccharide''' (also called a '''double sugar''' or '''''bivose'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/biose Biose on www.merriam-webster.org]&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[sugar]] formed when two [[monosaccharide]]s (simple sugars) are joined by [[Glycosidic bond|glycosidic]] linkage. Like monosaccharides, disaccharides are [[solubility|soluble]] in water. Three common examples are [[sucrose]], [[lactose]],&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=disaccharides|file=D01776}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[maltose]].

Disaccharides are one of the four chemical groupings of [[carbohydrate]]s  ([[monosaccharide]]s, disaccharides, [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s). The most common types of disaccharides—[[sucrose]], [[lactose]], and [[maltose]]—have 12 [[carbon]] atoms, with the general formula C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. The differences in these disaccharides are due to atomic arrangements within the molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology- A course for O Level|page=59|isbn=9810190964|last1=Kwan|first1=Lam Peng|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The joining of simple sugars into a double sugar happens by a [[condensation reaction]], which involves the elimination of a water molecule from the [[functional group]]s only. Breaking apart a double sugar into its two simple sugars is accomplished by [[hydrolysis]] with the help of a type of [[enzyme]] called a [[disaccharidase]]. As building the larger sugar ejects a water molecule, breaking it down consumes a water molecule. These reactions are vital in [[metabolism]]. Each disaccharide is broken down with the help of a corresponding disaccharidase ([[sucrase]], [[lactase]], and [[maltase]]).

==Classification==
There are two functionally different classes of disaccharides: 
*[[Reducing sugar|Reducing disaccharides]], in which one monosaccharide, the [[reducing sugar]] of the pair, still has a free [[hemiacetal]] unit that can perform as a reducing [[aldehyde]] group; [[lactose]], [[maltose]] and [[cellobiose]] are examples of reducing disaccharides, each with one hemiacetal unit, the other occupied by the [[Glycoside|glycosidic]] bond, which prevents it from acting as a [[reducing agent]]. They can easily be detected by the Woehlk test or Fearon's test on methylamine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How to visualize the different lactose content of dairy products by Fearon's test and Woehlk test in classroom experiments and a new approach to the mechanisms and formulae of the mysterious red dyes|journal = Chemistry Teacher International|language=en|doi = 10.1515/cti-2019-0008|year = 2019|last1 = Ruppersberg|first1 = Klaus|last2 = Herzog|first2 = Stefanie|last3 = Kussler|first3 = Manfred W.|last4 = Parchmann|first4 = Ilka}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[Reducing sugar|Non-reducing disaccharides]], in which the component monosaccharides bond through an [[acetal]] linkage between their [[Anomer|anomeric]] centers. This results in neither monosaccharide being left with a hemiacetal unit that is free to act as a [[reducing agent]].  [[Sucrose]] and [[trehalose]] are examples of non-reducing disaccharides because their glycosidic bond is between their respective hemiacetal carbon atoms. The reduced chemical reactivity of the non-reducing sugars in comparison to reducing sugars, may be an advantage where stability in storage is important. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Nomenclature of Carbohydrates (Recommendations 1996)2-Carb-36 Disaccharides.|url= http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/2carb/36.html|access-date= 2010-07-21|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170826141346/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/2carb/36.html|archive-date= 2017-08-26|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disaccharides and Oligosaccharides|url=http://faculty.virginia.edu/mcgarveylab/Carbsyn/Carblist/html/disacch.html|accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The formation of a disaccharide molecule from two [[monosaccharide]] molecules proceeds by displacing a [[hydroxyl]] [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] from one molecule and a [[Hydrogen atom|hydrogen nucleus]] (a [[proton]]) from the other, so that the now vacant bonds on the monosaccharides join the two [[monomer]]s together. The vacant bonds on the hydroxyl radical and the proton unite in their turn, forming a molecule of water, that then goes free. Because of the removal of the water molecule from the product, the term of convenience for such a process is &quot;[[dehydration reaction]]&quot; (also &quot;[[condensation reaction]]&quot; or &quot;[[Dehydration reaction|dehydration synthesis]]&quot;). For example, milk sugar ([[lactose]]) is a disaccharide made by condensation of one molecule of each of the monosaccharides [[glucose]] and [[galactose]], whereas the disaccharide [[sucrose]] in sugar cane and sugar beet, is a condensation product of [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]. [[Maltose]], another common disaccharide, is condensed from two glucose molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitney|first=Ellie|title=Understanding Nutrition|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=California|isbn=978-0-538-73465-3|pages=100|edition=Twelfth|author2=Sharon Rady Rolfes|editor=Peggy Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The dehydration reaction that bonds monosaccharides into disaccharides (and also bonds monosaccharides into more complex [[polysaccharide]]s) forms what are called [[glycosidic bond]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ochempal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.uvu.edu/ochem/index.php/alphabetical/g-h/glycosidic-link/ |title=Glycosidic Link |website=OChemPal |publisher=Utah Valley University |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The glycosidic bond can be formed between any hydroxyl group on the component monosaccharide.  So, even if both component [[sugar]]s are the same (e.g., [[glucose]]), different bond combinations (regiochemistry) and [[stereochemistry]] (''alpha-'' or ''beta-'') result in disaccharides  that are [[diastereoisomer]]s with different chemical and physical properties.

Depending on the [[monosaccharide]] constituents, disaccharides are sometimes crystalline, sometimes water-soluble, and sometimes sweet-tasting and sticky-feeling.

Digestion involves breakdown to the monosaccharides.
