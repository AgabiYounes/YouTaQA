'''Delphinus''' (Eng. U.S. {{IPAc-en|d|ɛ|l|ˈ|f|aɪ|n|ə|s}}) Eng. oth: {{IPAc-en|'|d|ɛ|l|f|ɪ|n|ə|s}}) is a [[constellation]] in the northern sky, close to the [[celestial equator]]. Its name  is the [[Latin]] version for the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[dolphin]] (δελφίνι). Delphinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer [[Ptolemy]], and it remains among the 88 modern constellations recognized by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. It is one of the smaller constellations, ranked 69th in size.

Delphinus' brightest stars form a distinctive [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that can easily be recognized. It is bordered (clockwise from north) by [[Vulpecula]] the fox, [[Sagitta]] the arrow, [[Aquila (constellation)|Aquila]] the eagle, [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] the water-carrier, [[Equuleus]] the foal and [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] the flying horse.

===Stars===
{{See also|List of stars in Delphinus}}
Delphinus lacks stars above fourth [[apparent magnitude|(apparent) magnitude]]; its brightest star is of magnitude 3.8. The main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] in Delphinus is '''Job's Coffin''', nearly a 45°-apex [[lozenge]] diamond of the four brightest stars: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Delphini. Delphinus is in a rich Milky Way star field. Alpha and Beta Delphini have 19th century names Sualocin and Rotanev, read backwards: Nicolaus Venator, the Latinized name of a [[Palermo Astronomical Observatory|Palermo Observatory]] director, [[Niccolò Cacciatore]] (d. 1841).{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=140-141}}

[[Alpha Delphini]] is a blue-white hued [[main sequence]] star of magnitude 3.8, 241 light-years from Earth.

[[Beta Delphini]], called Rotanev. The gap between its close [[binary star|binary]] stars is visible from large amateur telescopes. To the unaided eye, it appears to be a white star of magnitude 3.6. It has a period of 27 years and is 97 light-years from Earth.

[[Gamma Delphini]] is a celebrated binary star among amateur astronomers. The primary is orange-gold of magnitude 4.3; the secondary is a light yellow star of magnitude 5.1. The pair form a true binary with an estimated orbital period of over 3,000 years. 125 light-years away, the two components are visible in a small amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=140-141}} The secondary, also described as green, is 10 arcseconds from the primary. [[Struve 2725]], called the &quot;Ghost Double&quot;, is a pair that appears similar but dimmer. Its components of magnitudes 7.6 and 8.4 are separated by 6 arcseconds and are 15 arcminutes from Gamma Delphini itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;T&quot;/&gt;

[[Delta Delphini]] is a type [[A-type main sequence star|A7&amp;nbsp;IIIp]] star of magnitude 4.43.

[[Epsilon Delphini]], Deneb Dulfim ([[Arab astrology|lit.]] &quot;tail [of the] Dolphin&quot;), or Aldulfin, is a star of [[stellar classification|stellar class]] B6&amp;nbsp;III and magnitude 4, at 330 ly.&lt;ref name=ug&gt;http://www.universeguide.com/starsearch&lt;/ref&gt;

In Delphinus, in extremes of distance, '''[[Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars|Gliese]] 795''' is the closest known star at 54.95 ly and rapidly moves east over a period of centuries (863±3 [[arcsecond]]s per year); whereas the giant of blue colour, W Delphini is at 2203.81 ly at 9.76 magnitude.&lt;ref name=ug/&gt; Its brightness ranges from a magnitude of 12.3 to a magnitude of 9.7 over its variable period as it is a [[Beta Persei star]]-type semi-detached system. Other variable stars of large amateur telescopic visibility include '''R Delphini''', a [[Mira variable|Mira-type variable star]] with a period of 285.5 days. Its magnitude ranges between a maximum 7.6 and a minimum 13.8.

[[Rho Aquilae]] at magnitude 4.94 is at about 150 light years.&lt;ref name=scfs&gt;{{citation | display-authors=1 | title=Sixth Catalogue of Fundamental Stars (FK6). Part I. Basic fundamental stars with direct solutions | last1=Wielen | first1=R. | last2=Schwan | first2=H. | last3=Dettbarn | first3=C. | last4=Lenhardt | first4=H. | last5=Jahreiß | first5=H. | last6=Jährling | first6=R. | publisher=Astronomisches Rechen-Institut Heidelberg | issue=35 | year=1999 | bibcode=1999VeARI..35....1W | postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its [[proper motion]] it has been in the (round-figure parameter) bounds of the constellation since 1992.

===Deep-sky objects===
Its rich [[Milky Way]] star field means many modestly deep-sky objects. '''NGC 6891''' is a [[planetary nebula]] of magnitude 10.5; another is [[NGC 6905]] or the Blue Flash nebula. [[NGC 6934]] is a [[globular cluster]] of magnitude 9.75. At a distance of about 185,000 light-years, the globular cluster [[NGC 7006]] is at the outer reaches of the galaxy. It is also fairly dim at magnitude 11.5.

==Mythology==
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Delphinus, Sagitta, Aquila, and Antinous.jpg|left|thumb|Delphinus is depicted on the left of this card from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]'' (1825)]]
Delphinus is associated with two stories from [[Greek mythology]].

According to the first Greek god [[Poseidon]] wanted to marry [[Amphitrite]], a beautiful [[nereid]]. However, wanting to protect her virginity, she fled to the Atlas mountains. Her suitor then sent out several searchers, among them a certain Delphinus. Delphinus accidentally stumbled upon her and was able to persuade Amphitrite to accept Poseidon's wooing. Out of gratitude the god placed the image of a dolphin among the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html#17|title=HYGINUS, ASTRONOMICA 2.1-17|last=Pseudo-Hyginus|first=|date=|website=Theoi Classical Texts Library|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Never Cry Werewolf |last = Ravensdale |first = Kaede|url=https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12547405/8/Never-Cry-Werewolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second story tells of the Greek poet [[Arion]] of [[Lesbos]] (7th century BC), who was saved by a dolphin.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=140-141}} He was a court musician at the palace of Periander, ruler of Corinth. Arion had amassed a fortune during his travels to Sicily and Italy. On his way home from [[Taranto|Tarentum]] his wealth caused the crew of his ship to conspire against him. Threatened with death, Arion asked to be granted a last wish which the crew granted: he wanted to sing a dirge.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' I.23-24;&lt;br&gt;''also'' [[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Atticae'' XVI.19; [[Plutarch]], ''Conv. sept. sap.'' 160-62; [[Shakespeare]], ''Twelfth Night'' (Act I, Sc 2, line 16)&lt;/ref&gt; This he did, and while doing so, flung himself into the sea.  There, he was rescued by a dolphin which had been charmed by Arion's music. The dolphin carried Arion to the coast of Greece and left.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;T&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Celestial Dolphin |last = Schaaf |first = Fred |page = 47 |journal = Sky and Telescope |date = September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equivalents==
In [[Chinese astronomy]], the stars of Delphinus are located within ''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|the Black Tortoise of the North]]'' (北方玄武, ''Běi Fāng Xuán Wǔ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|zh}}  [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060704.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 4 日]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Polynesia]], two cultures recognized Delphinus as a constellation. In [[Pukapuka]], it was called ''Te Toloa'' and in the [[Tuamotus]], it was called ''Te Uru-o-tiki''.{{sfn|Makemson|1941|p=283}}

==Namesakes==
[[USS Delphinus (AF-24)]] and [[USS Delphinus (PHM-1)]], two United States Navy ships, are named after the constellation.
