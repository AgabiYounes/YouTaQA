'''''Doraemon''''' ({{lang-ja|ドラえもん}} {{IPA-ja|do̞ɾa̠e̞mõ̞ɴ}}) is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Fujiko Fujio]], the pen name of the duo Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. The series has also been adapted into a successful [[anime]] series and [[media franchise]]. The story revolves around an earless robotic cat named [[Doraemon (character)|Doraemon]], who [[time travel|travels back in time]] from the 22nd century to aid a boy named {{nihongo|[[Nobita Nobi]]|野比のび太|Nobi Nobita}}.

The first full story in the Doraemon manga series was published in January 1970. A pre-advertisement for the manga was published in six different magazines in December 1969. A total of 1,465 stories were created in the original series, which are published by [[Shogakukan]]. It is [[List of best-selling manga|one of the best-selling manga in the world]], and has sold over 100 million copies {{as of|2015|lc=y}}.

The volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]], Japan, where Fujiko Fujio was born. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] bought the rights to the Doraemon anime series in the mid-1980s for an English-language release in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jref.com/japan/travel/prefectures/kanagawa/doraemon_museum.shtml |title=Fujiko F.

In July 2013, [[Voyager Books|Voyager Japan]] announced the manga would be released digitally in English via the [[Amazon Kindle]] [[e-book]] service.

Awards for Doraemon include the [[Japan Cartoonists Association Award]] for excellence in 1973, the first [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[Children's anime and manga|children's manga]] in 1982, and the first [[Osamu Tezuka Culture Award]] in 1997. In March 2008, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japan's Foreign Ministry]] appointed Doraemon as the nation's first &quot;anime ambassador.&quot; A Ministry spokesperson explained the novel decision as an attempt to help people in other countries understand Japanese anime better and to deepen their interest in [[Japanese culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/431177|title=Doraemon named 'anime ambassador'|last=AFP|date=March 15, 2008|website=[[Japan Today]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318231731/http://www.japantoday.com/jp/news/431177|archive-date=March 18, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foreign Ministry action confirms that Doraemon has come to be considered a Japanese cultural icon. [[Doraemon in India|In India]], its [[Hindi]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] translation has been telecasted, where the anime version is the highest-rated kids' show; winning the ''Best Show For Kids'' award twice at the [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards India]] in 2013 and 2015. In 2002 ''[[Time Asia]]'' magazine acclaimed the character as an &quot;Asian Hero&quot; in a special feature survey. An edited English dub distributed by [[TV Asahi]] aired on [[Disney XD]] in the United States started on July 7, 2014. On August 17, 2015, another English dubbed version distributed by Luk Internacional began broadcasting on [[Boomerang (UK &amp; Ireland)|Boomerang UK]].

{{See also|List of Doraemon characters}}
Doraemon, a cat robot from the 22nd century, is sent to help [[Nobita Nobi]], a young boy, who scores poor grades and is frequently bullied by his two classmates, Gian and Suneo so that his descendants can improve their lives (Doraemon is sent by Sewashi Nobi, Nobita's future grandson). [[Doraemon (character)|Doraemon]] has a four-dimensional pouch in which he stores unexpected gadgets that improve his life. He has many gadgets, which he gets from The Future Departmental Store, such as Bamboo-Copter, a small piece of headgear that can allow its users to fly; Anywhere Door, a pink-colored door that allows people to travel according to the thoughts of the person who turns the knob; Time Kerchief, a handkerchief that can turn an object new or old or a person young or old; Translator Tool, a cuboid jelly that can allow people to converse in any language across the universe; Designer Camera, a camera that produces dresses; and many more.

Nobita's closest friend and love interest is [[Shizuka Minamoto]], who eventually becomes his wife in the future and has a child with him named Nobisuke Nobi (the same name as Nobita's father). Nobita is often bullied by [[Takeshi Goda]] (nicknamed &quot;Gian&quot;), and Suneo Honekawa (Gian's sidekick), but they are shown to be friends in some of the episodes. In most episodes, a typical story consists of Nobita taking a gadget from Doraemon for his needs eventually causing more trouble than he was trying to solve. As for the movies, Doraemon, Nobita, Shizuka, Suneo, and Gian are often shown ready for an adventure to protect people. They are adventurous, humorous, and emotional.

In December 1969 the ''Doraemon'' manga appeared in six different children's monthly magazines published by [[Shogakukan]]. The magazines were aimed at children from nursery school to fourth grade. In 1977 ''[[CoroCoro Comic]]'' was launched as the flagship magazine of ''Doraemon.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Rough&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Manga|last=S.

Since the debut of ''Doraemon'' in 1969, the stories have been selectively collected into forty-five [[tankōbon]] volumes, which were published under Shogakukan's ''Tentōmushi Comics'' imprint, from 1974 to 1996. Shogakukan published a ''master works'' collection consisting of twenty volumes between July 24, 2009 and September 25, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shogakukan.co.jp/comics/detail/_isbn_9784091434036|title=藤子・Ｆ・不二雄大全集　ドラえもん　１|accessdate=January 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115194711/http://www.shogakukan.co.jp/comics/detail/_isbn_9784091434036|archive-date=2013-01-15|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shogakukan.co.jp/comics/detail/_isbn_9784091435019|title=藤子・Ｆ・不二雄大全集　ドラえもん　２０|accessdate=January 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113233150/http://www.shogakukan.co.jp/comics/detail/_isbn_9784091435019|archive-date=2015-01-13|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Doraemon has appeared in a variety of manga series by Shōgakukan. In 2005 Shōgakukan published a series of five more manga volumes under the title ''Doraemon+'' (''[[Doraemon Plus]]''), which were not found in the forty-five original volumes. On December 1, 2014, a sixth volume of ''Doraemon Plus'' was published.

===Anime===
After a brief first attempt at an [[Doraemon (1973 anime)|animated series]] in 1973 by [[Nippon Television]], ''Doraemon'' remained fairly exclusive in manga form until 1979 when a newly formed animation studio, [[Shin-Ei Animation]] (now owned by [[TV Asahi]]) produced an animated [[Doraemon (1979 anime)|second attempt]] of ''Doraemon.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schilling|first1=Mark|title=The Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture|date=1997|publisher=Weatherhill|location=New York|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series became incredibly popular, and ended with 1,787 episodes on March 25, 2005. In [[Asia]], this version is sometimes referred to as the Ōyama Edition, after the [[Nobuyo Ōyama|voice actress]] who voiced Doraemon in this series.&lt;ref name=&quot;asiatitle&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inmediahk.net/node/1002380|title=舊酒新瓶？濃厚也 (Old Wine In New Bottle?

====Feature films====
{{Further|List of Doraemon films}}
In 1980, [[Toho]] released the first of a series of annual feature-length [[animated film]]s based on the lengthy special volumes published annually. Unlike the anime and manga (some based on the stories in select volumes), they are more action-adventure oriented and have more of a [[Shōnen manga|shōnen]] demographic, taking the familiar characters of ''Doraemon'' and placing them in a variety of exotic and perilous settings. Nobita and his friends have visited the age of the [[dinosaur]]s, the far reaches of the [[galaxy]], the depths of the ocean, and a world of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Some of the films are based on [[legend]]s such as [[Atlantis]], and on literary works including ''[[Journey to the West]]'' and ''[[Arabian Nights]].'' Some films also have serious themes, especially on environmental topics and the use of technology. Overall, the films have a somewhat darker tone in their stories, unlike the manga and anime.

===Video games===
{{details|List of Doraemon video games}}
There are 63 Japanese-only Doraemon video games, ranging from platformer games to RPG games, beginning with the Emerson's [[Arcadia 2001]] system. Doraemon can also be seen in [[Namco]]'s popular ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'' rhythm game series like ''Taiko no Tatsujin'' (11 – [[Taiko no Tatsujin 14|14]] only), ''[[Metcha! Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Nanatsu no Shima no Daibouken]]'', ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin Wii]]'', ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin Plus]]'', and ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin DS: Dororon! Yokai Daikessen!!]]''. The Japanese version of Microsoft's ''3D Movie Maker'' contained a Doraemon-themed expansion pack. The first Doraemon game to receive a Western release was ''[[Doraemon Story of Seasons]]'' (2019).
