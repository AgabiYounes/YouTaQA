'''Draco''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|r|eɪ|k|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Δράκων}}, ''Drakōn''; fl. c. 7th century BC), also called Drako or Drakon, was the first recorded [[legislator]] of [[Athens]] in [[Ancient Greece]]. He replaced the prevailing system of [[oral law]] and [[blood feud]] by a written [[Code (law)|code]] to be enforced only by a [[court of law]]. Draco was the first democratic legislator, requested by the [[Athenian citizen]]s to be a lawgiver for the [[city-state]], but the citizens were fully unaware that Draco would establish laws&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/01/draconian-laws-written-human-blood-rather-ink/|title=Written in Human Blood: Draconian Laws and the Dawn of Democracy|date=2014-01-09|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by their harshness.

== Life ==
During the 39th [[Olympiad]], in 622 or 621 BC, Draco established the legal code with which he is identified.

Little is known about his life. He may have belonged to the Greek nobility of [[Attica]], with which the 10th-century [[Suda]] text records him as contemporaneous, prior to the period of the [[Seven Sages of Greece]]. It also relates a [[folklore|folkloric]] story of his death in the [[Aegina|Aeginetan]] theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Cobham, Ebenezer. [https://books.google.com/books?oe=UTF-8&amp;id=fzoFAAAAYAAJ ''The Reader's Handbook of Allusions, References, Plots and Stories''], p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; In a traditional ancient Greek show of approval, his supporters &quot;threw so many hats and shirts and cloaks on his head that he suffocated, and was buried in that same theatre&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Suidas. &quot;[http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;db=REAL&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=delta,1495&amp;filter=CD-Unicode {{lang|grc|Δράκων}}] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103215841/http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;db=REAL&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=delta,1495&amp;filter=CD-Unicode |date=2015-11-03 }}&quot;.  ''Suda On Line''. Adler number delta, 1495.&lt;/ref&gt; The truth about his death is still unclear, but it is known that Draco was driven out of Athens by the Athenians to the neighbouring island of [[Aegina]], where he spent the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Guerber, H. A., and Joe Larkins. The Story Of The Greeks. Luton: Andrews UK, 2011. eBook Collection (EBSCOhost). Web. 26 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Draconian constitution==
{{main|Draconian constitution}}
The [[law]]s ({{lang|grc|θεσμοί}} - ''thesmoi'') that he laid were the first written [[Draconian constitution|constitution of Athens]]. So that no one would be unaware of them, they were posted on wooden tablets ({{lang|grc|ἄξονες}} - ''axones''), where they were preserved for almost two centuries on [[stele]]s of the shape of [[tetrahedron|three-sided pyramids]] ({{lang|grc|κύρβεις}} - ''kyrbeis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holland|first=Leicester B.|date=1941|title=Axones|jstor=499024|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=45|issue=3|pages=346–362|doi=10.2307/499024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets were called ''axones'', perhaps because they could be pivoted along the pyramid's axis to read any side.

The constitution featured several major innovations:
*Instead of oral laws known to a special class, arbitrarily applied and interpreted, all laws were written, thus being made known to all literate citizens (who could appeal to the [[Areopagus]] for injustices): &quot;the constitution formed under Draco, when the first code of laws was drawn up&quot;. ([[Aristotle]]: [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/athemain.asp Athenian Constitution], [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/athe5.asp Part 5, Section 41])
*The laws distinguish between [[murder]] and [[involuntary homicide]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|editor1-last=Boardman|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Hammond|editor2-first=N.G.L|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Volume III, Part 3: The Expansion of the Greek World, Eighth to Sixth Centuries B.C.|author-last=Andrewes|author-first=A.|chapter=The Growth of the Athenian State|isbn=0-521-23447-6|page=371|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laws were particularly harsh. For example, any [[debt]]or whose status was lower than that of his [[credit (finance)|credit]]or was forced into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2GbgfLmCR-YC&amp;pg=PA117 Morris Silver. ''Economic Structures of Antiquity'']. Ed. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. {{ISBN|9780313293801}}. P. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment was more lenient for those owing a debt to a member of a lower class. The [[capital punishment|death penalty]] was the punishment for even minor [[offence (law)|offences]], such as stealing a cabbage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RTOx0OMpEfYC&amp;pg=PA160 J. David Hirschel,&amp;nbsp;William O. Wakefield. ''Criminal Justice in England and the United States'']. Ed. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. {{ISBN|9780275941338}}. p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the liberal use of the death penalty in the Draconic code, [[Plutarch]] states: &quot;It is said that Drakon himself, when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences, answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve it, and he had no greater punishment for more important ones&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch (translation by Stewart; Long, George). He also wrote, &quot;Draco's code was written not in ink but in blood.&quot;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14033/14033-h/14033-h.htm#LIFE_OF_SOLON ''Life of Solon'', XVII].  [[gutenberg.org]].&lt;/ref&gt;

All his laws were repealed by [[Solon]] in the early 6th century BC, with the exception of the [[homicide]] law.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Ath.+Pol.+7.1 ''Athenian Constitution'', 7.1].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homicide law==
After much debate, the Athenians decided to revise the laws, including the homicide law, in 409 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volonaki|first=Eleni|title=&quot;Apagoge&quot; in Homicide Cases|journal=Dike|volume=3|year=2000|url=http://www.ledonline.it/Dike/allegati/Dike3_Volonakis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The homicide law is a highly fragmented inscription but states that it is up to the victim's relatives to prosecute a killer. According to the preserved part of the inscription, unintentional homicides received a sentence of [[exile]].

It is not clear whether Draco's law specified the punishment for intentional homicide. In 409 BC, intentional homicide was punished by death, but Draco's law begins, 'καὶ ἐὰμ μὲ ‘κ [π]ρονοί[α]ς [κ]τ[ένει τίς τινα, φεύγ]ε[ν]', which is ambiguous and difficult to translate. One possible translation offers, &quot;Even if a man not intentionally kills another, he is exiled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gagarin|first1=Michael|title=Drakon and early Athenian homicide law|date=1981|publisher=Yale U.P.|location=New York|isbn=0300026277|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/drakonearlyathen0000gaga}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Council of Four Hundred==
Draco introduced the lot-chosen Council of Four Hundred,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0046%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D3 ''The Athenian Constitution'', 4.3].&lt;/ref&gt; distinct from the [[Areopagus]], which evolved in later constitutions to play a large role in [[Athenian democracy]]. [[Aristotle]] notes that Draco, while having the laws written, merely legislated for an existing unwritten Athenian constitution&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058&amp;query=section%3D%2347&amp;layout=&amp;loc=2.1274a ''Politics'', 1274a].&lt;/ref&gt; such as setting exact qualifications for eligibility for office.

Draco extended the [[suffrage|franchise]] to all free men who could furnish themselves with a set of military equipment. They elected the Council of Four Hundred from among their number; nine [[archon]]s and the treasurers were drawn from persons possessing an unencumbered property of not less than ten ''[[Mina (unit)|minas]]'', the generals (''[[Strategos|strategoi]]'') and commanders of cavalry (''[[Hipparchus (cavalry officer)|hipparchoi]]'') from those who could show an unencumbered property of not less than a hundred ''minas'' and had children born in lawful wedlock over ten years of age. Thus, in the event of their death, their estate could pass to a competent heir. These officers were required to hold to account the ''[[Prytaneis|prytanes]]'' (councillors), ''strategoi'' (generals) and ''hipparchoi'' (cavalry officers) of the preceding year until their accounts had been audited. &quot;The Council of Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept watch over the magistrates to see that they executed their offices in accordance with the laws. Any person who felt himself wronged might lay an information before the Council of Areopagus, on declaring what law was broken by the wrong done to him. But, as has been said before, loans were secured upon the persons of the debtors, and the land was in the hands of a few.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Constitution'', §4.&lt;/ref&gt;
