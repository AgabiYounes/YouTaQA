The '''deuterocanonical books''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning &quot;belonging to the second [[Biblical canon|canon]]&quot;) are books and passages considered by the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] to be canonical books of the [[Old Testament]] but which are considered non-canonical by [[Protestant]] [[Religious denomination|denominations]].

The Masoretic Text did not include the seven deuterocanonical books and formed the basis for their exclusion in the Protestant Old Testament. The term distinguished these texts both from those that were termed [[protocanonical books]], which were the books of the Hebrew canon; and from the [[Biblical Apocrypha|apocryphal books]], which were those books of Jewish origin that were known sometimes to have been read in church as [[religious text|scripture]] but which were considered not to be canonical.

The deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament are:

''Canonical by the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church:''
* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]
* [[Book of Judith|Judith]]
* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] including the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] as the 6th chapter or standalone book
* [[Sirach]]
* [[1 Maccabees]]
* [[2 Maccabees]]
* [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]]
* [[Additions to Esther]]
* [[Additions to Daniel]]:
** [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children|Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]] ([[Septuagint]] [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 3:24–90)
** [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna and the Elders]] (Septuagint prologue, Vulgate Daniel 13)
** [[Bel and the Dragon]] (Septuagint epilogue, Vulgate Daniel 14)
''Canonical only by the Orthodox Church:''
* [[Prayer of Manasseh]]
* [[1 Esdras]]
* [[3 Maccabees]]
* [[Psalm 151]]

This 16th-century debate drew on traditions witnessing a counterpart debate in the 4th and 5th centuries; occasioned then by the awareness that the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which the [[Early Christianity|early church]] used as its Old Testament, included several books not recognised in the Jewish canon of the Bible as it had since been defined in [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. In this debate, which had preceded the dissemination of Jerome's Vulgate version, the books in the Hebrew Bible had been termed &quot;canonical&quot;; the additional books that were recognised by the Christian churches had been termed as &quot;canonical&quot; too (today termed as deuterocanonical), and those that were considered not to be in the Bible were termed &quot;apocryphal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaert 69-92&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |publisher= Cambridge University Press |editor1= Richard Marsden |editor2=E. Ann Matter |last=Bogaert |first=Pierre Maurice |title= New Cambridge History of the Bible; Vol II |contribution= The Latin Bible. c 600 to c. 900 |pages= 69–92 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 16th century, most [[Protestantism|Protestant Churches]] have accepted only works in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the Hebrew Bible as canonical books of the Old Testament, and hence classify all deuterocanonical texts (of whichever definition) with the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]].

==Historical background==
{{main|Development of the Old Testament canon}}
Deuterocanonical is a term coined in 1566 by the theologian [[Sixtus of Siena]], who had converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] from [[Judaism]], to describe scriptural texts considered [[Biblical canon|canonical]] by the Catholic Church, but which recognition was considered &quot;secondary&quot;. For Sixtus, this term included portions of both Old and New Testaments (Sixtus considers the final chapter of the [[Gospel of Mark]] as 'deuterocanonical'); and he also applies the term to the [[Book of Esther]] from the canon of the Hebrew Bible.  The term was then taken up by other writers to apply specifically to those books of the Old Testament which had been recognised as canonical by the Councils of Hippo (393), Carthage (397 and 419 AD), Council of Florence (1442 AD) and Council of Trent (1546 AD), but which were not in the Hebrew canon&lt;ref name=&quot;isbe&quot;&gt;[http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/C/CANON+OF+THE+OLD+TESTAMENT%2C+II/ Canon of the Old Testament, II, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1915]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;canonOT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commonly cited include (1) [[Melito of Sardis]], who went ''east'', to Palestine, and recorded the canon he found being used in the synagogues, as recorded in Eusebius' ''Church History'' 4.26.13–14, (2) [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], (3) [[Council of Laodicea]], (4) [[Jerome]] residing in [[Bethlehem]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of the term &quot;deuterocanonical&quot; were adopted after the 16th century by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to denote canonical books of the Septuagint not in the Hebrew Bible (a wider selection than that adopted by the Council of Trent), and also by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] to apply to works believed to be of Jewish origin translated in the Old Testament of the [[Ethiopic Bible]]; a wider selection still.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor1=James Carleton Paget |editor2=Joachim Schaper |last= Bogaert |first= Pierre Maurice |title= New Cambridge History of the Bible; Vol II |contribution=The Latin Bible |pages= 505–526 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of some of these books among [[early Christians]] was widespread, though not universal, and surviving Bibles from the early Church always include, with varying degrees of recognition, books now called ''deuterocanonical''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N. D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'', p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that their canonicity seems not to have been doubted in the Church until it was challenged by Jews after AD 100,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart G. Hall, ''Doctrine and Practice in the Early Church'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes postulating a hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]]. Regional councils in the [[Western Christianity|West]] published official canons that included these books as early as the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th]] and 5th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;canonOT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g., the [[Council of Carthage (397)]], the [[Council of Rome]], the [[Gelasian decree]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states that:

{{Quote|text=At Jerusalem there was a renascence, perhaps a survival, of Jewish ideas, the tendency there being distinctly unfavourable to the deuteros. St. Cyril of that see, while vindicating for the Church the right to fix the Canon, places them among the apocrypha and forbids all books to be read privately which are not read in the churches. In Antioch and Syria the attitude was more favourable. St. Epiphanius shows hesitation about the rank of the deuteros; he esteemed them, but they had not the same place as the Hebrew books in his regard. The historian Eusebius attests the widespread doubts in his time; he classes them as antilegomena, or disputed writings, and, like Athanasius, places them in a class intermediate between the books received by all and the apocrypha.

In the Latin Church, all through the Middle Ages we find evidence of hesitation about the character of the deuterocanonicals. There is a current friendly to them, another one distinctly unfavourable to their authority and sacredness, while wavering between the two are a number of writers whose veneration for these books is tempered by some perplexity as to their exact standing, and among those we note St. Thomas Aquinas. Few are found to unequivocally acknowledge their canonicity. The prevailing attitude of Western medieval authors is substantially that of the Greek Fathers. The chief cause of this phenomenon in the West is to be sought in the influence, direct and indirect, of St. Jerome's depreciating Prologus.&lt;ref name=&quot;canonOT&quot; /&gt;}}

Meanwhile, &quot;the protocanonical books of the Old Testament correspond with those of the Bible of the Hebrews, and the Old Testament as received by Protestants. The deuterocanonical (deuteros, &quot;second&quot;) are those whose Scriptural character was contested in some quarters, but which long ago gained a secure footing in the Bible of the Catholic Church, though those of the Old Testament are classed by Protestants as the &quot;Apocrypha&quot;. These consist of seven books: Tobias, Judith, Baruch, Ecclesiasticus, Wisdom, First and Second Machabees; also certain additions to Esther and Daniel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;canonOT&quot; /&gt;

===Dead Sea scrolls===
Fragments of three deuterocanonical books (''Sirach'', ''Tobit'', and ''Letter of Jeremiah'') have been found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] found at [[Qumran]], in addition to several partial copies of ''[[Book of Enoch|I Enoch]]'' and ''[[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]]'' from the Ethiopic deuterocanon, and Psalm 151 from the Eastern Orthodox Church deuterocanon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''[[Sirach]]'', whose [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text was already known from the [[Cairo Geniza]], has been found in two scrolls (2QSir or 2Q18, 11QPs_a or 11Q5) in Hebrew. Another Hebrew scroll of ''Sirach'' has been found in [[Masada]] (MasSir).&lt;ref name=&quot;Abegg&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Abegg| first1 = Martin| last2 = Flint| first2 = Peter| last3 = Ulrich| first3 = Eugene| title = The Dead Sea Scroll Bible| year = 1999| publisher = HarperOne| isbn = 978-0-06-060064-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|597}} Five fragments from the ''[[Book of Tobit]]'' have been found in Qumran written in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and in one written in Hebrew (papyri 4Q, nos. 196–200).&lt;ref name=&quot;Abegg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/search#q=composition_type_parent_en:'Apocrypha' AND manuscript_type_parent_en:'Non-Biblical Compositions'&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|636}} The ''[[Letter of Jeremiah]]'' (or ''[[Book of Baruch|Baruch]]'' chapter 6) has been found in cave 7 (papyrus [[7Q2]]) in [[Koine Greek|Greek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Abegg&quot;/&gt;{{rp|628}} It has been theorized by recent scholars&lt;ref&gt;Lena Cansdale 1997, ''Qumran and the Essenes'' pp. 14 ff. cites Rengstorf 1963, Golb 1980, and several others, as well as detractors of this theory.&lt;/ref&gt; that the Qumran library (of approximately 1,100 manuscripts found in the eleven caves at [[Qumran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zukeran|first1=Patrick|title=Unless I See ...

The large majority of Old Testament references in the [[New Testament]] are taken from the [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] (LXX), editions of which include the deuterocanonical books, as well as [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] – both of which are called collectively ''anagignoskomena'' (''&quot;Readable,'' namely worthy of reading&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Prof. [[Petros Vassiliadis]] [http://users.auth.gr/~pv/inspiration.htm defines the work thus].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2018}} No two Septuagint codices contain the same apocrypha,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=E.

Some deuterocanonicals appear to have been written originally in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but the original text has long been lost. Archaeological finds discovered both Psalm 151 and the [[Book of Tobit]] in Hebrew among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The Septuagint was widely accepted and used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] in the 1st century, even in the region of [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judea]], and therefore naturally became the text most widely used by early Christians, who were predominantly Greek speaking.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] (c. 94 AD) speaks of there being 22 books in the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] writes in ''[[Against Apion]]'', I, 8: &quot;We have not 10,000 books among us, disagreeing with and contradicting one another, but only twenty-two books which contain the records of all time, and are justly believed to be divine.&quot; These 22 books make up the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;/ref&gt; reported also by the Christian bishop [[Athanasius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/athanasius.html|title=Athanasius on the Canon of Scripture|website=bible-researcher.com|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Origen of Alexandria]] (c. 240 AD) also records 22 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible cited by Eusebius; among them are the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]] and the [[Books of the Maccabees|Maccabees]] as canonical books.

{{quote|The twenty-two books of the Hebrews are the following: That which is called by us Genesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers; Jesus, the son of Nave (Joshua book); Judges and Ruth in one book; the First and Second of Kings (1 Samuel and 2 Samuel) in one; the Third and Fourth of Kings (1 Kings and 2 Kings) in one; of the Chronicles, the First and Second in one; Esdras (Ezra–Nehemiah) in one; the book of Psalms; the Proverbs of Solomon; Ecclesiastes; the Song of Songs; Isaiah; Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the epistle (of Jeremiah) in one; Daniel; Ezekiel; Job; Esther.

===Synods===
In later copyings of the canons of the [[Council of Laodicea]] (from 364 AD) a canon list became appended to Canon 59, likely before the mid fifth century, which affirmed that Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations, and the Epistle (of Jeremiah) were canonical, while excluding the other deuterocanonical books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Synod of Laodicea Canon 60&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gallagher|first1=Edmon.L.|last2=Meade|first2=John.D.|title=The Biblical Canon Lists of Early Christianity|publisher=OUP|date=2017|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Rome]] (382 AD) in its [[Decretum Gelasianum]], which is a work written by an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553, cites a list of books of Scripture presented as having been made canonical by the Council of Rome. This list mentions all the deuterocanonical books except Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah as a part of the Old Testament Canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.tertullian.org/decretum_eng.htm | title=Tertullian : Decretum Gelasianum (English translation)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Synod of Hippo]] (in 393 AD), followed by the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] and the [[Council of Carthage (419)]], may be the first councils that explicitly accepted the first canon which includes a selection of books that did not appear in the [[Hebrew Bible]];&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, editors of ''The Canon Debate'', 2002, chapter 5: ''The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism'' by Albert C.

Finally the [[Council of Trent]] (1546 AD) adopted an understanding of the canons of these previous councils as corresponding to its own list of deuterocanonical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TRENT4.htm|title=Paul III&amp;nbsp; Council of Trent-4|website=ewtn.com|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding rested on two historical presumptions which are contested in current research; that where these councils and synods noted the 'Book of Jeremiah', they intended the Book of Baruch to be silently understood (including the [[Letter of Jeremiah]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaert Baruch&quot; /&gt; and that where these synods and councils noted 'two books of Esdras', these two books were to be understood as [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] counted separately, not (as was universal in Septuagint manuscripts of the time, in the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin Bible]] and in the works of Augustine) as [[1 Esdras]] and [[Ezra–Nehemiah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaert livres d'Esdras&quot; /&gt;

===Influence of Jerome===
[[Jerome]] in the [[Vulgate#Prologues|Vulgate's prologues]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/prologi.shtml|title=The Bible|website=thelatinlibrary.com|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a canon which excludes the deuterocanonical books. In these prologues, Jerome mentions all of the deuterocanonical and apocryphal works by name as being apocryphal or &quot;not in the canon&quot; except for ''[[Prayer of Manasseh|Prayer of Manasses]]'' and ''Baruch''. He mentions ''Baruch'' by name in his ''Prologue to Jeremiah''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=233 |website=Biblicalia |date=14 August 2006 |first=Kevin P. |last=Edgecomb |title=Jerome's Prologue to Jeremiah}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or &quot;not in the canon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Since some ancients counted Baruch as part of Jeremiah, it is conceivable though unlikely that Jerome counted Baruch under the name of Jeremiah when he enumerated the canon in his ''Prologus Galeatus''.&lt;/ref&gt; The inferior status to which the deuterocanonical books were relegated by authorities like Jerome is seen by some as being due to a rigid conception of canonicity, one demanding that a book, to be entitled to this supreme dignity, must be received by all, must have the sanction of Jewish antiquity, and must moreover be adapted not only to edification, but also to the &quot;confirmation of the doctrine of the Church&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;canonOT&quot; /&gt;

J. N. D. Kelly states that &quot;Jerome, conscious of the difficulty of arguing with Jews on the basis of books they spurned and anyhow regarding the Hebrew original as authoritative, was adamant that anything not found in it was 'to be classed among the apocrypha', not in the canon; later he grudgingly conceded that the Church read some of these books for edification, but not to support doctrine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=J. N. D.|title=Early Christian Doctrines|date=1960|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually however, Jerome's [[Vulgate]] did include the deuterocanonical books as well as [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]]. Jerome referenced and quoted from some as scripture despite describing them as &quot;not in the canon&quot;. Michael Barber asserts that, although Jerome was once suspicious of the apocrypha, he later viewed them as Scripture. Barber argues that this is clear from Jerome's epistles; he cites Jerome's letter to [[Eustochium]], in which Jerome quotes Sirach 13:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Michael |last=Barber |url=http://www.thesacredpage.com/2006/03/loose-canons-development-of-old_06.html |title=Loose Canons: The Development of the Old Testament (Part 2) |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Jerome apparently also refers to Baruch, the Story of Susannah and Wisdom as scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, To Paulinus, Epistle 58 (A.D. 395), in NPNF2, VI:119.: &quot;Do not, my dearest brother, estimate my worth by the number of my years. Gray hairs are not wisdom; it is wisdom which is as good as gray hairs At least that is what Solomon says: 'wisdom is the gray hair unto men.' [Wisdom 4:9]&quot; Moses too in choosing the seventy elders is told to take those whom he knows to be elders indeed, and to select them not for their years but for their discretion [Num. 11:16]? And, as a boy, Daniel judges old men and in the flower of youth condemns the incontinence of age [Daniel 13:55–59 aka Story of Susannah 55–59]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, To Oceanus, Epistle 77:4 (A.D. 399), in NPNF2, VI:159.: &quot;I would cite the words of the psalmist: 'the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,' [Ps 51:17] and those of Ezekiel 'I prefer the repentance of a sinner rather than his death,' [Ez 18:23] and those of Baruch, 'Arise, arise, O Jerusalem,' [Baruch 5:5] and many other proclamations made by the trumpets of the Prophets.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, Letter 51, 6, 7, NPNF2, VI:87–8: &quot;For in the book of Wisdom, which is inscribed with his name, Solomon says: 'God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.' [Wisdom 2:23]...Instead of the three proofs from Holy Scripture which you said would satisfy you if I could produce them, behold I have given you seven&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Barker states that Jerome quotes the Apocrypha with marked respect, and even as &quot;Scripture&quot;, giving them an ecclesiastical if not a canonical position and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Henry|title=English Bible Versions|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1108024549|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tRk7FHkAuEAC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=jerome+quotes+from+apocrypha+but+they+did+not+consider+scripture#v=snippet&amp;q=jerome%20quotes%20%20the%20apocrypha%20%20%20%20%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther also wrote introductions to the books of the Apocrypha, and occasionally quoted from some to support an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=S. Werrell|first1=Ralph|title=The Roots of William Tyndale's Theology|date=29 August 2013|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co|isbn=978-0227174029|page=57|edition=paperback|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kaAABAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=luther+quotes+from+apocrypha+but+they+did+not+consider+scripture|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his prologue to [[Book of Judith|Judith]], without using the word canon, Jerome mentioned that Judith was held to be scriptural by the [[First Council of Nicaea]].

{{quote|Among the Hebrews the Book of Judith is found among the [[Hagiographa]]. ...But because this book is found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures, I have acquiesced to your request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/jeromes-prologue-to-judith/ |title=Jerome's Prologue to Judith |website=Biblicalia |date=5 August 2006 |first=Kevin P. |last=Edgecomb}}&lt;/ref&gt; |sign=|source=}}

In his reply to [[Rufinus of Aquileia|Rufinus]], Jerome affirmed that he was consistent with the choice of the church regarding which version of the deuterocanonical portions of Daniel to use, which the Jews of his day did not include:

{{quote|What sin have I committed in following the judgment of the churches? But when I repeat what the Jews say against the [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Story of Susanna]] and the [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children|Hymn of the Three Children]], and the fables of [[Bel and the Dragon]], which are not contained in the Hebrew Bible, the man who makes this a charge against me proves himself to be a fool and a slanderer; for I explained not what I thought but what they commonly say against us. (''Against Rufinus'', II:33 [AD 402])&lt;ref name=Schaff27102&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/27102.htm |chapter=Apology Against Rufinus (Book II) |title=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series |volume=3 |author=Jerome |editor=Philip Schaff, Henry Wace |location=Buffalo, NY |publisher=Christian Literature Publishing Co. (retrieved from New Advent) |edition=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Thus Jerome acknowledged the principle by which the canon would be settled – the judgment of the Church (at least the local churches in this case) rather than his own judgment or the judgment of Jews; though concerning translation of Daniel to Greek, he wondered why one should use the version of a translator whom he regarded as a [[heresy|heretic]] and [[judaizer]] ([[Theodotion]]).&lt;ref name=Schaff27102/&gt;

The Vulgate is also important as the touchstone of the canon concerning which parts of books are canonical. When the [[Council of Trent]] listed the books included in the canon, it qualified the books as being &quot;entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be read in the Catholic Church, and as they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, The Fourth Session], 1546.&lt;/ref&gt; This decree was clarified somewhat by [[Pope Pius XI]] on 2 June 1927, who allowed that the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute, and it was further explicated by [[Pope Pius XII]]'s ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Council of Trent also promulgated the [[Vulgate]] Bible as the official Latin version of the Bible for the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecounciloftrent.com/ch4.htm|title=~The Council of Trent - Session 4~|website=thecounciloftrent.com|access-date=2019-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]], the translator of most of this version in the early 5th century, had translated the Old Testament books afresh directly from the Hebrew Bible, rather than from the Greek [[Septuagint]], and had then explicitly rejected all Septuagint books and passages not found in the Hebrew as &quot;apocryphal&quot;; and although he had subsequently translated some of these texts under sufferance (marking them with an [[obelus]]), he had maintained throughout that none of these books and additions were canonical and recorded this opinion in his prologues to each book. In the medieval period however, Latin translations of the Septuagint books that Jerome had refused altogether to translate had nevertheless become widely included in the Vulgate Bible; as too had Latin versions of other texts that had never been found in the Septuagint at all.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Council of Trent therefore needed to clarify which of the Old Testament books in 16th century Vulgate Bibles were in the canon; and which were not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the Old Latin version of the Bible, these two works appear to have been incorporated into the [[Book of Jeremiah]], and Latin Fathers of the 4th century and earlier always cite their texts as being from that book. However, when Jerome translated Jeremiah afresh from the Hebrew text, which is considerably longer than the Greek Septuagint text and with chapters in a different order, he steadfastly refused to incorporate either Baruch or the Letter of Jeremiah from the Greek. As the Vulgate Bible supplanted the Old Latin in Western church use in subsequent centuries, so Baruch and the letter of Jeremiah are no longer treated as canonical in the works of Fathers who favoured the Vulgate, [[Gregory the Great]], [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Bede]]. In the 9th century these two works were reintroduced into the Vulgate Bibles produced under the influence of [[Theodulf of Orleans]], originally as additional chapters to the Vulgate book of Jeremiah. Subsequently, and especially in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century, they are found together as a single, combined book after [[Lamentations]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaert Baruch&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=115|issue=2|pages=286–342|last=Bogaert|first=Pierre-Maurice|title=Le livre de Baruch dans les manuscrits de la Bible latine.

The canonical status of [[1 Esdras|Greek Esdras]] in the Western church is less easy to track, as references to [[Esdras]] in canon lists may refer either to this book, or to Greek [[Ezra–Nehemiah]], or both. Greek Esdras provides a free translation into Greek of the Hebrew canonical book of [[Ezra–Nehemiah]] plus chapters 35 and 36 of the [[Book of Chronicles]] with other additional matter, but with the sections specific to Nehemiah removed. In the surviving Greek pandect Bibles of the 4th and 5th centuries, this text always stands as 'Esdras A' while the Greek translation of the whole of canonical Ezra–Nehemiah stands as 'Esdras B'; and the same is found in the surviving witness of the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGregorio&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGregorio|first=Scott|title=Bede on Ezra and Nehemiah|publisher=Liverpool University Press|date = 2006|pages= xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Latin fathers of the early church cite quotations from the biblical 'Book of Ezra' it is overwhelmingly 'First Ezra/Esdras A' to which they refer, as in Augustine 'City of God' 18:36. Citations of the 'Nehemiah' sections of Old Latin Second Ezra/'Esdras B' are much rarer; and no Old Latin citations from the 'Ezra' sections of Second Ezra/'Esdras B' are known before [[Bede]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGregorio&quot; /&gt; Accordingly, Bogaert has proposed that all references to the 'two books of Ezra' in both Latin and Greek authorities and councils may be best understood as denoting Esdras A and Esdras B (where most previous scholars had interpreted this phrase as an early reference to Ezra and Nehemiah as separate works).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaert livres d'Esdras&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=110|issue=1–2|pages=5–26|last=Bogaert|first=Pierre-Maurice|title=Les livres d'Esdras et leur numérotation dans l'histoire du canon de la Bible latin|journal=Revue Bénédictine|date=2000|doi=10.1484/J.RB.5.100750}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jerome's Vulgate Bible however, there is only one Book of Ezra, translating Hebrew Ezra–Nehemiah but corresponding to Greek Esdras B; Esdras A is stated by Jerome to be a variant version, ''(exemplaria varietas)''&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaert livres d'Esdras&quot;/&gt; of the same Hebrew original. In the prologue to [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] Jerome states that [[2 Esdras|3 Esdras]] and 4 Esdras are apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_preface_ezra.htm|title=St. Jerome, The Prologue on the Book of Ezra: English translation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogaert notes that [[Ambrose]] cites [[2 Esdras|4 Esdras]] as the 'third book of Esdras', and consequently suggests that Jerome's 'third book of Esdras' is to be identified with '4 Ezra' of modern scholarship, while Jerome's 'fourth book of Esdras'may be modern [[2 Esdras|'5 Ezra' and '6 Ezra']] combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaert livres d'Esdras&quot;/&gt;

From the 9th century, occasional Latin Vulgate manuscripts are found in which Jerome's single Ezra text is split to form the separate books of [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]]; and in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century this split has become universal, with Esdras A being reintroduced as '[[1 Esdras|3 Esdras']] and [[2 Esdras|Latin Esdras]] being added as '4 Esdras'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bogaert livres d'Esdras&quot; /&gt; At the Council of Trent neither '[[1 Esdras|3 Esdras']] nor '[[2 Esdras|4 Esdras]]' were accepted as deuterocanonical books, but were eventually printed in the section of '[[Apocrypha]]' in the [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate]], along with the [[Prayer of Manasses]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The [[Council of Trent]] in 1546 restated the list of books included in the canon as it had been set out in the [[Council of Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=OUP|last=Hamilton|first=Alastair|title=The Copts and the West; 1439–1822|pages=54|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In respect to the deuterocanonical books this list conformed with the canon lists of Western synods of the late 4th century, other than including Baruch with the Letter of Jeremiah as a separate book, and in excluding [[1 Esdras|Greek Esdras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;canonOT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct04.html Council of Trent, Session 4, 8 April 1546].&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority at Trent supported this decision there were participants in the minority who disagreed with accepting any other than the protocanonical books in the canon. Among the minority, at Trent, were Cardinals [[Seripando]] and [[Thomas Cajetan|Cajetan]], the latter an opponent of Luther at Augsburg.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Jedin, ''Papal Legate at the Council of Trent'' (St Louis: B. Herder Book Co., 1947), pp. 270–71, 278.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Commentary on all the Authentic Historical Books of the Old Testament,'' In ult.

==In Orthodox Christianity==
Outside the Roman Catholic Church, the term deuterocanonical is sometimes used, by way of analogy, to describe books that [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] included in the [[Old Testament]] that are not part of the Jewish [[Tanakh]], nor the [[Protestant Old Testament]]. Among Orthodox, the term is understood to mean that they were compiled separately from the primary canon, as explained in 2 Esdras, where Esdras is instructed to keep certain books separate and hidden.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Eastern Orthodox Churches have traditionally included all the books of the Septuagint in their Old Testaments. The Greeks use the word ''Anagignoskomena'' (Ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα &quot;readable, worthy to be read&quot;) to describe the books of the Greek [[Septuagint]] that are not present in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. When Orthodox theologians use the term &quot;deuterocanonical&quot;, it is important to note that the meaning is not identical to the Roman Catholic usage. In Orthodox Christianity, deuterocanonical means that a book is part of the corpus of the Old Testament (i.e. is read during the services) but has secondary authority. In other words, deutero (second) applies to authority or witnessing power, whereas in Roman Catholicism, deutero applies to chronology (the fact that these books were confirmed later), not to authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/ Orthodox Answer To a Question About Apocrypha, Canon, Deuterocanonical – Answer #39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314205050/http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/ |date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Orthodox canon includes the deuterocanonical books accepted by Roman Catholics plus [[Psalm 151]], the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], [[3 Maccabees]] and [[1 Esdras]] (also included in the [[Clementine Vulgate]]), while Baruch is divided from the Epistle of Jeremiah, making a total of 49 Old Testament books in contrast with the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] 39-book canon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimbrough&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = S. T. Kimbrough| title = Orthodox And Wesleyan Scriptual Understanding And Practice| url = https://books.google.com/?id=q-vhwjamOioC&amp;pg=PA23| year = 2005| publisher = St Vladimir's Seminary Press| isbn = 978-0-88141-301-4| page = 23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Roman Catholic deuterocanonical books, these texts are integrated with the rest of the Old Testament, not printed in a separate section.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Other texts printed in Orthodox Bibles are included as an appendix, which is not the same in all churches; the appendix contains [[4 Maccabees]] in Greek-language bibles, while it contains [[2 Esdras]] in Slavonic-language and Russian-language bibles.&lt;ref name=Kimbrough/&gt;

===Ethiopian Orthodoxy===
{{Main|Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon}}
In the [[Ge'ez|Ethiopic]] Bible used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Church (an Oriental Orthodox Church), those books of the Old Testament that are still counted as canonical, but which are not agreed upon by all other Churches, are often set in a separate section titled ''&quot;Deeyutrokanoneekal&quot;'' (ዲዩትሮካኖኒካል), which is the same word as &quot;Deuterocanonical&quot;. The Ethiopian Orthodox Deuterocanon, in addition to the standard set listed above, and with the books of Esdras and ''Prayer of Minasse'', also includes some books that are still held canonical by only the Ethiopian Church, including Enoch or ''Henok'' ([[I Enoch]]), ''Kufale'' ([[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]]) and 1, 2 and 3 [[Meqabyan]] (which are sometimes wrongly confused with the &quot;Books of Maccabees&quot;).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==In Christian Churches having their origins in the Reformation==
{{Further|Biblical apocrypha}}

===Anglican Communion===
There is a great deal of overlap between the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section of the original 1611 [[King James Bible]] and the Catholic deuterocanon, but the two are distinct. The Apocrypha section of the original 1611 King James Bible includes, in addition to the deuterocanonical books, the following three books, which were not included in the list of the canonical books by the [[Council of Trent]]:{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
* [[1 Esdras]] ([[Vulgate]] 3 Esdras)
* [[2 Esdras]] (Vulgate 4 Esdras)
* [[Prayer of Manasseh]]

These books make up the [[Biblical apocrypha#Clementine Vulgate|Apocrypha]] section of the [[Vulgate#Clementine Vulgate|Clementine Vulgate]]: [[3 Esdras]] ([[1 Esdras]]); [[4 Esdras]] ([[2 Esdras]]); and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], where they are specifically described as &quot;outside of the series of the canon&quot;. The 1609 [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douai Bible]] includes them in an appendix, but they have not been included in English Catholic Bibles since the [[Richard Challoner|Challoner]] revision of the Douai Bible in 1750. They are found, along with the deuterocanonical books, in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section of certain Protestant Bibles (some versions of the King James, for example).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Using the word apocrypha (Greek: hidden away) to describe texts, although not necessarily pejorative, implies to some people{{who|date=February 2019}} that the writings in question should not be included in the [[Biblical canon|canon]] of the [[Books of the Bible|Bible]]. This classification commingles them with certain non-canonical [[gospel]]s and [[New Testament apocrypha]]. ''The Society of Biblical Literature'' recommends the use of the term ''deuterocanonical books'' instead of ''Apocrypha'' in academic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Society of Biblical Literature|date= 2014|title= The SBL Handbook of Style 2nd Edition|url= |location= Williston, VT|publisher= SBL Press|page= 111|isbn= 978-1589839649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of Religion of the [[Church of England]] lists the deuterocanonical books as suitable to be read for &quot;example of life and instruction of manners, but yet doth not apply them to establish any doctrine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx |title=Articles of Religion |publisher=The Church of England |chapter=VI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early lectionaries of the Anglican Church (as included in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1662) included the deuterocanonical books amongst the cycle of readings, and passages from them were used regularly in services (such as the Kyrie Pantokrator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/kyrie-pantokrator |title=Kyrie Patokrator |website=An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church|date=22 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Benedicite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Owen C. |last2=Wondra |first2=Ellen K. |title=Introduction to Theology, 3rd Edition |date=1 July 2002 |publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9780819218971 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readings from the deuterocanonical books are now included in most, if not all, of the modern lectionaries in the [[Anglican Communion]], based on the [[Revised Common Lectionary]] (in turn based on the post-conciliar Roman Catholic [[lectionary]]), though alternative readings from protocanonical books are also provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Revised Common Lectionary |editor=Consultation on Common Texts |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |year=2012 |isbn=9781451438475 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmg7UhF5rUEC |pages=177, 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheran Churches===
Luther did not accept deuterocanonical books in his Old Testament, terming them &quot;Apocrypha, that is, books which are not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but are useful and good to read.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05742122&amp;id=rl3lcbLkHV0C&amp;pg=PA521&amp;lpg=PA521&amp;dq=luther+%22are+useful+and+good+to+read%22 The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopædia and Scriptural Dictionary, Fully Defining and Explaining All Religious Terms, Including Biographical, Geographical, Historical, Archæological and Doctrinal Themes]'', p.521, edited by [[Samuel Fallows]] et al., The Howard-Severance company, 1901,1910. – [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodist Churches and Moravian Churches===
The first [[Methodist]] liturgical book, ''[[The Sunday Service of the Methodists]]'', employs verses from the biblical apocrypha, such as in the Eucharistic liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sunday Service of the Methodists; With Other Occasional Services|year=1825|publisher=J. Kershaw|language=English|page=136|author=John Wesley|title-link=The Sunday Service of the Methodists; With Other Occasional Services|author-link=John Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revised Common Lectionary]], in use by most mainline Protestants including Methodists and Moravians, lists readings from the biblical apocrypha in the liturgical [[kalendar]], although alternate Old Testament [[scripture lesson]]s are provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commontexts.org/rcl/rcl_introduction_web.pdf |title=The Revised Common Lectionary |year=1992 |publisher=Consultation on Common Texts |accessdate=19 August 2015 |quote=In all places where a reading from the deuterocanonical books (The Apocrypha) is listed, an alternate reading from the canonical Scriptures has also been provided. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701230910/http://www.commontexts.org/rcl/RCL_Introduction_Web.pdf |archivedate=1 July 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presbyterian Churches===
The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], a [[Calvinist]] document that serves as a systematic summary of doctrine for the [[Church of Scotland]] and other [[Presbyterian]] Churches worldwide, recognizes only the sixty-six books of the [[Biblical canon#Canons of various Christian traditions|Protestant canon]] as authentic Scripture. Chapter 1, Article 3 of the Confession reads: &quot;The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds3.iv.xvii.ii.html |title=Westminster Confession of Faith |chapter=Chapter I, III |website=ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformed Churches===
The [[Belgic Confession]], used in [[Reformed churches]], devotes a section (Article 6) to &quot;the difference between the canonical and apocryphal books&quot; and says of them: &quot;All which the Church may read and take instruction from, so far as they agree with the canonical books; but they are far from having such power and efficacy as that we may from their testimony confirm any point of faith or of the Christian religion; much less to detract from the authority of the other sacred books.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3RQQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA36&amp;lpg=RA1-PA36&amp;dq=%22All+which+the+Church+may+read+and+take+instruction+from,+so+far+as+they+agree+with+the+canonical+books;+but+they+are+far+from+having+such+power+and+efficacy+as+that+we+may+from+their+testimony+confirm+any+point+of+faith+or+of+the+Christian+religion;+much+less+to+detract+from+the+authority+of+the+other+sacred+books.%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22All%20which%20the%20Church%20may%20read%20and%20take%20instruction%20from,%20so%20far%20as%20they%20agree%20with%20the%20canonical%20books;%20but%20they%20are%20far%20from%20having%20such%20power%20and%20efficacy%20as%20that%20we%20may%20from%20their%20testimony%20confirm%20any%20point%20of%20faith%20or%20of%20the%20Christian%20religion;%20much%20less%20to%20detract%20from%20the%20authority%20of%20the%20other%20sacred%20books.%22&amp;f=false|title=The Psalms and hymns, with doctrinal standards and liturgy of the Reformed Church in America|last=America|first=Reformed Church in|date=1859|publisher=Board of Publications of the Reformed Church in America|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Jewish position==
{{main|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
Judaism excludes these books. It is commonly said that Judaism officially excluded the deuterocanonicals and the additional Greek texts listed here from their Scripture in the [[Council of Jamnia]] (c.&amp;nbsp;70–90&amp;nbsp;AD), but this claim is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Albert C. Sundberg, Jr., [http://department.monm.edu/classics/Speel_Festschrift/sundbergJr.htm &quot;The Old Testament of the Early Church&quot; Revisited 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament deuterocanonicals==
{{Main|Antilegomena}}
{{See also|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The term ''deuterocanonical'' is sometimes used to describe the canonical [[antilegomena]], those books of the [[New Testament]] which, like the deuterocanonicals of the Old Testament, were not universally accepted by the early Church. These books may be called the &quot;New Testament deuterocanonicals&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Akin&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/DEUTEROS.HTM |title=Defending the Deuterocanonicals |author=James Akin |author-link=Jimmy Akin |publisher=[[EWTN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are now included in the 27 books of the [[New Testament]] recognized by almost all [[Christianity|Christians]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The deuterocanonicals of the New Testament are as follows:{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

* The [[Second Epistle of John]]
* The [[Third Epistle of John]]
* The [[Epistle of Jude]]
* The [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]] (also known as the [[Book of Revelation]])

Luther made an attempt to remove the books of Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation from the canon (notably, he perceived them to go against the doctrines of ''[[sola gratia]]'' and ''[[sola fide]]''), but this was not generally accepted among his followers. However, these books are ordered last in the [[German language|German-language]] [[Luther Bible]] to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibelcenter.de/bibel/lu1545/ |title=Lutherbibel 1545 |website=Bibelarbeit |accessdate=5 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20010514151557/http://www.bibelcenter.de/bibel/lu1545/ |archivedate=14 May 2001 }} note order: &quot;...Hebräer, Jakobus, Judas, Offenbarung&quot;; see also {{cite web |url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html |title=German Bible Versions |website=bible-researcher.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
