'''Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane''', commonly known as '''DDT''', is a colorless, tasteless, and almost odorless [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] chemical compound,&lt;ref name=EHC009/&gt; an [[organochlorine]]. Originally developed as an [[insecticide]], it became infamous for its environmental impacts.  DDT was first synthesized in 1874 by the Austrian chemist [[Othmar Zeidler]]. DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist [[Paul Hermann Müller]] in 1939. DDT was used in the second half of [[World War II]] to control [[malaria]] and [[typhus]] among civilians and troops. Müller was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1948 &quot;for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several [[arthropods]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=nobel&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1948/ NobelPrize.org: The Nobel Prize in Physiology of Medicine 1948], accessed July 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1945, DDT was available for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distillations&quot;/&gt; Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s book ''[[Silent Spring]]''. It cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environmental and health effects. The book said that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause [[cancer]] and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lear&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Linda |last=Lear|title=Rachel Carson: Witness for Nature|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=36euz6DjmwUC}}|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=978-0-547-23823-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]], but its limited and still-controversial use in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] [[Vector control|control]] continues,&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Larson |first=Kim | name-list-format = vanc |date=December 1, 2007 |title=Bad Blood |journal=On Earth |issue=Winter 2008 |url=http://www.onearth.org/article/bad-blood? |accessdate=June 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moyers&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moyers |first=Bill | name-list-format = vanc |author-link=Bill Moyers |title=Rachel Carson and DDT |date=September 21, 2007 |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09212007/profile2.html |accessdate=March 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.

Along with the passage of the [[Endangered Species Act]], the United States ban on DDT is a major factor in the comeback of the [[bald eagle]] (the [[Bald eagle#National bird of the United States|national bird of the United States]]) and the [[peregrine falcon]] from near-extinction in the [[contiguous United States]].&lt;ref name=Stokstad07&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stokstad E | title = Species conservation.

==Properties and chemistry==
DDT is similar in structure to the insecticide [[methoxychlor]] and the [[acaricide]] [[dicofol]]. It is highly [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and nearly [[Solubility|insoluble]] in [[Properties of water|water]] but has good solubility in most [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[solvent]]s, [[fat]]s and [[oil]]s. DDT does not occur naturally and is synthesised by consecutive [[Friedel–Crafts reaction]]s between [[chloral]] ({{chem|CCl|3|CHO}}) and two [[equivalent (chemistry)|equivalents]] of [[chlorobenzene]] ({{chem|C|6|H|5|Cl}}), in the presence of an acidic [[Catalysis|catalyst]]. DDT has been marketed under [[trade name]]s including Anofex, Cezarex, Chlorophenothane, Dicophane, Dinocide, Gesarol, Guesapon, Guesarol, Gyron, Ixodex, Neocid, Neocidol and Zerdane; [[international nonproprietary name|INN]] is clofenotane.&lt;ref name=EHC009/&gt;

===Isomers and related compounds===
Commercial DDT is a mixture of several closely–related compounds. Due to the nature of the chemical reaction used to synthesize DDT, several combinations of ''ortho'' and ''para'' [[arene substitution pattern]]s are formed. The major component (77%) is the desired ''p'',''p{{'}}'' [[isomer]]. The ''o'',''p{{'}}'' isomeric impurity is also present in significant amounts (15%). [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene]] (DDE) and [[dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane]] (DDD) make up the balance of impurities in commercial samples. DDE and DDD are also the major [[metabolite]]s and environmental breakdown products.&lt;ref name=EHC009/&gt; DDT, DDE and DDD are sometimes referred to collectively as DDX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=22020740 |journal=J.

===Production and use ===
DDT has been formulated in multiple forms, including [[solution]]s in [[xylene]] or [[petroleum]] [[Distillation|distillates]], [[Emulsion|emulsifiable]] [[concentrate]]s, water-[[wettable powder]]s, granules, [[aerosol]]s, [[Smoke bomb|smoke candles]] and charges for vaporizers and lotions.&lt;ref name=EHC83&gt;{{EHC-ref | id = 83 | name = DDT and Its Derivatives: Environmental Aspects | isbn = 92-4-154283-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism of insecticide action===
In insects, DDT opens [[Sodium channel|sodium ion channels]] in [[neuron]]s, causing them to fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dong|first=Ke|date=March 2007|title=Insect sodium channels and insecticide resistance|journal=Invertebrate Neuroscience : IN|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17–30|doi=10.1007/s10158-006-0036-9|issn=1354-2516|pmc=3052376|pmid=17206406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects with certain [[mutation]]s in their sodium channel [[gene]] are resistant to DDT and similar insecticides.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing [[cytochrome P450]] in some insect species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Denholm I, Devine GJ, Williamson MS | title = Evolutionary genetics.

(The same enzyme family is up-regulated in mammals too, e.g., in response to ethanol consumption.)

DDT is the best-known of several [[chlorine]]-containing pesticides used in the 1940s and 1950s. With [[pyrethrum]] in short supply, DDT was used extensively during [[World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to control the insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of [[typhus]] – nearly eliminating the disease in many parts of [[Europe]]. In the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], it was sprayed aerially for malaria and dengue fever control with spectacular effects. While DDT's chemical and insecticidal properties were important factors in these victories, advances in application equipment coupled with competent organization and sufficient manpower were also crucial to the success of these programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunlap&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Dunlap|title=DDT: Scientists, Citizens, and Public Policy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=PLL_AwAAQBAJ}}|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5385-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the [[World Health Organization]] commenced a program to eradicate malaria in countries with low to moderate transmission rates worldwide, relying largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to reduce transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendis K, Rietveld A, Warsame M, Bosman A, Greenwood B, Wernsdorfer WH | title = From malaria control to eradication: The WHO perspective | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 802–809 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19497083 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02287.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program eliminated the disease in &quot;North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;AmJTrop&quot;/&gt; and in &quot;[[Taiwan]], much of the [[Caribbean]], the [[Balkans]], parts of northern Africa, the northern region of Australia, and a large swath of the South Pacific&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |author-link=Malcolm Gladwell |name-list-format=vanc |title=The Mosquito Killer |newspaper=The New Yorker |date=July 2, 2001 |url=http://gladwell.com/the-mosquito-killer/ |access-date=August 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416165010/http://gladwell.com/the-mosquito-killer/ |archive-date=April 16, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and dramatically reduced mortality in [[Sri Lanka]] and India.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt;

However, failure to sustain the program, increasing mosquito tolerance to DDT, and increasing parasite tolerance led to a resurgence. In many areas early successes partially or completely reversed, and in some cases rates of transmission increased.&lt;ref name=Chapin81&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chapin G, Wasserstrom R | title = Agricultural production and malaria resurgence in Central America and India | journal = Nature | volume = 293 | issue = 5829 | pages = 181–185 | year = 1981 | pmid = 7278974 | doi = 10.1038/293181a0 | bibcode = 1981Natur.293..181C }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program succeeded in eliminating malaria only in areas with &quot;high socio-economic status, well-organized healthcare systems, and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmJTrop&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadasivaiah S, Tozan Y, Breman JG | title = Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) for indoor residual spraying in Africa: how can it be used for malaria control? | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 77 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 249–263 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18165500 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.2007.77.249 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT was less effective in tropical regions due to the continuous life cycle of mosquitoes and poor infrastructure. It was not applied at all in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] due to these perceived difficulties. Mortality rates in that area never declined to the same dramatic extent, and now constitute the bulk of malarial deaths worldwide, especially following the disease's resurgence as a result of resistance to drug treatments and the spread of the deadly malarial variant caused by ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]''. Eradication was abandoned in 1969 and attention instead focused on controlling and treating the disease. Spraying programs (especially using DDT) were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as problems in administrative, managerial and financial implementation.&lt;ref name=Chapin81/&gt; Efforts shifted from spraying to the use of [[Mosquito net|bednets]] impregnated with insecticides and other interventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmJTrop&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogan05&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogan WJ, Chen A | title = Health risks and benefits of bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane (DDT) | journal = Lancet | volume = 366 | issue = 9487 | pages = 763–773 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16125595 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67182-6 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1259797 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States ban===
By October 1945, DDT was available for public sale in the United States, used both as an agricultural pesticide and as a household insecticide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distillations&quot;/&gt;  Although its use was promoted by government and the agricultural industry, US scientists such as FDA pharmacologist [[Herbert O. Calvery]] expressed concern over possible hazards associated with DDT as early as 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Frederick Rowe|title=Banned : a history of pesticides and the science of toxicology.|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0300205176|pages=26|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=kuIdBQAAQBAJ|page=26}}|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Distillations&quot;/&gt; In 1947, [[Bradbury Robinson|Dr. Bradbury Robinson]], a physician and nutritionist practicing in [[St. Louis, Michigan]], warned of the dangers of using the pesticide DDT in agriculture. DDT had been researched and manufactured in St. Louis by the [[Michigan Chemical Corporation]], later purchased by [[Velsicol Chemical Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.velsicol.com/|title=Leading Chemical Company - Manufacture, Distribution &amp; Sales - Velsicol Chemical, LLC|first=Super|last=User|website=Leading Chemical Company - Manufacture, Distribution &amp; Sales - Velsicol Chemical, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had become an important part of the local economy.&lt;ref name= STLH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouismi.com/1/stlouis/history_by_decades.asp|title=History by Decades|website=www.stlouismi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing research performed by [[Michigan State University]]&lt;ref&gt;American Potato Journal June 1947, Volume 24, Issue 6, pp 183-187 Results of spraying and dusting potatoes in Michigan in 1946&lt;/ref&gt; in 1946, Robinson, a past president of the local Conservation Club,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Conservation Club, St. Louis, Has Program&quot;, ''Lansing State Journal'' (Lansing, Michigan), Page 14, March 2, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; opined that:  &lt;blockquote&gt;... perhaps the greatest danger from D.D.T. is that its extensive use in farm areas is most likely to upset the natural balances, not only killing beneficial insects in great number but by bringing about the death of fish, birds, and other forms of wild life either by their feeding on insects killed by D.D.T. or directly by ingesting the poison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | title = A Nutritionist Ponders the D.D.T.

As its production and use increased, public response was mixed. At the same time that DDT was hailed as part of the &quot;world of tomorrow,&quot; concerns were expressed about its potential to kill harmless and beneficial insects (particularly [[pollinators]]), birds, fish, and eventually humans. The issue of toxicity was complicated, partly because DDT's effects varied from species to species, and partly because consecutive exposures could accumulate, causing damage comparable to large doses. A  number of states attempted to regulate DDT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distillations&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conis|first1=Elena |title=Beyond Silent Spring: An Alternate History of DDT |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=2|issue=4|pages=16–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/beyond-silent-spring-an-alternate-history-of-ddt|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EHC009&gt;{{EHC-ref | id = 009 | name=DDT and its derivatives | date = 1979 | isbn = 92-4-154069-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s the federal government began tightening regulations governing its use.&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt; These events received little attention.

In 1957 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported an unsuccessful struggle to restrict DDT use in [[Nassau County, New York]], and the issue came to the attention of the popular naturalist-author Rachel Carson.  William Shawn, editor of ''The New Yorker'', urged her to write a piece on the subject, which developed into her 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]''. The book argued that [[pesticide]]s, including DDT, were poisoning both wildlife and the environment and were endangering human health.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lear&quot;/&gt; ''Silent Spring'' was a best seller, and public reaction to it launched the modern [[environmentalism|environmental movement]] in the United States. The year after it appeared, [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] ordered his Science Advisory Committee to investigate Carson's claims. The committee's report &quot;add[ed] up to a fairly thorough-going vindication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring thesis,&quot; in the words of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenberg DS | title = Pesticides: White House Advisory Body Issues Report Recommending Steps to Reduce Hazard to Public | journal = Science | volume = 140 | issue = 3569 | pages = 878–79 | date = May 1963 | pmid = 17810673 | doi = 10.1126/science.140.3569.878 | bibcode = 1963Sci...140..878G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and recommended a phaseout of &quot;persistent toxic pesticides&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaels2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Michaels |first=David | name-list-format = vanc | title = Doubt is Their Product: How Industry's Assault on Science Threatens Your Health|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-530067-3|title-link=Doubt is Their Product }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the U.S. military removed DDT from the military supply system due in part to the development of resistance by body lice to DDT; it was replaced by [[lindane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first= |last= |authorlink=   |title=Technical Guide No. 6 - Delousing Procedures for the Control of Louse-borne Disease During Contingency Operations |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] Armed Forces Pest Management Board Information Services Division|date= November 2011|url= https://perma.cc/HY4A-ENXM |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT became a prime target of the growing anti-chemical and anti-pesticide movements, and in 1967 a group of scientists and lawyers founded the [[Environmental Defense|Environmental Defense Fund]] (EDF) with the specific goal of enacting a ban on DDT. [[Victor Yannacone]], Charles Wurster, [[Art Cooley]] and others in the group had all witnessed bird kills or declines in bird populations and suspected that DDT was the cause. In their campaign against the chemical, the EDF petitioned the government for a ban and filed lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sue the Bastards |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910111-2,00.html |work=[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]] |date=October 18, 1971 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119181231/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,910111-2,00.html |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, [[toxicologist]] [[David Peakall]] was measuring [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] levels in the eggs of [[peregrine falcons]] and [[California condor]]s and finding that increased levels corresponded with thinner shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=David B.|last1=Peakall|first2=lloyd F.|last2=Kiff | name-list-format = vanc |title=Eggshell thinning and dde residue levels among peregrine falcons falco peregrinus: a global perspective|publisher=Wiley Online Library|date=April 1979|doi= 10.1111/j.1474-919X.1979.tb04962.x|volume=121|issue = 2|journal=Ibis|pages=200–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to an EDF suit, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in 1971 ordered the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] to begin the de-registration procedure for DDT. After an initial six-month review process, [[William Ruckelshaus]], the Agency's first [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]] rejected an immediate suspension of DDT's registration, citing studies from the EPA's internal staff stating that DDT was not an imminent danger.&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt; However, these findings were criticized, as they were performed mostly by [[economic entomologist]]s inherited from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], who many environmentalists felt were biased towards [[agribusiness]] and understated concerns about human health and wildlife. The decision thus created controversy.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;

The EPA held seven months of hearings in 1971–1972, with scientists giving evidence for and against DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus announced the cancellation of most uses of DDT – exempting public health uses under some conditions.&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt;  Again, this caused controversy. Immediately after the announcement, both the EDF and the DDT manufacturers filed suit against EPA. Many in the agricultural community were concerned that food production would be severely impacted, while proponents of pesticides warned of increased breakouts of insect-borne diseases and questioned the accuracy of giving animals high amounts of pesticides for cancer potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Susan Wayland and Penelope Fenner-Crisp. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/pesticides.pdf “Reducing Pesticide Risks: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Industry sought to overturn the ban, while the EDF wanted a comprehensive ban. The cases were consolidated, and in 1973 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ]] ruled that the EPA had acted properly in banning DDT.&lt;ref name=EPA1975/&gt; During the late 1970s, the EPA also began banning organochlorines, pesticides that were chemically similar to DDT. These included aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane, heptachlor, texaphene, and mirex.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Some uses of DDT continued under the public health exemption. For example, in June 1979, the California Department of Health Services was permitted to use DDT to suppress [[flea]] vectors of [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlAEI – Short Publications – The Rise, Fall, Rise, and Imminent Fall of DDT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aei.org/outlook/27063 |title=AEI – Short Publications – The Rise, Fall, Rise, and Imminent Fall of DDT |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102120306/http://www.aei.org/outlook/27063 |archivedate=January 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; DDT continued to be produced in the United States for foreign markets until 1985, when over 300 tons were exported.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATSDRc5&quot;/&gt;

===International usage restrictions===
In the 1970s and 1980s, agricultural use was banned in most developed countries, beginning with [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvm.hu/main.php?folderID=1564&amp;articleID=6169&amp;ctag=articlelist&amp;iid=1&amp;part=2 |title=Selected passages from the history of the Hungarian plant protection administration on the 50th anniversary of establishing the county plant protection stations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110025539/http://www.fvm.hu/main.php?folderID=1564&amp;articleID=6169&amp;ctag=articlelist&amp;iid=1&amp;part=2 |archivedate=January 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] in 1970, [[West Germany]] and the United States in 1972, but not in the [[United Kingdom]] until 1984. By 1991, total bans, including for disease control, were in place in at least 26 countries; for example, Cuba in 1970, the US in the 1980s, Singapore in 1984, Chile in 1985, and the Republic of Korea in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pic.int/Portals/5/DGDs/DGD_DDT_EN.pdf |title=DDT, Decision Guidance Document, Joint FAO/UNEP Programme for the operation of Prior Informed Consent, UNEP/FAO, Rome, Italy, 1991.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]], which took effect in 2004, put a global ban on several [[persistent organic pollutant]]s, and restricted DDT use to [[vector control]]. The Convention was ratified by more than 170 countries. Recognizing that total elimination in many malaria-prone countries is currently unfeasible absent affordable/effective alternatives, the convention exempts public health use within [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) guidelines from the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/Repository/convention_text/UNEP-POPS-COP-CONVTEXT-FULL.English.PDF |title=Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resolution 60.18 of the [[World Health Assembly]] commits WHO to the Stockholm Convention's aim of reducing and ultimately eliminating DDT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/ipcs/capacity_building/ddt_statement/en/ |title=WHO.

DDT is a [[persistent organic pollutant]] that is readily [[adsorb]]ed to [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms.&lt;ref name=EHC83/&gt; Depending on conditions, its soil [[half-life]] can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, [[photolysis]] and [[aerobic organism|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]] [[biodegradation]]. Due to [[hydrophobic]] properties, in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water (however, its half-life in aquatic environments is listed by the [[National Pesticide Information Center]] as 150 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DDT (Technical Fact Sheet)|url=http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/archive/ddttech.pdf|access-date= 1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATSDRc5&quot;/&gt; DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the [[Arctic]] by the phenomenon of [[global distillation]], where they then accumulate in the region's [[food web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Grasshopper Effect and Tracking Hazardous Air Pollutants |journal=The Science and the Environment Bulletin |publisher=Environment Canada |issue=May/June 1998 |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/science/sandemay/PrintVersion/print2_e.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040928235911/http://www.ec.gc.ca/science/sandemay/printversion/print2_e.html |archivedate=September 28, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic toxicity ===
Primarily through the tendency for DDT to build up in areas of the body with high lipid content, chronic exposure can affect reproductive capabilities and the embryo or fetus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agarwal&quot;/&gt;
* A review article in ''[[The Lancet]]'' states, &quot;research has shown that exposure to DDT at amounts that would be needed in malaria control might cause preterm birth and early weaning&amp;nbsp;... toxicological evidence shows [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine-disrupting]] properties; human data also indicate possible disruption in semen quality, menstruation, gestational length, and duration of lactation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rogan05/&gt;

=== Carcinogenicity ===
In 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] classified DDT as Group 2A &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr236_E.pdf|title=IARC Monographs evaluate DDT, lindane, and 2,4-D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous assessments by the U.S. [[National Toxicology Program]] classified it as &quot;reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen&quot; and by the EPA classified DDT, DDE and DDD as class B2 &quot;probable&quot; [[carcinogen]]s; these evaluations were based mainly on animal studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ATSDRc5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rogan05/&gt; &lt;!--In 2002, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported, &quot;Overall, in spite of some positive associations for some cancers within certain subgroups of people, there is no clear evidence that exposure to DDT/DDE causes cancer in humans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ATSDRc5&quot;/&gt; --&gt;

A 2005 Lancet review stated that occupational DDT exposure was associated with increased [[pancreatic cancer]] risk in 2 case control studies, but another study showed no DDE dose-effect association. Results regarding a possible association with [[liver cancer]] and biliary tract cancer are conflicting: workers who did not have direct occupational DDT contact showed increased risk. White men had an increased risk, but not white women or black men. Results about an association with multiple myeloma, prostate and testicular cancer, endometrial cancer and colorectal cancer have been inconclusive or generally do not support an association.&lt;ref name=Rogan05/&gt; A 2017 review of liver cancer studies concluded that &quot;organochlorine pesticides, including DDT, may increase [[hepatocellular carcinoma]] risk&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = VoPham T, Bertrand KA, Hart JE, Laden F, Brooks MM, Yuan JM, Talbott EO, Ruddell D, Chang CH, Weissfeld JL | title = Pesticide exposure and liver cancer: a review | journal = Cancer Causes &amp; Control | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 177–190 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28194594 | pmc = 5336347 | doi = 10.1007/s10552-017-0854-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 review, whose co-authors included persons engaged in DDT-related litigation, reached broadly similar conclusions, with an equivocal association with testicular cancer. [[Case–control studies]] did not support an association with leukemia or lymphoma.&lt;ref name=&quot;PineRiver&quot;/&gt;

====Breast cancer====
The question of whether DDT or DDE are [[Risk factors for breast cancer|risk factors in breast cancer]] has not been conclusively answered. Several meta analyses of observational studies have concluded that there is no overall relationship between DDT exposure and breast cancer risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park JH, Cha ES, Ko Y, Hwang MS, Hong JH, Lee WJ | title = Exposure to Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and the Risk of Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 77–84 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24955316 | pmc = 4064641 | doi = 10.1016/j.phrp.2014.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ingber SZ, Buser MC, Pohl HR, Abadin HG, Murray HE, Scinicariello F | title = DDT/DDE and breast cancer: a meta-analysis | journal = [[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]] | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–433 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24021539 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2013.08.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Institute of Medicine reviewed data on the association of breast cancer with DDT exposure in 2012 and concluded that a causative relationship could neither be proven nor disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith-Bindman R | title = Environmental causes of breast cancer and radiation from medical imaging: findings from the Institute of Medicine report | journal = Archives of Internal Medicine | volume = 172 | issue = 13 | pages = 1023–1027 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22688684 | pmc = 3936791 | doi = 10.1001/archinternmed.2012.2329 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 case–control study&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohn07&quot;/&gt; using archived blood samples found that breast cancer risk was increased 5-fold among women who were born prior to 1931 and who had high serum DDT levels in 1963. Reasoning that DDT use became widespread in 1945 and peaked around 1950, they concluded that the ages of 14–20 were a critical period in which DDT exposure leads to increased risk. This study, which suggests a connection between DDT exposure and breast cancer that would not be picked up by most studies, has received variable commentary in third party reviews. One review suggested that &quot;previous studies that measured exposure in older women may have missed the critical period&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PineRiver&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clapp RW, Jacobs MM, Loechler EL | title = Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005–2007 | journal = Reviews on Environmental Health | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–37 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18557596 | pmc = 2791455 | doi = 10.1515/REVEH.2008.23.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Toxicology Program notes that while the majority of studies have not found a relationship between DDT exposure and breast cancer that positive associations have been seen in a &quot;few studies among women with higher levels of exposure and among certain subgroups of women&quot;.&lt;ref name=NTP-DDT/&gt;

A 2015 case control study identified a link (odds ratio 3.4) between ''in-utero'' exposure (as estimated from archived maternal blood samples) and [[breast cancer]] diagnosis in daughters. The findings &quot;support classification of DDT as an endocrine disruptor, a predictor of breast cancer, and a marker of high risk&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohn BA, La Merrill M, Krigbaum NY, Yeh G, Park JS, Zimmermann L, Cirillo PM | title = DDT Exposure in Utero and Breast Cancer | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 100 | issue = 8 | pages = 2865–2872 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26079774 | pmc = 4524999 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2015-1841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaria control{{anchor|Use_against_malaria}}==
[[Malaria]] remains the primary [[public health]] challenge in many countries. In 2015, there were 214 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 438,000 deaths, 90% of which occurred in Africa.&lt;ref name=WHO15&gt;{{cite web|title=Malaria Fact sheet N°94|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; DDT is one of many tools to fight the disease. Its use in this context has been called everything from a &quot;miracle weapon [that is] like [[Kryptonite]] to the mosquitoes&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Kirsten | last = Weir | name-list-format = vanc |title=Rachel Carson's birthday bashing |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/06/29/rachel_carson/ |work=Salon.com |date=June 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to &quot;toxic colonialism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Paull | first = John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Toxic Colonialism |journal=New Scientist |issue=2628 |page=25 |date=November 3, 2007 | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19626280.400-toxic-colonialism.html/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before DDT, eliminating mosquito breeding grounds by drainage or poisoning with [[Paris green]] or [[pyrethrum]] was sometimes successful. In parts of the world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt; A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include [[antimalarial drugs]] to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; [[mosquito net|bednets]] and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and [[vector control]] strategies&lt;ref name=&quot;wmr09&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date = 2009 | publisher = World Health Organization | url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241563901_eng.pdf | title = World Malaria Report }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[larvacide|larvaciding]] with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and [[indoor residual spraying]] (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of interior walls and ceilings with insecticides. It is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO–approved IRS insecticides.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmJTrop&quot;/&gt;

The WHO's anti-malaria campaign of the 1950s and 1960s relied heavily on DDT and the results were promising, though temporary in developing countries. Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased [[irrigation]]. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. [[chloroquine]]) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDTBP.1/2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feachem RG, Sabot OJ | title = Global malaria control in the 21st century: a historic but fleeting opportunity | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 20 | pages = 2281–2284 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17519417 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.20.2281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance was largely fueled by unrestricted agricultural use. Resistance and the harm both to humans and the environment led many governments to curtail DDT use in vector control and agriculture.&lt;ref name=Chapin81/&gt; In 2006 WHO reversed a longstanding policy against DDT by recommending that it be used as an indoor pesticide in regions where malaria is a major problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/15/AR2006091501012.html |title=WHO Urges Use of DDT in Africa |date=September 16, 2006 |newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the mainstay of anti-malaria campaigns, as of 2008 only 12 countries used DDT, including India and some southern African states,&lt;ref name=wmr09/&gt; though the number was expected to rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;DDTBP.1/2&quot;/&gt;

===Initial effectiveness===
When it was introduced in World War II, DDT was effective in reducing malaria [[morbidity]] and [[mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt; WHO's anti-malaria campaign, which consisted mostly of spraying DDT and rapid treatment and diagnosis to break the transmission cycle, was initially successful as well. For example, in [[Sri Lanka]], the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance |page=51 | last = Garrett | first = Laurie |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=v9RY2PVOtOMC|page=51}}|date=31 October 1994|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-1-4299-5327-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/health/28global.html | title = Malaria: A Disease Close to Eradication Grows, Aided by Political Tumult in Sri Lanka | first = Donald G. | last = McNeil | name-list-format = vanc | work = The New York Times | date = December 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 29 in 1964. Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969. The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use. The program switched to [[malathion]], but despite initial successes, malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc | title = Mosquitoes, Malaria, and Man: A History of the Hostilities Since 1880|isbn=978-0-525-16025-0|first=Gordon A. |last=Harrison|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mfkBr2oskyEC}}|date=1 June 1978|publisher=Dutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karunaweera ND, Galappaththy GN, Wirth DF | title = On the road to eliminate malaria in Sri Lanka: lessons from history, challenges, gaps in knowledge and research needs | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 13 | issue = | page = 59 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24548783 | pmc = 3943480 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-13-59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT remains on WHO's list of insecticides recommended for IRS. After the appointment of [[Arata Kochi]] as head of its anti-malaria division, WHO's policy shifted from recommending IRS only in areas of seasonal or episodic transmission of malaria, to advocating it in areas of continuous, intense transmission.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr50/en/index.html | publisher = World Health Organization | title = Who gives indoor use of DDT a clean bill of health for controlling malaria }}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO reaffirmed its commitment to phasing out DDT, aiming &quot;to achieve a 30% cut in the application of DDT world-wide by 2014 and its total phase-out by the early 2020s if not sooner&quot; while simultaneously combating malaria. WHO plans to implement alternatives to DDT to achieve this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/malaria_ddt_20090506/en/index.html | title = Countries move toward more sustainable ways to roll back malaria | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa continues to use DDT under WHO guidelines. In 1996, the country switched to alternative insecticides and malaria incidence increased dramatically. Returning to DDT and introducing new drugs brought malaria back under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamey G | title = Roll Back Malaria: a failing global health campaign | journal = BMJ | volume = 328 | issue = 7448 | pages = 1086–1087 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15130956 | pmc = 406307 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.328.7448.1086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria cases increased in [[South America]] after countries in that continent stopped using DDT. Research data showed a strong negative relationship between DDT residual house sprayings and malaria. In a research from 1993 to 1995, Ecuador increased its use of DDT and achieved a 61% reduction in malaria rates, while each of the other countries that gradually decreased its DDT use had large increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts 1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffing SM, Gamboa D, Udhayakumar V | title = The history of 20th century malaria control in Peru | journal = Malaria Journal | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 303 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24001096 | pmc = 3766208 | doi = 10.1186/1475-2875-12-303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curtis CF | title = Should the use of DDT be revived for malaria vector control? | journal = Biomédica | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 455–461 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12596442 | doi = 10.7705/biomedica.v22i4.1171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mosquito resistance===
In some areas resistance reduced DDT's effectiveness. WHO guidelines require that absence of resistance must be confirmed before using the chemical.&lt;ref name=&quot;IRS-WHO&quot;&gt;&quot;

World Health Organization, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance is largely due to agricultural use, in much greater quantities than required for disease prevention.

Resistance was noted early in spray campaigns. Paul Russell, former head of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Anti-Malaria campaign, observed in 1956 that &quot;resistance has appeared after six or seven years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladwell&quot;/&gt; Resistance has been detected in Sri Lanka, [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]] and [[Central America]] and it has largely been replaced by [[organophosphate]] or [[carbamate]] insecticides, e.g. malathion or [[bendiocarb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis&quot;&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Curtis CF | url = http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/curtiscf.htm | title = Control of Malaria Vectors in Africa and Asia | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20071002124232/http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/curtiscf.htm | archive-date = October 2, 2007 | url-status = dead | date = February 1996 | publisher = University of Minnesota }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many parts of [[India]], DDT is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma VP | title = Current scenario of malaria in India | journal = Parassitologia | volume = 41 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 349–353 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10697882 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural uses were banned in 1989 and its anti-malarial use has been declining.

Studies of malaria-vector mosquitoes in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]], [[South Africa]] found susceptibility to 4% DDT (WHO's susceptibility standard), in 63% of the samples, compared to the average of 87% in the same species caught in the open. The authors concluded that &quot;Finding DDT resistance in the vector ''An. arabiensis'', close to the area where we previously reported pyrethroid-resistance in the vector ''An. funestus'' Giles, indicates an urgent need to develop a strategy of [[insecticide resistance]] management for the malaria control programmes of southern Africa.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hargreaves&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hargreaves K, Hunt RH, Brooke BD, Mthembu J, Weeto MM, Awolola TS, Coetzee M | title = Anopheles arabiensis and An. quadriannulatus resistance to DDT in South Africa | journal = Medical and Veterinary Entomology | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 417–422 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14651656 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2915.2003.00460.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT can still be effective against resistant mosquitoes&lt;ref name=PLoS1/&gt; and the avoidance of DDT-sprayed walls by mosquitoes is an additional benefit of the chemical.&lt;ref name=&quot;mrc&quot;/&gt; For example, a 2007 study reported that resistant mosquitoes avoided treated huts. The researchers argued that DDT was the best pesticide for use in IRS (even though it did not afford the most protection from mosquitoes out of the three test chemicals) because the other pesticides worked primarily by killing or irritating mosquitoes – encouraging the development of resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLoS1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grieco JP, Achee NL, Chareonviriyaphap T, Suwonkerd W, Chauhan K, Sardelis MR, Roberts DR | title = A new classification system for the actions of IRS chemicals traditionally used for malaria control | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | page = e716 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17684562 | pmc = 1934935 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000716 | editor1-last = Krishna | editor1-first = Sanjeev | bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..716G }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the avoidance behavior slows eradication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musawenkosi&quot;/&gt; Unlike other insecticides such as [[pyrethroid]]s, DDT requires long exposure to accumulate a lethal dose; however its irritant property shortens contact periods. &quot;For these reasons, when comparisons have been made, better malaria control has generally been achieved with pyrethroids than with DDT.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis&quot;/&gt; In India outdoor sleeping and night duties are common, implying that &quot;the excito-repellent effect of DDT, often reported useful in other countries, actually promotes outdoor transmission&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=DDT: The fallen angel |first=V.

===Residents' concerns===
{{Main|Indoor residual spraying#Residents' opposition to IRS}}
IRS is effective if at least 80% of homes and barns in a residential area are sprayed.&lt;ref name=&quot;IRS-WHO&quot;/&gt; Lower coverage rates can jeopardize program effectiveness. Many residents resist DDT spraying, objecting to the lingering smell, stains on walls, and the potential exacerbation of problems with other insect pests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Musawenkosi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mabaso ML, Sharp B, Lengeler C | title = Historical review of malarial control in southern African with emphasis on the use of indoor residual house-spraying | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 846–856 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15303988 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2004.01263.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thurow&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Malaria-New-Strain.htm In Malaria War, South Africa Turns To Pesticide Long Banned in the West]&quot; {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013113406/http://mindfully.org/Health/Malaria-New-Strain.htm |date=October 13, 2007 }}, Roger Thurow, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', July 26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pyrethroid]] insecticides (e.g. [[deltamethrin]] and [[lambda-cyhalothrin]]) can overcome some of these issues, increasing participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis&quot;/&gt;

===Human exposure===
A 1994 study found that [[South Africa]]ns living in sprayed homes have levels that are several orders of magnitude greater than others.&lt;ref name=&quot;PineRiver&quot;/&gt; [[Breast milk]] from South African mothers contains high levels of DDT and DDE.&lt;ref name=&quot;PineRiver&quot;/&gt; It is unclear to what extent these levels arise from home spraying vs food residues. Evidence indicates that these levels are associated with infant neurological abnormalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis&quot;/&gt;

Most studies of DDT's human health effects have been conducted in developed countries where DDT is not used and exposure is relatively low.&lt;ref name=Rogan05/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PineRiver&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090504122058.htm |title=Unprecedented Use Of DDT Concerns Experts |last=Science Daily |date=May 9, 2009 |publisher=ScienceDaily.com |accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illegal diversion to agriculture is also a concern as it is difficult to prevent and its subsequent use on crops is uncontrolled. For example, DDT use is widespread in Indian agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Markets/Commodities/Pesticide-level-in-veggies-fruits-rises/articleshow/4637527.cms|title=Pesticide level in veggies, fruits rises|last=Jayashree|first=Jayashree| name-list-format = vanc | date = 10 June 2009|newspaper=Economic Times|accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly [[mango]] production&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanjana|date=June 13, 2009|title=A Whole Fruit|journal=Tehelka Magazine|volume=6|issue=23|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main42.asp?filename=cr130609a_whole.asp|access-date=June 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405075828/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main42.asp?filename=cr130609a_whole.asp|archive-date=April 5, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is reportedly used by librarians to protect books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/State-public-libraries-gasp-for-breath/472785|title=State public libraries gasp for breath|last=Chakravartty|first=Anupam | name-list-format = vanc | date = 8 June 2009|newspaper=Indian Express|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include Ethiopia, where DDT intended for malaria control is reportedly used in coffee production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Katima | first = Jamidu | name-list-format = vanc | date = June 2009 | title = African NGOs outline commitment to malaria control without DDT | url = http://www.pan-uk.org/pestnews/Issue/pn84/PN84_5.pdf | journal = Pesticides News | issue = 84 | page = 5 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160224231607/http://www.pan-uk.org/pestnews/Issue/pn84/PN84_5.pdf | archivedate = February 24, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ghana where it is used for fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghananewsagency.org/s_social/r_9596/ |title=Ministry moves to check unorthodox fishing methods |last=Ghana News Agency |date=November 17, 2009 |publisher=Ghana News Agency |accessdate=November 18, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118212645/http://www.ghananewsagency.org/s_social/r_9596/ |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.myjoyonline.com/news/201004/45316.asp|title=Northern fisherfolks complain of committee's harassment|last=Appiah|first=Samuel|name-list-format=vanc|date=27 April 2010|publisher=Joy Online|accessdate=April 27, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429002159/http://news.myjoyonline.com/news/201004/45316.asp|archivedate=April 29, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residues in crops at levels unacceptable for export have been an important factor in bans in several tropical countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Curtis&quot;/&gt; Adding to this problem is a lack of skilled personnel and management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Musawenkosi&quot;/&gt;

===Criticism of restrictions on DDT use===

Criticisms of a DDT &quot;ban&quot; often specifically reference the 1972 United States ban (with the erroneous implication that this constituted a worldwide ban and prohibited use of DDT in vector control).

[[Organophosphate]] and [[carbamate]] insecticides, e.g. [[malathion]] and [[bendiocarb]], respectively, are more expensive than DDT per kilogram and are applied at roughly the same dosage. [[Pyrethroid]]s such as [[deltamethrin]] are also more expensive than DDT, but are applied more sparingly (0.02–0.3&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vs 1–2&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so the net cost per house per treatment is about the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmJTrop&quot;/&gt; DDT has one of the longest resiudal efficacy periods of any IRS insecticide, lasting 6 to 12 months. Pyrethroids will remain active for only 4 to 6 months, and organophosphates and carbamates remain active for 2 to 6 months. In many malaria-endemic countries, malaria transmission occurs year-round, meaning that the high expense conducting a spray campaign (including hiring spray operators, procuring insecticides, and conducting pre-spray outreach campaigns to encourage people to be home and to accept the intervention) will need to occur multiple times per year for these shorter lasting insecticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/69386/WHO_HTM_MAL_2006.1112_eng.pdf?sequence=1|title=Indoor Residual Spraying|last=|first=|date=2019|website=World Health Organization|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-chemical vector control====
Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or curtailed in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning mosquito breeding grounds and larva habitats, for example by eliminating standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa for more than half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Killeen GF, Fillinger U, Kiche I, Gouagna LC, Knols BG | title = Eradication of Anopheles gambiae from Brazil: lessons for malaria control in Africa? | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | pages = 618–627 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12383612 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(02)00397-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to CDC, such methods are not practical in Africa because &quot;''Anopheles gambiae'', one of the primary vectors of malaria in Africa, breeds in numerous small pools of water that form due to rainfall&amp;nbsp;... It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict when and where the breeding sites will form, and to find and treat them before the adults emerge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/vector_control.html |title=CDC – Malaria – Malaria Worldwide – How Can Malaria Cases and Deaths Be Reduced? – Larval Control and Other Vector Control Interventions |website= |accessdate=|date=January 29, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative effectiveness of IRS versus other malaria control techniques (e.g. bednets or prompt access to anti-malarial drugs) varies and is dependent on local conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmJTrop&quot;/&gt;

A WHO study released in January 2008 found that mass distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and [[artemisinin]]–based drugs cut malaria deaths in half in malaria-burdened Rwanda and Ethiopia. IRS with DDT did not play an important role in mortality reduction in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/ReportGFImpactMalaria.pdf Impact of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs) and artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) measured using surveillance data in four African countries]&quot;. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215004936/http://www.who.int/malaria/docs/ReportGFImpactMalaria.pdf |date=February 15, 2008 }} World Health Organization, January 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/01/MN4EUPS3D.DTL&amp;type=health Malaria deaths halved in Rwanda and Ethiopia Better drugs, mosquito nets are the crucial tools], David Brown (Washington Post), ''SF Chronicle'', A-12, February 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vietnam]] has enjoyed declining malaria cases and a 97% mortality reduction after switching in 1991 from a poorly funded DDT-based campaign to a program based on prompt treatment, bednets and pyrethroid group insecticides.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.afronets.org/files/malaria.pdf World Health Organization, A story to be shared: The successful fight against malaria in Vietnam]&quot;, November 6, 2000. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224853/http://www.afronets.org/files/malaria.pdf |date=February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, effective and affordable chemical and non-chemical strategies were so successful that the Mexican DDT manufacturing plant ceased production due to lack of demand.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMC1119118&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/work%20documents/ddt_ipenreport_english.pdf |title=DDT &amp; Malaria |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726185356/http://www.ipen.org/ipenweb/documents/work%20documents/ddt_ipenreport_english.pdf |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of fourteen studies in sub-Saharan Africa, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for children, chemoprophylaxis or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine and changing front–line drug treatment, found decision making limited by the lack of information on the costs and effects of many interventions, the small number of cost-effectiveness analyses, the lack of evidence on the costs and effects of packages of measures and the problems in generalizing or comparing studies that relate to specific settings and use different methodologies and outcome measures. The two cost-effectiveness estimates of DDT residual spraying examined were not found to provide an accurate estimate of the cost-effectiveness of DDT spraying; the resulting estimates may not be good predictors of cost-effectiveness in current programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman CA, Mills AJ | title = The evidence base on the cost-effectiveness of malaria control measures in Africa | journal = Health Policy and Planning | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–312 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10787646 | doi = 10.1093/heapol/14.4.301 | url = http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/14/4/301.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study in Thailand found the cost per malaria case prevented of DDT spraying ([[United States dollar|US$]]1.87) to be 21% greater than the cost per case prevented of [[lambda-cyhalothrin]]–treated nets (US$1.54),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamolratanakul P, Butraporn P, Prasittisuk M, Prasittisuk C, Indaratna K | title = Cost-effectiveness and sustainability of lambdacyhalothrin-treated mosquito nets in comparison to DDT spraying for malaria control in western Thailand | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 65 | issue = 4 | pages = 279–284 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11693869 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.2001.65.279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; casting some doubt on the assumption that DDT was the most cost-effective measure. The director of Mexico's malaria control program found similar results, declaring that it was 25% cheaper for Mexico to spray a house with synthetic pyrethroids than with DDT.&lt;ref name=&quot;PMC1119118&quot;/&gt; However, another study in South Africa found generally lower costs for DDT spraying than for impregnated nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman CA, Mnzava AE, Dlamini SS, Sharp BL, Mthembu DJ, Gumede JK | title = Comparison of the cost and cost-effectiveness of insecticide-treated bednets and residual house-spraying in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa | journal = Tropical Medicine &amp; International Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 280–295 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11348519 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-3156.2001.00700.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more comprehensive approach to measuring cost-effectiveness or efficacy of malarial control would not only measure the cost in dollars, as well as the number of people saved, but would also consider ecological damage and negative human health impacts. One preliminary study found that it is likely that the detriment to human health approaches or exceeds the beneficial reductions in malarial cases, except perhaps in epidemics. It is similar to the earlier study regarding estimated theoretical infant mortality caused by DDT and subject to the criticism also mentioned earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jcu.edu.au/jrtph/vol/v04corin.pdf | vauthors = Corin SE, Weaver SA |year=2005 |title=A risk analysis model with an ecological perspective on DDT and malaria control in South Africa |journal=Journal of Rural and Tropical Public Health |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=21–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in the [[Solomon Islands]] found that &quot;although impregnated bed nets cannot entirely replace DDT spraying without substantial increase in incidence, their use permits reduced DDT spraying&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Over M, Bakote'e B, Velayudhan R, Wilikai P, Graves PM | title = Impregnated nets or DDT residual spraying?

A comparison of four successful programs against malaria in Brazil, India, Eritrea and Vietnam does not endorse any single strategy but instead states, &quot;Common success factors included conducive country conditions, a targeted technical approach using a package of effective tools, data-driven decision-making, active leadership at all levels of government, involvement of communities, decentralized implementation and control of finances, skilled technical and managerial capacity at national and sub-national levels, hands-on technical and programmatic support from partner agencies, and sufficient and flexible financing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barat LM | title = Four malaria success stories: how malaria burden was successfully reduced in Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Vietnam | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 74 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–16 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16407339 | doi = 10.4269/ajtmh.2006.74.12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DDT resistant mosquitoes may be susceptible to pyrethroids in some countries. However, pyrethroid resistance in ''Anopheles'' mosquitoes is on the rise with resistant mosquitoes found in multiple countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mint Mohamed Lemine A, Ould Lemrabott MA, Niang EH, Basco LK, Bogreau H, Faye O, Ould Mohamed Salem Boukhary A | title = Pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis in Nouakchott, Mauritania | journal = Parasites &amp; Vectors | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 344 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29895314 | pmc = 5998517 | doi = 10.1186/s13071-018-2923-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
