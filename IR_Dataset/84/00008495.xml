A '''data set''' (or '''dataset''') is a collection of [[data]]. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more [[table (database)|database tables]], where every [[column (database)|column]] of a table represents a particular variable, and each [[row (database)|row]] corresponds to a given record of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.  Each value is known as a datum. Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files.&lt;ref name=&quot;Editorial&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snijders | first1 = C. | last2 = Matzat | first2 = U. | last3 = Reips | first3 = U.-D. | year = 2012 | title = 'Big Data': Big gaps of knowledge in the field of Internet | url = http://www.ijis.net/ijis7_1/ijis7_1_editorial.html | journal = International Journal of Internet Science | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[open data]] discipline, data set is the unit to measure the information released in a public open data repository.  The European Open Data portal aggregates more than half a million data sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europeandataportal.eu/data/en/dataset|title=European open data portal|last=|first=|date=|website=European open data portal|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this field other definitions have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meloda.org/dataset-definition/|title=Dataset definition – MELODA|website=www.meloda.org|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but currently there is not an official one. Some other issues (real-time data sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atz|first=U|date=2014|title=The tau of data: A new metric to assess the timeliness of data in catalogues|url=http://duweb.donau-uni.ac.at/imperia/md/content/department/gpa/zeg/bilder/cedem/cedem14/cedem14_proceedings.pdf#page=258|journal=CEDEM 2014 Proceedings|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-08-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-relational data sets, etc.) increases the difficulty to reach a consensus about it.

==Properties==
Several characteristics define a data set's structure and properties.  These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various [[statistical measure]]s applicable to them, such as [[standard deviation]] and [[kurtosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTzeRZFmaBgC&amp;pg=PA100 |title=Principles of data mining and knowledge discovery |author=Jan M. Żytkow, Jan Rauch |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |isbn=978-3-540-66490-1 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The values may be numbers, such as [[real number]]s or [[integer]]s, for example representing a person's height in centimeters, but may also be [[nominal data]] (i.e., not consisting of [[Number|numerical]] values), for example representing a person's ethnicity. More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a [[level of measurement]]. For each variable, the values are normally all of the same kind. However, there may also be ''[[missing values]]'', which must be indicated in some way.

In [[statistics]], data sets usually come from actual observations obtained by [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] a [[statistical population]], and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population. Data sets may further be generated by [[algorithms]] for the purpose of testing certain kinds of [[software]].  Some modern statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] still present their data in the classical data set fashion.  If data is missing or suspicious an [[imputation (statistics)|imputation]] method may be used to complete a data set.&lt;ref name=&quot;sde&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Statistical Data Editing: Impact on Data Quality: Volume 3 of Statistical Data Editing, Conference of European Statisticians Statistical standards and studies |author=United Nations Statistical Commission |author2=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |year=2007 |publisher=United Nations Publications |isbn=9211169526 |page=20 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=X0wtLo2XY9gC |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classic data sets ==
Several classic data sets have been used extensively in the [[statistical]] literature:
