'''Dorado''' ({{IPAc-en|US|d|ɒ|ˈ|r|eɪ|d|oʊ|,_}}{{IPAc-en|alsoUK|-|ɑː|d|oʊ}}) is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the [[IAU designated constellations|88 modern constellations]]. Its name refers to the [[Coryphaena|dolphinfish]] (''Coryphaena hippurus''), which is known as ''dorado'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], although it has also been depicted as a [[swordfish]]. Dorado contains most of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], the remainder being in the constellation [[Mensa (constellation)|Mensa]]. The South [[Ecliptic pole]] also lies within this constellation.

Even though the name Dorado is not [[Latin]] but Portuguese, astronomers give it the Latin [[genitive]] form ''Doradus'' when naming its stars; it is treated (like the adjacent asterism [[Argo Navis]]) as a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -ō (like ''Io'' or ''Callisto'' or ''Argo''), which have a genitive ending ''-ūs''.

==History==
Dorado was one of twelve constellations named by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]],{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=142–143}}. It appeared:
*On Plancius's maps of 1592 and 1594, figured as an elderly bearded man named [[Polophylax]] (Greek for &quot;guardian of the [[Celestial pole|pole]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Lost Stars, by Morton Wagman, publ. Mcdonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company, First printing September 2003, page 134, {{ISBN|0-939923-78-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On a {{convert|35|cm|in|adj=mid|sp=us|-diameter}} celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;!-- Preceding information not sourced to Staal 1988 --&gt;
*First depiction in a celestial atlas, in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603, where it was named Dorado.
*In [[Johannes Kepler]]'s edition of [[Tycho Brahe]]'s star list in the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' of 1627: first time that it was named '''Xiphias''', the [[swordfish]].
Dorado has been represented historically as a [[dolphinfish]] and a [[swordfish]]; the latter depiction is inaccurate.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=244}} It has also been represented as a [[goldfish]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=142–143}} The constellation was also known in the 17th and 18th century as Xiphias. The name ''Dorado'' ultimately become dominant and was adopted by the [[IAU]].

===Stars ===
{{see also|List of stars in Dorado}}

[[Alpha Doradus]] is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.3, 176 light-years from Earth. It is the brightest star in Dorado. [[Beta Doradus]] is a notably bright [[Cepheid variable]] star. It is a yellow-tinged supergiant star that has a minimum magnitude of 4.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5. One thousand and forty light-years from Earth, Beta Doradus has a period of 9 days and 20 hours.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=142–143}}

[[R Doradus]] is one of the many [[variable star]]s in Dorado. [[S Doradus|S Dor]], 9.721 [[hypergiant]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], is the prototype of [[Luminous blue variable|S Doradus variable]] stars. The variable star [[R Doradus]] 5.73 has the largest known apparent size of any star other than the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-id?Ident=r+doradus&amp;NbIdent=1&amp;Radius=2&amp;Radius.unit=arcmin&amp;submit=submit+id |title = R Doradus |accessdate = 28 July 2012 |publisher = [[SIMBAD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gamma Doradus]] is the prototype of the [[Gamma Doradus variable]] stars.

[[SN1987A|Supernova 1987A]] was the closest supernova to occur since the invention of the telescope. [[SNR 0509-67.5]] is the remnant of an unusually energetic Type 1a supernova from about 400 years ago.

[[HE 0437-5439]] is a [[hypervelocity star]] escaping from the [[Milky Way]]/[[Magellanic Cloud]] system.

Dorado is also the location of the South [[Ecliptic pole]], which lies near the fish's head. The pole was called &quot;Polus Doradinalis&quot; by [[Willem Jansson Blaeu]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=244}}

===Deep-sky objects===
Because Dorado contains part of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], it is rich in deep sky objects. The Large Magellanic Cloud, 25,000 light-years in diameter, is a [[satellite galaxy]] of the Milky Way Galaxy, located at a distance of 179,000 light-years. It has been deformed by its gravitational interactions with the larger Milky Way. In 1987, it became host to [[SN 1987A]], the first supernova of 1987 and the closest since 1604.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title = 300 Astronomical Objects: A Visual Reference to the Universe |last1=Wilkins |first1=Jamie |last2=Dunn |first2 = Robert |publisher = Firefly Books |date = 2006 |edition = 1st |location=Buffalo, New York |isbn = 978-1-55407-175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 25,000-light-year-wide galaxy contains over 10,000 million stars.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|pp=142–143}} All coordinates given are for Epoch [[J2000.0]].

* [[NGC 2074]] (RA 05h 39m 03.0s, Dec −69° 29′ 54″) is an emission nebula.
* [[NGC 2080]], also called the &quot;Ghost Head Nebula&quot;, is an emission nebula that is 50 light-years wide in the Large Magellanic Cloud.

The western portion is colored green from [[doubly ionized oxygen]], the southern portion is red from [[hydrogen alpha]] emissions, and the center region is colored yellow from both oxygen and hydrogen emissions.

* [[N44 (astronomy)|N44]] is a [[superbubble]] in the Large Magellanic Cloud that is 1,000 light-years wide. Its overall structure is shaped by the 40 hot stars towards its center. Within the superbubble of N44 is a smaller bubble catalogued as N44F. It is approximately 35 light-years in diameter and is shaped by an incredibly hot star at its center, which has a [[stellar wind]] speed of 7 million kilometers per hour. N44F also features dust columns with probable [[star formation]] hidden inside.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}
