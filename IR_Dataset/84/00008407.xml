In [[geometry]], a '''dodecahedron''' (Greek {{lang|grc|δωδεκάεδρον}}, from {{lang|grc|δώδεκα}} ''dōdeka'' &quot;twelve&quot; + {{lang|grc|ἕδρα}} ''hédra'' &quot;base&quot;, &quot;seat&quot; or &quot;face&quot;) is any [[polyhedron]] with twelve flat faces. The most familiar dodecahedron is the [[regular dodecahedron]], which is a [[Platonic solid]]. There are also three [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|regular star dodecahedra]], which are constructed as [[stellation]]s of the convex form. All of these have [[icosahedral symmetry]], order 120.

The [[#Pyritohedron|pyritohedron]], a common crystal form in [[pyrite]], is an irregular pentagonal dodecahedron, having the same topology (in terms of its vertices as a graph) as the regular one but [[pyritohedral symmetry]] while the [[#Tetartoid|tetartoid]] has [[tetrahedral symmetry]]. The [[rhombic dodecahedron]], seen as a limiting case of the pyritohedron, has [[octahedral symmetry]]. The [[elongated dodecahedron]] and [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedron]] variations, along with the rhombic dodecahedra, are [[space-filling polyhedra|space-filling]]. There are numerous [[#Other dodecahedra|other dodecahedra]].

==Regular dodecahedra==
{{Main|Regular dodecahedron}}
The convex regular dodecahedron is one of the five regular [[Platonic solid]]s and can be represented by its [[Schläfli symbol]] {5, 3}.

The [[dual polyhedron]] is the regular [[icosahedron]] {3, 5}, having five equilateral triangles around each vertex.

|}
The convex regular dodecahedron also has three [[stellation]]s, all of which are regular star dodecahedra. They form three of the four [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]]. They are the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] {5/2, 5}, the [[great dodecahedron]] {5, 5/2}, and the [[great stellated dodecahedron]] {5/2, 3}. The small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are dual to each other; the great stellated dodecahedron is dual to the [[great icosahedron]] {3, 5/2}. All of these regular star dodecahedra have regular pentagonal or [[pentagram]]mic faces. The convex regular dodecahedron and great stellated dodecahedron are different realisations of the same [[abstract polytope|abstract regular polyhedron]]; the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron are different realisations of another abstract regular polyhedron.

==Other pentagonal dodecahedra==
In [[crystallography]], two important dodecahedra can occur as crystal forms in some [[crystallographic point groups|symmetry classes]] of the [[cubic crystal system]] that are topologically equivalent to the regular dodecahedron but less symmetrical: the pyritohedron with [[pyritohedral symmetry]], and the [[tetartoid]] with [[tetrahedral symmetry]]:

A '''pyritohedron''' is a dodecahedron with [[pyritohedral symmetry|pyritohedral]] (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) symmetry. Like the [[regular dodecahedron]], it has twelve identical [[pentagon]]al faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices (see figure).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleries.com/minerals/property/crystal.htm#dodecahe Crystal Habit]. Galleries.com. Retrieved on 2016-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pentagons are not constrained to be regular, and the underlying atomic arrangement has no true fivefold symmetry axis. Its 30 edges are divided into two sets – containing 24 and 6 edges of the same length. The only axes of [[rotational symmetry]] are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes and four threefold axes.

Although regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the pyritohedron form occurs in the crystals of the mineral [[pyrite]], and it may be an inspiration for the discovery of the regular [[Platonic solid]] form. The true regular dodecahedron can occur as a shape for [[quasicrystal]]s (such as [[holmium–magnesium–zinc quasicrystal]]) with [[icosahedral symmetry]], which includes true fivefold rotation axes.

====Crystal pyrite====
Its name comes from one of the two common [[crystal habit]]s shown by [[pyrite]], the other one being the [[cube]].

|[[File:Pyriteespagne.jpg|150px]]&lt;br&gt;Cubic pyrite
|[[File:Pyrite-193871.jpg|150px]]&lt;br&gt;Pyritohedral pyrite
|}

====Cartesian coordinates====
[[File:Pyritohedron animation.gif|200px|left]]
The coordinates of the eight vertices of the original cube are:
:(±1, ±1, ±1)

The coordinates of the 12 vertices of the cross-edges are:
:(0, ±(1 + ''h''), ±(1 − ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;))
:(±(1 + ''h''), ±(1 − ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 0)
:(±(1 − ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 0, ±(1 + ''h''))

where ''h'' is the height of the [[wedge (geometry)|wedge-shaped &quot;roof&quot;]] above the faces of the cube. When ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the six cross-edges degenerate to points and a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] is formed. When ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, the cross-edges are absorbed in the facets of the cube, and the pyritohedron reduces to a cube. When ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|−1 + {{radic|5}}|2}}, the multiplicative inverse of the [[golden ratio]], the result is a regular dodecahedron. When ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|−1 − {{radic|5}}|2}}, the conjugate of this value, the result is a regular [[great stellated dodecahedron]].

====Geometric freedom====
[[File:Endo-dodecahedron honeycomb.gif|thumb|Animation of convex/concave pyritohedral honeycomb, between h={{sfrac|±{{radic|5}} + 1|2}}]]
The pyritohedron has a geometric degree of freedom with [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]]s of a cubic [[convex hull]] at one limit of collinear edges, and a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] as the other limit as 6 edges are degenerated to length zero. The regular dodecahedron represents a special intermediate case where all edges and angles are equal.

It is possible to go past these limiting cases, creating concave or nonconvex pyritohedra. The ''endo-dodecahedron'' is concave and equilateral; it can tessellate space with the convex regular dodecahedron. Continuing from there in that direction, we pass through a degenerate case where twelve vertices coincide in the centre, and on to the regular [[great stellated dodecahedron]] where all edges and angles are equal again, and the faces have been distorted into regular [[pentagram (geometry)|pentagrams]]. On the other side, past the rhombic dodecahedron, we get a nonconvex equilateral dodecahedron with fish-shaped self-intersecting equilateral pentagonal faces.

[[File:Tetartoid-25.gif|thumb|240px|Tetartoid]]
A '''tetartoid''' (also '''tetragonal pentagonal dodecahedron''', '''pentagon-tritetrahedron''', and '''tetrahedric pentagon dodecahedron''') is a dodecahedron with chiral [[tetrahedral symmetry]] (T). Like the [[regular dodecahedron]], it has twelve identical [[pentagon]]al faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices. However, the pentagons are not regular and the figure has no fivefold symmetry axes.

Although regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the tetartoid form does. The name tetartoid comes from the Greek root for one-fourth because it has one fourth of full octahedral symmetry, and half of pyritohedral symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch, Steve. [https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/xlforms.htm The 48 Special Crystal Forms] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918103121/https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/xlforms.htm |date=2013-09-18 }}.

Its topology can be as a cube with square faces bisected into 2 rectangles like the pyritohedron, and then the bisection lines are slanted retaining 3-fold rotation at the 8 corners.

====Cartesian coordinates====
The following points are vertices of a tetartoid pentagon under [[tetrahedral symmetry]]:
:(''a'', ''b'', ''c''); (−''a'', −''b'', ''c''); (−{{sfrac|''n''|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, −{{sfrac|''n''|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{sfrac|''n''|''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}); (−''c'', −''a'', ''b''); (−{{sfrac|''n''|''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{sfrac|''n''|''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{sfrac|''n''|''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}),

===Dual of triangular gyrobianticupola===
A lower symmetry form of the regular dodecahedron can be constructed as the dual of a polyhedra constructed from two triangular [[anticupola]] connected base-to-base, called a ''triangular gyrobianticupola.'' It has D&lt;sub&gt;3d&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, order 12. It has 2 sets of 3 identical pentagons on the top and bottom, connected 6 pentagons around the sides which alternate upwards and downwards. This form has a hexagonal cross-section and identical copies can be connected as a partial hexagonal honeycomb, but all vertices will not match.

==Rhombic dodecahedron==
[[File:Rhombicdodecahedron.jpg|160px|thumb|Rhombic dodecahedron]]
The ''[[rhombic dodecahedron]]'' is a [[zonohedron]] with twelve rhombic faces and octahedral symmetry. It is dual to the [[quasiregular polyhedron|quasiregular]] [[cuboctahedron]] (an [[Archimedean solid]]) and occurs in nature as a crystal form. The rhombic dodecahedron packs together to fill space.

The ''rhombic dodecahedron'' can be seen as a degenerate [[pyritohedron]] where the 6 special edges have been reduced to zero length, reducing the pentagons into rhombic faces.

The rhombic dodecahedron has several [[stellation]]s, the [[First stellation of rhombic dodecahedron|first of which]] is also a [[rhombic dodecahedron#Parallelohedron|parallelohedral spacefiller]].

Another important rhombic dodecahedron, the [[Bilinski dodecahedron]], has twelve faces congruent to those of the [[rhombic triacontahedron]], i.e. the diagonals are in the ratio of the [[golden ratio]]. It is also a [[zonohedron]] and was described by [[Stanko Bilinski|Bilinski]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Hafner, I. and Zitko, T. [http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/hafner2/IntrodRhombic.html Introduction to golden rhombic polyhedra]. Faculty of Electrical Engineering, [[University of Ljubljana]], Slovenia.&lt;/ref&gt; This figure is another spacefiller, and can also occur in non-periodic [[honeycomb (geometry)|spacefilling]]s along with the rhombic triacontahedron, the rhombic icosahedron and rhombic hexahedra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://met.iisc.ernet.in/~lord/webfiles/tcq.html |author1=Lord, E.

==Other dodecahedra==
There are 6,384,634 topologically distinct ''convex'' dodecahedra, excluding mirror images—the number of vertices ranges from 8 to 20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numericana.com/data/polycount.htm Counting polyhedra]. Numericana.com (2001-12-31). Retrieved on 2016-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; (Two polyhedra are &quot;topologically distinct&quot; if they have intrinsically different arrangements of faces and vertices, such that it is impossible to distort one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.)
