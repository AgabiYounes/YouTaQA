'''David McAlister Barry''' (born July 3, 1947) is an American author and columnist who wrote a nationally [[Print syndication|syndicated]] humor column for the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' from 1983 to 2005. He has also written numerous books of humor and [[parody]], as well as [[comic novel]]s. Barry's honors include the [[Pulitzer Prize for Commentary]] (1988) and the [[Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism]] (2005).

Barry has defined a sense of humor as &quot;a measurement of the extent to which we realize that we are trapped in a world almost totally devoid of reason. Laughter is how we express the anxiety we feel at this knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Bryan|title=An elegy for Dave Barry|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2112218/|accessdate=June 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Barry was born in [[Armonk, New York]], where his father, David,&lt;!-- his father did not have the same middle name, and therefore it's not a Jr/Sr thing. This is as per Barry's assistant} --&gt; was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. He was educated at Wampus Elementary School, Harold C. Crittenden Junior High School (both in Armonk), and [[Pleasantville High School (New York)|Pleasantville High School]], where he was elected &quot;Class Clown&quot; in 1965. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from [[Haverford College]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/dave-barry-20699073|title=Dave Barry|website=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alumnus of a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-affiliated college, he [[draft evasion|avoided military service]] during the [[Vietnam War]] by registering as a religious [[conscientious objector]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-09-22/features/8503050333_1_bulletin-board-potty-elderly-pedestrians/3 &quot;The World According To Dave Barry&quot;], 1985, Eric Zorn, ''Chicago Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding his father's vocation, Barry decided &quot;early on&quot; that he was an [[Atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Huberman&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Quotable Atheist|last=Huberman|first=Jack|year=2007|publisher=Nation Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/quotableatheista0000unse/page/31 31]|isbn=978-1-56025-969-5|url=https://archive.org/details/quotableatheista0000unse/page/31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said, &quot;The problem with writing about religion is that you run the risk of offending sincerely religious people, and then they come after you with machetes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huberman&quot;/&gt;

==Writing career==
Barry began his journalism career in 1971, working as a general-assignment reporter for the ''[[Daily Local News]]'' in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], near his [[alma mater]], Haverford College. He covered local government and civic events and was promoted to City Editor after about two years. He also started writing a weekly humor column for the paper and began to develop his unique style. He remained at the newspaper through 1974. He then worked briefly as a [[copy editor]] at the [[Associated Press]]'s Philadelphia bureau before joining Burger Associates, a consulting firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Dave Barry | title=2008ish bio | url=http://www.davebarry.com/dave-barry-other-bio.php | access-date=November 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Burger, he taught effective writing to business people. In his own words, he &quot;spent nearly eight years trying to get various businesspersons to...stop writing things like 'Enclosed please find the enclosed enclosures,' but...eventually realized that it was hopeless.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bioold&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=1999 Dave Barry Biography|url=http://www.davebarry.com/bioold.htm|accessdate=May 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brian Engler-Dave Barry &amp; The Fairfax Prize-Close-up 9-22-2013.JPG|thumb|left|Brian Engler, Chair of the Fairfax Library Foundation, presents the 2013 Fairfax Prize to Dave Barry on September 22, 2013.]]
In 1981 he wrote a humorous guest column in the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' about watching the birth of his son, which attracted the attention of [[Gene Weingarten]], then an editor of the ''[[Miami Herald]]''{{'}}s Sunday magazine ''Tropic''. Weingarten hired Barry as a humor columnist in 1983. Barry's column was syndicated nationally. Barry won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Commentary]] in 1988 for &quot;his consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pulitzer Prize Winners 1988|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1988|accessdate=May 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry's first novel, ''[[Big Trouble (novel)|Big Trouble]]'', was published in 1999. The book was adapted into a [[Big Trouble (2002 film)|motion picture]] directed by [[Barry Sonnenfeld]] and starring [[Tim Allen]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Patrick Warburton]], with a cameo by Barry (deleted in [[post-production]]). The movie was originally due for release in September 2001 but was postponed following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] because the story involved smuggling a [[nuclear weapon]] onto an airplane. The film was released in April 2002.

In response to a column in which Barry mocked the cities of [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]], and [[East Grand Forks, Minnesota]], for calling themselves the &quot;Grand Cities&quot;, Grand Forks named a sewage pumping station after Barry in January 2002. Barry traveled to Grand Forks for the dedication ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Idling in the Grand Cities|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-03-17/features/0203170453_1_cars-with-remote-control-devices-grand-forks-international-airport-grand-cities|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles written by Barry have appeared in publications such as ''Boating'', ''Home Office Computing'', and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', in addition to the ''[[Chicken Soup for the Soul]]'' inspirational book series. Two of his articles have been included in the ''Best American Sportswriting'' series. One of his columns was used as the introduction to the book ''Pirattitude!: So You Wanna Be a Pirate? Here's How!'' ({{ISBN|0-451-21649-0}}), a follow-up to Barry's role in publicizing [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]]. His books have frequently appeared on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]].

On October 31, 2004, Barry announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence of at least a year from his weekly column in order to spend more time with his family. In December 2005, Barry said in an interview with ''Editor and Publisher'' that he would not resume his weekly column, although he would continue such features as his yearly gift guide, his year-in-review feature, and his blog, as well as an occasional article or column.

In 2005, Barry won the [[Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arizona State University|title=Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication|url=https://cronkite.asu.edu/about/walter-cronkite-and-asu/walter-cronkite-award|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, September 22, 2013, the opening night of the 15th annual Fall for the Book festival in Fairfax, Virginia, Barry was awarded the event's highest honor, the Fairfax Prize,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dave Barry Named 2013 Fairfax Prize Winner |url=http://fallforthebook.org/2013/05/31/dave-barry-named-2013-fairfax-prize-winner/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000858/http://fallforthebook.org/2013/05/31/dave-barry-named-2013-fairfax-prize-winner/ |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fallforthebook.org/book-prizes/the-fairfax-prize/|title=Fairfax PRize|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120123705/http://fallforthebook.org/book-prizes/the-fairfax-prize|archivedate=January 20, 2014|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; honoring outstanding literary achievement, presented by the Fairfax Library Foundation.

==''Dave's World'' television series==
From 1993 to 1997, [[CBS]] broadcast the sitcom ''[[Dave's World]]'' based on the books ''[[Dave Barry Turns 40]]'' and ''Dave Barry's Greatest Hits''. The show starred [[Harry Anderson]] as Barry and [[DeLane Matthews]] as his wife Beth. In an early episode, Barry appeared in a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] role. After four seasons, the program was canceled shortly after being moved from its &quot;coveted&quot; Monday night slot&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1993-05-30-2915050-story.html|title=CBS Hopes Broad-based Programming Keeps It on Top|last=Lawler|first=Sylvia|date=May 30, 1993|work=The Morning Call|access-date=2020-01-03|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the &quot;[[Friday night death slot]],&quot; so named because of its association with low viewership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2015/10/22/wwe-smackdown-going-live-on-tuesdays-is-best-for-business/|title=WWE SmackDown Going Live On Tuesdays Is Best For Business|last=Oestriecher|first=Blake|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
During college, Barry was in a band called the Federal Duck. While at the ''Miami Herald'', he and several of his colleagues created a band called the Urban Professionals, with Barry on lead guitar and vocals. They performed an original song called &quot;The [[Tupperware]] Song&quot; at the Tupperware headquarters in [[Orlando, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Dave. ''Dave Barry's Greatest Hits'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1992, Barry played lead guitar in the [[Rock Bottom Remainders]], a rock band made up of published authors. ''([[Remaindered book|Remainder]]'' is a publishing term for a book that doesn't sell.) The band was founded by Barry's sister-in-law, [[Kathi Kamen Goldmark]], for an [[American Booksellers Association]] convention, and has also included [[Stephen King]], [[Amy Tan]], [[Ridley Pearson]], [[Scott Turow]], [[Mitch Albom]], [[Roy Blount Jr.]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], [[Matt Groening]], and Barry's brother [[Sam Barry (author)|Sam]], among others.&lt;ref name=RBR_NYT1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/arts/music/04rema.html |title=Rock On, but Hang on to Your Literary Gigs |last=McGrath |first=Charles |date=June 4, 2007 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=May 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davebarry.com/about.html|title=Dave Barry|accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's members &quot;are not musically skilled, but they are extremely loud,&quot; according to Barry. Several high-profile musicians, including [[Al Kooper]], [[Warren Zevon]], and [[Roger McGuinn]], have performed with the band, and [[Bruce Springsteen]] sat in at least once. The band's road tour resulted in the book ''Mid-Life Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America with Three Chords and an Attitude''. The Rock Bottom Remainders disbanded in 2012 following Goldmark's death from breast cancer.  They have reunited several times, performing at the Tucson Festival of books in 2016 and 2018.

==Other activities==
Beginning in 1984, Barry and ''Tropic'' editors [[Gene Weingarten]] and [[Tom Shroder]] have organized the [[Tropic Hunt]] (now the Herald Hunt), an annual [[puzzlehunt]] in Miami. A [[Washington, D.C.]], spinoff, the [[Post Hunt]], began in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/18/AR2008051802315.html|title=Urban Safari Participants Find Equal Parts Fun and Frustration|last=Ruane|first=Michael E.|date=2008-05-19|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2019-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry has run several mock campaigns for President of the United States, running on a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] platform. He has also written for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]'s national newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics1.com/indep2k.htm  Presidency 2000:The Independent, Write-In, and other Candidates], Politics1.com {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616165144/http://politics1.com/indep2k.htm |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The screen adaptation of Barry's book ''Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys'' was released in 2005; it is available on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Complete Guide to Guys (2005) - IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407680/|language=en|access-date=2019-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Barry married Lois Ann Shelnutt in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7104439/the_morning_news/ |title=Lois Ann Selnutt Bride of Mr. Barry |accessdate=September 19, 2017 |date=June 9, 1969 |publisher=The Morning News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He next married Beth Lenox, in 1976.
