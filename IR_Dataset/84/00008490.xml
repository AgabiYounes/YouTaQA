The '''discus throw''' ({{audio|En-us-discus.ogg|pronunciation|help=no}}), also known as disc throw, is a [[track and field]] event in which an athlete throws a heavy [[disk (mathematics)|disc]]—called a discus—in an attempt to mark a farther distance than their competitors. It is an [[classical antiquity|ancient]] sport, as demonstrated by the fifth-century-BC [[Myron]] statue ''[[Discobolus]]''. Although not part of the [[modern pentathlon]], it was one of the events of the [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon|ancient Greek pentathlon]], which can be dated back to at least to 708 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/passion/collectors/object/gallery_uk.asp?ObjId=318|title=Sports - List of Summer and Winter Olympic Sports|author=|date=14 January 2018|website=olympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is part of the modern [[decathlon]].

==History==
[[Image:Diskuskastare Gbg - Alkamenes.jpg|thumb|Modern copy of the ''Diskophoros'', attributed to [[Alkamenes]]]]
The sport of throwing the discus traces back to it being an event in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|original Olympic Games]] of Ancient Greece.  The discus as a sport was resurrected in [[Magdeburg]], Germany, by [[Christian Georg Kohlrausch]] and his students in the 1870s. Organized Men's competition was resumed in the late 19th century, and has been a part of the modern [[Summer Olympic Games]] since the first modern competition, the [[1896 Summer Olympics]]. Images of discus throwers figured prominently in advertising for early modern Games, such as fundraising stamps for the 1896 games, the main posters for the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1948 Summer Olympics]]. Today the sport of discus is a routine part of modern track-and-field meets at all levels, and retains a particularly iconic place in the Olympic Games. 

[[File:1920 olympics poster.jpg|thumb|The main poster for the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]]]

The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was [[František Janda-Suk]] from [[Bohemia]] (present [[Czech Republic]]). {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} He invented this technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus. After only one year of developing the technique he earned a silver medal in the 1900 Olympics.

Women's competition began in the first decades of the 20th century.  Following competition at national and regional levels it was added to the Olympic program for the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]].

==Description==
[[Image:Discobolus Kleomelos Louvre G111.jpg|thumb|left|Discus-thrower, tondo of a [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by the Kleomelos Painter, [[Louvre Museum]]]]
[[Image:Discus Thrower Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|left|Modern copy of [[Myron]]'s ''[[Discobolus]]'' in [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden]], [[Denmark]]]]
The men's discus is a heavy [[Lens (geometry)|lenticular]] [[disk (mathematics)|disc]] with a weight of {{convert|2|kg|lb}} and diameter of {{convert|22|cm|in}}, the women's discus has a weight of {{convert|1|kg|lb}} and diameter of {{convert|18|cm|in}}.

Under [[IAAF]] (international) rules, Youth boys (16–17 years) throw the {{convert|1.5|kg|lb}} discus, the Junior men (18–19 years) throw the unique {{convert|1.75|kg|lb}} discus, and the girls/women of those ages throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus.

In international competition, men throw the 2&amp;nbsp;kg discus through to age 49. The {{convert|1.5|kg|lb}} discus is thrown by ages 50–59, and men age 60 and beyond throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus. Women throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus through to age 74. Starting with age 75, women throw the {{convert|0.75|kg|lb}} discus.

The typical discus has sides made of plastic, wood, fiberglass, carbon fiber or metal with a metal rim and a metal core to attain the weight. The rim must be smooth, with no roughness or finger holds. A discus with more weight in the rim produces greater angular momentum for any given spin rate, and thus more stability, although it is more difficult to throw. However, a higher rim weight, if thrown correctly, can lead to a farther throw. A solid rubber discus is sometimes used (see [[#United States|in the United States]]).

To make a throw, the competitor starts in a circle of {{T&amp;Fcalc|2.5|m}} diameter, which is recessed in a concrete pad by {{convert|20|mm|in}}. The thrower typically takes an initial stance facing away from the direction of the throw. He then spins anticlockwise (for right-handers) around one and a half times through the circle to build momentum, then releases his throw. The discus must land within a 34.92-degree sector. The rules of competition for discus are virtually identical to those of [[shot put]], except that the circle is larger, a stop board is not used and there are no form rules concerning how the discus is to be thrown.

The basic motion is a forehanded sidearm movement. The discus is spun off the index finger or the middle finger of the throwing hand. In flight the disc spins clockwise when viewed from above for a right-handed thrower, and anticlockwise for a left-handed thrower. As well as achieving maximum momentum in the discus on throwing, the discus' distance is also determined by the trajectory the thrower imparts, as well as the aerodynamic behavior of the discus. Generally, throws into a moderate headwind achieve the maximum distance. Also, a faster-spinning discus imparts greater gyroscopic stability. The technique of discus throwing is quite difficult to master and needs lots of experience to get right, thus most top throwers are 30 years old or more.

==Phases==
The discus technique can be broken down into phases. The purpose is to transfer from the back to the front of the throwing circle while turning through one and a half circles. The speed of delivery is high, and speed is built up during the throw (slow to fast). Correct technique involves the buildup of torque so that maximum force can be applied to the discus on delivery.

[[Image:DiscusRutgerSmith6551.jpg|thumb|World and European champion [[Rutger Smith]] in phases of the discus throw]]

Initially, the thrower takes up their position in the throwing circle, distributing their bodyweight evenly over both feet, which are roughly shoulder width apart. They crouch in order to adopt a more efficient posture to start from whilst also [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preloading]] their muscles; this will allow them to start faster and achieve a more powerful throw. They then begin the wind-up, which sets the tone for the entire throw; the rhythm of the wind-up and throw is very important.

Focusing on rhythm can bring about the consistency to get in the right positions that many throwers lack. Executing a sound discus throw with solid technique requires perfect balance. This is due to the throw being a linear movement combined with a one and a half rotation and an implement at the end of one arm. Thus, a good discus thrower needs to maintain balance within the circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitaltrackandfield.com/shot-put-discus-technique/|title=Shot Put and Discus Technique and Training|last=Cappos|first=Scott|date=|website=Digital Track and Field|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a right handed thrower, the next stage is to move the weight over the left foot. From this position the right foot is raised, and the athlete 'runs' across the circle. There are various techniques for this stage where the leg swings out to a small or great extent, some athletes turn on their left heel (e.g. Ilke Wylluda&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vr-6mTLm30|title=wyludda discus throw 1996 olympics|first=|last=throwhammer|date=13 September 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but turning on the ball of the foot is far more common.

The aim is to land in the 'power position', the right foot should be in the center and the heel should not touch the ground at any point. The left foot should land very quickly after the right. Weight should be mostly over the back foot with as much torque as possible in the body—so the right arm is high and far back. This is very hard to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trackandfield.about.com/od/discus/ss/discustechnique_8.htm#step-heading Power position], about.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical stage is the delivery of the discus, from this 'power position' the hips drive through hard, and will be facing the direction of the throw on delivery. Athletes employ various techniques to control the end-point and recover from the throw, such as fixing feet (to pretty much stop dead&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;), or an active reverse spinning onto the left foot (e.g. Virgilijus Alekna&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhZwyyfBCBo|title=2005 World Championship Men's Discus - 1st Virgilijus Alekna|first=|last=ntujavelin|date=26 December 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Sports scientist [[Richard Ganslen]] researched the ''Aerodynamics of the Discus'', reporting the discus will [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|stall]] at an angle of 29°.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.auvac.org/research/publications/files/2003/niewiadomska.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[Image:2003 Greece 10 Euro OS Discus front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Discus commemorative coin]]]]

The discus throw has been the subject of a number of well-known ancient Greek statues and Roman copies such as the [[Discobolus]] and [[Discophoros]]. The discus throw also appears repeatedly in ancient [[Greek mythology]], featured as a means of [[manslaughter]] in the cases of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]], [[Crocus (mythology)|Crocus]], [[Phocus#Phocus.2C son of Aeacus|Phocus]], and [[Acrisius]], and as a named event in the [[funeral games]] of [[Patroclus]].

Discus throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the €10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Discus commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. On the obverse of the coin a modern athlete is seen in the foreground in a half-turned position, while in the background an ancient discus thrower has been captured in a lively bending motion, with the discus high above his head, creating a vivid representation of the sport.

==United States==
In U.S. high school track and field, boys typically throw a discus weighing 1.6&amp;nbsp;kg (3&amp;nbsp;lb&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;oz) and the girls throw the 1&amp;nbsp;kg (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb) women's discus. Under USATF Youth rules, boys throw the 1&amp;nbsp;kg discus between the ages of 11–14, and transition to the 1.6&amp;nbsp;kg discus as 15- to 18-year-olds. Girls throw the 1&amp;nbsp;kg discus as 11- to 18-year-olds.

Under [[National Federation of State High School Associations|US high school rules]], if a discus hits the surrounding safety cage and is deflected into the sector, it is ruled a foul.  In contrast, under [[IAAF]], [[World Masters Athletics|WMA]], [[NCAA]] and [[USATF]] rules, it is ruled a legal throw.  Additionally, under US high school rules, distances thrown are rounded down to the nearest whole inch, rather than the nearest centimetre.

US high school rules allow the use of a solid rubber discus; it is cheaper and easier to learn to throw (due to its more equal distribution of weight, as opposed to the heavy rim weight of the metal rim/core discus), but less durable. However, there are a vast variety of metal discuses to choose from. The weight is not always distributed into the rim of metal discuses as there are four categories that the discs are sold in; center weighted, low spin, high spin, and very high spin. Center weighted discs carry 50-60% of their weight in the rims  and are intended for beginner throwers just as rubber discs are. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.elitethrowscoaching.com/single-post/2018/02/27/How-To-Choose-The-Correct-Discus-Rim-Weight
