'''Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=true|size=100%|KG|GCB|GCH|PC|FRS}} (1 May 1769 – 14 September 1852) was an [[Anglo-Irish]] soldier and [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] statesman who was one of the leading military and political figures of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|19th-century Britain]], serving twice as [[Prime Minister]]. He won a notable victory against [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.

Wellesley was born in [[Dublin]] into the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]. He was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[British Army]] in 1787, serving in Ireland as [[aide-de-camp]] to two successive [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lords Lieutenant of Ireland]]. He was also elected as a [[Member of Parliament]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]]. He was a colonel by 1796 and saw action in the [[Flanders Campaign|Netherlands]] and in India, where he fought in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] at the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|Battle of Seringapatam]]. He was appointed governor of [[Seringapatam]] and [[Mysore]] in 1799 and, as a newly appointed major-general, won a decisive victory over the [[Maratha Empire#The Confederacy era (1761–1818)|Maratha Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of Assaye]] in 1803.

Wellesley rose to prominence as a general during the [[Peninsular War|Peninsular campaign]] of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and was promoted to the rank of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] after leading the allied forces to victory against the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Vitoria]] in 1813. Following Napoleon's exile in 1814, he served as the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|ambassador to France]] and was granted a dukedom. During the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815, he commanded the [[Seventh Coalition|allied]] army which, together with a [[Prussian Army]] under [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]], defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. Wellington's [[Military career of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|battle record]] is exemplary; he ultimately participated in some 60 battles during the course of his military career.

Wellington is famous for his adaptive defensive style of warfare, resulting in several victories against numerically superior forces while minimising his own losses. He is regarded as one of the greatest defensive commanders of all time, and many of his tactics and battle plans are still studied in military academies around the world. After the end of his active military career, he returned to politics. He was twice [[British prime minister]] as a member of the Tory party: from 1828 to 1830, and for a little less than a month in 1834. He oversaw the passage of the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829]], but opposed the [[Reform Act 1832]]. He continued as one of the leading figures in the [[House of Lords]] until his retirement and remained [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces|Commander-in-Chief of the British Army]] until his death.

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Dangan Castle, Co Meath, Ireland, 1840.jpg|thumb|left|Wellesley spent much of his early childhood at his family's [[ancestral home]], [[Dangan Castle]] (engraving, 1842).]]

Wellesley was born into an aristocratic [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] family in [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] as [[The Honourable|The Hon.]] Arthur Wesley,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellesley, p. 16&quot;&gt;Wellesley (2008). p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; the third of five surviving sons (fourth otherwise) of [[Anne Wellesley, Countess of Mornington|Anne]] and [[Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington]]. His mother was the eldest daughter of [[Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon]], after whom Wellesley was named. As such, he belonged to the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Severn (2007). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; His biographers mostly follow the same contemporary newspaper evidence in saying that he was born on 1 May 1769,&lt;ref&gt;Though 29 April is considered as more likely by some other earlier biographers including Ernest Marsh Lloyd, writing in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' with some sources to support that view,{{harvp|Lloyd|1899|p=170}} Norman Gash writing in the more modern ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', on balance supports 1 May {{harv|Gash|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the day before he was baptised.&lt;ref&gt;Guedalla (1997). p. 480. However {{harvp|Lloyd|1899|p=170}} states &quot;registry of St. Peter's Church, Dublin, shows that he was christened there on 30 April 1769&quot;. His baptismal font was donated to [[St. Nahi's Church]] in [[Dundrum, Dublin]], in 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; His birthplace is uncertain. He was most likely born at his parents' townhouse, 24 Upper [[Merrion Street]], Dublin, now the [[Merrion Hotel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gash|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But his mother Anne, Countess of Mornington, recalled in 1815 that he had been born at 6 Merrion Street, Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley (2008). p. 16. &quot;Anne Mornington insisted that she remembered the details: 1 May 1769, at 6 Merrion Street, Dublin – an elegant new townhouse round the corner from St Stephen's Green, the largest public square in Europe.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other places have been put forward as the location of his birth, including [[Mornington House]] (the house next door on Upper Merrion), as his father had asserted; the Dublin packet boat;&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley (2008). p. 14. Longford says, &quot;there is no valid argument&quot; for this choice&lt;/ref&gt; and the mansion in the family estate of [[Athy]] (consumed in the fires of 1916), as the Duke apparently put on his 1851 census return.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes-7&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent most of his childhood at his family's two homes, the first a large house in Dublin and the second [[Dangan Castle]], {{convert|3|mi|km|sigfig=1}} north of [[Summerhill, County Meath|Summerhill]] on the [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]] Road (now the [[R158 road (Ireland)|R158]]) in [[County Meath]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1781, Arthur's father died and his eldest brother [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard]] inherited his father's earldom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes8&quot;/&gt;

He went to the diocesan school in Trim when at Dangan, Mr Whyte's Academy when in Dublin, and Brown's School in Chelsea when in London. He then enrolled at [[Eton College]], where he studied from 1781 to 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes8&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; His loneliness there caused him to hate it, and makes it highly unlikely that he actually said &quot;The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton&quot;, a quotation which is often attributed to him. Moreover, Eton had no playing fields at the time. In 1785, a lack of success at Eton, combined with a shortage of family funds due to his father's death, forced the young Wellesley and his mother to move to [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes9&quot;/&gt; Until his early twenties, Arthur showed little sign of distinction and his mother grew increasingly concerned at his idleness, stating, &quot;I don't know what I shall do with my awkward son Arthur.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes9&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, Arthur enrolled in the French Royal Academy of Equitation in [[Angers]], where he progressed significantly, becoming a good horseman and learning French, which later proved very useful.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to England in late 1786, he astonished his mother with his improvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes20&quot;/&gt;

== Military career ==
{{further|Military career of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington}}

===Early career===
[[File:Dcastlemaindoor.jpg|thumb|left|Beginning in 1787, Wellesley served at [[Dublin Castle]] (pictured) as [[aide-de-camp]] to two successive [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lords Lieutenant of Ireland]].]]

Despite his new promise, he had yet to find a job and his family was still short of money, so upon the advice of his mother, his brother Richard asked his friend the [[Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland|Duke of Rutland]] (then [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]) to consider Arthur for a commission in the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes20&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, on 7 March 1787, he was gazetted [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the [[73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot|73rd Regiment of Foot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=12836|page=118|date=6 March 1787}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, with the assistance of his brother, he was assigned as ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', on ten [[shilling]]s a day (twice his pay as an ensign), to the new Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|Lord Buckingham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes21&quot;/&gt; He was also transferred to the new [[76th Regiment of Foot|76th Regiment]] forming in Ireland and on Christmas Day, 1787, was promoted [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes21&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=12959|page=47|date=26 January 1788}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Dublin his duties were mainly social; attending balls, entertaining guests and providing advice to Buckingham. While in Ireland, he overextended himself in borrowing due to his occasional gambling, but in his defence stated that &quot;I have often known what it was to be in want of money, but I have never got helplessly into debt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes22&quot;/&gt;

On 23 January 1788, he transferred into the [[41st (Welch) Regiment of Foot|41st Regiment of Foot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=12958|page=40|date=22 January 1788}}&lt;/ref&gt; then again on 25 June 1789, still a lieutenant, he transferred to the [[12th Royal Lancers|12th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=13121|page=539|date=8 August 1789}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to military historian [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]], he also dipped a reluctant toe into politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes22&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the general election of 1789, he went to the [[rotten borough]] of [[Trim (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Trim]] to speak against the granting of the title &quot;[[Freedom of the City|Freeman]]&quot; of Dublin to the parliamentary leader of the [[Irish Patriot Party]], [[Henry Grattan]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Succeeding, he was later nominated and duly elected as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Trim (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Trim]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes24&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the limited [[suffrage]] at the time, he sat in a parliament where at least two-thirds of the members owed their election to the landowners of fewer than a hundred boroughs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes24&quot;/&gt; Wellesley continued to serve at [[Dublin Castle]], voting with the government in the Irish parliament over the next two years. He became a [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] on 30 January 1791, and was transferred to the [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Regiment of Foot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwr.org.uk/dwr.php?id=59|title=Regimental Archives|publisher=Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding)|accessdate=10 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427075619/http://www.dwr.org.uk/dwr.php?id=59|archivedate=27 April 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=13347|page=542|date=27 September 1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October, he transferred to the [[18th Royal Hussars|18th Light Dragoons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=13488|page=976|date=25 December 1792}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was during this period that he grew increasingly attracted to [[Catherine Wellesley, Duchess of Wellington|Kitty Pakenham]], the daughter of [[Earl of Longford|Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes25&quot;/&gt; She was described as being full of 'gaiety and charm'.&lt;ref name=&quot;10DStreet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/duke-of-wellington |title=History and Tour – Duke of Wellington |publisher=number10.gov.uk |accessdate=8 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611040229/http://www.number10.gov.uk/history-and-tour/prime-ministers-in-history/duke-of-wellington |archivedate=11 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793, he sought her hand, but was turned down by [[Thomas Pakenham, 2nd Earl of Longford|her brother Thomas]], Earl of Longford, who considered Wellesley to be a young man, in debt, with very poor prospects.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; An aspiring amateur musician, Wellesley, devastated by the rejection, burnt his [[violin]]s in anger, and resolved to pursue a military career in earnest.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[major]] [[Sale of commissions|by purchase]] in the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment]] in 1793.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes25&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=13542 |page=555 |date=29 June 1793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, in September, his brother lent him more money and with it he purchased a [[lieutenant colonel|lieutenant-colonelcy]] in the 33rd.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes28&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=13596 |page=1052 |date=23 November 1793 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Wellesley by John Hoppner.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|Wellesley as Lieutenant Colonel, aged c. 26, in the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment]]. Portrait by [[John Hoppner]]]]

In 1793, the Duke of York was sent to [[Flanders]] in command of the British contingent of an allied force destined for the invasion of France. In June 1794, Wellesley with the 33rd regiment set sail from [[Cork Harbour|Cork]] bound for [[Ostend]] as part of an expedition bringing reinforcements for the army in Flanders. They arrived too late and joined the Duke of York as he was pulling back towards the Netherlands. On 15 September 1794, at the [[Battle of Boxtel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes30&quot;/&gt; east of [[Breda]], Wellington, in temporary command of his brigade, had his first experience of battle. During General Abercromby's withdrawal in the face of superior French forces, the 33rd held off enemy cavalry, allowing neighbouring units to retreat safely. During the extremely harsh winter that followed, Wellesley and his regiment formed part of an allied force holding the defence line along the [[Waal River]]. The 33rd, along with the rest of the army, suffered heavy losses from sickness and exposure. Wellesley's health was also affected by the damp environment.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the campaign was to end disastrously, with the British army driven out of the [[Netherlands|United Provinces]] into Germany, Wellesley was to learn several valuable lessons, including the use of steady lines of infantry against advancing columns and of the merits of supporting sea-power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes30&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; He understood that the failure of the campaign was due in part to the faults of the leaders and the poor organisation at [[headquarters]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes32&quot;/&gt; He remarked later of his time in the Netherlands that &quot;At least I learned what not to do, and that is always a valuable lesson&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes32&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to England in March 1795, he was returned as a member of parliament for Trim for a second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes33&quot;/&gt; He hoped to be given the position of secretary of war in the new Irish government but the new lord-lieutenant, [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|Lord Camden]], was only able to offer him the post of [[Surveyor-General of the Ordnance (Ireland)|Surveyor-General of the Ordnance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes33&quot;/&gt; Declining the post, he returned to his regiment, now at [[Southampton]] preparing to set sail for the [[West Indies]]. After seven weeks at sea, a storm forced the fleet back to [[Poole]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes33&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The 33rd was given time to recuperate and a few months later, [[Whitehall]] decided to send the regiment to India. Wellesley was promoted full [[colonel]] by seniority on 3 May 1796&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=13892|page=460|date=14 May 1796}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few weeks later set sail for [[Calcutta]] with his regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Arriving in [[Calcutta]] in February 1797 he spent several months there, before being sent on a brief expedition to the [[Philippines]], where he established a list of new hygiene precautions for his men to deal with the unfamiliar climate.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in November to [[India]], he learnt that his elder brother [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard]], now known as Lord Mornington, had been appointed as the new [[Governor-General of India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes41&quot;/&gt;

In 1798, he changed the spelling of his surname to &quot;Wellesley&quot;; up to this time he was still known as Wesley, which his eldest brother considered the ancient and proper spelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes41&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 54. ''Wellington's first signature as Arthur Wellesley was on a letter dated 19 May 1798.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the campaign to extend the rule of the [[British East India Company]], the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]] broke out in 1798 against the Sultan of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], [[Tipu Sultan]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur's brother Richard ordered that an armed force be sent to capture [[Seringapatam]] and defeat Tipu. Under the command of [[George Harris, 1st Baron Harris|General Harris]], some 24,000 troops were dispatched to [[Madras]] (to join an equal force being sent from [[Bombay]] in the west).&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes49&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur and the 33rd sailed to join them in August.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

After extensive and careful logistic preparation (which would become one of Wellesley's main attributes)&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes, p. 47&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; the 33rd left with the main force in December and travelled across {{convert|250|mi|km|sigfig=3}} of jungle from Madras to Mysore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes, p. 47&quot;/&gt; On account of his brother, during the journey, Wellesley was given an additional command, that of chief advisor to the [[Mir Nizam Ali Khan, Asaf Jah II|Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]'s army (sent to accompany the British force).&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes49&quot;/&gt; This position was to cause friction among many of the senior officers (some of whom were senior to Wellesley).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this friction was put to rest after the [[Battle of Mallavelly]], some {{convert|20|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from Seringapatam, in which Harris's army attacked a large part of the sultan's army. During the battle, Wellesley led his men, in a line of battle of two ranks, against the enemy to a gentle ridge and gave the order to fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes53&quot;/&gt; After an extensive repetition of volleys, followed by a bayonet charge, the 33rd, in conjunction with the rest of Harris's force, forced Tipu's infantry to retreat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes53&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Seringapatam=====
Immediately after their arrival at [[Srirangapatna|Seringapatam]] on 5 April 1799, the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|Battle of Seringapatam]] began and Wellesley was ordered to lead a night attack on the village of Sultanpettah, adjacent to the fortress to clear the way for the artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the enemy's strong defensive preparations, and the darkness, with the resulting confusion, the attack failed with 25 casualties. Wellesley suffered a minor injury to his knee from a spent musket-ball.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.mq.edu.au/digital/seringapatam/chronology.html |title=The Battle of Seringapatam: Chronology, Macquarie University |accessdate=17 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722191234/http://www.lib.mq.edu.au/digital/seringapatam/chronology.html |archivedate=22 July 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they would re-attack successfully the next day, after time to scout ahead the enemy's positions, the affair affected Wellesley. He resolved &quot;never to attack an enemy who is preparing and strongly posted, and whose posts have not been reconnoitered by daylight&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes58&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lewin Bentham Bowring]] gives this alternative account:
{{quote|text=One of these groves, called the Sultanpet Tope, was intersected by deep ditches, watered from a channel running in an easterly direction about a mile from the fort. [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General Baird]] was directed to scour this grove and dislodge the enemy, but on his advancing with this object on the night of the 5th, he found the tope unoccupied. The next day, however, the Mysore troops again took possession of the ground, and as it was absolutely necessary to expel them, two columns were detached at sunset for the purpose. The first of these, under Colonel Shawe, got possession of a ruined village, which it successfully held. The second column, under Colonel Wellesley, on advancing into the tope, was at once attacked in the darkness of night by a tremendous fire of musketry and rockets.  The men, floundering about amidst the trees and the water-courses, at last broke, and fell back in disorder, some being killed and a few taken prisoners. In the confusion Colonel Wellesley was himself struck on the knee by a spent ball, and narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bowring (1893). pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A few weeks later, after extensive artillery bombardment, a breach was opened in the main walls of the fortress of Seringapatam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes58&quot;/&gt; An attack led by [[David Baird, 1st Baronet|Major-General Baird]] secured the fortress. Wellesley secured the rear of the advance, posting guards at the breach and then stationed his regiment at the main palace.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing news of the death of the Tipu Sultan, Wellesley was the first at the scene to confirm his death, checking his pulse.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the coming day, Wellesley grew increasingly concerned over the lack of discipline among his men, who drank and pillaged the fortress and city. To restore order, several soldiers were [[Flagellation|flogged]] and four [[Hanging|hanged]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

After battle and the resulting end of the war, the main force under General Harris left Seringapatam and Wellesley, aged 30, stayed behind to command the area as the new Governor of Seringapatam and Mysore. While in India, Wellesley was ill for a considerable time, first with severe [[diarrhoea]] from the water and then with fever, followed by a serious skin infection caused by [[trichophyton]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellesley was in charge of raising an Anglo-Indian expeditionary force in [[Trincomalee|Trincomali]] in early 1801&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Raising of the Anglo-Indian army|journal=The Literary Gazette and Journal|date=1832|page=711|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nlcv5zijS2IC&amp;lpg=PA711&amp;dq=baird%20anglo%20indian%20force%20raised%20in%20bombay%201801&amp;pg=PP7#v=onepage&amp;q=baird%20anglo%20indian%20force%20raised%20in%20biombay%201801&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 October 2017|last1=Jerdan|first1=William|last2=Workman|first2=William Ring|last3=Morley|first3=John|last4=Arnold|first4=Frederick|last5=Goodwin|first5=Charles Wycliffe}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the capture of Batavia and Mauritius from the French. However, on the eve of its departure, orders arrived from England that it was to be sent to Egypt to co-operate with Sir [[Ralph Abercromby]] in the expulsion of the [[France|French]] from [[Egypt]]. Wellesley had been appointed second in command to Baird, but owing to ill-health did not accompany the expedition on 9 April 1801. This turned out fortunately for Wellesley, since the very vessel on which he was to have sailed foundered with all hands in the Red Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India: The Egyptian Expedition|date=1911|publisher=Superintendent Government Printing, India|location=Calcutta|pages=Vol. 6. Chapter 2|url=https://archive.org/stream/ExpeditionsOverseas/Expeditions%20Overseas_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to [[brigadier general (United Kingdom)|brigadier-general]] on 17 July 1801. He took residence within the Sultan's summer palace and reformed the tax and justice systems in his province to maintain order and prevent bribery.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; He also hunted down the mercenary and self-proclaimed 'King' [[Dhoondiah Waugh]], who had escaped from prison in Seringapatam during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dhoondiah Waugh insurgency====
In 1800, whilst serving as Governor of Mysore, Wellesley was tasked with putting down an [[insurgency]] led by [[Dhoondiah Waugh]], formerly a [[Patan district|Patan]] trooper for [[Tipu Sultan]].&lt;ref&gt;Weller, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Siege of Seringapatam (1799)|fall of Seringapatam]] he became a powerful brigand, raiding villages along the Maratha–Mysore border region. Despite initial setbacks, the [[East India Company]] having pursued and destroyed his forces once already, forcing him into retreat in August 1799, he raised a sizeable force composed of disbanded Mysore soldiers, captured small outposts and forts in Mysore, and was receiving the support of several Maratha ''[[killedar]]s'' opposed to British occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies22&quot;&gt;Davies, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This drew the attention of the British administration, who were beginning to recognise him as more than just a bandit, as his raids, expansion and threats to destabilise British authority suddenly increased in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, pp. 94–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of Tipu Sultan had created a [[power vacuum]] and Waugh was seeking to fill it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies22&quot;/&gt;

Given independent command of a combined East India Company and British Army force,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weller, p. 97&quot;&gt;Weller, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellesley ventured north to confront Waugh in June 1800, with an army of 8,000 infantry and cavalry, having learned that Waugh's forces numbered over 50,000, although the majority (around 30,000) were [[Irregular military|irregular]] light cavalry and unlikely to pose a serious threat to British infantry and artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 33, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout June–August 1800, Wellesley advanced through Waugh's territory, his troops [[escalade|escalading]] forts in turn and capturing each one with &quot;trifling loss&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley &amp; Gurwood (ed), Vol. I, pp. 181, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The forts generally offered little resistance due to their poor construction and design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weller, p. 97&quot;/&gt; Wellesley did not have sufficient troops to garrison each fort, and had to clear the surrounding area of insurgents before advancing to the next fort.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July, he had &quot;taken and destroyed Dhoondiah's baggage and six guns, and driven into the Malpoorba (where they were drowned) about five thousand people&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wellesley &amp; Gurwood (ed), Vol. I, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Dhoondiah continued to retreat, but his forces were rapidly deserting, he had no infantry and due to the [[monsoon]] weather flooding river crossings he could no longer outpace the British advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weller99&quot;&gt;Weller, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September, at the [[Battle of Conaghul]], Wellesley personally led a charge of 1,400 British dragoons and Indian cavalry, in single line with no reserve, against Dhoondiah and his remaining 5,000 cavalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weller99&quot;/&gt; Dhoondiah was killed during the clash, his body was discovered and taken to the British camp tied to a cannon. With this victory Wellesley's campaign was concluded, and British authority had been restored.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellesley, with command of four regiments, had defeated Dhoondiah's larger rebel force, along with Dhoondiah himself, who was killed in the final battle. Wellesley then paid for the future upkeep of Dhoondiah's orphaned son.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second Anglo-Maratha War====
{{main|Second Anglo-Maratha War}}

In September 1802, Wellesley learnt that he had been promoted to the rank of [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|major-general]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes69&quot;/&gt; He had been gazetted on 29 April 1802, but the news took several months to reach him by sea. He remained at Mysore until November when he was sent to command an army in the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes69&quot;/&gt;

When he determined that a long defensive war would ruin his army, Wellesley decided to act boldly to defeat the numerically larger force of the [[Maratha Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes73&quot;/&gt; With the logistic assembly of his army complete (24,000 men in total) he gave the order to break camp and attack the nearest Maratha fort on 8 August 1803.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes69&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes73&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The fort surrendered on 12 August after an infantry attack had exploited an artillery-made breach in the wall. With the fort now in British control Wellesley was able to extend control southwards to the river [[Godavari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes74&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Assaye=====
[[File:Battle of Assaye.jpeg|thumb|left|Arthur Wellesley (mounted) at the [[Battle of Assaye]] (engraving after [[William Heath (artist)|William Heath)]]. Wellesley later remarked that it was his greatest victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes81&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Splitting his army into two forces, to pursue and locate the main Marathas army, (the second force, commanded by Colonel Stevenson was far smaller) Wellesley was preparing to rejoin his forces on 24 September. His intelligence, however, reported the location of the Marathas' main army, between two rivers near [[Assaye]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes75&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; If he waited for the arrival of his second force, the Marathas would be able to mount a retreat, so Wellesley decided to launch an attack immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes75&quot;/&gt;

On 23 September, Wellesley led his forces over a ford in the river Kaitna and the [[Battle of Assaye]] commenced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes77&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; After crossing the ford the infantry was reorganised into several lines and advanced against the Maratha infantry. Wellesley ordered his [[cavalry]] to exploit the flank of the Maratha army just near the village.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes77&quot;/&gt; During the battle Wellesley himself came under fire; two of his horses were shot from under him and he had to mount a third.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes80&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; At a crucial moment, Wellesley regrouped his forces and ordered Colonel Maxwell (later killed in the attack) to attack the eastern end of the Maratha position while Wellesley himself directed a renewed infantry attack against the centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes80&quot;/&gt;

An officer in the attack wrote of the importance of Wellesley's personal leadership: &quot;The General was in the thick of the action the whole time&amp;nbsp;... I never saw a man so cool and collected as he was&amp;nbsp;... though I can assure you, 'til our troops got the order to advance the fate of the day seemed doubtful&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; With some 6,000 Marathas killed or wounded, the enemy was routed, though Wellesley's force was in no condition to pursue. British casualties were heavy: the British losses were counted as 409 soldiers being killed out of which 164 were Europeans and the remaining 245 were Indian; a further 1,622 British soldiers were wounded and 26 soldiers were reported missing (the British casualty figures were taken from Wellesley's own despatch).&lt;ref&gt;Millar (2006). p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellesley was troubled by the loss of men and remarked that he hoped &quot;I should not like to see again such loss as I sustained on 23 September, even if attended by such gain&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes81&quot;/&gt; Years later, however, he remarked that Assaye, and not Waterloo, was the best battle he ever fought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes81&quot;/&gt;

=====Argaum and Gawilghur=====
Despite the damage done to the Maratha army, the battle did not end the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes82&quot;/&gt; A few months later in November, Wellesley attacked a larger force near [[Argaon|Argaum]], leading his army to victory again, with an astonishing 5,000 enemy dead at the cost of only 361 British casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes82&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; A further successful attack at the fortress at [[Gawilghur]], combined with the victory of [[Gerard Lake, 1st Viscount Lake|General Lake]] at [[Delhi]] forced the Maratha to sign a peace settlement at [[Anjangaon]] (not concluded until a year later) called the [[Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military historian Richard Holmes remarked that Wellesley's experiences in India had an important influence on his personality and military tactics, teaching him much about military matters that would prove vital to his success in the [[Peninsular War]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; These included a strong sense of discipline through drill and order,&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes87&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; the use of diplomacy to gain allies, and the vital necessity for a secure supply line. He also established a high regard for the acquisition of intelligence through scouts and spies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes87&quot;/&gt; His personal tastes also developed, including dressing himself in white trousers, a dark tunic, with [[Hessian boot]]s and black cocked hat (that later became synonymous as his style).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leaving India====

Wellesley had grown tired of his time in India, remarking &quot;I have served as long in India as any man ought who can serve anywhere else&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes84&quot;/&gt; In June 1804 he applied for permission to return home and as a reward for his service in India he was made a [[Order of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]] in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes84&quot;/&gt; While in India, Wellesley had amassed a fortune of £42,000 (considerable at the time), consisting mainly of [[prize money]] from his campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes84&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; When his brother's term as Governor-General of India ended in March 1805, the brothers returned together to England on [[HMS Howe (1805)|HMS ''Howe'']]. Arthur, coincidentally, stopped on his voyage at the little island of [[Saint Helena]] and stayed in the [[Briars, St Helena|same building]] to which [[Napoleon I]] would later be exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Back in Britain, meeting Nelson===
In September 1805, Major-General Wellesley was newly returned from his campaigns in India and was not yet particularly well known to the public. He reported to the office of the Secretary for War to request a new assignment. In the waiting room, he met Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]], already a legendary figure after his victories at the Nile and Copenhagen, who was briefly in England after months chasing the French Toulon fleet to the West Indies and back. Some 30 years later, Wellington recalled a conversation that Nelson began with him which Wellesley found &quot;almost all on his side in a style so vain and silly as to surprise and almost disgust me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes92&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson left the room to inquire who the young general was and, on his return, switched to a very different tone, discussing the war, the state of the colonies, and the geopolitical situation as between equals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this second discussion, Wellington recalled, &quot;I don't know that I ever had a conversation that interested me more&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert (2005). p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only time that the two men met; Nelson was killed at his great victory at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] just seven weeks later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes92&quot; /&gt;

Wellesley then served in the abortive [[Hanover Expedition|Anglo-Russian expedition]] to north Germany in 1805, taking a brigade to [[Elbe]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts (2003). pp. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then took a period of extended leave from the army and was elected as a [[Tories (political faction)|Tory]] member of the British parliament for [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] in January 1806.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=15908 |page=449 |date=8 April 1806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he was elected MP for [[Newport (Isle of Wight) (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] and was then appointed to serve as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], under the [[Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]]. At the same time, he was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy counsellor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands38&quot;/&gt; While in Ireland, he gave a verbal promise that the remaining [[Penal Laws]] would be enforced with great moderation, perhaps an indication of his later willingness to support [[Catholic Emancipation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Longford 1971 174&quot;&gt;Longford (1971) p.174&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War against Denmark ===
Wellesley was in Ireland in May 1807 when he heard of the British expedition to [[Denmark]]. He decided to go, while maintaining his political appointments and was appointed to command an infantry brigade in the [[Second Battle of Copenhagen]] which took place in August. He fought at the [[Battle of Køge|Køge]], during which the men under his command took 1,500 prisoners, with Wellesley later present during the surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands38&quot;/&gt;

By 30 September, he had returned to England and was raised to the rank of [[lieutenant general]] on 25 April 1808.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands38&quot;/&gt; In June 1808 he accepted the command of an expedition of 9,000 men. Preparing to sail for an attack on the Spanish colonies in [[South America]] (to assist the Latin American patriot [[Francisco de Miranda]]) his force was instead ordered to sail for [[Portugal]], to take part in the Peninsular Campaign and rendezvous with 5,000 troops from [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands39&quot;&gt;Neillands (2003). p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peninsular War===
{{main|Peninsular War}}
{{further|British Army during the Napoleonic Wars|Anglo-Portuguese Army}}

Ready for battle, Wellesley left Cork on 12 July 1808 to participate in the war against French forces in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with his skills as a commander tested and developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands39&quot; /&gt; According to the historian [[Robin Neillands]], &quot;Wellesley had by now acquired the experience on which his later successes were founded. He knew about command from the ground up, about the importance of logistics, about campaigning in a hostile environment. He enjoyed political influence and realised the need to maintain support at home. Above all, he had gained a clear idea of how, by setting attainable objectives and relying on his own force and abilities, a campaign could be fought and won.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands39&quot; /&gt;

====1808====
[[File:Wellingtons33rd.jpg|thumb|Reenactors of the [[33rd Regiment of Foot]] Wellington's Redcoats who fought in the Napoleonic Wars, 1812–1815, here showing the standard line 8th Company]]

Wellesley defeated the French at the [[Battle of Roliça]] and the [[Battle of Vimeiro]] in 1808&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 148–154.&lt;/ref&gt; but was superseded in command immediately after the latter battle. [[Sir Hew Whiteford Dalrymple, 1st Baronet|General Dalrymple]] then signed the controversial [[Convention of Sintra]], which stipulated that the [[Royal Navy]] transport the [[French army]] out of [[Lisbon]] with all their loot, and insisted on the association of the only available government minister, Wellesley.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 155–157.&lt;/ref&gt;
Dalrymple and Wellesley were recalled to Britain to face a Court of Enquiry. Wellesley had agreed to sign the preliminary armistice, but had not signed the convention, and was cleared.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Napoleon himself entered Spain with his veteran troops to put down the revolt; the new commander of the British forces in the Peninsula, [[John Moore (British soldier)|Sir John Moore]], died during the [[Battle of Corunna]] in January 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although overall the land war with France was not going well from a British perspective, the Peninsula was the one theatre where they, with the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], had provided strong resistance against France and her allies. This contrasted with the disastrous [[Walcheren expedition]], which was typical of the mismanaged British operations of the time. Wellesley submitted a memorandum to [[Lord Castlereagh]] on the defence of Portugal. He stressed its mountainous frontiers and advocated Lisbon as the main base because the Royal Navy could help to defend it. Castlereagh and the cabinet approved the memo and appointed him head of all British forces in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1809====
Wellesley arrived in Lisbon on 22 April 1809 on board [[French frigate Surveillante (1802)|HMS ''Surveillante'']],&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; after narrowly escaping shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1897).&lt;/ref&gt; Reinforced, he took to the offensive. In the [[Second Battle of Porto]] he crossed the [[Douro]] river in a daylight ''[[coup de main]]'', and routed [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]'s French troops in [[Porto]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford (2012). p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Portugal secured, Wellesley advanced into Spain to unite with [[Gregorio de la Cuesta|General Cuesta]]'s forces. The combined allied force prepared for an assault on [[Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno|Marshal Victor]]'s [[I Corps (Grande Armée)|I&amp;nbsp;Corps]] at Talavera, 23 July. Cuesta, however, was reluctant to agree, and was only persuaded to advance on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Gates (2002). p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; The delay allowed the French to withdraw, but Cuesta sent his army headlong after Victor, and found himself faced by almost the entire French army in New Castile—Victor had been reinforced by the Toledo and Madrid garrisons. The Spanish retreated precipitously, necessitating the advance of two British divisions to cover their retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Guedalla (1997). p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, 27 July, at the [[Battle of Talavera]] the French advanced in three columns and were repulsed several times throughout the day by Wellesley, but at a heavy cost to the British force. In the aftermath Marshal Soult's army was discovered to be advancing south, threatening to cut Wellesley off from Portugal. Wellesley moved east on 3 August to block it, leaving 1,500 wounded in the care of the Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Longford (2012). p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; intending to confront Soult before finding out that the French were in fact 30,000 strong. The British commander sent the Light Brigade on a dash to hold the bridge over the [[Tagus]] at [[Almaraz]]. With communications and supply from Lisbon secured for now, Wellesley considered joining with Cuesta again but found out that his Spanish ally had abandoned the British wounded to the French and was thoroughly uncooperative, promising and then refusing to supply the British forces, aggravating Wellesley and causing considerable friction between the British and their Spanish allies. The lack of supplies, coupled with the threat of French reinforcement (including the possible inclusion of Napoleon himself) in the spring, led to the British deciding to retreat into Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (2012). pp. 134–150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his victory at Talavera, Wellesley was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 26 August 1809 as '''Viscount Wellington''' of Talavera and of Wellington, in the County of Somerset, with the subsidiary title of '''Baron Douro''' of Wellesley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir 2013. p. 343&quot;&gt;Muir (2013). p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16291|page=1342|date=22 August 1809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1810====
In 1810, a newly enlarged French army under Marshal [[André Masséna]] invaded Portugal. British opinion both at home and in the army was negative and there were suggestions that they must evacuate Portugal. Instead, Lord Wellington first slowed the French down at [[Battle of Buçaco|Buçaco]];&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 225–230.&lt;/ref&gt; he then prevented them from taking the Lisbon Peninsula by the construction of his massive earthworks, the [[Lines of Torres Vedras]], which had been assembled in complete secrecy and had flanks guarded by the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 235–240.&lt;/ref&gt; The baffled and starving French invasion forces retreated after six months. Wellington's pursuit was frustrated by a series of reverses inflicted by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]] in a much-lauded [[rear guard]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (2012). p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1811====
In 1811, Masséna returned toward Portugal to relieve Almeida; Wellington narrowly checked the French at the [[Battle of Fuentes de Onoro]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 251–254.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, his subordinate, [[William Carr Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|Viscount Beresford]], fought Soult's 'Army of the South' to a mutual bloody standstill at the [[Battle of Albuera]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington was promoted to full [[General (United Kingdom)|general]] on 31 July for his services. The French abandoned [[Siege of Almeida (1811)|Almeida]], slipping away from British pursuit,&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 254–256.&lt;/ref&gt; but retained the twin Spanish fortresses of [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] and [[Badajoz]], the 'Keys' guarding the roads through the mountain passes into Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (2012). p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1812====
[[File:Wellington a Salamanca.jpg|thumb|Wellington at the [[Battle of Salamanca]] (engraving after William Heath)]]

In 1812, Wellington finally captured [[Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo (1812)|Ciudad Rodrigo]] by a rapid movement as the French went into winter quarters, storming it before they could react. He then moved south quickly, besieged the fortress of Badajoz for a month and captured it during one bloody night. On viewing the aftermath of the [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|Storming of Badajoz]], Wellington lost his composure and cried at the sight of the bloody carnage in the breaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes, p. 162&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

His army now was a veteran British force reinforced by units of the retrained Portuguese army. Campaigning in Spain, he routed the French at the [[Battle of Salamanca]], taking advantage of a minor French mispositioning.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 283–287.&lt;/ref&gt; The victory liberated the Spanish capital of [[Madrid]]. As a reward, he was created '''Earl of Wellington''', in the county of Somerset on 22 February 1812,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16576|page=335|date=18 February 1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then '''Marquess of Wellington''', in the said county on 18 August 1812,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16636|page=1677|date=18 August 1812}}&lt;/ref&gt; and given command of all Allied armies in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington attempted to take the vital fortress of [[Siege of Burgos|Burgos]], which linked Madrid to France. But failure, due in part to a lack of siege guns, forced him into a headlong retreat with the loss of over 2,000 casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gates366&quot;&gt;Gates (2002). p. 366. Notes: &quot;While, in view of the developing strategic situation, is not clear what Wellesley hoped to gain by its seizure, he had resolved to take the fortress—a task which he evidently believed could be easily accomplished; for, notwithstanding the [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|sanguinary lessons]] that virtually all his sieges had given him and the availability of scores of heavy cannon captured at Ciudad Rodrigo and Madrid, he brought up only eight heavy guns to breach the defences. This force was to prove lamentably inadequate and, in this and other aspects of the operation, Wellesley's complacency and ineptitude were to cost his troops dear.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The French abandoned [[Andalusia]], and combined the troops of Soult and [[Auguste de Marmont|Marmont]]. Thus combined, the French outnumbered the British, putting the British forces in a precarious position. Wellington withdrew his army and, joined with the smaller corps commanded by [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Rowland Hill]], began to retreat to Portugal. Marshal Soult declined to attack.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 297–299.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1813====
[[File:Francisco Goya - Portrait of the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|[[Portrait of the Duke of Wellington (Goya)|The Duke of Wellington]] by [[Francisco Goya]], 1812–14]]

In 1813, Wellington led a new offensive, this time against the French line of communications. He struck through the hills north of Burgos, the [[Trás-os-Montes (region)|Tras os Montes]], and switched his supply line from Portugal to [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] on Spain's north coast; this led to the French abandoning Madrid and Burgos. Continuing to outflank the French lines, Wellington caught up with and smashed the army of King [[Joseph Bonaparte]] in the [[Battle of Vitoria]], for which he was promoted to [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|field marshal]] on 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; He personally led a column against the French centre, while other columns commanded by [[Thomas Graham, 1st Baron Lynedoch|Sir Thomas Graham]], Rowland Hill and the [[George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie|Earl of Dalhousie]] looped around the French right and left (this battle became the subject of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s orchestral piece, the ''[[Wellington's Victory]]'' ([[Opus number|Opus]] 91). The British troops broke ranks to loot the abandoned French wagons instead of pursuing the beaten foe. This gross abandonment of discipline caused an enraged Wellington to write in a famous dispatch to [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl Bathurst]], &quot;We have in the service the scum of the earth as common soldiers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wellington to Bathurst, dispatches, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although later, when his temper had cooled, he extended his comment to praise the men under his command saying that though many of the men were, &quot;the scum of the earth; it is really wonderful that we should have made them to the fine fellows they are&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hay7&quot;&gt;Haythornthwaite (1998). p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking the small fortresses of [[Pamplona]], Wellington invested [[Siege of San Sebastian|San Sebastián]] but was frustrated by the obstinate French garrison, losing 693 dead and 316 captured in a failed assault and suspending the siege at the end of July. Soult's relief attempt was blocked by the Spanish Army of Galicia at [[Battle of San Marcial|San Marcial]], allowing the Allies to consolidate their position and tighten the ring around the city, which fell in September after a second spirited defence.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington then forced Soult's demoralised and battered army into a fighting retreat into France, punctuated by battles at the [[Battle of the Pyrenees|Pyrenees]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=16934 |page=1850 |date=13 September 1814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of the Bidassoa (1813)|Bidassoa]] and [[Battle of Nivelle|Nivelle]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=16934 |page=1851 |date=13 September 1814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington invaded southern France, winning at [[Battle of the Nive|the Nive]] and [[Battle of Orthez|Orthez]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington's final battle against his rival Soult occurred at [[Battle of Toulouse (1814)|Toulouse]], where the Allied divisions were badly mauled storming the French [[redoubt]]s, losing some 4,600 men. Despite this momentary victory, news arrived of Napoleon's defeat and abdication&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 344–345.&lt;/ref&gt; and Soult, seeing no reason to continue the fighting, agreed on a ceasefire with Wellington, allowing Soult to evacuate the city.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (2012). p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====
[[File:Vienna Congress.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Wellington (far left) alongside [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]], [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]] and other European diplomats at the [[Congress of Vienna]], 1815 (engraving after [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]])]]
Hailed as the conquering hero by the British, on 3 May 1814 Wellington was made '''Duke of Wellington''', in the county of Somerset, together with the subsidiary title of '''Marquess Douro''', in the said County.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muir 2013. p. 343&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16894|page=936|date=3 May 1814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received some recognition during his lifetime (the title of &quot;[[Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo|Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo]]&quot; and &quot;[[Grandee|Grandee of Spain]]&quot;) and the Spanish King Ferdinand VII allowed him to keep part of the works of art from the Royal Collection which he had recovered from the French. His equestrian portrait features prominently in the Monument to the Battle of Vitoria, in present-day Vitoria-Gasteiz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=3&amp;BookId=40 |title=Bernard Cornwell – Britain's Storyteller |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |accessdate=13 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611231155/http://bernardcornwell.net/index2.cfm?page=3&amp;BookId=40 |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His popularity in Britain was due to his image and his appearance as well as to his military triumphs. His victory fitted well with the passion and intensity of the Romantic movement, with its emphasis on individuality. His personal style influenced the fashions on Britain at the time: his tall, lean figure and his plumed black hat and grand yet classic uniform and white trousers became very popular.&lt;ref&gt;Tina Bicât (2003). ''Period Costume for the Stage''. Ramsbury, UK: Crowood Press. pp. 65–66. {{ISBN|978-1-86126-589-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1814, the Prime Minister wanted him to take command in Canada and with the assignment of winning the [[War of 1812]] against the United States. Wellesley replied that he would go to America, but he believed that he was needed more in Europe. He stated:

{{quote|I think you have no right, from the state of war, to demand any concession of territory from America... You have not been able to carry it into the enemy's territory, notwithstanding your military success, and now undoubted military superiority, and have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack. You cannot on any principle of equality in negotiation claim a cession of territory except in exchange for other advantages which you have in your power... Then if this reasoning be true, why stipulate for the [[uti possidetis]]? You can get no territory: indeed, the state of your military operations, however creditable, does not entitle you to demand any.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley Mills, &quot;The Duke of Wellington and the Peace Negotiations at Ghent in 1814,&quot; ''Canadian Historical Review'' (1921) 2#1 pp 19–32, quote at p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He was appointed [[British Ambassador to France|Ambassador to France]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=16915 |page=1389 |date=9 July 1814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then took [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Lord Castlereagh]]'s place as first [[plenipotentiary]] to the [[Congress of Vienna]], where he strongly advocated allowing France to keep its place in the European balance of power. On 2 January 1815 the title of his Knighthood of the Bath was converted to [[Order of the Bath|Knight Grand Cross]] upon the expansion of that order.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16972|page=18|date=4 January 1815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Wellesley, first Duke of Wellington. Wellcome V0048407.jpg|thumb|upright|Engraving of Wellesley by [[William Say (engraver)|William Say]] after [[Thomas Phillips]]]]
On 26 February 1815, Napoleon escaped from [[Elba]] and returned to France. He regained control of the country by May and faced a renewed alliance against him.&lt;ref&gt;Barbero (2005). p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington left Vienna for what became known as the [[Waterloo Campaign]]. He arrived in the Netherlands to take command of the British-German army and their allied Dutch, all stationed alongside the [[Prussia]]n forces of Generalfeldmarschall [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 396–407.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon's strategy was to isolate the Allied and Prussian armies and annihilate each one separately before the Austrians and Russians arrived. In doing so the vast superiority in numbers of the Coalition would be greatly diminished. He would then seek the possibility of peace with Austria and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French invaded the Netherlands, with Napoleon defeating the Prussians at [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]], and Marshal Ney engaging indecisively with Wellington, at the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). pp. 423–432.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prussians retreated 18 miles north to [[Wavre]] whilst Wellington's Anglo-Allied army withdrew 15 miles north to a site he had noted the previous year as favourable for a battle: the north ridge of a shallow valley on the Brussels road, just south of the small town of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]. On 17 June there was torrential rain, which severely hampered movement&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert (1997). pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a considerable effect the next day, 18 June, when the [[Battle of Waterloo]] was fought. This was the first time Wellington had encountered Napoleon; he commanded an Anglo-Dutch-German army that consisted of approximately 73,000 troops, 26,000 of whom were British.&lt;ref&gt;Adkin (2001). p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 30 percent of that 26,000 were Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Ronan|title=Just how many Irish fought at the Battle of Waterloo?|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/just-how-many-irish-fought-at-the-battle-of-waterloo-1.2254271|newspaper=[[Irish Times]]|location=Dublin|date=18 June 2015|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Battle====
{{main|Battle of Waterloo}}
[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|left|''Wellington at Waterloo'', by [[Robert Alexander Hillingford]]]]

The Battle of Waterloo commenced with a diversionary attack on [[Hougoumont]] by a division of French soldiers. After a barrage of 80 cannons, the first French infantry attack was launched by [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|Comte D'Erlon]]'s I Corps. D'Erlon's troops advanced through the Allied centre, resulting in Allied troops in front of the ridge retreating in disorder through the main position. D'Erlon's corps stormed the most fortified Allied position, [[La Haye Sainte]], but failed to take it. An Allied division under [[Thomas Picton]] met the remainder of D'Erlon's corps head to head, engaging them in an infantry duel in which Picton fell. During this struggle [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Lord Uxbridge]] launched two of his cavalry brigades at the enemy, catching the French infantry off guard, driving them to the bottom of the slope, and capturing two [[French Imperial Eagle]]s. The charge, however, over-reached itself, and the British cavalry, crushed by fresh French horsemen hurled at them by Napoleon, were driven back, suffering tremendous losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Waterloo Campaign |volume=28 |pages=371–381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A little before 16:00, Marshal Ney noted an apparent exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Ney at this time had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with a cavalry charge alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siborne439&quot;&gt;Siborne (1990). p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Waterloo-French cavalry.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Grenadiers à Cheval''. Napoleon can be seen in the background on a grey horse.&lt;ref&gt;A number of different mounts could have been ridden by Napoleon at Waterloo: Ali, Crebère, Désirée, Jaffa, Marie and Tauris ({{cite book |author=Christopher J. Summerville |title=Who Was Who at Waterloo: A Biography of the Battle |url=https://books.google.com/?id=q_cXSrh0C_IC&amp;pg=PA315 |date=2007 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-582-78405-5 |page=315}})&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At about 16:30, the first Prussian corps arrived. Commanded by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|Freiherr von Bülow]], IV Corps arrived as the French cavalry attack was in full spate. Bülow sent the 15th Brigade to link up with Wellington's left flank in the [[Frichermont]]–[[La Haie, Lasne|La Haie]] area while the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-117&quot;&gt;Hofschröer (1999). p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon sent [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]]'s corps to intercept the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to [[Plancenoit]]. The 15th Brigade sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area. Von Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit. Napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed by the enemy. Napoleon's Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-122&quot;&gt;Hofschröer (1999). p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon then resorted to sending two battalions of the Middle and Old Guard into Plancenoit and after ferocious fighting they recaptured the village.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-122&quot;/&gt;
The French cavalry attacked the British infantry squares many times, each at a heavy cost to the French but with few British casualties. Ney himself was displaced from his horse four times.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1987), p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adkin361&quot;&gt;Adkin (2001). p. 361..&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knotel - The storming of La Haye Sainte.jpg|right|thumb|alt=The storming of La Haye Sainte by Knötel|The storming of La Haye Sainte, by [[Richard Knötel]]]]
Meanwhile, at approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, Napoleon ordered Ney to capture La Haye Sainte at whatever the cost. Ney accomplished this with what was left of D'Erlon's corps soon after 18:00. Ney then moved [[horse artillery]] up towards Wellington's centre and began to destroy the infantry squares at short-range with [[canister shot|canister]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Siborne439&quot;/&gt; This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square. Wellington's centre was now on the verge of collapse and wide open to an attack from the French. Luckily for Wellington, Pirch I's and [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s corps of the Prussian Army were now at hand. Zieten's corps permitted the two fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on Wellington's extreme left to be moved and posted behind the depleted centre. Pirch I Corps then proceeded to support Bülow and together they regained possession of Plancenoit, and once more the Charleroi road was swept by Prussian round shot. The value of this reinforcement at this particular moment can hardly be overestimated.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The Battle of Waterloo, June 18th 1815 - The wars of Wellington, a narrative poem (1819), before 169 - BL.jpg|thumb|left|Wellington at the battle of Waterloo]]
The French army now fiercely attacked the Coalition all along the line with the culminating point being reached when Napoleon sent forward the Imperial Guard at 19:30. The attack of the Imperial Guards was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the Grenadiers or Chasseurs of the Old Guard. Marching through a hail of canister and [[skirmisher]] fire and severely outnumbered, the 3,000 or so Middle Guardsmen advanced to the west of La Haye Sainte and proceeded to separate into three distinct attack forces. One, consisting of two battalions of Grenadiers, defeated the Coalition's first line and marched on. [[David Hendrik Chassé|Chassé]]'s relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them and Allied artillery fired into the victorious Grenadiers' flank. This still could not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade to charge the outnumbered French, who faltered and broke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chesney-178&quot;&gt;Chesney (1907). pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plas Newydd (Anglesey) - Waterloo 1.jpg|thumb|right|British 10th Hussars of Vivian's Brigade (red shakos – blue uniforms) attacking mixed French troops, including a square of Guard grenadiers (left, middle distance) in the final stages of the battle]]

Further to the west, 1,500 British Foot Guards under [[Peregrine Maitland|Maitland]] were lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery. As two battalions of Chasseurs approached, the second prong of the Imperial Guard's attack, Maitland's guardsmen rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The Chasseurs deployed to counter-attack but began to waver. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke them. The third prong, a fresh Chasseur battalion, now came up in support. The British guardsmen retreated with these Chasseurs in pursuit, but the latter were halted as the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]] wheeled in line onto their flank and poured a devastating fire into them and then charged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chesney-178&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry-70&quot;&gt;Parry (1900). p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this onslaught, they too broke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parry-70&quot;/&gt;

The last of the Guard retreated headlong. A ripple of panic passed through the French lines as the astounding news spread: &quot;''La Garde recule. Sauve qui peut!''&quot; (&quot;The Guard retreats. Save yourself if you can!&quot;). Wellington then stood up in [[Copenhagen (horse)|Copenhagen]]'s stirrups, and waved his hat in the air to signal an advance of the Allied line just as the Prussians were overrunning the French positions to the east. What remained of the French army then abandoned the field in disorder. Wellington and Blücher met at the inn of La Belle Alliance, on the north–south road which bisected the battlefield, and it was agreed that the Prussians should pursue the retreating French army back to France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chesney-178&quot;/&gt; The [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 20 November 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Great Britain.

After the victory, the Duke supported proposals that a medal be awarded to all British soldiers who participated in the Waterloo campaign, and on 28 June 1815 he wrote to the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] suggesting:&lt;blockquote&gt; ... the expediency of giving to the non commissioned officers and soldiers engaged in the Battle of Waterloo a medal. I am convinced it would have the best effect in the army, and if the battle should settle our concerns, they will well deserve it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[Waterloo Medal]] was duly authorised and distributed to all ranks in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Cawthorne (2015). p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====
Much historical discussion has been made about Napoleon's decision to send 33,000 troops under [[Emmanuel de Grouchy, Marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] to intercept the Prussians, but—having defeated Blücher at Ligny on 16 June and forced the Allies to retreat in divergent directions—Napoleon may have been strategically astute in a judgement that he would have been unable to beat the combined Allied forces on one battlefield. Wellington's comparable strategic gamble was to leave 17,000 troops and artillery, mostly Dutch, {{Convert|8.1|mi|km|abbr=on}} away at Halle, north-west of Mont-Saint-Jean, in case of a French advance up the Mons-Hal-Brussels road.&lt;ref&gt;Adkin (2001). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Willem Pieneman00.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Wellington at the battle of Waterloo. Detail of a painting by [[Jan Willem Pieneman]]]]
The campaign led to numerous other controversies, especially concerning the Prussians. For example: Were Wellington's troop dispositions prior to Napoleon's invasion of the Netherlands sound? Did Wellington somehow mislead or betray Blücher by promising, then failing, to come directly to Blücher's aid at Ligny? Who deserved the lion's share of credit for the victory—Wellington or the Prussians? These and other such issues concerning Blücher's, Wellington's, and Napoleon's decisions during the campaign were the subject of a major strategic-level study by the famous Prussian political-military theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], ''Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815'',&lt;ref&gt;Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815, in Carl von Clausewitz, Schriften—Aufsätze—Studien—Briefe, 2 volumes in 3, edited by Werner Hahlweg (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1966–90), volume 2, part 2: 936–1118.&lt;/ref&gt; English title: ''The Campaign of 1815: Strategic Overview of the Campaign''. Written c.1827, this study was Clausewitz's last such work and is widely considered to be the best example of Clausewitz's mature theories concerning such analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Moran, &quot;[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/seven.htm Clausewitz on Waterloo: Napoleon at Bay],&quot; in Carl von Clausewitz and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellesley, '' On Waterloo: Clausewitz, Wellesley, and the Campaign of 1815'', ed./trans. Christopher Bassford, Daniel Moran, and Gregory W. Pedlow (Clausewitz.com, 2010). {{ISBN|1453701508}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted the attention of Wellington's staff, who prompted the Duke to write his only published essay on the campaign (other than his immediate, official after-action report, &quot;The Waterloo Dispatch&quot;), his 1842 &quot;Memorandum on the Battle of Waterloo&quot;. While Wellington disputed Clausewitz on several points, the Prussian writer largely absolved Wellington of accusations levelled against him by nationalistic German axe-grinders. This exchange with Clausewitz was quite famous in Britain in the 19th century (it was heavily discussed in, for example, Chesney's ''Waterloo Lectures'' (1868).) It seems, however, to have been systematically ignored by British historians writing since 1914, which is odd considering that it was one of only two discussions of the battle that Wellington wrote. The explanation, unfortunately, is probably that it drew too much attention to the decisive German role in Wellington's victory—which Wellington himself was perfectly happy to acknowledge, but which became an awkward subject given Anglo-German hostilities in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bassford, &quot;[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/one.htm Introduction],&quot; in Carl von Clausewitz and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellesley, ''On Waterloo: Clausewitz, Wellesley, and the Campaign of 1815'', ed./trans.

== Political career ==
{{Toryism}}

Wellington entered politics again when he was appointed [[Master-General of the Ordnance]] in the Tory government of [[Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] on 26 December 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17434|page=2325|date=26 December 1818}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became [[Governor of Plymouth]] on 9 October 1819.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17525|page=1831|date=16 October 1819}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces|Commander-in-Chief of the British Army]] on 22 January 1827&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18327|page=153|date=23 January 1827}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Constable of the Tower|Constable of the Tower of London]] on 5 February 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18335|page=340|date=13 February 1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Robert Peel]], Wellington became an increasingly influential member of the Tory party, and in 1828 he resigned as Commander-in-Chief and became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). pp. 270–271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington by John Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of the Duke of Wellington by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]], 1830–31]]

During his first seven months as prime minister, he chose not to live in the official residence at [[10 Downing Street]], finding it too small. He moved in only because his own home, [[Apsley House]], required extensive renovations. During this time he was largely instrumental in the foundation of [[King's College London]]. On 20 January 1829 Wellington was appointed [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18543|page=129|date=23 January 1829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic emancipation===
His term was marked by [[Catholic emancipation]]: the granting of almost full civil rights to Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland. The change was prompted by the landslide [[by-election]] win of [[Daniel O'Connell]], an Irish Catholic proponent of emancipation, who was elected despite not being legally allowed to sit in Parliament. In the [[House of Lords]], facing stiff opposition, Wellington spoke for Catholic Emancipation, and according to some sources, gave one of the best speeches of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many Tories voted against the Act, and it passed only with the help of the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington had threatened to resign as Prime Minister if the King ([[George IV]]) did not give his Royal Assent.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, N.

The [[George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea|Earl of Winchilsea]] accused the Duke of &quot;an insidious design for the infringement of our liberties and the introduction of Popery into every department of the State&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes275&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington responded by immediately challenging Winchilsea to a [[duel]]. On 21 March 1829, Wellington and Winchilsea met on [[Battersea Park|Battersea fields]]. When the time came to fire, the Duke took aim and Winchilsea kept his arm down. The Duke fired wide to the right. Accounts differ as to whether he missed on purpose, an act known in dueling as a ''[[delope]]''. Wellington claimed he did. However, he was noted for his poor aim and reports more sympathetic to Winchilsea claimed he had aimed to kill. Winchilsea discharged his pistol into the air, a plan he and his second had almost certainly decided upon before the duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The nickname &quot;Iron Duke&quot; originates from this period, when he experienced a high degree of personal and political unpopularity. Its repeated use in ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'' throughout June 1830 appears to bear reference to his resolute political will, with taints of disapproval from its Irish editors.&lt;ref name=&quot;IronDuke1&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Wellington's government fell in 1830. In the summer and autumn of that year, a wave of [[Swing Riots|riots]] swept the country.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; The Whigs had been out of power for most years since the 1770s, and saw political reform in response to the unrest as the key to their return. Wellington stuck to the Tory policy of no reform and no expansion of suffrage, and as a result, lost a vote of no confidence on 15 November 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform Act===
{{Main|Reform Act 1832}}
The Whigs introduced the first [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] while Wellington and the Tories worked to prevent its passage. The Whigs could not get the bill past its second reading in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], and the bill failed. An election followed in direct response and the Whigs were returned with a landslide majority. A second Reform Act was introduced and passed in the House of Commons but was defeated in the Tory-controlled House of Lords. Another wave of near insurrection swept the country. Wellington's residence at Apsley House was targeted by a mob of demonstrators on 27 April 1831 and again on 12 October, leaving his windows smashed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This left King William IV no choice but to restore [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] to the premiership. Eventually, the bill passed the House of Lords after the King threatened to fill that House with newly created Whig peers if it were not. Wellington was never reconciled to the change; when Parliament first met after the first election under the widened franchise, Wellington is reported to have said &quot;I never saw so many shocking bad hats in my life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish emancipation===
{{Main|Emancipation of the Jews in England}}
Wellington opposed the Jewish Civil Disabilities Repeal Bill, and he stated in Parliament on 1 August 1833 that England &quot;is a Christian country and a Christian legislature, and that the effect of this measure would be to remove that peculiar character.&quot; The Bill was defeated 104 votes to 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wellesley Wellington (Duke of)| first = Arthur| title = The Speeches of the Duke of Wellington in Parliament, Volume 1 (1854).| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0Bhkop1x8UsC&amp;pg=PA671| accessdate = 10 March 2012| year = 1854| publisher = London: W.

[[File:Duke of Wellington Photo cleaned.jpg|thumb|[[Daguerreotype]] of the Duke of Wellington, then aged 74 or 75, by [[Antoine Claudet]], 1844]]
Wellington was gradually superseded as leader of the Tories by Robert Peel, while the party evolved into the Conservatives. When the Tories were returned to power in 1834, Wellington declined to become Prime Minister because he thought membership in Commons had become essential. The king reluctantly approved Peel, who was in Italy. So for three weeks in November and December 1834, Wellington acted as interim leader, taking the responsibilities of Prime Minister and most of the other ministries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes289&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; In Peel's first cabinet (1834–1835), Wellington became [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], while in the second (1841–1846) he was a [[Minister without Portfolio]] and [[Leader of the House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). pp. 291–292.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington was also re-appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Army on 15 August 1842 following the resignation of [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Lord Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20130|page=2217|date=16 August 1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington served as the leader of the Conservative party in the House of Lords, 1828–1846. Some historians have belittled him as a befuddled reactionary, but a consensus in the late 20th century depicts him as a shrewd operator who hid his cleverness behind the facade of a poorly informed old soldier. Wellington worked to transform the Lords from unstinting support of the Crown to an active player in political maneuvering, with a commitment to the landed aristocracy. He used his London residence as a venue for intimate dinners and private consultations, together with extensive correspondence that kept him in close touch with party leaders in the Commons, and the main persona in the Lords. He gave public rhetorical support to [[Ultra-Tory]] anti-reform positions, but then deftly changed positions toward the party's center, especially when Peel needed support from the upper house. Wellington's success was based on the 44 Elected peers from Scotland and Ireland, whose election he controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Davis, &quot;Wellington&quot; ''Parliamentary History'' (2003) 22#1 pp 43–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Wellesley married [[Kitty Pakenham]] in Dublin on 10 April 1806.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage proved unsatisfactory and the two spent years apart while he was campaigning. Kitty grew depressed, and Wellesley pursued other sexual and romantic partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neillands38&quot;&gt;Neillands (2003). p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05vlz90|title=BBC Two – Wellington: The Iron Duke Unmasked|work=BBC|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They had [[Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington|Arthur]] in 1807 and [[Lord Charles Wellesley|Charles]] in 1808. The couple lived apart most of the time and occupied separate rooms when they were together. Her brother [[Edward Pakenham]] served under Wellesley throughout the [[Peninsular War]], and Wellesley's regard for him helped to smooth his relations with Kitty, until Pakenham's death at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002), p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==

Wellington retired from political life in 1846, although he remained [[Commander-in-Chief of the Forces|Commander-in-Chief]], and returned briefly to the spotlight in 1848 when he helped organise a military force to protect London during that [[Revolutions of 1848|year of European revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative Party had split over the Repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846, with Wellington and most of the former Cabinet still supporting Peel, but most of the MPs led by [[Lord Derby]] supporting a protectionist stance. Early in 1852 Wellington, by then very deaf, gave [[Who? Who? Ministry|Derby's first government]] its nickname by shouting &quot;Who? Who?&quot; as the list of inexperienced Cabinet Ministers was read out in the House of Lords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/pms/derby.htm |title=Biography-Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby (1799–1869) |last=Bloy |first=Marjorie |work=A Web of English History |year=2011 |accessdate=6 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514090500/http://www.historyhome.co.uk/pms/derby.htm| archivedate= 14 May 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became Chief Ranger and Keeper of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[St. James's Park]] on 31 August 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21132|page=2396|date=3 September 1850}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also colonel of the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment|33rd Regiment of Foot]] from 1 February 1806&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15885|page=128|date=28 January 1806}}&lt;/ref&gt; and colonel of the [[Grenadier Guards]] from 22 January 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18327|page=154|date=23 January 1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitty died of cancer in 1831; despite their generally unhappy relations, which had led to an effective separation, Wellington was said to have been greatly saddened by her death, his one comfort being that after &quot;half a lifetime together, they had come to understand each other at the end&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Longford, Elizabeth  ''Wellington-Pillar of State'' Weidenfeld and Nicolson (1972) p.281&lt;/ref&gt; He had found consolation for his unhappy marriage in his warm friendship with the diarist [[Harriet Arbuthnot]], wife of his colleague [[Charles Arbuthnot]].&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1972) p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Harriet's death in the [[cholera]] epidemic of 1834 was almost as great a blow to Wellington as it was to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1972) p.296&lt;/ref&gt; The two widowers spent their last years together at Apsley House.&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1972) p.297&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington died at [[Walmer Castle]] in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] on 14 September 1852. This was his residence as [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]]. Walmer Castle was said to have been his favourite residence. He was found to be unwell on that morning and was aided from his military campaign bed (the same one he used throughout his historic military career) and seated in his chair where he died. His death was recorded as being due to the after-effects of a stroke culminating in a series of [[Epileptic seizure|seizures]].

Although in life he hated travelling by rail (after witnessing the death of [[William Huskisson]], one of the first railway accident casualties), his body was then taken by train to [[London]], where he was given a [[state funeral]] – one of only a handful of British subjects to be honoured in that way (other examples are [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] and Sir [[Winston Churchill]]) – and the last heraldic state funeral to be held in Britain. The funeral took place on 18 November 1852.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Thursday, 18 November 1852; p. 5; Issue 21276; col A: Funeral of the Duke of Wellington [Announcement of arrangements] and ''The Times'', Friday, 19 November 1852; p. 5; Issue 21277; col A: [Report of the event].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=21381|page=3079|date=16 November 1852}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his funeral there was hardly any space to stand because of the number of people attending, and the effusive praise given him in Tennyson's &quot;Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington&quot; attests to his stature at the time of his death.

During the retreat to Portugal in 1811, he subsisted on &quot;cold meat and bread&quot;, to the despair of his staff who dined with him.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbert (1997). p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, renowned for the quality of the wine that he drank and served, often drinking a bottle with his dinner (not a great quantity by the standards of his day).&lt;ref&gt;Longford (1971). p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

He rarely showed emotion in public, and often appeared condescending to those less competent or less well-born than himself (which was nearly everyone). However, Álava was a witness to an incident just before the Battle of Salamanca. Wellington was eating a chicken leg while observing the manoeuvres of the French army through a [[Telescope|spyglass]]. He spotted an overextension in the French left flank, and realised that he could launch a successful attack there. He threw the drumstick in the air and shouted &quot;''Les français sont perdus!''&quot; (&quot;The French are lost!&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Battle of Toulouse, an aide brought him the news of Napoleon's abdication, and Wellington broke into an impromptu [[flamenco]] dance, spinning around on his heels and clicking his fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Glover (2001). p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military historian Charles Dalton recorded that, after a hard-fought battle in Spain, a young officer made the comment, &quot;I am going to dine with Wellington tonight&quot;, which was overheard by the Duke as he rode by. &quot;Give me at least the prefix of Mr. before my name,&quot; Wellington said. &quot;My Lord,&quot; replied the officer, &quot;we do not speak of Mr. Caesar or Mr. Alexander, so why should I speak of Mr. Wellington?&quot;{{sfn|Dalton|1904|page=9}}

His stern countenance and iron-handed discipline were renowned; he was said to disapprove of soldiers cheering as &quot;too nearly an expression of opinion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gere (1981). p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Wellington cared for his men; he refused to pursue the French after the battles of Porto and Salamanca, foreseeing an inevitable cost to his army in chasing a diminished enemy through rough terrain. The only time that he ever showed grief in public was after the storming of Badajoz; he cried at the sight of the British dead in the breaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes, p. 162&quot;/&gt; In this context, his famous dispatch after the Battle of Vitoria, calling them the &quot;scum of the earth,&quot; can be seen to be fuelled as much by disappointment at their breaking ranks as by anger. He expressed his grief openly the night after Waterloo before his personal physician, and later with his family; unwilling to be congratulated for his victory, he broke down in tears, his fighting spirit diminished by the high cost of the battle and great personal loss.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). pp. 250,254.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington's soldier servant, a gruff German called Beckerman, and his long-serving valet, James Kendall, who served him for 25 years and was with him when he died, were both devoted to him.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2003). p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; (A story that he never spoke to his servants and preferred instead to write his orders on a note pad on his dressing table in fact probably refers to his son, the 2nd Duke. It was recorded by the 3rd Duke's niece, Viva Seton Montgomerie (1879-1959), as being an anecdote she heard from an old retainer, Charles Holman who was said greatly to resemble Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomerie (1955). p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Holman is recorded as a servant of the Dukes of Wellington from 1871 to 1905).&lt;ref&gt;Information from Archivist, Stratfield Saye House, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an incident when, as Master-General of the Ordnance he had been close to a large explosion, Wellington began to experience deafness and other ear-related problems. In 1822, he had an operation to improve the hearing of the left ear. The result, however, was that he became permanently deaf on that side. It is claimed that he was &quot;never quite well afterwards&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloy&quot;/&gt;

Wellington had a &quot;vigorous sexual appetite&quot; and many amorous liaisons during his marriage to Kitty. He enjoyed the company of intellectual and attractive women for many decades, particularly after the Battle of Waterloo and his subsequent ambassadorial position in Paris. The British press lampooned this side of the national hero.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; In 1824, one liaison came back to haunt him, when Wellington received a letter from a publisher offering to refrain from issuing an edition of the rather racy memoirs of one of his mistresses [[Harriette Wilson]], in exchange for financial consideration. It is said that the Duke promptly returned the letter, after scrawling across it, '''&quot;Publish and be damned&quot;'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

He was also a remarkably practical man who spoke concisely. In 1851, it was discovered that there were a great many sparrows flying about in [[the Crystal Palace]] just before [[the Great Exhibition]] was to open. His advice to Queen Victoria was &quot;Sparrowhawks, ma'am&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes (2002). pp. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington has often been portrayed as a defensive general, even though many, perhaps most, of his battles were offensive (Argaum, Assaye, Oporto, Salamanca, Vitoria, Toulouse). However, for most of the Peninsular War, where he earned his fame, his army lacked the numbers for a strategically offensive posture.&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg (1999). p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington had various other nicknames:
* In the popular ballads of the day Wellington was called ''&quot;Nosey&quot;'' or ''&quot;Old Nosey&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rory Muir|title=Wellington: Waterloo and the fortunes of peace, 1814–1852|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLROCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA472|year=2013|page=472|isbn=9780300187861}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia]] called Wellington &quot;''Le vainqueur du vainqueur du monde''&quot;, the conqueror of the world's conqueror, the phrase &quot;the world's conqueror&quot; obviously referring to [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornwell, Bernard |title=Waterloo – The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles|year=2014|page=10|title-link=Waterloo – The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] uses a similar reference in his &quot;Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington&quot;, referring to him as &quot;the great World-victor's victor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alfred Lord Tennyson|title=Tennyson: Including Lotos Eaters, Ulysses, Ode on the Death, Maud, The Coming and the Passing of Arthur|year=1900|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Officers under his command called him ''&quot;The Beau&quot;'', as he was a fine dresser.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes178&quot;&gt;Holmes (2002). p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spanish troops called him ''&quot;The Eagle&quot;'', while Portuguese troops called him ''&quot;[[Douro]] Douro&quot;'' after his river crossing at Oporto in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan (2004). p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''&quot;Beau Douro&quot;''; Wellington found this amusing when hearing it used by a Colonel of the Coldstream Guards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes178&quot; /&gt;
* ''&quot;Sepoy General&quot;''; Napoleon used this term as an insult to Wellington's military service in India, publicly considering him an unworthy opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
