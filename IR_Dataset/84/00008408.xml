'''Darwin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑːr|w|ɪ|n|audio=En-au-Darwin.ogg}} {{respell|DAR|win}})&lt;ref&gt;''Macquarie Dictionary, Fourth Edition'' (2005). Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. {{ISBN|1-876429-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the capital city of the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]], situated on the [[Timor Sea]]. It is the largest city in the sparsely populated Northern Territory, with a population of 148,564.&lt;ref name=ABSCapitalPop&gt;{{cite web|title=3218.0 – Regional Population Growth, Australia, 2017-18: Main Features|url=https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3218.0Main+Features12017-18|website=Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]|date=27 March 2019|accessdate=14 November 2019}} Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the smallest, wettest and most northerly of the Australian capital cities, and acts as the [[Top End]]'s regional centre.

Darwin's proximity to South East Asia makes it a link between Australia and countries such as [[Indonesia]] and [[East Timor]]. The [[Stuart Highway]] begins in Darwin, extends southerly across central Australia through [[Tennant Creek]] and [[Alice Springs]], concluding in [[Port Augusta, South Australia]]. The city is built upon a low bluff overlooking the harbour. Its suburbs begin at [[Lee Point, Northern Territory|Lee Point]] in the north and stretch to [[Berrimah, Northern Territory|Berrimah]] in the east. Past Berrimah, the Stuart Highway goes on to Darwin's satellite city [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] and its suburbs.

The Darwin region, like much of the Top End, experiences a tropical climate with a wet and dry season. A period known locally as &quot;the build up&quot; leading up to Darwin's wet season sees temperature and humidity increase. Darwin's wet season typically arrives in late November to early December and brings with it heavy monsoonal downpours, spectacular lightning displays, and increased cyclone activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;GUM&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Lightning Storms in the Top End |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/scribblygum/december2002/default.htm | date = 10 December 2002 | accessdate =27 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the dry season, the city has clear skies and mild sea breezes from the harbour.

The greater Darwin area is the ancestral home of the [[Larrakia people|Larrakia]] people. On 9 September 1839, {{HMS|Beagle}} sailed into Darwin harbour during its survey of the area. [[John Clements Wickham]] named the region &quot;Port Darwin&quot; in honour of their former shipmate [[Charles Darwin]], who had sailed with them on the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|ship's previous voyage]] which ended in October 1836. The settlement there became the town of Palmerston in 1869, but it was renamed Darwin in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDarwin – Northern Territory – Australia – Travel – smh.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Northern-Territory/Darwin/2005/02/17/1108500201604.html |title=Darwin – Northern Territory – Australia – Travel – smh.com.au |date=8 February 2004 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |quote= |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has been almost entirely rebuilt four times, following devastation caused by the 1897 cyclone, the 1937 cyclone, [[Bombing of Darwin|Japanese air raids]] during World War II, and [[Cyclone Tracy]] in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web   | title = A brief history of Darwin   | publisher = Darwin City Council   | url = http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/aboutdarwin/history/a_brief_history.htm   | accessdate = 29 December 2008   | url-status = dead   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090328121247/http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/aboutdarwin/history/a_brief_history.htm   | archivedate = 28 March 2009   | df = dmy-all   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Darwin (Northern Territory, Australia) | encyclopaedia = Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151900/Darwin | accessdate =13 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-20th century===
The Aboriginal people of the [[Larrakia language|Larrakia]] language group are the traditional custodians and the first inhabitants of the greater Darwin area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larrakia.com/AboutUs.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311090619/http://www.larrakia.com/AboutUs.html|archivedate=2009-03-11|title=Our People and History|publisher=Larrakia Nation Aboriginal Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had [[trading routes]] with Southeast Asia (see [[Macassan contact with Australia]]), and imported goods from as far afield as [[South Australia|South]] and Western Australia. Established [[songlines]] penetrated throughout the country, allowing stories and histories to be told and retold along the routes. The extent of [[Culture of Australia|shared songlines]] and history of multiple clan groups within this area is still contestable.

The Dutch visited Australia's northern coastline in the 1600s and landed on the [[Tiwi Islands]] only to be repelled by the [[Tiwi people]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiwilandcouncil.net.au/AboutUs/About_us.htm |title=Tiwi Land Council History |date=2007-10-21 |access-date=2016-06-26 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407223320/http://www.tiwilandcouncil.net.au/AboutUs/About_us.htm |archivedate=7 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch created the first European maps of the area. This accounts for the Dutch names in the area, such as [[Arnhem Land]] and [[Groote Eylandt]]. The first British person to see Darwin harbour appears to have been Lieutenant [[John Lort Stokes]] of {{HMS|Beagle}} on 9 September 1839. The ship's captain, Commander [[John Clements Wickham]], named the port after [[Charles Darwin]], the British naturalist who had sailed with them both on the earlier [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second expedition of the ''Beagle'']].

In 1863, the Northern Territory was transferred from [[New South Wales]] to South Australia. In 1864 South Australia sent [[B. T. Finniss]] north as Government Resident to survey and found a capital for its new territory. Finniss chose a site at [[Escape Cliffs]], near the entrance to Adelaide River, about {{convert|60|km}} northeast of the modern city. This attempt was short-lived, however, and the settlement abandoned by 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ling|first1=Ted|title=Commonwealth Government Records about the Northern Territory|publisher=National Archives of Australia|isbn=9781920807870|accessdate=26 June 2016|page=6|url=http://guides.naa.gov.au/content/20141219-Guide022_tcm48-58753.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309133412/http://guides.naa.gov.au/content/20141219-Guide022_tcm48-58753.pdf|archive-date=9 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 1869, [[George Goyder]], the Surveyor-General of South Australia, established a small settlement of 135 people at Port Darwin between [[Fort Hill, Darwin|Fort Hill]] and the escarpment. Goyder named the settlement [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], after the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntl.nt.gov.au/story/surveying-darwin-1869|title=Surveying Darwin 1869 {{!}} Northern Territory Library|website=ntl.nt.gov.au|access-date=2019-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, the first poles for the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|Overland Telegraph]] were erected in Darwin, connecting Australia to the rest of the world. The discovery of gold by employees of the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line]] digging holes for telegraph poles at [[Pine Creek, Northern Territory|Pine Creek]] in the 1880s spawned a gold rush which further boosted the young colony's development.{{efn|The story around the pole holes is commonly perpetuated, though no first hand accounts have been uncovered to authenticate this}}{{efn|In 1872 it was reported that ''A great many statements have been made about gold being found in holes of the telegraph post, and other unimaginable places. Such statements are incorrect, and given out by interested parties.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27273906 |title=GOLD AT PORT DARWIN. |newspaper=[[The Queenslander]] |volume=VII |issue=358 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=14 December 1872 |accessdate=23 June 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn|nearest first hand account is of linesmen finding gold near the telegraph line}}

In February 1872 the [[brigantine]] ''Alexandra'' was the first private vessel to set sail from an English port directly to Darwin, carrying people many of whom were coming to recent gold finds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28682755 |title=IV.—THE NORTHERN TERRITORY AND THE OVERLAND TELEGRAPH. |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |location=South Australia |date=2 February 1872 |accessdate=23 June 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1875 Darwin's [[white people|white population]] had grown to approximately 300 because of the gold rush. On 17 February 1875 the {{SS|Gothenburg}} left Darwin ''en route'' for [[Adelaide]]. The approximately 88 passengers and 34 crew (surviving records vary) included government officials, circuit-court judges, Darwin residents taking their first [[furlough]], and miners. While travelling south along the north Queensland coast, the ''Gothenburg'' encountered a cyclone-strength storm and was wrecked on a section of the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. Only 22 men survived, while between 98 and 112 people perished. Many passengers who perished were Darwin residents and news of the tragedy severely affected the small community, which reportedly took several years to recover.&lt;ref name=NTLIB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntlib.nt.gov.au/tracy/advanced/History_Cyclones.html |title=Previous cyclones in Darwin |work=Cyclone Tracy |publisher=Northern Territory Library |date=21 April 1998 |accessdate=7 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206005507/http://www.ntlib.nt.gov.au/tracy/advanced/History_Cyclones.html |archivedate=6 February 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, relatively large numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] settled at least temporarily in the Northern Territory; many were contracted to work the goldfields and later to build the Palmerston to Pine Creek railway. By 1888 there were 6122 Chinese in the Northern Territory, mostly in or around Darwin. The early Chinese settlers were mainly from the Guangdong Province in south China. However at the end of the nineteenth century anti-Chinese feelings grew in response to the 1890s economic depression and the White Australia policy meant many Chinese left the Territory. However, some families stayed and became Australian citizens, and established a commercial base in Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chungwahnt.asn.au/|title=Home|website=Chung Wah Society|accessdate=26 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Territory was initially settled and administered by [[South Australia]], until its transfer to the [[Australia|Commonwealth]] in 1911. In the same year, the city's official name changed from Palmerston to Darwin.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Northern-Territory/Darwin/2005/02/17/1108500201604.html/|title=Darwin|author=The Sydney Morning Herald|authorlink=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2004-02-08|location=Darwin, Australia|accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period between 1911 and 1919 was filled with political turmoil, particularly with trade union unrest, which culminated on 17 December 1918. Led by [[Harold Nelson (Australian politician)|Harold Nelson]], some 1000 demonstrators marched to [[Government House, Darwin|Government House]] at Liberty Square in Darwin where they burnt an [[effigy]] of the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]] [[John A. Gilruth|John Gilruth]] and demanded his resignation. The incident became known as the '[[Darwin Rebellion]]'. Their grievances were against the two main Northern Territory employers: [[Vestey Group|Vestey's Meatworks]] and the federal government. Both Gilruth and the Vestey company left Darwin soon afterwards.

Around 10,000 Australian and other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops arrived in Darwin at the outset of World War II, in order to defend Australia's northern coastline. On 19 February 1942 at 0957, 188 [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] warplanes [[Bombing of Darwin|attacked Darwin]] in two waves. It was the same fleet that had bombed [[Pearl Harbor]], though a considerably larger number of bombs were dropped on Darwin than on Pearl Harbor. The attack killed at least 243 people and caused immense damage to the town, airfields and aircraft. These were by far the most serious attacks on Australia in time of war, in terms of fatalities and damage. They were the first of [[Air raids on Australia, 1942–43|many raids]] on Darwin.
&lt;!-- The statement about Sydney and Newcastle was wrong; there were about 100 air raids, including one on Broome which killed more than 80 people. --&gt;

Darwin was further developed after the war, with sealed roads constructed connecting the region to [[Alice Springs]] to the south and [[Mount Isa]] to the south-east, and [[Manton Dam]] built in the south to provide the city with water. On [[Australia Day]] (26 January) 1959, Darwin was granted city status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiadaynt.com.au/fun/quiz/quiz2004.html |title=Australia Day (Darwin) |accessdate=2006-02-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211065041/http://www.australiadaynt.com.au/fun/quiz/quiz2004.html |archivedate=11 February 2006 |df=dmy }}. australiadaynt.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970–present day===

On 25 December 1974, Darwin was struck by [[Cyclone Tracy]], which killed 71 people and destroyed over 70% of the city's buildings, including many old stone buildings such as the Palmerston Town Hall, which could not withstand the lateral forces generated by the strong winds. After the disaster, 30,000 people of the population of 46,000 were evacuated, in what turned out to be the biggest airlift in Australia's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCC&quot;/&gt; The town was subsequently rebuilt with newer materials and techniques during the late 1970s by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, led by former [[Brisbane]] [[Lord mayor]] [[Clem Jones]]. A satellite city of [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] was built {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Darwin in the early 1980s.

On 17 September 2003 the [[Adelaide–Darwin railway]] was completed, with the opening of the Alice Springs-Darwin standard gauge line.

=== Aviation history ===
[[File:Darwin 1921.jpg|thumb|Darwin Aviation Heritage Centre – 1st Ultralight – Hover Bird]]
Darwin has played host to many of aviation's early pioneers. On 10 December 1919 Captain [[Ross Macpherson Smith|Ross Smith]] and his crew landed in Darwin and won a £10,000 Prize from the Australian Government for completing the first flight from London to Australia in under thirty days. Smith and his Crew flew a [[Vickers Vimy]], G-EAOU and landed on an airstrip that has now become Ross Smith Avenue.

Other aviation pioneers include [[Amy Johnson]], [[Amelia Earhart]], Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] and [[Bert Hinkler]]. The original QANTAS Empire Airways Ltd Hangar, a registered heritage site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Register|url=http://www.ntlis.nt.gov.au/heritageregister/f?p=103:302:4229181194015530::NO::P302_SITE_ID:119|website=Northern Territory government|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was part of the original Darwin Civil Aerodrome in Parap and is now a museum and still bears scars from the [[bombing of Darwin]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enjoy-darwin.com/qantas-australia.html QANTAS hangar]. Enjoy-darwin.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was home to Australian and US pilots during the war, with air strips being built in and around Darwin. Today Darwin provides a staging ground for [[military exercise]]s.

Darwin was a compulsory stop over/check point in the London to Melbourne Centenary Air Race in 1934. The official name of the race was the [[MacRobertson Air Race]]. Winners of the great race were [[Tom Campbell Black]] and [[C. W. A. Scott]].

The following is an excerpt from [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], 29 October 1934, Volume XXIV, Number 18.

{{quotation|Third Day. Biggest sensation of the race came just before dawn on the third day, when burly Lieutenant Scott and dapper [[Flight Lieutenant|Captain]] Black flew their scarlet [[De Havilland DH.88|Comet]] into Darwin. They had covered the last 300 miles over water on one motor, risked death landing on a field made soggy by the first rain in seven months. Said sandy-haired Lieutenant Scott: &quot;We've had a devil of a trip.&quot; But they had flown 9000 miles in two days, had broken the England to Australia record of 162 hr. in the unbelievable time of 52hr. 33 min., were only 2000 miles from their goal at Melbourne.}}

The [[Australian Aviation Heritage Centre]] is located approximately {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the City centre on the Stuart Highway and is one of only two places outside the United States where a B-52 bomber (on permanent loan from the United States Air Force) is on public display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Geography ==
[[File:Darwin skyline.jpg|thumb|Darwin skyline from East Point in 2007]]

Darwin lies in the Northern Territory, on the [[Timor Sea]]. The city proper occupies a low bluff overlooking [[Darwin Harbour]], flanked by Frances Bay to the east and Cullen Bay to the west. The remainder of the city is flat and low-lying, and coastal areas are home to recreational reserves, extensive beaches, and excellent fishing.

=== City and suburbs ===
{{Main|List of Darwin suburbs}}
[[File:Map of the Wards and Suburbs of Darwin, Northern Territory.png|upright|thumb|Map of Darwin with suburbs]]
Darwin and its suburbs spread in an approximately triangular shape, with the older south-western suburbs—and the city itself—forming one corner, the newer northern suburbs another, and the eastern suburbs, progressing towards Palmerston, forming the third.

The older part of Darwin is separated from the newer northern suburbs by [[Darwin International Airport]] and [[RAAF Base Darwin]]. [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] is a satellite city {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Darwin that was established in the 1980s and is one of the fastest growing municipalities in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmerston.nt.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=292|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813074102/http://www.palmerston.nt.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=292|archivedate=2010-08-13|title=Palmerston Growth|publisher=Palmerston City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rural areas of Darwin including [[Howard Springs, Northern Territory|Howard Springs]], [[Humpty Doo, Northern Territory|Humpty Doo]] and [[Berry Springs, Northern Territory|Berry Springs]] are experiencing strong growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuredarwin.nt.gov.au/development/transport.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929035715/http://www.futuredarwin.nt.gov.au/development/transport.html|archivedate=2008-09-29|title=Darwin to Palmerston Transport Corridor|quote=Traffic volumes have continued to increase on all road links between Darwin and Palmerston in parallel with the growth of Palmerston and the rural areas...|accessdate=5 February 2008|publisher=[[Government of the Northern Territory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's [[central business district]] is bounded by Daly Street in the north-west, McMinn Street in the north-east, Mitchell Street on the south-west and Bennett Street on the south-east. The CBD has been the focus of a number of major projects, including the billion dollar redevelopment of the Stokes Hill wharf waterfront area including a convention centre with seating for 1500 people and approximately {{convert|4000|m2|sqft}} of exhibition space. The developers have announced that this will include hotels, residential apartments, and public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theterritory.com.au/index.php?menuID=148 |title=Major Projects |publisher=Northern Territory Government |accessdate=15 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513094922/http://www.theterritory.com.au/index.php?menuID=148 |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's main industrial areas are along the Stuart Highway going towards Palmerston, centred on [[Winnellie, Northern Territory|Winnellie]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Darwin 1824.jpg|thumb|A wet-season storm at night in January]]
Darwin has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen ''Aw'']])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CHAPTER 7: Introduction to the Atmosphere | work=physicalgeography.net |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7v.html | accessdate =15 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with distinct wet and dry seasons and the average maximum temperature is similar all year round. The dry season runs from about May to September, during which nearly every day is sunny, and afternoon relative humidity averages around 30%.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarwinAirportAWS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Darwin Airport | publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_014015_All.shtml | accessdate =14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The driest period of the year, seeing only approximately {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} of monthly rainfall on average, is between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|°C|°F}}, but very rarely lower, and a temperature lower than {{convert|10|°C|°F}} has never been recorded in the city centre. Outer suburbs away from the coast, however, can occasionally record temperatures as low as {{convert|5|°C|°F}} in the dry season.  For an exceedingly lengthy 147‑day period during the 2012 dry season, from 5 May to 29 September, Darwin recorded no precipitation whatsoever. Prolonged periods of no precipitation are common in the dry season in [[Northern Australia]] (particularly in the [[Northern Territory]] and northern regions of [[Western Australia]]) although a no-rainfall event of this extent is rare. The 3pm dewpoint average in the wet season is at around {{convert|24.0|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarwinAirportAWS&quot;/&gt;

Extreme temperatures at the Darwin Post Office Station have ranged from {{convert|40.4|°C|°F}} on 17 October 1892 to {{convert|13.4|°C|°F}} on 25 June 1891; while extreme temperatures at the Darwin Airport station (which is further from the coast and routinely records cooler temperatures than the post office station which is located in Darwin's CBD) have ranged from {{convert|38.9|°C|°F}} on 18 October 1982 to {{convert|10.4|°C|°F}} on 29 July 1942. The highest minimum temperature on record is {{convert|30.7|°C|°F}} on 18 January 1928 for the post office station and {{convert|29.7|°C|°F}} on both 25 November 1987 and 17 December 2014 for the airport station; while the lowest maximum temperature on record is {{convert|18.4|°C|°F}} on 3 June 1904 for the post office station and {{convert|21.1|°C|°F}} on 14 July 1968 for the airport station.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarwinAirportAWS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DarwinPO&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_014016_All.shtml| title = Climate statistics for Australian locations|date=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclone]]s and monsoon rains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Information about Darwin | work = Charles Darwin University | url = http://www.cdu.edu.au/studyabroad/services.html#climate | accessdate = 15 July 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724032835/http://www.cdu.edu.au/studyabroad/services.html#climate | archive-date = 24 July 2008 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70 percent during the wettest months.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarwinAirportAWS&quot;/&gt; It does not rain every day during the wet season, but most days have plentiful cloud cover; January averages under 6 hours of bright sunshine daily. Darwin's highest Bureau of Meteorology verified daily rainfall total is {{convert|367.6|mm}}, which fell when [[2010–11 Australian region cyclone season|Cyclone Carlos]] bore down on the Darwin area on 16 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Cyclone Carlos bears down on Darwin | publisher=Weatherzone |url=http://www.weatherzone.com.au/news/cyclone-carlos-bears-down-on-darwin/16392 | accessdate =16 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; February 2011 was also Darwin's wettest month ever recorded, with {{convert|1110.2|mm}} recorded for the month at the airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarwinAirportAWS&quot;/&gt;

The hottest month is November, just before the onset of the main rain season. The [[heat index]] sometimes rises above {{convert|45|°C|°F}}, while the actual temperature is usually below {{convert|35|°C|°F}}, because of humidity levels that most would find uncomfortable. Because of its long dry season, Darwin has the second most daily average sunshine hours (8.4) of any Australian capital with the most sunshine from April to November; only Perth, Western Australia averages more (8.8). The sun passes directly overhead in mid October and mid February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.org.au/nova/005/005act02.htm|title=Direct solar energy|publisher=Australian Academy of Science|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629223440/http://science.org.au/nova/005/005act02.htm|archivedate=29 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average temperature of the sea ranges from {{convert|25.8|C|1}} in July to {{convert|31.5|C|1}} in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seatemperature.org/australia-pacific/australia/darwin.htm|title=Darwin Water Temperature - Australia - Sea Temperatures|first=Copyright Global Sea Temperatures-A.-Connect|last=Ltd|website=World Sea Temperatures|accessdate=26 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin occupies one of the most lightning-prone areas in Australia. On 31 January 2002 an early-morning [[squall line]] produced over 5,000 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes within a {{convert|60|km|mi|adj=on}} radius of Darwin alone – about three times the amount of lightning that Perth, Western Australia, experiences on average in an entire year.&lt;ref name=&quot;GUM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Darwin is one of the fastest-growing capital cities in Australia, with an annual growth rate of 2.6 per cent since the 2006 census. In recent years, the [[City of Palmerston|Palmerston]] and [[Shire of Litchfield|Litchfield]] parts of the Darwin statistical division have recorded the highest growth in population of any [[Local government areas of the Northern Territory|Northern Territory local government area]], and by 2016 Litchfield could overtake Palmerston as the second-largest municipality in metropolitan Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyReleaseDate/AF8693FEEF5896DFCA25741C0077EF91?OpenDocument |title=Darwin Statistical Division population growth|accessdate=31 March 2008|work=ABS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predicted by 2021 that the combined population of both Palmerston and Litchfield will be 101,546 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/6FE818DDDF5292C5CA256A940000A303/$File/32227_1999%20to%202021.pdf|title=Population projections|accessdate=20 April 2008|work=ABS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's population changed after the Second World War. Darwin, like many other Australian cities, experienced influxes from Europe, with significant numbers of [[Italians]] and [[Greeks]] during the 1960s and 1970s. Darwin also started to experience an influx from other European countries, which included the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Germans]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/3105.0.65.0012006?OpenDocument|title=Darwin Significant Migration Groups|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=26 March 2008|author-link=Australian Bureau of Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant percentage of Darwin's residents are recent immigrants from [[Asian Australian|Asia]], including the peoples of [[East Timor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nt.gov.au/community/multicultural-communities/community-profiles/portuguese-timorese|title=Portuguese-Timorese|first=Northern Territory|last=Government|date=2 March 2016|website=nt.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.localsearch.com.au/profile/portuguese-timorese-social-club-inc/marrara-nt/fOed|title=Portuguese &amp; Timorese Social Club Inc in Marrara &amp;#124; Localsearch|website=https://www.localsearch.com.au/profile/portuguese-timorese-social-club-inc/marrara-nt/fOed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory.JPG|thumb|right|In the Legislative Assembly]] 
The [[City of Darwin|Darwin City Council]] (Incorporated under the Northern Territory Local Government Act 1993) governs the [[City of Darwin]] which takes in the CBD and the suburbs. The city has been governed by a City Council form of government since 1957. The council consists of 13 elected members, the [[Lord Mayor]], and 12 [[aldermen]].

The City of Darwin electorate is organised into four electoral units or wards. The names of the wards are Chan, Lyons, Richardson, and Waters. The constituents of each ward are directly responsible for electing three [[aldermen]]. Constituents of all wards are directly responsible for electing the Lord Mayor of Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/aboutcouncil/elections/elections.htm|title=Darwin City Council – Elections|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929211108/http://www.darcity.nt.gov.au/aboutcouncil/elections/elections.htm|archivedate=29 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor is [[Kon Vatskalis]] after council elections in August 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;2017mayor&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=New Darwin Lord Mayor blasts predecessors for 'stupid decisions'|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-04/new-darwin-lord-mayor-kon-vatskalis-blasts-predecessors/8869522|work=ABC News|date=4 September 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rest of the Darwin area is divided into two [[Local Government Areas of the Northern Territory|local government areas]]—the [[City of Palmerston|Palmerston City Council]] and the [[Coomalie Shire|Shire of Coomalie]]. These areas have elected councils which are responsible for functions delegated to them by the [[Northern Territory Government]], such as planning and garbage collection.

The [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory]] convenes in Darwin in the Northern Territory [[Parliament House, Darwin|Parliament House]]. [[Government House, Darwin|Government House]], the official residence of the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], is located on The Esplanade.

Darwin is split between nine electoral divisions in the Legislative Assembly—[[electoral division of Port Darwin|Port Darwin]], [[electoral division of Fannie Bay|Fannie Bay]], [[electoral division of Fong Lim|Fong Lim]], [[electoral division of Nightcliff|Nightcliff]], [[electoral division of Sanderson|Sanderson]], [[electoral division of Johnston|Johnston]], [[Electoral division of Casuarina|Casuarina]], [[electoral division of Wanguri|Wanguri]], and [[electoral division of Karama|Karama]].  Historically, Darwin voters elected [[Country Liberal Party]] members.  However, since the turn of the 21st century, voters have often selected [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] members, particularly in the more diverse northern section.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Also located on the Esplanade is the [[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.nt.gov.au/|title=The Supreme Court of the Northern Territory|website=supremecourt.nt.gov.au|accessdate=26 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin has a Magistrate's Court which is also located on the corner of Cavenagh and Bennett Streets quite close to the Darwin City Council Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://localcourt.nt.gov.au/|title=NT Local Courts|first=NT Local|last=Courts|date=27 January 2019|website=localcourt.nt.gov.au|accessdate=26 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime===

Darwin has had a history of alcohol abuse and violent crime, with 6,000 assaults in 2009, of which 350 resulted in broken jaws and noses – more than anywhere else in the world, according to the Royal Darwin Hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;etjaw&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Australian city of Darwin named 'broken jaw capital of the world'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/6945648/Australian-city-of-Darwin-named-broken-jaw-capital-of-the-world.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|first=Bonnie|last= Malkin|date=7 January 2010|access-date=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell Street, with its numerous pubs, [[night club|club]]s and other entertainment venues, was one of the areas policed by the CitySafe Unit, officially launched by the NT Chief Minister [[Paul Henderson]] on 25 February 2009, was credited with success in tackling alcohol abuse linked to crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/adminmedia/mailouts/5170/attachments/090217%20City%20Safe.pdf|title=CitySafe Night Patrol on the Beat in the City|author=Northern Territory Government|date=2009|url-status=dead|journal=|access-date=24 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917175101/http://newsroom.nt.gov.au/adminmedia/mailouts/5170/attachments/090217%20City%20Safe.pdf|archive-date=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the NT police were looking at establishing a specialist licensing enforcement unit in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=http://nceta.flinders.edu.au/files/3413/5226/7676/EN458_LLReport3.pdf|first1=Allan|last1=Trifonoff|first2=Rachel |last2=Andrew|first3=Tania|last3=Steenson|first4=Roger |last4=Nicholas|first5=Ann M.|last5=Roche|displayauthors=1|title=Liquor licensing legislation in Australia: Part 3: Police expectations and experiences|series=An examination of Liquor Licensing Legislation in Australia as at December 2010|others=Commissioned by the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs through the National Drug Strategy Cost Shared Funding Model|access-date=24 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
[[File:The Supreme Court.JPG|thumb|right|[[Supreme Court of the Northern Territory]]]]

The two largest economic sectors are [[mining]] and [[tourism]]. Given its location, Darwin serves as a &quot;gateway&quot; for Australian travellers to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/home-design/darwin-capitalises-as-the-gateway-to-asia/news-story/|title=Darwin capitalises as the gateway to Asia|work=[[The Australian]]|date=3 August 2013|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining and energy industry production exceeds $2.5 billion per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/dpifm/Minerals_Energy/index.cfm?header=About%20Minerals%20and%20Energy|title=About the Minerals and Energy Group|publisher=Department of Primary Industry, Fisheries and Mines|access-date=16 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908210447/http://www.nt.gov.au/dpifm/Minerals_Energy/index.cfm?header=About%20Minerals%20and%20Energy|archive-date=8 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important mineral resources are gold, zinc and [[bauxite]], along with [[manganese]] and many others. The energy production is mostly off shore with oil and natural gas from the [[Timor Sea]], although there are significant [[uranium]] deposits near Darwin. Tourism employs 8% of Darwin residents, and is expected to grow as domestic and international tourists are now spending time in Darwin during the [[wet season|Wet]] and [[dry season|Dry]] seasons. Federal spending is also a major contributor to the local economy.

[[File:Darwin CBD-2005.jpg|thumb|Darwin CBD (Central Business District), circa 2005]]

Darwin's importance as a port is expected to grow, due to the increased exploitation of petroleum in the nearby Timor Sea, and to the completion of the railway link and continued expansion in trade with Asia.
During 2005, a number of major construction projects started in Darwin. One is the redevelopment of the Wharf Precinct, which includes a large convention and exhibition centre, apartment housing including [[Outrigger Pandanas]] and [[Evolution on Gardiner]], retail and entertainment outlets including a large wave pool and safe swimming lagoon. The [[Chinatown]] project has also started with plans to construct Chinese-themed retail and dining outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/waterfront/news/newsletter/2005/pdf/200504Transformation.pdf |title=Darwin City Waterfront |accessdate=13 May 2007 |work=Northern Territory Government |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604233555/http://www.nt.gov.au/waterfront/news/newsletter/2005/pdf/200504Transformation.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Charles Darwin National Park.jpg|right|thumb|Picnic area located [[Charles Darwin National Park]]]]
Tourism is one of Darwin's largest industries. Tourism is a major industry and employment sector for the Northern Territory.
In 2005/06, 1.38 million people visited the Northern Territory. They stayed for 9.2 million nights and spent over $1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismnt.com.au/ Tourism NT]. Tourism NT.&lt;/ref&gt;
The tourism industry directly employed 8,391 Territorians in June 2006 and when indirect employment is included, tourism typically accounts for more than 14,000 jobs across the Territory.

Darwin is a hub for tours to [[Kakadu National Park]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://parksaustralia.gov.au/kakadu/|title=Kakadu National Park|website=parksaustralia.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Litchfield National Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nt.gov.au/leisure/parks-reserves/find-a-park-to-visit/litchfield-national-park|title=Litchfield National Park|last=Government|first=Northern Territory|date=2017-09-27|website=nt.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Katherine Gorge]].
The Territory is traditionally divided into the wet and dry, but there are up to six traditional seasons in Darwin.
It is warm and sunny from May to September. Humidity rises during the green season, from October to April bringing thunderstorms and monsoonal rains which rejuvenates the landscape. Tourism is largely seasonal with most tourists visiting during the cooler dry season which runs from April to September.

=== Military ===

The military presence that is maintained both within Darwin, and the wider Northern Territory, is a substantial source of employment. &lt;!---some of the following could be in history---&gt;
On 16 November 2011, Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] and President [[Barack Obama]] announced that the United States would station troops in Australia for the first time since World War II.

As Darwin was destroyed by cyclones several times and suffered severe bomb damage during World War II there are few historic buildings left in town. The ''Administrator's Office'' dating from 1883 was used as a law court and as a police station and was only slightly damaged by bombs. In 1974, however, it was completely destroyed by the cyclone. In 1979 it was decided to rebuild the ruin and the reconstruction was finished in 1981. The building houses Government offices today. Opposite the building ''Survivors Lookout'' offers a beautiful view of the marina.&lt;ref&gt;Information board on the building&lt;/ref&gt;
