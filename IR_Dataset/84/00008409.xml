A '''dictator''' is a political leader who possesses [[autocracy|absolute power]].  A [[dictatorship]] is a state ruled by one dictator or by a small clique.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Dictatorship&quot; at [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictatorship ''Merriam Webster'' (2019)&lt;/ref&gt;  The word originated as the title of a [[Roman dictator|magistrate]] in the [[Roman Republic]] appointed by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] to rule the republic in times of emergency (see [[Roman dictator]] and ''[[justitium]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictator|title=dictator – Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=1 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516141807/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictator|archivedate=16 May 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the term &quot;[[tyrant]]&quot; (which was originally a non-pejorative Ancient Greek title), and to a lesser degree &quot;[[Autocracy|autocrat]]&quot;, &quot;dictator&quot; came to be used almost exclusively as a non-titular term for oppressive rule. Thus, in modern usage, the term &quot;dictator&quot; is generally used to describe a leader who holds or abuses an extraordinary amount of [[Superiority complex|personal power]]. Dictatorships are often characterised by some of the following: suspension of [[election]]s and [[civil liberties]]; proclamation of a [[state of emergency]]; [[rule by decree]]; [[political repression|repression of political opponents]]; not abiding by the [[rule of law]] procedures, and [[cult of personality]]. Dictatorships are often [[one-party state|one-party ]] or [[dominant-party system|dominant-party]] states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papaioannou|first=Kostadis|date=2015|title=The Dictator Effect: How long years in office affect economic development|journal=Journal of Institutional Economics|volume=11|issue=1|pages=111–139|doi=10.1017/S1744137414000356|pmid=|author2=vanZanden, Jan Luiten}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|last = Olson|first = Mancur|date = 1993|journal =[[American Political Science Review]] |volume=87 |issue=3|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of leaders coming to power in different kinds of regimes, such as [[military junta]]s, [[one-party state]]s, [[dominant-party system|dominant-party state]]s, and civilian governments under a personal rule, have been described as dictators. They may hold [[far-left|left]] or [[far-right|right-wing]] views, or may be [[Apoliticism|apolitical]].

== Etymology ==

{{main article|Roman dictator}}
Originally an emergency legal appointment in the [[Roman Republic]], the term &quot;Dictator&quot; did not have the negative meaning it has now. A Dictator was a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] given sole power for a limited duration. At the end of the term, the Dictator's power was returned to normal [[Roman consul|Consular rule]] whereupon a dictator provided accountability, though not all dictators accepted a return to power sharing.

The term started to get its modern negative meaning with [[Sulla|Cornelius Sulla]]'s ascension to the [[dictatorship]] following [[Sulla's second civil war]], making himself the first Dictator in [[Rome]] in more than a century (during which the office was ostensibly abolished) as well as ''[[de facto]]'' eliminating the time limit and need of senatorial acclamation. He avoided a major constitutional crisis by resigning the office after about one year, dying a few years later. [[Julius Caesar]] followed Sulla's example in 49 BC and in February 44 BC was proclaimed ''[[Dictator perpetuo]]'', &quot;Dictator in perpetuity&quot;, officially doing away with any limitations on his power, which he kept until [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|his assassination]] the following month.

Following Julius' assassination, his heir [[Augustus]] was offered the title of dictator, but he declined it. Later successors also declined the title of dictator, and usage of the title soon diminished among Roman rulers.

As late as the second half of the 19th century, the term ''dictator'' had occasional positive implications. For example, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], the national leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] was often referred to as dictator, without any negative connotations, by his supporters and detractors alike, although his official title was that of regent-president.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lajos-Kossuth&lt;/ref&gt; When creating a provisional [[Executive (government)|executive]] in [[Sicily]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand]] in 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] officially assumed the title of &quot;Dictator&quot; (see [[Dictatorship of Garibaldi]]). Shortly afterwards, during the 1863 [[January Uprising]] in Poland, &quot;Dictator&quot; was also the official title of four leaders, the first being [[Ludwik Mierosławski]]. 
   
Past that time, however, the term ''dictator'' assumed an invariably negative connotation. In popular usage, a ''dictatorship'' is often associated with brutality and oppression. As a result, it is often also used as a term of abuse against political opponents. The term has also come to be associated with [[megalomania]]. Many dictators create a [[cult of personality]] around themselves and they have also come to grant themselves increasingly grandiloquent titles and honours. For instance, [[Idi Amin|Idi Amin Dada]], who had been a British army [[lieutenant]] prior to [[Uganda]]'s independence from Britain in October 1962, subsequently styled himself &quot;''[[Excellency|His Excellency]], [[President for Life]], [[Field marshal (Uganda)|Field Marshal]] [[Hajji|Al Hadji]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctor]]{{Ref label|Doctorate|A|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC,{{Ref label|VC|B|}} [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], [[Military Cross|MC]], Conqueror of the [[British Empire]] in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 August 2003 |access-date=2008-03-18 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205070235/http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |archive-date=2013-12-05 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[movie]] ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940), [[Charlie Chaplin]] satirized not only [[Adolf Hitler]] but the institution of dictatorship itself.

A benevolent dictatorship refers to a government in which an [[authoritarian]] leader exercises absolute political power over the state but is perceived to do so with the regard for benefit of the population as a whole, standing in contrast to the decidedly malevolent stereotype of a [[dictator]]. A benevolent dictator may allow for some [[economic liberalization]] or [[democracy|democratic decision-making]] to exist, such as through public [[referendum|referenda]] or [[elect]]ed [[Representative democracy|representative]]s with limited power, and often makes preparations for a [[Democratization|transition to genuine democracy]] during or after their term. It might be seen as a [[republic]] a form of [[enlightened despotism]].

The label has been applied to leaders such as [[Ioannis Metaxas]] of [[4th of August Regime|Greece]] (1936-41), [[Josip Broz Tito]] of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1953-80),&lt;ref name=&quot;shapiro&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Susan |last2=Shapiro |first2=Ronald |title=The Curtain Rises: Oral Histories of the Fall of Communism in Eastern Europe |publisher=McFarland |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-7864-1672-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCqWFQ1WKlkC&amp;pg=PA180 |ref=Shapiro_2004}}&lt;br /&gt;&quot;...All Yugoslavs had educational opportunities, jobs, food, and housing regardless of nationality. Tito, seen by most as a benevolent dictator, brought peaceful co-existence to the Balkan region, a region historically synonymous with factionalism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lee Kuan Yew]] of [[Singapore]] (1959-90).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=What Singapore can teach us |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-singapore-can-teach-us/2012/05/02/gIQAlQEGwT_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2012-05-02 |access-date=2015-11-25 |issn=0190-8286 |first=Matt |last=Miller |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311045232/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/what-singapore-can-teach-us/2012/05/02/gIQAlQEGwT_story.html |archive-date=2016-03-11 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The association between a dictator and the [[military]] is a common one; many dictators take great pains to emphasize their connections with the military and they often wear military uniforms. In some cases, this is perfectly legitimate; [[Francisco Franco]] was a lieutenant general in the Spanish Army before he became [[Head of state|Chief of State]] of [[Spain]]; [[Manuel Noriega]] was officially commander of the [[Panama]]nian Defense Forces. In other cases, the association is mere pretense.

Some dictators have been masters of [[crowd manipulation]], such as Mussolini and Hitler. Others were more prosaic speakers, such as Stalin and Franco.  Typically the dictator's people seize control of all media, censor or destroy the opposition, and give strong doses of [[propaganda]] daily, often built around a [[cult of personality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morstein |first=Marx Fritz |display-authors=etal |title=Propaganda and Dictatorship |publisher=Princeton UP |isbn=978-1406747249|date=March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its negative and pejorative [[connotation]]s, modern authoritarian leaders very rarely (if ever) use the term ''dictator'' in their formal titles, instead they most often simply have title of [[President (government title)|president]]. In the 19th century, however, its official usage was more common:

Over time, dictators have been known to use tactics that violate human rights. For example, under the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leaders [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]], government policy was enforced by [[Red Terror|extrajudicial killings]], [[secret police]] (originally known as the ''[[Cheka]]'') and the notorious [[Gulag]] system of concentration camps. Most Gulag inmates were not political prisoners, although significant numbers of political prisoners could be found in the camps at any one time. Data collected from Soviet archives gives the death toll from Gulags at 1,053,829.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gulag Prisoner Population Statistics from 1934 to 1953.&quot; ''Wasatch.edu''. Wasatch, n.d. Web. 16 July 2016: &quot;According to a 1993 study of Soviet archival data, a total of 1,053,829 people died in the Gulag from 1934 to 1953. However, taking into account that it was common practice to release prisoners who were either suffering from incurable diseases or on the point of death, the actual Gulag death toll was somewhat higher, amounting to 1,258,537 in 1934-53, or 1.6 million deaths during the whole period from 1929 to 1953..&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other human rights abuses by the Soviet state included [[Poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services|human experimentation]], [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|the use of psychiatry as a political weapon]] and the denial of freedoms of religion, assembly, speech and association.

== In game theory ==
{{ref section|date=March 2017}}
In [[social choice theory]], the notion of a dictator is formally defined as a person who can achieve any feasible social outcome he/she wishes. The formal definition yields an interesting distinction between two different types of dictators.
* ''The strong dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind (e.g. raise taxes, having someone killed, etc.), a definite way of achieving that goal. This can be seen as having explicit absolute power, like [[Sulla]].
* ''The weak dictator'' has, for any social goal he/she has in mind, and for any political scenario, a course of action that would bring about the desired goal. For the ''weak'' dictator, it is usually not enough to &quot;give their orders&quot;, rather he/she has to manipulate the political scene appropriately. This means that the ''weak'' dictator might actually be lurking in the shadows, working within a political setup that seems to be non-dictatorial. An example of such a figure is [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo the Magnificent]], who controlled Renaissance [[Florence]].
Note that these definitions disregard some alleged dictators who are not interested in the actual achieving of social goals, as much as in [[propaganda]] and controlling public opinion.
