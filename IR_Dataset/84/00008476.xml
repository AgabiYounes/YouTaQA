A '''disk operating system''' (abbreviated '''DOS''') is a computer [[operating system]] that can use a [[disk storage]] device, such as a [[floppy disk]], [[hard disk drive]], or [[optical disc]]. A disk operating system must provide a [[file system]] for organizing, reading, and writing [[computer file|files]] on the storage disk. Strictly speaking, this definition does not apply to current generations of operating systems, such as versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] in use, and is more appropriately used only for older generations of operating systems.

Disk operating systems were available for [[mainframe]]s, [[microprocessor]]s and [[home computer]]s and were usually loaded from the disks themselves as part of the [[Booting|boot process]].

==History==
In the early days of computers, there were no disk drives, floppy disks or modern [[flash storage]] devices. Early storage devices such as [[Analog delay line|delay line]]s, [[core memories]], [[punched card]]s, [[punched tape]], [[magnetic tape]], and [[magnetic drum]]s were used instead. And in the early days of microcomputers and [[home computer]]s, paper tape or [[audio cassette tape]] (see [[Kansas City standard]]) or nothing were used instead. In the latter case, program and data entry was done at [[front panel]] switches directly into memory or through a [[computer terminal]] / keyboard, sometimes controlled by a [[BASIC]] interpreter in [[read-only memory|ROM]]; when power was turned off any information was lost.

Both [[hard disk]]s and floppy disk drives require software to manage rapid access to block storage of sequential and other data. For most microcomputers, a disk drive of any kind was an optional peripheral; systems could be used with a tape drive or booted without a storage device at all. The disk operating system component of the operating system was only needed when a disk drive was used.

The DOS concept began with [[DOS/360]] in 1966 for IBM's [[System/360]] mainframes. Most home and personal computers of the late 1970s and 1980s used a disk operating system, most often with &quot;DOS&quot; in the name and simply referred to as &quot;DOS&quot; within their respective communities: [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS]] for Commodore 8-bit systems, [[Atari DOS]] for the Atari 8-bit family, [[TRS-DOS]] for the TRS-80, and [[Apple DOS]] for the Apple II, and [[MS-DOS]] for IBM PC compatibles.

Usually, a disk operating system was loaded from a disk. Among the exceptions were Commodore, whose DOS resided on ROM chips in the [[Commodore 1541|disk drive]]s. The [[Lt. Kernal]] hard disk subsystem for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Commodore 128]] models stored its DOS on the disk, as is the case with modern systems, and loaded the DOS into [[RAM]] at boot time; the British [[BBC Micro]]'s optional [[Disc Filing System]], DFS, offered as a kit with a disk controller chip, a ROM chip, and a handful of logic chips, to be installed inside the computer.

==Disk operating systems that were extensions to the OS==
*[[Apple DOS]] was the primary operating system for the [[Apple II series]] of computers, from 1979 with the introduction of the [[floppy disk drive]], until 1983 when it was replaced by [[ProDOS]].
*[[Commodore DOS]] was used on 8-bit [[Commodore International|Commodore]] computers such as the [[Commodore 64]]. Unlike most other DOS systems, it was integrated into the disk drives, not loaded into the computer's own memory.
*[[Atari DOS]] was used by the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of computers. The Atari OS only offered low-level disk-access, so an extra layer called ''DOS'' was booted from a floppy and offered higher level functions such as filesystems.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; Third-party replacements for Atari DOS were also available: [[DOS XL]], [[SpartaDOS X|SpartaDOS]], MyDOS, TurboDOS, Top-DOS.
*[[MSX-DOS]] for the [[MSX]] computer standard. Initial version, released in 1984, was nothing but MS-DOS 1.0 ported to [[Zilog Z80|Z80]]; but in 1988 it evolved to version 2, offering facilities such as subdirectories, memory management and environment strings. The MSX-DOS kernel resided in ROM (built-in on the disk controller) so basic file access capacity was available even without the command interpreter, by using [[BASIC]] extended commands.
*[[Disc Filing System]] (DFS) This was an optional component for the Acorn [[BBC Micro]], offered as a kit with a disk controller chip, a ROM chip, and a handful of logic chips, to be installed inside the computer
*[[Advanced Disc Filing System]] (ADFS) was a successor to Acorn's DFS.
*[[AMSDOS]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]] computers.
*GDOS and G+DOS, for the [[+D]] and [[DISCiPLE]] disk interfaces for the [[ZX Spectrum]].

==Disk operating systems that were the main OS==
Some disk operating systems were the operating system for the entire computer system.
*The [[DOS/360]] initial/simple operating system for the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] family of [[mainframe computer]]s (it later became DOS/VSE, and was eventually just called [[VSE (operating system)|VSE]]).
*The [[DEC BATCH-11/DOS-11|DOS-11]] operating system for [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]] [[minicomputer]]s.
*[[CP/M]] was a disk operating system--even though it was named as such--used as the main or alternate operating system for numerous microcomputers of the 1970s and 1980s.
*[[TRSDOS]] was the operating system for the [[TRS-80]] line of computers from Tandy.&lt;ref name=trsdos/&gt;
*[[MS-DOS]] for [[IBM PC]] compatibles with [[Intel]] [[x86]] CPUs. It started as [[86-DOS]], which was modeled on [[CP/M]], and then itself served as the basis for [[Microsoft]]'s [[MS-DOS]], and was rebranded by IBM as [[IBM PC DOS]] until 1993. Various compatible systems were later produced by different organizations, starting with [[DR-DOS]] in 1988.
