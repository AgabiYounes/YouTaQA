'''David Hayes Agnew''' (November 24, 1818{{snd}}March 22, 1892) was an American [[surgery|surgeon]].

== Biography ==
Agnew was born on November 24, 1818, Nobleville, Pennsylvania (present-day [[Christiana, Pennsylvania|Christiana]]). His parents were Robert Agnew and Agnes Noble. Agnew grew up as a Christian. He was surrounded by a family of doctors and had always known he was going to become a physician. As a young boy, he had a sharp sense of humor and was very intelligent. 

He graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] School of Medicine in 1838. He returned to Nobleville to help his father in his clinic. He worked there for two years. His father was an asthmatic and moved to Maryland in 1840 because the climate was more suited to his condition. Agnew moved with him. On November 21, 1841, he married Margaret Irwin. In 1852, he bought and revived the Philadelphia School of Anatomy. He held responsibility for ten years until 1862. During the [[American Civil War]] he was consulting surgeon in the [[Mower Hospital|Mower Army Hospital]], near Philadelphia, and acquired a considerable reputation for his operations in cases of gunshot wounds. On December 21, 1863, he became the Demonstrator of Anatomy and Assistant Lecturer on Clinical Surgery at The University of Pennsylvania. Later, he was requested to assist the Professor of Surgery in the Conduct of the surgical clinics. In the year 1865, he gave summer instruction courses. For the next seven years, he worked for the University as Demonstrator of Anatomy. A large portion of his success was due to his wife's energy, intelligence, and determination. She gave him an impetus to try harder and not be satisfied with his first try.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-uhOHdlAm4C&amp;pg=PA25 |title=History of the Life of D. Hayes Agnew ...|last=Adams|first=Jedidiah Howe|date=1892-01-01|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Garfield Case ==
On July 2, 1881, President James A. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau. He held the position of chief consulting surgeon. When a committee came to give him his money for helping, Agnew said, &quot;Gentlemen, I present no bill for my attendance to President Garfield. I gave my services freely and gratuitously&quot;. He was never optimistic about the President's case and was not fooled by fallacious beliefs. This procedure helped create Agnew's reputation.
