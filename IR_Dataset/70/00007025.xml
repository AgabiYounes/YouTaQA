'''Cranberries''' are a group of [[evergreen]] [[dwarf shrub]]s or trailing vines in the [[subgenus]] '''''Oxycoccus''''' of the genus ''[[Vaccinium]]''. In Britain, cranberry may refer to the native species ''[[Vaccinium oxycoccos]]'',&lt;ref name=Stac10/&gt; while in North America, cranberry may refer to ''[[Vaccinium macrocarpon]]''.&lt;ref name=usdaplants&gt;{{PLANTS|symbol=VAMA|taxon=Vaccinium macrocarpon|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vaccinium oxycoccos'' is cultivated in central and northern Europe, while ''Vaccinium macrocarpon'' is cultivated throughout the northern United States, Canada and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cranberries.org/cranberries/grow_intro.html|title=How Cranberries Grow: &quot;Cranberries 101&quot; - An Introduction|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=2014|website= |publisher=Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some methods of classification, ''Oxycoccus'' is regarded as a [[genus]] in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymf.bbg.org/profile_species_tech.asp?id=412|publisher=Brooklyn Botanic Garden|title=''Vaccinium oxycoccos'': Small Cranberry, Technical Page|author=Steven Clemants}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be found in [[acid]]ic [[bog]]s throughout the cooler regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

The [[flower]]s are dark pink, with very distinct ''reflexed'' [[petal]]s, leaving the [[Gynoecium|style]] and [[stamen]]s fully exposed and pointing forward. They are pollinated by [[bee]]s. The fruit is a [[berry (botany)|berry]] that is larger than the leaves of the plant; it is initially light green, turning red when ripe. It is edible, but with an acidic taste that usually overwhelms its sweetness.

In 2017, the United States, Canada, and Chile accounted for 98% of the world production of cranberries. Most cranberries are processed into products such as [[cranberry juice|juice]], sauce, jam, and sweetened [[Dried cranberry|dried cranberries]], with the remainder sold fresh to consumers.

== Species and description ==
[[File:Cranberrymap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Approximate ranges of the cranberries in sect. ''Oxycoccus'': Red: common cranberry. Orange: small cranberry. Green: American cranberry.]]
Cranberries are related to [[bilberry|bilberries]], [[blueberry|blueberries]], and [[Huckleberry|huckleberries]], all in ''Vaccinium'' subgenus ''Vaccinium''. These differ in having bell-shaped flowers, the petals not being reflexed, and woodier stems, forming taller shrubs. There are 3-4 species of cranberry, classified by ''[[subgenus]]'':{{cn|date=January 2020}}

===Subgenus ''Oxycoccus''===
*''[[Vaccinium oxycoccos]]'' or ''Oxycoccus palustris'' (common cranberry, northern cranberry or cranberry) is widespread throughout the cool temperate Northern Hemisphere, including northern Europe, northern Asia, and northern North America. It has small {{cvt|5|–|10|mm|in|frac=8}} leaves. The flowers are dark pink, with a purple central spike, produced on finely hairy stems. The fruit is a small pale pink [[berry (botany)|berry]], with a refreshing sharp acidic flavor.
*''[[Vaccinium microcarpum]]'' or ''Oxycoccus microcarpus'' (small cranberry) occurs in northern North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.borealforest.org/shrubs/shrub29.htm |title=''Oxycoccus microcarpus'' Small Cranberry |publisher=Lakehead University |author=Faculty of Natural Resources Management |website=borealforest.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; northern Europe and northern Asia, and differs from ''V. oxycoccos'' in the leaves being more triangular, and the flower stems hairless; additionally, their stems can also be smaller and produce a smaller number of flowers than ''V.&amp;nbsp;ocycoccos''. They also differ in the fact that their leaves can also be smaller in size, even though the main difference is their triangular shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235743745 |title=''Vaccinium Oxycoccos'' L.

*''[[Vaccinium macrocarpon]]'' or ''Oxycoccus macrocarpus'' (large cranberry, American cranberry, bearberry) native to northern North America across Canada, and eastern United States, south to [[North Carolina]] at high altitudes). It differs from ''V. oxycoccos'' in the leaves being larger, {{cvt|10|–|20|mm|in|frac=8}} long, and in its slightly apple-like taste.

===Subgenus ''Oxycoccus'', sect. ''Oxycoccoides''===
*''[[Vaccinium erythrocarpum]]'' or ''Oxycoccus erythrocarpus'' (southern mountain cranberry) native to southeastern North America at high altitudes in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]], and also in eastern Asia.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

== Etymology ==
[[File:Vaccinum oxycoccos 120604.jpg|thumb|''Vaccinium oxycoccos'' flowers]]
The name, ''cranberry'', derives from the German, ''kraanbere'' (English translation, ''craneberry''), first named as ''cranberry'' in English by the missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] in 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Cranberry (''Vaccinium macrocarpon'') : FAQ |url=https://researchguides.library.wisc.edu/c.php?g=177896&amp;p=1169823 |publisher=Research Guides, University of Wisconsin Libraries, Madison, WI |accessdate=7 December 2017 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1694, German and Dutch [[colonist]]s in [[New England]] used the word, cranberry, to represent the expanding flower, [[Plant stem|stem]], [[calyx (flower)|calyx]], and petals resembling the neck, head, and bill of a [[crane (bird)|crane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Cranberry |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/cranberry |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper |accessdate=7 December 2017 |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aps&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Caruso FL |author2=Bristow PR |author3=Oudemans PV |title=Cranberries: The Most Intriguing Native North American Fruit |journal=Apsnet Feature Articles |url=http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/Cranberries.aspx |accessdate=7 December 2017 |doi=10.1094/APSnetFeature-2000-1100 |date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional English name for the plant more common in Europe, ''Vaccinium oxycoccos'', '''[[:ang:Fenberȝe|fenberry]]''', originated from plants with small red berries found growing in [[fen]] (marsh) lands of England.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

In North America, the [[Narragansett people]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian nation]] in the regions of [[New England]] appeared to be using cranberries in [[pemmican]] for food and for [[dye]].&lt;ref name=aps/&gt; Calling the red berries, ''sasemineash'', the Narragansett people may have introduced cranberries to colonists in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=aps/&gt; In 1550, James White Norwood made reference to Native Americans using cranberries, and it was the first reference to American cranberries up until this point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broussard|first=Melissa|last2=Rao|first2=Sujaya|last3=Stephen|first3=William P.|last4=White|first4=Linda|date=June 2011|title=Native Bees, Honeybees, and Pollination in Oregon Cranberries|journal=HortScience|volume=46|issue=6|pages=885–888|doi=10.21273/hortsci.46.6.885|issn=0018-5345}}&lt;/ref&gt; In James Rosier's book ''The Land of Virginia'' there is an account of Europeans coming ashore and being met with Native Americans bearing bark cups full of cranberries. In Plymouth, Massachusetts, there is a 1633 account of the husband of Mary Ring auctioning her cranberry-dyed petticoat for 16 shillings. In 1643, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]'s book ''[[A Key Into the Language of America]]'' described cranberries, referring to them as &quot;bearberries&quot; because bears ate them. In 1648, preacher John Elliott was quoted in [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Thomas Shepard's]] book ''Clear Sunshine of the Gospel'' with an account of the difficulties the Pilgrims were having in using the Indians to harvest cranberries as they preferred to hunt and fish. In 1663, the Pilgrim cookbook appears with a recipe for cranberry sauce. In 1667, New Englanders sent to [[Charles II of England|King Charles]] ten barrels of cranberries, three barrels of codfish and some Indian corn as a means of appeasement for his anger over their local coining of the [[Pine-tree shilling]]. In 1669, Captain Richard Cobb had a banquet in his house (to celebrate both his marriage to Mary Gorham and his election to the Convention of Assistance), serving wild turkey with sauce made from wild cranberries. In the 1672 book ''New England Rarities Discovered'' author [[John Josselyn]] described cranberries, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sauce for the Pilgrims, cranberry or bearberry, is a small trayling [''[[sic]]''] plant that grows in salt marshes that are overgrown with moss. The berries are of a pale yellow color, afterwards red, as big as a cherry, some perfectly round, others oval, all of them hollow with sower [''sic''] astringent taste; they are ripe in August and September. They are excellent against the Scurvy. They are also good to allay the fervor of hoof diseases. The Indians and English use them mush, boyling [''sic''] them with sugar for sauce to eat with their meat; and it is a delicate sauce, especially with roasted mutton. Some make tarts with them as with gooseberries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Compleat Cook's Guide'', published in 1683, made reference to cranberry juice. In 1703, cranberries were served at the Harvard University commencement dinner. In 1787, [[James Madison]] wrote [[Thomas Jefferson]] in France for background information on constitutional government to use at the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. Jefferson sent back a number of books on the subject and in return asked for a gift of apples, pecans and cranberries. [[William Aiton]], a Scottish botanist, included an entry for the cranberry in volume II of his 1789  work ''[[Hortus Kewensis]]''. He notes that ''[[Vaccinium macrocarpon]]'' (American cranberry) was cultivated by James Gordon in 1760. In 1796, cranberries were served at the first celebration of the landing of the Pilgrims, and Amelia Simmons (an American orphan) wrote a book entitled ''American Cookery'' which contained a recipe for cranberry tarts.

[[American Revolutionary War]] veteran [[Henry Hall (American)|Henry Hall]] first cultivated cranberries in the [[Cape Cod]] town of [[Dennis (CDP), Massachusetts|Dennis]] around 1816.&lt;ref name=aps/&gt; In the 1820s, Hall was shipping cranberries to [[New York City]] and [[Boston]] from which shipments were also sent to Europe.&lt;ref name=aps/&gt; In 1843, [[Eli Howes]] planted his own crop of cranberries on Cape Cod, using the &quot;Howes&quot; variety. In 1847, Cyrus Cahoon planted a crop of &quot;Early Black&quot; variety near Pleasant Lake, Harwich, Massachusetts.

By 1900, {{Convert|21500|acre|ha}} were under cultivation in the New England region.&lt;ref name=aps/&gt; In 2014, the total area of cranberries harvested in the United States was {{convert|40500|acre|ha}}, with Massachusetts as the second largest producer after [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cranberries|url=https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/fruits/cranberries/|publisher=Agricultural Marketing Resource Center, Iowa State University|accessdate=7 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==

=== Geography and bog method ===
[[File:Cranberrys beim Ernten.jpeg|thumb|right|Cranberry harvest in [[New Jersey]]]]
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

Historically, cranberry beds were constructed in wetlands. Today's cranberry beds are constructed in upland areas with a shallow water table. The topsoil is scraped off to form [[dyke (construction)|dykes]] around the bed perimeter. Clean sand is hauled in and spread to a depth of four to eight inches (10 to 20 centimeters). The surface is [[laser level]]ed flat to provide even drainage. Beds are frequently drained with socked tile in addition to the perimeter ditch. In addition to making it possible to hold water, the dykes allow equipment to service the beds without driving on the vines. Irrigation equipment is installed in the bed to provide [[irrigation]] for vine growth and for spring and autumn frost protection.

A common misconception about cranberry production is that the beds remain flooded throughout the year. During the [[growing season]] cranberry beds are not flooded, but are irrigated regularly to maintain soil moisture. Beds are flooded in the autumn to facilitate harvest and again during the winter to protect against low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.umass.edu/cranberry/about/cranberry|title=The Cranberry|last=admin|date=2015-08-07|website=Center for Agriculture, Food and the Environment|access-date=2019-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cold climates like Wisconsin, [[New England]], and eastern Canada, the winter flood typically freezes into ice, while in warmer climates the water remains liquid. When ice forms on the beds, trucks can be driven onto the ice to spread a thin layer of sand to control pests and rejuvenate the vines. Sanding is done every three to five years. Additionally, climate change could prove to be an issue for the cultivation of cranberries in the future. It is possible that, given rising temperatures over the next 50 years, chilling temperatures for harvesting cranberries may be insufficient for the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cranberries.org/sites/default/files/uploads/pdf/Meeting_files/Climate_Change_Walberg_March_2017.pdf|title=Climate Change and Cranberry Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propagation ===
Cranberry vines are propagated by moving vines from an established bed. The vines are spread on the surface of the sand of the new bed and pushed into the sand with a blunt disk. The vines are watered frequently during the first few weeks until roots form and new shoots grow. Beds are given frequent, light application of nitrogen fertilizer during the first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Carolyn J. DeMoranville |author2=Hilary A. Sandler |author3=Frank L.

=== Ripening and harvest ===

[[File:Harvesting cranberries 2.jpg|thumb|Cranberry harvest (wet-picking)]]
Cranberries are harvested in the fall when the fruit takes on its distinctive deep red color. Berries that receive sun turn a deep red when fully ripe, while those that do not fully mature are a pale pink or white color. This is usually in September through the first part of November. To harvest cranberries, the beds are flooded with six to eight inches (15 to 20 centimeters) of water above the vines. A harvester is driven through the beds to remove the fruit from the vines. For the past 50 years, water reel type harvesters have been used. Harvested cranberries float in the water and can be corralled into a corner of the bed and conveyed or pumped from the bed. From the farm, cranberries are taken to receiving stations where they are cleaned, sorted, and stored prior to packaging or processing. While cranberries are harvested when they take on their deep red color, they can also be harvested beforehand when they are still white, which is how white cranberry juice is made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stonebridgefarmevents.com/wet-picking/|title=Wet Picking|website=Stone Bridge Farm|access-date=2019-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yields are lower on beds harvested early and the early flooding tends to damage vines, but not severely. Vines can also be trained through dry picking to help avoid damage in subsequent harvests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.umass.edu/cranberry/pubs/bmp_fruit.html|title=Fresh Fruit Production BMP: Publications UMass Cranberry Station|website=www.umass.edu|access-date=2019-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most cranberries are wet-picked as described above, 5–10% of the US crop is still dry-picked. This entails higher labor costs and lower yield, but dry-picked berries are less bruised and can be sold as fresh fruit instead of having to be immediately frozen or processed. Originally performed with two-handed comb scoops, dry picking is today accomplished by motorized, walk-behind harvesters which must be small enough to traverse beds without damaging the vines.

Cranberries for fresh market are stored in shallow bins or boxes with perforated or slatted bottoms, which deter decay by allowing air to circulate. Because harvest occurs in late autumn, cranberries for fresh market are frequently stored in thick walled barns without mechanical refrigeration. Temperatures are regulated by opening and closing vents in the barn as needed. Cranberries destined for processing are usually frozen in bulk containers shortly after arriving at a receiving station.

Usually cranberries as fruit are cooked into a [[compote]] or [[jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]], known as [[cranberry sauce]]. Such preparations are traditionally served with roast [[Turkey meat|turkey]], as a staple of English Christmas dinners, and Thanksgiving (both [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|in Canada]] and [[Thanksgiving (United States)|in the United States]]). The berry is also used in baking ([[muffin]]s, [[scones]], [[cake]]s and [[breads]]). In baking it is often combined with [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] or [[orange zest]]. Less commonly, cranberries are used to add tartness to savory dishes such as soups and stews.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot; /&gt;

Fresh cranberries can be frozen at home, and will keep up to nine months; they can be used directly in recipes without thawing.&lt;ref name=&quot;uw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.wisc.edu/content.php?pid=87646&amp;sid=652165 |title=The American Cranberry-Basic Information on Cranberries |publisher=Library.wisc.edu |accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive review in 2012 of available research concluded there is no evidence that cranberry juice or cranberry extract as tablets or capsules are effective in preventing [[urinary tract infection]]s (UTIs).&lt;ref name=Jepsen2012&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jepson |first=RG |author2=Williams, G |author3=Craig, JC |title=Cranberries for preventing urinary tract infections |journal=[[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]] |volume=10 |date=2012 |issue=10 |pages=CD001321 |id=CD001321 |pmid=23076891 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001321.pub5 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-31802013000500363 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] reviewed the evidence for one brand of cranberry extract and concluded a [[causality|cause and effect relationship]] had not been established between cranberry consumption and reduced risk of UTIs.&lt;ref name=&quot;efsa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) |title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of a health claim related to CranMax® and reduction of the risk of urinary tract infection by inhibiting the adhesion of certain bacteria in the urinary tract pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/20061 |journal=EFSA Journal |date=May 2014 |volume=12 |issue=5 |id=3657 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One 2017 [[systematic review]] showed that consuming cranberry products reduced the incidence of UTIs in women with ''recurrent'' infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luís|first1=Â|last2=Domingues|first2=F|last3=Pereira|first3=L|title=Can Cranberries Contribute to Reduce the Incidence of Urinary Tract Infections? A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis and Trial Sequential Analysis of Clinical Trials.|journal=Journal of Urology|volume=198|issue=3|pages=614–621|date=10 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2017.03.078|pmid=28288837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review of small clinical studies indicated that consuming cranberry products could reduce the risk of UTIs by 26% in otherwise healthy women, although the authors indicated that larger studies were needed to confirm such an effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fu&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fu | first=Zhuxuan | last2=Liska | first2=DeAnn | last3=Talan | first3=David | last4=Chung | first4=Mei | title=Cranberry Reduces the Risk of Urinary Tract Infection Recurrence in Otherwise Healthy Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal=The Journal of Nutrition  | volume=147 | issue=12 | date=18 October 2017 | issn=0022-3166 | doi=10.3945/jn.117.254961 | pages=2282–2288|pmid=29046404|url=https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/147/12/2282/4727969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the quality of [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]] on the efficacy of consuming cranberry products for preventing or treating UTIs is examined, large variation and uncertainty of effect are seen, resulting from inconsistencies of [[clinical research]] design and inadequate numbers of subjects.&lt;ref name=&quot;liska&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4863270|year=2016|last1=Liska|first1=D.

=== Phytochemicals===
Raw cranberries, cranberry juice and cranberry extracts are a source of [[polyphenol]]s – including [[proanthocyanidin]]s, [[flavonol]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2004.06.001 |title=Flavonoid composition over fruit development and maturation in American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait |year=2004 |last1=Vvedenskaya |first1=Irina O |last2=Vorsa |first2=Nicholi |journal=Plant Science |volume=167 |issue=5 |pages=1043}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quercetin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duthie SJ, Jenkinson AM, Crozier A |title=The effects of cranberry juice consumption on antioxidant status and biomarkers relating to heart disease and cancer in healthy human volunteers |journal=Eur J Nutr |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=113–22 |date=March 2006 |pmid=16032375 |doi=10.1007/s00394-005-0572-9 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zheng W, Wang SY |title=Oxygen radical absorbing capacity of phenolics in blueberries, cranberries, chokeberries, and lingonberries |journal=J Agric Food Chem |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=502–9 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12517117 |doi=10.1021/jf020728u }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[phytochemical]] compounds are being studied [[in vivo]] and [[in vitro]] for possible effects on the cardiovascular system, immune system and cancer.&lt;ref name=Jepsen2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blumberg&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24228191 |pmc=3823508 |year=2013 |last1=Blumberg |first1=JB |title=Cranberries and their bioactive constituents in human health |journal=Advances in Nutrition: An International Review Journal |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=618–32 |last2=Camesano |first2=TA |last3=Cassidy |first3=A |last4=Kris-Etherton |first4=P |last5=Howell |first5=A |last6=Manach |first6=C |last7=Ostertag |first7=LM |last8=Sies |first8=H |last9=Skulas-Ray |first9=A |last10=Vita |first10=JA |doi=10.3945/an.113.004473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mskcc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/cranberry |title=Cranberry |publisher=Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center |location=New York |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no confirmation from human studies that consuming cranberry polyphenols provides anti-cancer, immune, or cardiovascular benefits.&lt;ref name=Jepsen2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=mskcc/&gt; Potential is limited by poor [[bioavailability|absorption]] and rapid excretion.&lt;ref name=blumberg/&gt;

Cranberry juice contains a high [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] non-[[Dialysis (biochemistry)|dializable]] material that is under research for its potential to affect formation of [[Dental plaque|plaque]] by ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' pathogens that cause tooth decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/content/article/115/111780 |title=Blocking tooth decay |author=Miranda Hill |publisher=Webmd.com |date=23 November 2005 |accessdate=13 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koo, H. |author2=Nino de Guzman, P. |author3=Schobel, B.D. |author4=Vacca Smith, A.V. |author5= Bowen W.H. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Influence of Cranberry Juice on Glucan-Mediated Processes Involved in Streptococcus mutans Biofilm Development. |journal=Caries Research |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=20–27 |date=January 2006 |doi=10.1159/000088901|pmid=16352876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cranberry juice components are also being studied for possible effects on [[kidney stone]] formation.&lt;ref name=mskcc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McHarg T, Rodgers A, Charlton K |title=Influence of cranberry juice on the urinary risk factors for calcium oxalate kidney stone formation |journal=BJU Int. |volume=92 |issue=7 |pages=765–8 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14616463 |doi=10.1046/j.1464-410X.2003.04472.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kessler T, Jansen B, Hesse A |title=Effect of blackcurrant-, cranberry- and plum juice consumption on risk factors associated with kidney stone formation |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |volume=56 |issue=10 |pages=1020–3 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12373623 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extract quality ===
Problems may arise with the lack of validation for quantifying of [[A-type proanthocyanidin]]s (PAC) extracted from cranberries. For instance, PAC extract quality and content can be performed using different methods including the [[European Pharmacopoeia]] method, [[liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.03.062|title=Characterisation of genuine and derived cranberry proanthocyanidins by LC–ESI-MS|year=2011|last1=Tarascou|first1=Isabelle|last2=Mazauric|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Meudec|first3=Emmanuelle|last4=Souquet|first4=Jean-Marc|last5=Cunningham|first5=David|last6=Nojeim|first6=Steve|last7=Cheynier|first7=Véronique|last8=Fulcrand|first8=Hélène|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=128|issue=3|pages=802}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a modified [[4-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde]] [[colorimetric]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=20549799|doi=10.1002/jsfa.3966|title=Multi-laboratory validation of a standard method for quantifying proanthocyanidins in cranberry powders|year=2010|last1=Prior|first1=Ronald L|last2=Fan|first2=Ellen|last3=Ji|first3=Hongping|last4=Howell|first4=Amy|last5=Nio|first5=Christian|last6=Payne|first6=Mark J|last7=Reed|first7=Jess|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume=90|issue=9|pages=1473–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in extract analysis can lead to difficulties in assessing the quality of PAC extracts from different cranberry starting material, such as by regional origin, ripeness at time of harvest and post-harvest processing. Assessments show that quality varies greatly from one commercial PAC extract product to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/jf204912u|title=Comprehensive Assessment of the Quality of Commercial Cranberry Products.

=== Possible safety concerns ===
The [[anticoagulant]] effects of [[warfarin]] may be increased by consuming cranberry juice, resulting in [[adverse effect]]s such as increased incidence of bleeding and [[bruising]].&lt;ref name=mskcc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pham DQ, Pham AQ |title=Interaction potential between cranberry juice and warfarin |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=490–4 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17322161 |doi=10.2146/ajhp060370 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other safety concerns from consuming large quantities of cranberry juice or using cranberry supplements include potential for nausea, increasing stomach inflammation, sugar intake or [[kidney stone]] formation.&lt;ref name=mskcc/&gt;

== Marketing and economics ==

===United States===
Cranberry sales in the United States have traditionally been associated with [[public holiday|holidays]] of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]].
[[File:Annual Crops of Cranberries, 1907 to 1935, American Cranberry Exchange.png|thumb|left|Annual U.S. crops of cranberries, 1907 to 1935]]
In the U.S., large-scale cranberry cultivation has been developed as opposed to other countries. American cranberry growers have a long history of cooperative [[marketing]]. As early as 1904, John Gaynor, a [[Wisconsin]] grower, and A.U. Chaney, a fruit broker from [[Des Moines, Iowa]], organized Wisconsin growers into a cooperative called the Wisconsin Cranberry Sales Company to receive a uniform price from buyers. Growers in [[New Jersey]] and [[Massachusetts]] were also organized into cooperatives, creating the National Fruit Exchange that marketed fruit under the [[Eatmor]] [[brand]]. The success of cooperative marketing almost led to its failure. With consistent and high prices, area and production doubled between 1903 and 1917 and prices fell.

With surplus cranberries and changing American households some enterprising growers began [[canning]] cranberries that were below-grade for fresh market. [[Competition]] between canners was fierce because [[profit (accounting)|profits]] were thin. The [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] cooperative was established in 1930 through a merger of three primary processing companies: Ocean Spray Preserving company, Makepeace Preserving Co, and Cranberry Products Co. The new company was called Cranberry Canners, Inc. and used the Ocean Spray label on their products. Since the new company represented over 90% of the market, it would have been illegal (cf. [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]]) had [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]] John Quarles not found an exemption for [[agricultural cooperative]]s. Morris April Brothers were the producers of Eatmor brand cranberry sauce, in Tuckahoe, New Jersey; Morris April Brothers brought an action against Ocean Spray for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and won $200,000 in real damages plus triple damages, in 1958, just in time for the Great Cranberry Scare of 1959.  {{as of|2006}}, about 65% of the North American industry belongs to the Ocean Spray cooperative. (The percentage may be slightly higher in Canada than in the U.S.)

A turning point for the industry occurred on 9 November 1959, when the secretary of the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] [[Arthur S. Flemming]] announced that some of the 1959 crop was tainted with traces of the [[herbicide]] [[aminotriazole]]. The market for cranberries collapsed and growers lost millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;zeldes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dashiell Asher |date=21 September 2011 |url=http://thatsongblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/angry-songs-about-food-vol1-cranberry.html |title=Angry Songs About Food Vol.1 - Cranberry Blues |quote=In 1959 there was a deadly cranberry shortage. Cranberries from all over Oregon and Washington were covered in bad herbicide. Rats definitely died. People may have died. Thanksgiving exploded. Probably. Which of course lead to the creation of Cranberry Blues by Robert Williams and The Groovers! |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the scare taught the industry that they could not be completely dependent on the holiday market for their products: they had to find year-round markets for their fruit. They also had to be exceedingly careful about their use of [[pesticide]]s. After the aminotriazole scare, Ocean Spray reorganized and spent substantial sums on [[product development]]. New products such as cranberry/apple [[juice]] blends were introduced, followed by other juice blends.

A [[Federal Marketing Order]] that is authorized to synchronize supply and demand was approved in 1962. The order has been renewed and modified slightly in subsequent years, but it has allowed for more stable marketing. The market order has been invoked during six crop years: 1962 (12%), 1963 (5%), 1970 (10%), 1971 (12%), 2000 (15%), and 2001 (35%). Even though supply still exceeds demand, there is little will to invoke the Federal Marketing Order out of the realization that any pullback in supply by U.S. growers would easily be filled by Canadian production.

Prices and production increased steadily during the 1980s and 1990s. Prices peaked at about $65.00 per barrel ({{cvt|0.65|$/lb|$/kg|2 |disp=or}})—a cranberry barrel equals {{convert|100|lb|kg |sigfig=3 |disp=or|abbr=off}}. in 1996 then fell to $18.00 per barrel ({{cvt|0.18|$/lb|$/kg|2 |disp=or}}) in 2001. The cause for the precipitous drop was classic oversupply. Production had outpaced consumption leading to substantial inventory in freezers or as concentrate.

Cranberry handlers (processors) include [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]], [[Cliffstar|Cliffstar Corporation]], Northland Cranberries Inc. (Sun Northland LLC), Clement Pappas &amp; Co., and Decas Cranberry Products as well as a number of small handlers and processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Roper TR, Vorsa N |chapter=Cranberry: Botany and Horticulture |editor=Janick J |title=Horticultural Reviews |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=1997 |pages=215–6 |isbn=978-0-471-18907-7 |chapter-url=http://www.pubhort.org/hr/hr21/HR_21_07_00000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cranberry Marketing Committee====
The Cranberry Marketing Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscranberries.com/About/|title=About the Cranberry Marketing Committee|publisher=US Cranberry Marketing Committee|date=2014|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an organization that represents United States cranberry growers in four marketing order districts. The committee was established in 1962 as a Federal Marketing Order to ensure a stable, orderly supply of good quality product. The Cranberry Marketing Committee, based in Wareham, Massachusetts, represents more than 1,100 cranberry growers and 60 cranberry handlers across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and New York ([[Long Island]]). The authority for the actions taken by the Cranberry Marketing Committee is provided in Chapter IX, Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations which is called the Federal Cranberry Marketing Order. The Order is part of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, identifying cranberries as a commodity good that can be regulated by Congress.  The Federal Cranberry Marketing Order has been altered over the years to expand the Cranberry Marketing Committee's ability to develop projects in the United States and around the world. The Cranberry Marketing Committee currently runs promotional programs in the United States, China, India, Mexico, Pan-Europe, and South Korea.

===International trade===
{{as of|2016}}, the [[European Union]] was the largest importer of American cranberries, followed individually by Canada, China, Mexico, and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cranberries: No Longer Just an American Tradition|url=https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/cranberries-no-longer-just-american-tradition|publisher=Foreign Agricultural Service, US Department of Agriculture|accessdate=4 November 2017|date=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013 to 2017, US cranberry exports to China grew exponentially, making China the second largest country importer, reaching $36 million in cranberry products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |title= Beyond Thanksgiving: The Humble Cranberry Takes Root in China |publisher= the Wall Street Journal |location= New York |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/beyond-thanksgiving-the-humble-cranberry-takes-root-in-china-1509793203|author=Jennifer Levitz|date=4 November 2017|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[China–United States trade war]] resulted in many Chinese businesses cutting off ties with their U.S. cranberry suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/10/06/763463639/how-the-trade-war-crushed-a-growing-chinese-market-for-u-s-cranberries|title=How The Trade War Crushed A Growing Chinese Market For U.S. Cranberries|last=Ma|first=Adrian|date=October 6, 2019|work=NPR News|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
