&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Chagas disease''', also known as '''American trypanosomiasis''', is a [[tropical disease|tropical]] [[parasitic disease]] caused by the [[protist]] ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]''.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; It is spread mostly by insects known as [[Triatominae]], or &quot;kissing bugs&quot;.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen [[lymph node]]s, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms.&lt;ref name=Rassi2012&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=((Rassi A Jr)), Rassi A, Marcondes de Rezende J|title=American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease)|journal=Infectious Disease Clinics of North America|date=June 2012|volume=26|issue=2|pages=275–91|pmid=22632639|doi=10.1016/j.idc.2012.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rassi A, Rassi A, Marin-Neto JA |title=Chagas disease |journal=Lancet |volume=375 |issue=9723 |pages=1388–402 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20399979 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60061-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other 30–40% of people develop further symptoms 10–30 years after the initial infection,&lt;ref name=Rassi2012/&gt; including enlargement of the [[ventricles of the heart]] in 20–30%, leading to [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; An [[megaesophagus|enlarged esophagus]] or an [[megacolon|enlarged colon]] may also occur in 10% of people.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis--&gt;
''T. cruzi'' is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] &quot;kissing bugs&quot; of the subfamily [[Triatominae]].&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Centers for Disease Control (CDC) |url=https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/trypanosomiasisAmerican/ |title=DPDx&amp;nbsp;– Trypanosomiasis, American.

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment  --&gt;
Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; This may involve the use of [[insecticides]] or [[bed-nets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevention of Chagas disease|url=http://www.who.int/chagas/disease/prevention/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other preventive efforts include screening blood used for transfusions.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; {{Asof|2017}}, a vaccine has not been developed.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Early infections are treatable with the medication [[benznidazole]] or [[nifurtimox]].&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of end–stage symptoms.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Benznidazole and nifurtimox cause temporary side effects in up to 40% of people&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; including skin disorders, brain toxicity, and digestive system irritation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rassi2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bern&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bern C, Montgomery SP, Herwaldt BL, etal |title=Evaluation and treatment of chagas disease in the United States: a systematic review |journal=JAMA |volume=298 |issue=18 |pages=2171–81 |date=November 2007|pmid=18000201 |doi=10.1001/jama.298.18.2171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rassi2&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rassi A, Dias JC, Marin-Neto JA, Rassi A |title=Challenges and opportunities for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of Chagas' disease |journal=Heart |volume=95|issue=7 |pages=524–34 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19131444 |doi=10.1136/hrt.2008.159624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Chagoma.jpg|thumb|An acute Chagas disease infection with swelling of the right eye (Romaña's sign)]]
[[File:Heart pathology Chagas disease.JPG|thumb|Large scale anatomy of a heart damaged by chronic Chagas disease&amp;nbsp;– see also: [[:Image:Heart radiology Chagas disease.JPG|Chagas heart, radiology]]]]
The human disease occurs in two stages: an [[acute (medicine)|acute]] stage, which occurs shortly after an initial [[infection]], and a [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] stage that develops over many years.

The acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or exhibits only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, swollen eyelids, and vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/chagasdisease.html|title=Chagas Disease|website=medlineplus.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a [[chagoma]]) where the parasite entered the body.&lt;ref name=Guimaraes1968&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Guimarães FN, da Silva NN, Clausell DT, de Mello AL, Rapone T, Snell T, Rodrigues N| title=Um surto epidêmico de doença de Chagas de provável transmissão digestiva, ocorrido em Teutonia (Estrêla&amp;nbsp;– Rio Grande Do Sul) | journal=Hospital (Rio J) | volume=73 | issue=6 | pages=1767–804| year=1968 |pmid= 4976999|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recognized marker of acute Chagas disease is called Romaña's sign, which includes swelling of the eyelids on the side of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/gen_info/detailed.html|title=CDC - Chagas Disease - Detailed Fact Sheet|last=Prevention|first=CDC-Centers for Disease Control and|date=2019-04-16|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely, people may die from the acute disease due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle ([[myocarditis]]) or brain ([[meningoencephalitis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Guimaraes1968&quot;/&gt; The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

If symptoms develop during the acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three to eight weeks in approximately 90% of individuals.&lt;ref name=Rassi2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bern/&gt; Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called ''indeterminate'' chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called ''determinate'' chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.&lt;ref name=Rassi2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bern/&gt;

The symptomatic (determinate) chronic stage affects the [[nervous system]], [[digestive system]] and [[Human heart|heart]]. About two-thirds of people with chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including [[dilated cardiomyopathy]], which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the [[digestive tract]] ([[megacolon]] and [[megaesophagus]]), accompanied by severe [[weight loss]]. [[Swallowing]] difficulties (secondary [[achalasia]]) may be the first symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name=emed&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/214581-overview |title=Chagas Disease (American Trypanosomiasis) |author=Louis V Kirchhoff |date=17 December 2010 |publisher=eMedicine |accessdate=12 May 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317174758/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/214581-overview |archivedate=17 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

20–50% of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt; Up to 10% of chronically infected individuals develop [[neuritis]] that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment. Isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement, including [[dementia]], confusion, chronic [[encephalopathy]] and [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory]] and [[Motor skill|motor]] deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Córdova E, Maiolo E, Corti M, Orduña T |title=Neurological manifestations of Chagas' disease |journal=Neurol. Res. |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=238–44 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20406601 |doi=10.1179/016164110X12644252260637 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical manifestations of Chagas disease are due to cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an [[inflammatory response]], cellular [[lesions]], and [[fibrosis]]. For example, intracellular [[amastigote]]s destroy the intramural neurons of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart [[aneurysm]]s, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease can be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;

==Transmission==
[[File:Rhodnius prolixus70-300.jpg|thumb|''[[Rhodnius prolixus]]'' is the principal vector in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], and some parts of [[Nicaragua]] and [[El Salvador]]]]

===Main methods===
In Chagas-endemic areas, the main mode of transmission is through an insect [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] called a [[Triatominae|triatomine]] bug.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; A triatomine becomes infected with ''T. cruzi'' by feeding on the blood of an infected person or animal. During the day, triatomines hide in crevices in the walls and roofs.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

The bugs emerge at night, when the inhabitants are sleeping. Because they tend to feed on people's faces, triatomine bugs are also known as &quot;kissing bugs&quot;. After they bite and ingest blood, they defecate on the person. Triatomines pass ''T. cruzi'' parasites (called [[trypomastigote]]s) in feces left near the site of the bite wound.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

Scratching the site of the bite causes the trypomastigotes to enter the host through the wound, or through intact [[mucous membranes]], such as the [[conjunctiva]]. Once inside the host, the trypomastigotes invade cells, where they differentiate into intracellular [[amastigote]]s. The amastigotes multiply by [[binary fission]] and differentiate into trypomastigotes, which are then released into the bloodstream. This cycle is repeated in each newly infected cell. Replication resumes only when the parasites enter another cell or are ingested by another vector.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; (See also: [[:Image:Trypanosoma cruzi LifeCycle.gif|Life cycle and transmission of ''T. cruzi'']])

Dense vegetation (such as that of tropical [[rainforest]]s) and urban habitats are not ideal for the establishment of the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the [[sylvatic]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly [[deforestation|deforested]] areas, [[piassava palm]] culture areas, and some parts of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teixeira AR, Monteiro PS, Rebelo JM |title=Emerging Chagas disease: trophic network and cycle of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi from palm trees in the Amazon |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=100–12 |year=2001 |pmid=11266300 |doi=10.3201/eid0701.010115 |pmc=2631687 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other methods===
{{update-section|date=February 2020}}
''T. cruzi'' can also be transmitted through [[blood transfusions]]. With the exception of blood derivatives (such as fractionated [[Antibody|antibodies]]), all blood components are infective. The parasite remains viable at 4&amp;nbsp;°C for at least 18 days or up to 250 days when kept at room temperature. As of 2010 it was unclear whether ''T. cruzi'' can be transmitted through frozen-thawed blood components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wendel S |title=Transfusion transmitted Chagas disease: Is it really under control? |journal=Acta Trop |volume= 115|issue= 1–2|pages= 28–34|date=January 2010 |pmid=20044970 |doi=10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modes of transmission include [[organ transplant]]ation, through [[breast milk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Santos Ferreira C, Amato Neto V, Gakiya E, Bezerra RC, Alarcón RS |title=Microwave treatment of human milk to prevent transmission of Chagas disease |journal=[[Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de São Paulo]] |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=41–2 |year=2003 |pmid=12751321 |doi=10.1590/S0036-46652003000100008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by accidental laboratory exposure. 

Chagas disease can also spread congenitally from a pregnant woman to her baby through the [[placenta]], and As of 1984 accounted for approximately 13% of stillborn deaths in parts of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hudson L, Turner MJ |title=Immunological consequences of infection and vaccination in South American trypanosomiasis [and discussion] |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=307 |issue=1131 |pages=51–61 |date=November 1984 |pmid=6151688 |jstor=2990154 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1984.0108|bibcode = 1984RSPTB.307...51H }} Retrieved 22 February 2007 through [[JSTOR]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of ''T. cruzi'' is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It can be detected by [[microscope|microscopic]] examination of fresh anti[[coagulate]]d blood, or its [[buffy coat]], for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with [[Giemsa stain|Giemsa]], for direct visualization of [[parasitism|parasites]]. Microscopically, ''T. cruzi'' can be confused with ''[[Trypanosoma rangeli]]'', which is not known to be [[pathogen]]ic in humans. Isolation of ''T. cruzi'' can occur by inoculation into [[mouse|mice]], by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by [[xenodiagnosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Brumpt E| title=Le xénodiagnostic.

[[Blood transfusion]] was formerly the second-most common mode of transmission for Chagas disease, but the development and implementation of [[blood bank]] screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century.

==Management==
There are two approaches to treating Chagas disease: [[antiparasitic]] treatment, to kill the parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the [[parasympathetic nervous system]]. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.

===Medication===
{{update-section|date=February 2020}}
Antiparasitic treatment is most effective early in the course of infection, but is not limited to cases in the acute phase. As of 2005, drugs of choice included [[azole]] or [[Nitro compound|nitro]] derivatives, such as [[benznidazole]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Garcia S, Ramos CO, Senra JF |title=Treatment with Benznidazole during the Chronic Phase of Experimental Chagas' Disease Decreases Cardiac Alterations |journal=[[Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|Antimicrob Agents Chemother]] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=1521–8 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15793134 |pmc=1068607 |doi=10.1128/AAC.49.4.1521-1528.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[nifurtimox]]. Both agents are limited in their capacity to completely eliminate ''T. cruzi'' from the body (parasitologic cure), especially in chronically infected patients, as of 1998, resistance to these drugs has been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckner FS, Wilson AJ, White TC, Van Voorhis WC |title=Induction of Resistance to Azole Drugs in ''Trypanosoma cruzi'' |journal=Antimicrob Agents Chemother |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=3245–50 |date=December 1998 |pmid=9835521 |pmc=106029 |doi=10.1128/AAC.42.12.3245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, studies suggested that antiparasitic treatment leads to parasitological cure in more than 90% of infants, but only about 60–85% of adults treated in the first year of acute phase Chagas disease. Children aged six to 12 years with chronic disease had a cure rate of about 60% with benznidazole. While the rate of cure declines the longer an adult has been infected with Chagas, as of 2010 treatment with benznidazole has been shown to slow the onset of heart disease in adults with chronic Chagas infections.&lt;ref name=Rassi2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;

As of 2010, treatment of chronic infection in women prior to or during pregnancy did not appear to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it was unclear whether [[prophylactic]] treatment of chronic infection would be beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression for example, organ transplant recipients or in persons who are already immunosuppressed for example, those with HIV infection.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;

===Complications===
In the chronic stage, treatment involves managing the clinical manifestations of the disease. For example, [[pacemaker]]s and medications for irregular heartbeats, such as the anti-arrhythmia drug [[amiodarone]], may be life saving for some patients with chronic cardiac disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dubner S, Schapachnik E, Riera AR, Valero E |title=Chagas disease: state-of-the-art of diagnosis and management |journal=Cardiol J |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=493–504 |year=2008 |pmid=19039752}}&lt;/ref&gt; while surgery may be required for megaintestine. The disease cannot be cured in this phase, however. Chronic heart disease caused by Chagas disease is now a common reason for [[heart transplantation]] surgery. Until recently, however, Chagas disease was considered a [[contraindication]] for the procedure, since the heart damage could recur as the parasite was expected to seize the opportunity provided by the [[immunosuppression]] that follows surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bocchi EA, Bellotti G, Mocelin AO |title=Heart transplantation for chronic Chagas' heart disease |journal=Ann Thorac Surg |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1727–33 |date=June 1996 |pmid=8651775 |doi=10.1016/0003-4975(96)00141-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
{{update-section|date=February 2020}}
[[File:Distribution of Chagas' disease.svg|thumb|350px|Chagas disease in Latin America ([[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] zones)]]
Chagas disease has a serious economic impact; As of 2013, the global cost was estimated at $7 billion.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bruce Y Lee |author2=Kristina M Bacon |author3=Maria Elena Bottazzi |author4=Peter J Hotez |title=Global economic burden of Chagas disease: a computational simulation model|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|date=April 2013|volume=13|issue=4|pages=342–348|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(13)70002-1|pmc=3763184 |pmid=23395248}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2010, Chagas disease affected 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;million people living in endemic Latin American countries, with an additional 300,000–400,000 living in nonendemic countries, including Spain and the United States. As of 2010, an estimated 41,200 new cases occurred annually in endemic countries, and 14,400 infants are born with congenital Chagas disease annually.&lt;ref name=Rassi2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=emed/&gt; in 2010 it resulted in approximately 10,300 deaths up from 9,300 in 1990.&lt;ref name=Loz2012&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lozano R|title=Global and regional mortality from 235 causes of death for 20 age groups in 1990 and 2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010|journal=Lancet|date=15 December 2012|volume=380|issue=9859|pages=2095–128|pmid=23245604|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61728-0|hdl=10536/DRO/DU:30050819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the disease occurred in 18 countries on the American continents, ranging from the southern United States to northern [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;/&gt; Chagas exists in two different ecological zones: In the [[Southern Cone]] region, the main vector lives in and around human homes. In Central America and Mexico, the main vector species lives both inside dwellings and in uninhabited areas. In both zones, Chagas occurs almost exclusively in rural areas, where triatomines breed and feed on the more than 150 species from 24 families of domestic and wild mammals, as well as humans, that are the [[natural reservoir]]s of ''T. cruzi''.&lt;ref name=NatRev&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morel CM, Lazdins J |title=Chagas disease |journal=Nat Rev Microbiol |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=14–5 |date=October 2003 |pmid=15040175 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds appear to be immune to infection and therefore are not considered to be a ''T. cruzi'' reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals that are part of the ancient, [[sylvatic]] (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human habitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author = Pinto-Dias JC | year = 1992 | title = Epidemiology of Chagas disease | conference = ISBT Brazil '92.

Chronic Chagas disease remains a major health problem in many Latin American countries, despite the effectiveness of hygienic and preventive measures, such as eliminating the transmitting insects. However, several landmarks have been achieved in the fight against it in Latin America, including a reduction by 72% of the incidence of human infection in children and young adults in the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] Initiative, and at least three countries ([[Uruguay]], in 1997, and [[Chile]], in 1999, and Brazil in 2006) have been certified free of vectorial and transfusional transmission.&lt;ref name=emed/&gt;&lt;ref name=TDR1&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.who.int/tdrold/publications/tdrnews/news65/chagas.htm |title=The Southern Cone Initiative: an update |work=Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) |publisher=WHO |year=2004 |accessdate=29 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922232932/http://www.who.int/tdrold/publications/tdrnews/news65/chagas.htm |archivedate=22 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18053273&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Massad E |title=The elimination of Chagas' disease from Brazil |journal=Epidemiol Infect |volume=136 |issue=9 |pages=1153–64 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18053273 |doi=10.1017/S0950268807009879 |pmc=2870925}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina, vectorial transmission has been interrupted in 13 of the 19 endemic provinces,&lt;ref name= TDR1/&gt; and major progress toward this goal has also been made in both Paraguay and Bolivia.

As of 2009, screening of donated blood, blood components, and solid organ donors, as well as donors of cells, tissues, and cell and tissue products for ''T. cruzi'' was mandated in all Chagas-endemic countries and has been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Castro E |title=Chagas' disease: lessons from routine donation testing |journal=Transfus Med |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=16–23 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19302451 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3148.2009.00915.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===In the United States===
As of 2008, about 300,000 infected people were living in the United States, which is likely the result of immigration from Latin American countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=National Institutes of Health | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001372.htm | title=Medical Encyclopedia: Chagas disease | accessdate=11 September 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001205422/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001372.htm | archivedate=1 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of 2020, locally acquired Chagas disease in the US has been exceedingly rare, however. Only 28 autochthonous infections were documented from 1955 to 2015. In 2017, the first documented [[autochthonous]] case of Chagas disease in [[Missouri]] occurred, as a blood donation screened positive for antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmwr&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turabelidze |first=George |date=2020 |title=Autochthonous Chagas Disease — Missouri, 2018 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6907a4.htm |journal=MMWR.

The earliest detection of a ''T. cruzi'' infection comes from a 9000-year-old Chinchorro mummy. Other exhumed mummies in the Andean region as well as pre-Columbian Peruvian ceramics shed light on the existence of Chagas Disease and have provided anthropologists reasons for how  and why the illness spread.&lt;ref name = &quot;Steverding_2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steverding D | title = The history of Chagas disease | journal = Parasites &amp; Vectors | volume = 7 | pages = 317 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25011546 | pmc = 4105117 | doi = 10.1186/1756-3305-7-317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1707, the Portuguese physician,  Miguel Dial Pimenta, was the first individual to provide a clinical report relating to the possible intestinal symptoms of Chagas Disease.&lt;ref name = &quot;Steverding_2014&quot; /&gt;

The disease was named after the [[Brazil]]ian physician and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Carlos Chagas]], who first described it in 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chagas_1909&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chagas C | title=Neue Trypanosomen |journal=Vorläufige Mitteilung Arch Schiff Tropenhyg |year=1909 |volume=13 |pages = 120–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Redhead_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redhead SA, Cushion MT, Frenkel JK, Stringer JR |title=''Pneumocystis'' and ''Trypanosoma cruzi'': nomenclature and typifications |journal=J Eukaryot Microbiol |year=2006 |pages=2–11 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pmid=16441572 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.2005.00072.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chagas_1909b&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chagas C |title=Nova tripanozomiase humana: Estudos sobre a morfolojia e o ciclo evolutivo do Schizotrypanum cruzi n. gen., n. sp., ajente etiolojico de nova entidade morbida do homem [New human trypanosomiasis.

Dr Chagas discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now [[Reduviidae]]: [[Triatominae]]) harbored a [[flagellate]] protozoan, a new species of the genus ''[[Trypanosoma]]'', and was able to demonstrate experimentally that it could be transmitted to [[marmoset]] monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed [[squirrel monkey]]s were also vulnerable to infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hulsebos_1989&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hulsebos LH, Choromanski L, Kuhn RE |title=The effect of interleukin-2 on parasitemia and myocarditis in experimental Chagas' disease |journal=J Protozool |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=293–8 |year=1989 |pmid=2499678 |doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1989.tb05366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chagas named the pathogenic parasite as ''Trypanosoma cruzi''&lt;ref name=Chagas_1909 /&gt; and later that year as ''Schizotrypanum cruzi'',&lt;ref name=Chagas_1909b /&gt; both honoring [[Oswaldo Cruz]], the noted Brazilian physician and [[epidemiologist]] who successfully fought epidemics of [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], and [[bubonic plague]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and other cities in the beginning of the 20th century. Chagas was also the first to unknowingly discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus ''[[Pneumocystis pneumonia|Pneumocystis]]'', later infamously linked to PCP (''Pneumocystis'' [[pneumonia]] in AIDS victims).&lt;ref name=Redhead_2006 /&gt; Confusion between the two pathogens' life-cycles led him to briefly recognize his genus ''Schizotrypanum'', but following the description of ''Pneumocystis'' by others as an independent genus, Chagas returned to the use of the name ''Trypanosoma cruzi''.

In [[Argentina]], the disease is known as ''mal de Chagas-Mazza'', in honor of [[Salvador Mazza]], the [[Argentina|Argentine]] physician who in 1926 began investigating the disease and over the years became the principal researcher of this disease in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drwebsa.com.ar/alcha/hist4.htm |publisher=Asociación Lucha Contra el Mal de Chagas |title=Enfermedad de Chagas&amp;nbsp;– Mazza |language=Spanish |accessdate=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916130857/http://www.drwebsa.com.ar/alcha/hist4.htm |archivedate=16 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mazza produced the first scientific confirmation of the existence of ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in Argentina in 1927, eventually leading to support from local and European medical schools and Argentine government policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |title=Historia de la enfermedad de Chagas |language=Spanish|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204113113/http://www.fac.org.ar/fec/chagas/fatala/historia.htm |archivedate=4 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesized that [[Charles Darwin]] might have suffered from Chagas disease as a result of a bite of the so-called great black bug of the [[Pampas]] (''vinchuca'') (see [[Charles Darwin's illness]]). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of [[the Voyage of the Beagle]] as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the [[Andes]] near [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. Darwin was young and generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near [[Valparaiso]], but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of [[symptom]]s, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at [[Westminster Abbey]] by using modern [[PCR]] techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's [[curator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adler D |title=Darwin's Illness |journal=Isr J Med Sci |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=218–21 |year=1989 |pmid=2496051}}&lt;/ref&gt;
