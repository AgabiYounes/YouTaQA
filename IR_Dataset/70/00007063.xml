A '''catapult''' is a [[ballistics|ballistic]] device used to launch a [[projectile]] a great distance without the aid of [[gunpowder]] or other [[propellant]]s – particularly various types of ancient and medieval [[siege engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The art of the catapult: build Greek ballista, Roman onagers, English trebuchets, and more ancient artillery|last= Gurstelle|first= William|authorlink= William Gurstelle|year= 2004|publisher= Chicago Review Press|location= Chicago|isbn= 978-1-55652-526-1|oclc= 54529037|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/artofcatapult00will}}&lt;/ref&gt; A catapult uses the sudden release of stored [[potential energy]] to propel its payload. Most convert [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] or [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] energy that was more slowly and manually built up within the device before release, via springs, bows, twisted rope, elastic, or any of numerous other materials and mechanisms. The [[counterweight trebuchet]] is a type of catapult that uses gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Catapult Physics |url=https://www.real-world-physics-problems.com/catapult-physics.html |website=Real World Physics Problems |accessdate=29 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In use since ancient times, the catapult has proven to be one of the most persistently effective mechanisms in warfare. In modern times the term can apply to devices ranging from a simple hand-held implement (also called a &quot;[[slingshot]]&quot;) to a mechanism for [[Aircraft catapult|launching aircraft from a ship]].

The earliest catapults date to at least the 4th century BC with the advent of the [[mangonel]] in [[ancient China]], a type of [[trebuchet|traction trebuchet]] and catapult.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chevedden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trebuchet/&gt; Early uses were also attributed to [[Ajatashatru]] of [[Magadha]] in his war against the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|author=Singh, U.|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9788131711200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC|page=272|accessdate=October 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703065417/http://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC|archivedate=July 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Greek catapults emerged around the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name = &quot;Duncan Campbell, p.3&quot;/&gt;

The catapult and [[crossbow]] in Greece are closely intertwined. Primitive catapults were essentially &quot;the product of relatively straightforward attempts to increase the range and penetrating power of missiles by strengthening the bow which propelled them&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barton C. Hacker&quot; /&gt; The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC), described the invention of a mechanical arrow-firing catapult (''katapeltikon'') by a Greek task force in 399&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diod.

The introduction of crossbows however, can be dated further back: according to the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] (fl. 1st century AD), who referred to the now lost works of the 3rd-century BC engineer [[Ctesibius]], this weapon was inspired by an earlier foot-held crossbow, called the ''[[gastraphetes]]'', which could store more energy than the Greek bows.

Philo of Byzantium provides probably the most detailed account on the establishment of a theory of belopoietics (''belos'' = &quot;projectile&quot;; ''poietike'' = &quot;(art) of making&quot;) circa 200&amp;nbsp;BC. The central principle to this theory was that &quot;all parts of a catapult, including the weight or length of the projectile, were proportional to the size of the torsion springs&quot;. This kind of innovation is indicative of the increasing rate at which geometry and physics were being assimilated into military enterprises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serafina Cuomo&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed | date = December 2013}}

From the mid-4th century BC onwards, evidence of the Greek use of arrow-shooting machines becomes more dense and varied: arrow firing machines (''katapaltai'') are briefly mentioned by [[Aeneas Tacticus]] in his treatise on siegecraft written around 350&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8&quot;/&gt; An extant inscription from the [[Athens|Athenian]] arsenal, dated between 338 and 326&amp;nbsp;BC, lists a number of stored catapults with shooting bolts of varying size and springs of sinews.&lt;ref name = &quot;Eric William Marsden, p.57&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb | Marsden | 1969 | p = 57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The later entry is particularly noteworthy as it constitutes the first clear evidence for the switch to [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] catapults, which are more powerful than the more-flexible crossbows and which came to dominate Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] artillery design thereafter.&lt;ref name = &quot;Duncan Campbell, p.8ff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | pp = 8ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This move to torsion springs was likely spurred by the engineers of Philip II of Macedonia.&lt;ref name= &quot;Serafina Cuomo&quot;/&gt;{{Page needed | date = December 2013}} Another Athenian inventory from 330 to 329&amp;nbsp;BC includes catapult bolts with heads and flights.&lt;ref name = &quot;Eric William Marsden, p.57&quot; /&gt; As the use of catapults became more commonplace, so did the training required to operate them. Many Greek children were instructed in catapult usage, as evidenced by &quot;a 3rd Century B.C. inscription from the island of Ceos in the Cyclades [regulating] catapult shooting competitions for the young&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serafina Cuomo&quot;/&gt; Arrow firing machines in action are reported from [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]'s siege of [[Perinth]] ([[Thrace]]) in 340&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eric William Marsden, p.60&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb | Marsden | 1969 | p = 60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Greek fortifications began to feature high towers with shuttered windows in the top, which could have been used to house anti-personnel arrow shooters, as in [[Aigosthena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Josiah | last = Ober | title = Early Artillery Towers: Messenia, Boiotia, Attica, Megarid | journal = American Journal of Archaeology | volume = 91 | number = 4 | year = 1987 | pages = 569–604 (569) | doi=10.2307/505291}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Projectiles included both arrows and (later) stones that were sometimes lit on fire.

The Romans started to use catapults as arms for their wars against [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Macedon, Sparta and Aetolia (3rd and 2nd centuries BC).

[[Castle]]s and fortified [[walled cities]] were common during this period and catapults were used as [[siege weapon]]s against them. As well as their use in attempts to breach walls, [[Early thermal weapons|incendiary missiles]], or diseased carcasses or garbage could be catapulted over the walls.

Defensive techniques in the Middle Ages progressed to a point that rendered catapults largely ineffective. The [[Siege of Paris (885–886)|Viking siege of Paris]] (885–6&amp;nbsp;A.D.) &quot;saw the employment by both sides of virtually every instrument of siege craft known to the classical world, including a variety of catapults&quot;, to little effect, resulting in failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton C. Hacker&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Hacker | first = Barton C | jstor = 3102042 | title = Greek Catapults and Catapult Technology: Science, Technology, and War in Ancient World}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely used catapults throughout the Middle Ages were as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;Middle Ages&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm | title = Middle ages | contribution = Catapults | place = United Kingdom | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100924235615/http://middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm | archivedate = 2010-09-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Ballista]]: Ballistae were similar to giant crossbows and were designed to work through torsion. The projectiles were large arrows or darts made from wood with an iron tip. These arrows were then shot &quot;along a flat trajectory&quot; at a target. Ballistae were accurate, but lacked firepower compared with that of a mangonel or trebuchet. Because of their immobility, most ballistae were constructed on site following a siege assessment by the commanding military officer.&lt;ref name = &quot;Middle Ages&quot; /&gt;
:
; [[Springald]]: The springald's design resembles that of the ballista, being a crossbow powered by tension. The springald's frame was more compact, allowing for use inside tighter confines, such as the inside of a castle or tower, but compromising its power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Middle Ages&quot; /&gt;
:
; [[Mangonel]]: This machine was designed to throw heavy projectiles from a &quot;bowl-shaped bucket at the end of its arm&quot;. Mangonels were mostly used for “firing various missiles at fortresses, castles, and cities,” with a range of up to 1300 feet. These missiles included anything from stones to excrement to rotting carcasses. Mangonels were relatively simple to construct, and eventually wheels were added to increase mobility.&lt;ref name = &quot;Middle Ages&quot; /&gt;
:
; [[Onager (siege weapon)|Onager]]: Mangonels are also sometimes referred to as Onagers. Onager catapults initially launched projectiles from a sling, which was later changed to a &quot;bowl-shaped bucket&quot;. The word ''Onager'' is derived from the Greek word ''onagros'' for &quot;wild ass&quot;, referring to the &quot;kicking motion and force&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Middle Ages&quot;/&gt; that were recreated in the Mangonel's design. Historical records regarding onagers are scarce. The most detailed account of Mangonel use is from “Eric Marsden's translation of a text written by Ammianus Marcellius in the 4th Century AD” describing its construction and combat usage.&lt;ref name=&quot;catapults.info&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.catapults.info/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601094938/http://www.catapults.info/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-06-01 |title=Catapults info }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:
; [[Trebuchet]]: [[File:MongolsBesiegingACityInTheMiddleEast13thCentury.jpg|thumb|left|Mongol warriors using trebuchet to besiege a city]] Trebuchets were probably the most powerful catapult employed in the Middle Ages. The most commonly used ammunition were stones, but &quot;darts and sharp wooden poles&quot; could be substituted if necessary. The most effective kind of ammunition though involved fire, such as &quot;firebrands, and deadly [[Greek Fire]]&quot;. Trebuchets came in two different designs: Traction, which were powered by people, or Counterpoise, where the people were replaced with &quot;a weight on the short end&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Middle Ages&quot;/&gt;  The most famous historical account of trebuchet use dates back to the siege of [[Stirling Castle]] in 1304, when the army of Edward I constructed a giant trebuchet known as [[Warwolf]], which then proceeded to &quot;level a section of [castle] wall, successfully concluding the siege&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;catapults.info&quot; /&gt;

:
; Leonardo da Vinci's catapult: [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought to improve the efficiency and range of earlier designs. His design incorporated a large wooden [[leaf spring]] as an [[:wikt:accumulator|accumulator]] to power the catapult.{{citation needed |date=February 2011}} Both ends of the bow are connected by a rope, similar to the design of a [[bow and arrow]]. The leaf spring was not used to pull the catapult armature directly, rather the rope was wound around a drum. The catapult armature was attached to this drum which would be turned until enough potential energy was stored in the deformation of the spring. The drum would then be disengaged from the winding mechanism, and the catapult arm would snap around.{{citation needed | date = February 2011}} Though no records exist of this design being built during Leonardo's lifetime, contemporary enthusiasts have reconstructed it.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

[[File:French grenade catapult.jpg|left|thumb|200px|French troops using a catapult to throw [[hand grenade]]s and other explosives during [[World War I]]]]
The last large scale military use of catapults was during the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. During the early stages of the war, catapults were used to throw [[hand grenade]]s across [[no man's land]] into enemy trenches. They were eventually replaced by small [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].

In the 1840s the invention of [[vulcanized]] [[natural rubber|rubber]] allowed the making of small hand-held catapults, either improvised from Y-shaped sticks or manufactured for sale; both were popular with children and teenagers. These devices were also known as [[slingshots]] in the USA.

Special variants called [[aircraft catapult]]s are used to launch planes from land bases and sea carriers when the takeoff runway is too short for a powered takeoff or simply impractical to extend. Ships also use them to launch torpedoes and deploy bombs against submarines.{{dubious|date=June 2016}} Small catapults, referred to as &quot;traps&quot;, are still widely used to launch [[clay target]]s into the air in the sport of [[clay pigeon shooting]].

=== Entertainment ===
In the 1990s and into the early 2000s, a powerful catapult, a trebuchet, was used by thrill-seekers first on private property and in 2001-2002 at Middlemoor Water Park, Somerset, England to experience being catapulted through the air for {{convert|100|ft|m|sp=us}}. The practice has been discontinued due a fatality at the Water Park. There had been an injury when the trebuchet was in use on private property. Injury and death occurred when those two participants failed to land onto the safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2004/02/oxford-university-dangerous-sports-club |title=Scandal: Extreme Oxford Sports |last=Martin |first=Brett |date=August 5, 2013 |journal=Vanity Fair |accessdate=November 13, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531102033/http://www.vanityfair.com/style/2004/02/oxford-university-dangerous-sports-club |archivedate=May 31, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operators of the trebuchet were tried, but found not guilty of manslaughter, though the jury noted that the fatality might have been avoided had the operators &quot;imposed stricter safety measures.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/31/highereducation.uk4 |title=Inquest told of student catapult death |newspaper=The Guardian |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=December 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114133709/http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/oct/31/highereducation.uk4 |archivedate=January 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/oxfordshire/4401024.stm |title=BBC NEWS UK England Oxfordshire - Safety doubts over catapult death |date=November 2, 2005 |accessdate=December 8, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211151741/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/oxfordshire/4401024.stm |archivedate=December 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human cannonball]] [[circus]] acts use a catapult launch mechanism, rather than gunpowder, and are risky ventures for the human cannonballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_069.html|title=The Straight Dope: How do &quot;human cannonballs&quot; survive?|last=Adams|first=Cecil|date=1991-06-21|website=Straight Dope|publisher=Chicago Reader|accessdate=November 13, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106071839/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a4_069.html|archivedate=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[launched roller coaster]]s used a catapult system powered by a diesel engine or a dropped weight to acquire their momentum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzZHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|title=Coasters 101: An Engineer's Guide to Roller Coaster Design|last=Weisenberger|first=Nick|year=2013|isbn=9781468013559|pages=49–50|oclc=927712635|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223060540/https://books.google.com/books?id=OzZHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|archivedate=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Shuttle Loop]] installations between 1977-1978. The catapult system for roller coasters has been replaced by [[flywheel]]s and later [[linear motor]]s.

''[[Pumpkin chunking]]'' is another widely popularized use, in which people compete to see who can launch a pumpkin the farthest by mechanical means (although the world record is held by a pneumatic air cannon).
