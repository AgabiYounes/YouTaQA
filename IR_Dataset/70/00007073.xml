It has a [[latency (engineering)|latency]] of about 100 milliseconds because it is much closer to Earth than standard [[geostationary satellite]]s, whose latencies can be over 600 milliseconds. Although the initial launch consisted of 4 satellites, as many as 20 may be launched eventually to serve various areas with little or no optical fibre service, the first of which is the Cook Islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amos&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Amos|first=Jonathan|title=Lift-off for O3b satellite network|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23028083|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
