&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Chlamydia''', or more specifically a '''chlamydia infection''', is a [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] caused by the bacterium ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]''.&lt;ref name=CDCStats2015/&gt; Most people who are infected have no symptoms.&lt;ref name=CDCFact2016/&gt; When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur.&lt;ref name=CDCFact2016/&gt; Symptoms in women may include [[vaginal discharge]] or [[burning with urination]].&lt;ref name=CDCFact2016/&gt; Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or [[epididymitis|pain and swelling of one or both testicles]].&lt;ref name=CDCFact2016/&gt; The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women, causing [[pelvic inflammatory disease]], which may result in future [[infertility]] or [[ectopic pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=2015 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/chlamydia.htm |publisher=CDC |accessdate=10 June 2016|date=June 4, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611072758/http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/chlamydia.htm|archivedate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated infections of the eyes that go without treatment can result in [[trachoma]], a common cause of [[blindness]] in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2009Eye&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = CDC - Trachoma, Hygiene-related Diseases, Healthy Water | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  | url = https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/disease/trachoma.html | accessdate = 2015-07-24 | date = December 28, 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905105656/http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/disease/trachoma.html | archivedate = September 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Chlamydia can be spread during [[vaginal intercourse|vaginal]], [[anal sex|anal]], or [[oral sex]], and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDCFact2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Chlamydia - CDC Fact Sheet |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/stdfact-chlamydia.htm |publisher=CDC |access-date=10 June 2016|date=May 19, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611024217/http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/stdfact-chlamydia.htm|archivedate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eye infections may also be spread by personal contact, flies, and contaminated towels in areas with poor [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=CDC2009Eye/&gt; ''Chlamydia trachomatis'' only occurs in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graeter|first1=Linda|title=Elsevier's Medical Laboratory Science Examination Review|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323292412|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uc9sBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910235426/https://books.google.com/books?id=Uc9sBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30|archivedate=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis is often by [[screening test|screening]] which is recommended yearly in sexually active women under the age of twenty-five, others at higher risk, and at the first [[prenatal visit]].&lt;ref name=CDCFact2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt; Testing can be done on the urine or a swab of the cervix, vagina, or [[urethra]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt; Rectal or mouth swabs are required to diagnose infections in those areas.&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Prevention is by [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]], the use of [[condom]]s, or having sex with only one other person, who is not infected.&lt;ref name=CDCFact2016/&gt; Chlamydia can be cured by [[antibiotic]]s with typically either [[azithromycin]] or [[doxycycline]] being used.&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt; [[Erythromycin]] or azithromycin is recommended in babies and during [[pregnancy]].&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt; Sexual partners should also be treated and the infected people advised not to have sex for seven days and until symptom free.&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt; [[Gonorrhea]], [[syphilis]], and [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] should be tested for in those who have been infected.&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt; Following treatment people should be tested again after three months.&lt;ref name=CDC2015/&gt;

====Women====
Chlamydial infection of the [[cervix]] (neck of the womb) is a sexually transmitted infection which has [[asymptomatic|no symptoms]] for 50&amp;ndash;70% of women infected. The infection can be passed through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Of those who have an asymptomatic infection that is not detected by their doctor, approximately half will develop [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID), a generic term for infection of the [[uterus]], [[fallopian tubes]], and/or [[ovaries]]. PID can cause scarring inside the [[reproductive organ]]s, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic [[pelvis|pelvic]] pain, difficulty becoming [[pregnancy|pregnant]], [[ectopic pregnancy|ectopic (tubal) pregnancy]], and other dangerous complications of pregnancy.

Chlamydia is known as the &quot;silent epidemic&quot;, as in women it may not cause any [[symptom]]s in 70–80% of cases,&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS Chlamydia page&quot;&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Chlamydia/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS Chlamydia page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116082623/http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Chlamydia/Pages/Introduction.aspx |date=2013-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can linger for months or years before being discovered. Signs and symptoms may include abnormal [[vaginal bleeding]] or discharge, abdominal pain, [[Dyspareunia|painful sexual intercourse]], [[fever]], [[Dysuria|painful urination]] or the urge to urinate more often than usual ([[urinary urgency]]).

For sexually active women who are not pregnant, screening is recommended in those under 25 and others at risk of infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meyers D, Wolff T, Gregory K | year = 2008 | title = USPSTF Recommendations for STI Screening | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20080315/819.html | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 77 | issue = 6| pages = 819–824 |display-authors=etal| pmid = 18386598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors include a history of chlamydial or other sexually transmitted infection, new or multiple sexual partners, and inconsistent [[condom]] use.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSTF&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = U.S. Preventive Services Task Force | title = Screening for chlamydial infection: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement | journal = Ann Intern Med | volume = 147 | issue = 2 | pages = 128–34 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17576996 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-147-2-200707170-00172 | url = http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf07/chlamydia/chlamydiars.htm | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080303022755/http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf07/chlamydia/chlamydiars.htm | archivedate = 2008-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guidelines recommend all women attending for [[emergency contraception|emergency contraceptive]] are offered Chlamydia testing, with studies showing up to 9% of women aged &lt;25 years had Chlamydia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeung E, Comben E, McGarry C, Warrington R | year = 2015 | title = STI testing in emergency contraceptive consultations | journal = British Journal of General Practice | volume = 65 | issue = 631 | pages = 63–64 | pmid = 25624285 | doi = 10.3399/bjgp15X683449 | pmc = 4325454 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Men====
In men, those with a chlamydial infection show symptoms of infectious [[Urethritis|inflammation of the urethra]] in about 50% of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS Chlamydia page&quot;/&gt; Symptoms that may occur include: a painful or burning sensation when urinating, an unusual discharge from the [[Human penis|penis]], [[Testicle|testicular]] pain or swelling, or fever. If left untreated, chlamydia in men can spread to the testicles causing [[epididymitis]], which in rare cases can lead to [[infertility|sterility]] if not treated.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS Chlamydia page&quot;/&gt; Chlamydia is also a potential cause of [[prostatitis|prostatic inflammation]] in men, although the exact relevance in prostatitis is difficult to ascertain due to possible contamination from urethritis.&lt;ref name=&quot;urology&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagenlehner FM, Naber KG, Weidner W | title = Chlamydial infections and prostatitis in men | journal = BJU Int. | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 687–90 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16536754 | doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joints===
Chlamydia may also cause [[reactive arthritis]]—the triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis and urethral inflammation—especially in young men. About 15,000 men develop reactive arthritis due to chlamydia infection each year in the U.S., and about 5,000 are permanently affected by it. It can occur in both sexes, though is more common in men.

===Infants===
As many as half of all [[infant]]s born to mothers with chlamydia will be born with the disease. Chlamydia can affect infants by causing spontaneous abortion; [[premature birth]]; [[conjunctivitis]], which may lead to [[blindness]]; and [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = STD Facts - Chlamydia | publisher = Center For Disease Control | date = December 16, 2014 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/std/Chlamydia/STDFact-Chlamydia.htm | accessdate = 2015-07-24 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150714002621/http://www.cdc.gov/std/chlamydia/stdfact-chlamydia.htm | archivedate = July 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conjunctivitis due to chlamydia typically occurs one week after birth (compared with chemical causes (within hours) or gonorrhea (2–5 days)).

===Other conditions===
A different [[serovar]] of Chlamydia trachomatis is also the cause of [[lymphogranuloma venereum]], an infection of the [[lymph nodes]] and [[lymphatics]]. It usually presents with [[genital ulcer]]ation and [[Lymphadenopathy|swollen lymph nodes]] in the [[groin]], but it may also manifest as [[proctitis|rectal inflammation]], [[fever]] or swollen lymph nodes in other regions of the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;proctitis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams D, Churchill D | title = Ulcerative proctitis in men who have sex with men: an emerging outbreak | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | issue = 7533 | pages = 99–100 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16410585 | pmc = 1326936 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.332.7533.99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission==
Chlamydia can be transmitted during vaginal, anal, or oral sex or direct contact with infected tissue such as conjunctiva. Chlamydia can also be passed from an infected mother to her baby during vaginal childbirth.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
''Chlamydiae'' have the ability to establish long-term associations with host cells. When an infected host cell is starved for various nutrients such as [[amino acid]]s (for example, [[tryptophan]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17724071&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leonhardt RM, Lee SJ, Kavathas PB, Cresswell P | title = Severe Tryptophan Starvation Blocks Onset of Conventional Persistence and Reduces Reactivation of Chlamydia trachomatis | journal = Infect.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:ChlamydiaTrachomatisEinschlusskörperchen.jpg|thumb|''Chlamydia trachomatis'' inclusion bodies (brown) in a McCoy [[cell culture]].]]
The diagnosis of genital chlamydial infections evolved rapidly from the 1990s through 2006. [[Nucleic acid amplification test]]s (NAAT), such as [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and the DNA [[strand displacement amplification]] (SDA) now are the mainstays. NAAT for chlamydia may be performed on swab specimens [[sampling (medicine)|sampled]] from the cervix (women) or urethra (men), on self-collected vaginal swabs, or on voided urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gaydos CA | year = 2004 | title = Comparison of three nucleic acid amplification tests for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in urine specimens | url = | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 3041–3045 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.42.7.3041-3045.2004 | pmid = 15243057 | pmc = 446239 |display-authors=etal| citeseerx = 10.1.1.335.7713}}&lt;/ref&gt; NAAT has been estimated to have a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of approximately 90% and a [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of approximately 99%, regardless of sampling from a cervical swab or by urine specimen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haugland2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haugland S, Thune T, Fosse B, Wentzel-Larsen T, Hjelmevoll SO, Myrmel H | title = Comparing urine samples and cervical swabs for Chlamydia testing in a female population by means of Strand Displacement Assay (SDA) | journal = BMC Women's Health | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20338058 | pmc = 2861009 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6874-10-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In women seeking an STI clinic and a urine test is [[Medical test|negative]], a subsequent cervical swab has been estimated to be positive in approximately 2% of the time.&lt;ref name=Haugland2010/&gt;

At present, the NAATs have regulatory approval only for testing urogenital specimens, although rapidly evolving research indicates that they may give reliable results on rectal specimens.

Because of improved test accuracy, ease of specimen management, convenience in specimen management, and ease of screening sexually active men and women, the NAATs have largely replaced culture, the historic [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for chlamydia diagnosis, and the non-amplified probe tests. The latter test is relatively insensitive, successfully detecting only 60–80% of infections in asymptomatic women, and often giving falsely positive results. Culture remains useful in selected circumstances and is currently the only assay approved for testing non-genital specimens. Other method also exist including: [[ligase chain reaction]] (LCR), direct fluorescent antibody resting, [[ELISA|enzyme immunoassay]], and cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6302a1.htm|title=Recommendations for the Laboratory-Based Detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae — 2014|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-12|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627175218/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6302a1.htm|archivedate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention is by [[Sexual abstinence|not having sex]], the use of [[condom]]s, or having sex with only one other person, who is not infected.&lt;ref name=CDCFact2016/&gt;

===Screening===
For sexually active women who are not pregnant, screening is recommended in those under 25 and others at risk of infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;/&gt; Risk factors include a history of chlamydial or other sexually transmitted infection, new or multiple sexual partners, and inconsistent [[condom]] use.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSTF&quot;/&gt; For pregnant women, guidelines vary: screening women with age or other risk factors is recommended by the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) (which recommends screening women under 25) and the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (which recommends screening women aged 25 or younger). The [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] recommends screening all at risk, while the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommend universal screening of pregnant women.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;/&gt; The USPSTF acknowledges that in some communities there may be other risk factors for infection, such as ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;/&gt; Evidence-based recommendations for screening initiation, intervals and termination are currently not possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmFamPhys&quot;/&gt; For men, the USPSTF concludes evidence is currently insufficient to determine if regular screening of men for chlamydia is beneficial.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSTF&quot;/&gt; They recommend regular screening of men who are at increased risk for HIV or syphilis infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSTF&quot;/&gt; A [[Cochrane review]] found that the effects of screening are uncertain in terms of chlamydia transmission but that screening probably reduces the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Low |first1=N |last2=Redmond |first2=S |last3=Uusküla |first3=A |last4=van Bergen |first4=J |last5=Ward |first5=H |last6=Andersen |first6=B |last7=Götz |first7=H |title=Screening for genital chlamydia infection. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=13 September 2016 |volume=9 |pages=CD010866 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010866.pub2 |pmid=27623210 |pmc=6457643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom the [[National Health Service|National Health Service (NHS)]] aims to:

''C. trachomatis'' infection can be effectively cured with [[antibiotic]]s. Guidelines recommend [[azithromycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[erythromycin]], levofloxacin or [[ofloxacin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Eliopoulos GM, Gilbert DN, Moellering RC|title=The Sanford guide to antimicrobial therapy 2011|publisher=Antimicrobial Therapy, Inc.|location=Sperryville, VA|isbn=978-1-930808-65-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sanfordguidetoan00davi_0/page/20 20]|url=https://archive.org/details/sanfordguidetoan00davi_0/page/20|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In men, doxycycline (100&amp;nbsp;mg twice a day for 7 days) is probably more effective than azithromycin (1 g single dose) but evidence for the relative effectiveness of antibiotics in women is very uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Páez-Canro |first1=C |last2=Alzate |first2=JP |last3=González |first3=LM |last4=Rubio-Romero |first4=JA |last5=Lethaby |first5=A |last6=Gaitán |first6=HG |title=Antibiotics for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non-pregnant women. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=25 January 2019 |volume=1 |pages=CD010871 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010871.pub2 |pmid=30682211|pmc=6353232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents recommended during pregnancy include erythromycin or [[amoxicillin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDiagnosis and Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection - April 15, 2006 - American Family Physician&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0415/p1411.html |title=Diagnosis and Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis Infection - April 15, 2006 - American Family Physician |journal=American Family Physician |volume=73 |issue=8 |pages=1411–1416 |accessdate=2010-10-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127054457/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0415/p1411.html |archivedate=November 27, 2011 |date=2006-04-15 |last1=Miller |first1=Karl E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An option for treating sexual partners of those with chlamydia or [[gonorrhea]] includes [[patient-delivered partner therapy]] (PDT or PDPT), which is the practice of treating the sex partners of index cases by providing prescriptions or medications to the patient to take to his/her partner without the health care provider first examining the partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPTFinalReport2006&quot;&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/EPTFinalReport2006.pdf Expedited Partner Therapy in the Management of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (2 February 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729185320/https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/eptfinalreport2006.pdf |date=29 July 2017 }} U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service.
