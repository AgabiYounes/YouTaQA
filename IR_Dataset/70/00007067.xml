The '''Cook Islands''' ([[Cook Islands Māori]]: ''Kūki 'Āirani'')&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse &amp; Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200&lt;/ref&gt; is a self-governing [[island country]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]. It comprises 15 islands whose total land area is {{convert|240|km2|sqmi|0}}. The Cook Islands' [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) covers {{convert|1800000|km2|sqmi}} of ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214035426/http://www.sopac.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Cook+Islands A View from the Cook Islands].

New Zealand is responsible for the Cook Islands' defence and foreign affairs, but these responsibilities are exercised in consultation with the Cook Islands.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/68986939/cook-islands-push-for-independence-from-nz&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times, the Cook Islands have adopted an increasingly independent foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|quote=Since 2001, the Cook Islands have complete sovereignty in managing their Foreign affairs according to the common declaration of 6 April 2001.|url=http://www.ambafrance-nz.org/Cook-Islands|title=Cook Islands|website=France in New Zealand|accessdate=October 30, 2015|date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cook Islanders]] are [[New Zealand nationality law|citizens of New Zealand]], but they also have the status of Cook Islands nationals, which is not given to other New Zealand citizens. The Cook Islands has been an active member of the [[Pacific Community]] since 1980.

The Cook Islands' main population centres are on the island of [[Rarotonga]] (13,007 in [[2016 Cook Islands Census|2016]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfem.gov.ck/census|title=Census 2016 - Cook Islands - Ministry of Finance and Economic Management|website=www.mfem.gov.ck|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828062044/http://www.mfem.gov.ck/census|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there is an [[Rarotonga International Airport|international airport]].

==History==
{{Main|History of the Cook Islands|British Western Pacific Territories}}
The latest carbon-dating evidence reveals that the Cook Islands were first settled by around AD 1000 by [[Polynesian people]] who are thought to have migrated from [[Tahiti]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crowe |first1=Andrew |title=Pathway of the Birds |date=2018 |publisher=David Bateman Ltd |location=Auckland |page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2019|reason=Popular science, non-expert author}} an island {{convert|1154|km}} to the northeast of the main island of Rarotonga.

Spanish ships visited the islands in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century. The first written record came in 1595 when the island of [[Pukapuka]] was sighted by Spanish sailor [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], who gave it the name ''San Bernardo'' (Saint Bernard). [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese captain working for the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish crown]], made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling the island ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Brian |last=Hooker |date=1998 |journal=[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |title=European discovery of the Cook Islands |pages=54–62|doi=10.1179/tin.1998.30.1.54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

British navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and again in 1777&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Nicholas (2003). ''Cook : the extraordinary voyages of Captain James Cook'', Walker &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0802714129}}, pp. 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt; giving the island of [[Manuae (Cook Islands)|Manuae]] the name ''Hervey Island''. The ''Hervey Islands'' later came to be applied to the entire southern group. The name &quot;Cook Islands&quot;, in honour of Cook, first appeared on a Russian naval chart published in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php |title=Cook Islands Government website |publisher=Cook-islands.gov.ck |accessdate=18 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326003510/http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php |archivedate=26 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1813 [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], a missionary on the ''Endeavour'' (not the same ship as Cook's) made the first recorded sighting of [[Rarotonga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.org.au/fpbooks/tendecades/TEN%20DECADES%20Chapter%203.doc|title=Ten Decades: The Australasian Centenary History of the London Missionary Society, Rev.

Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and many islanders are Christians today.

The islands were a popular stop in the 19th century for [[whaling]] ships from the United States, Britain and Australia. They visited, from at least 1826, to obtain water, food, and firewood.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Langdon (ed.) ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', (1984) Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, pp16 &amp; 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Their favourite islands were Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Mangaia and Penrhyn.

[[File:Cook Islands Annexation Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lord Ranfurly]] reading the annexation proclamation to [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] on 7 October 1900.]]
The Cook Islands became a British [[protectorate]] in 1888, largely because of community fears that France might occupy the islands as it already had Tahiti. On 6 September 1900, the islanders' leaders presented a petition asking that the islands (including [[Niue]] &quot;if possible&quot;) be annexed as British territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891&quot;&gt;''&quot;Commonwealth and Colonial Law&quot;'' by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Z. Parliamentary Pp., A3 (1901)&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 and 9 October 1900, seven instruments of cession of Rarotonga and other islands were signed by their chiefs and people. A British Proclamation was issued, stating that the cessions were accepted and the islands declared parts of Her Britannic Majesty's dominions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891&quot;/&gt; However, it did not include [[Aitutaki]]. Even though the inhabitants regarded themselves as British subjects, the Crown's title was unclear until the island was formally annexed by that Proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Commonwealth and Colonial Law&quot; by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 761&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Z. Parliamentary Pp., A1 (1900)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 the islands were included within the boundaries of the [[Colony of New Zealand]] by Order in Council&lt;ref&gt;S.R.O. &amp; S.I. Rev. XVI, 862–863&lt;/ref&gt; under the Colonial Boundaries Act, 1895 of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;58 &amp; 59 V. c. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary change became effective on 11 June 1901, and the Cook Islands have had a formal relationship with New Zealand since that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891&quot;/&gt;

When the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect on 1 January 1949, Cook Islanders who were [[British subject]]s automatically gained [[New Zealand citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/citizenship/3 3. Aliens and citizens – Citizenship – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]. Teara.govt.nz (4 March 2009). Retrieved 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The islands remained a New Zealand dependent territory until the New Zealand Government decided to grant them self-governing status. On 4 August 1965, a constitution was promulgated. The first Monday in August is celebrated each year as [[Public holidays in the Cook Islands|Constitution Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/Library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_cw.html|title=Australia - Oceania :: Cook Islands — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] of the [[Cook Islands Party]] was elected as the first Premier. Henry led the nation until 1978, when he was accused of vote-rigging and resigned. He was succeeded by [[Tom Davis (Cook Islands)|Tom Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]].

In March 2019, it was reported that the Cook Islands had plans to change its name and remove the reference to Captain James Cook in favour of &quot;a title that reflects its 'Polynesian nature'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraphname&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/05/cook-islands-change-name-remove-association-captain-cook/|title=Cook Islands to choose new indigenous name and remove any association with British explorer|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=6 March 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;radionzname&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/383948/cook-islands-government-backs-name-change-body|title=Cook Islands government backs name change body|date=2019-03-05|website=Radio New Zealand|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported in May 2019 that the proposed name change had been poorly received by the Cook Islands diaspora. As a compromise, it was decided that the English name of the islands would not be altered, but that a new Cook Islands Māori name would be adopted to replace the current name, a transliteration from English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/radio-australia/programs/pacificbeat/cook-islands-name-change/11140916|title=Cook Islands: Backlash over name change leads to compromise traditional name|work=Pacific Beat with Catherine Graue|publisher=ABC News|date=23 May 2019|access-date=26 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the Cook Islands}}
[[File:Wyspy Cooka.png|thumb|Map of the Cook Islands]]
The Cook Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Zealand, between [[French Polynesia]] and [[American Samoa]]. There are 15&amp;nbsp;major islands spread over {{convert|2200000|km²|-4|abbr=on}} of ocean, divided into two distinct groups: the Southern Cook Islands and the Northern Cook Islands of [[Atoll|coral atolls]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cook Islands Travel Guide&quot; (with description), ''World Travel Guide'', Nexus Media Communications, 2006. Webpage: [http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/65/country_guide/Australia-and-South-Pacific/Cook-Islands.html WTGuide-Cook-Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026060558/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/65/country_guide/Australia-and-South-Pacific/Cook-Islands.html |date=26 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands were formed by [[volcanic]] activity; the northern group is older and consists of six atolls, which are sunken volcanoes topped by coral growth. The climate is [[Oceanic climate|moderate]] to [[Tropical climate|tropical]]. The Cook Islands consist of 15 islands and two reefs.

The Cook Islands is a [[representative democracy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] in an [[associated state]] relationship with New Zealand. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, with the Chief Minister as [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of the Cook Islands]]. There is a pluriform{{clarify|date=September 2019}} [[multi-party system]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The [[head of state]] is the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], who is represented in the Cook Islands by the [[Monarchy in the Cook Islands|Queen's Representative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/ck/government.html|title=Cook Islands System of Government Information|website=www.paclii.org|access-date=2019-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands are self-governing in &quot;free association&quot; with [[New Zealand]]. New Zealand retains primary responsibility for external affairs, with consultation with the Cook Islands government. Cook Islands nationals are citizens of New Zealand and can receive New Zealand government services, but the reverse is not true; New Zealand citizens are not Cook Islands nationals. Despite this, {{As of|2014|lc=y}}, the Cook Islands had diplomatic relations in its own name with 43 other countries.

==Administrative subdivisions==
There are island councils on all of the inhabited outer islands (Outer Islands Local Government Act 1987 with amendments up to&amp;nbsp;2004, and Palmerston Island Local Government Act 1993) except [[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]], which is governed by [[Pukapuka]] ([[Suwarrow]], with only one caretaker living on the island, also governed by Pukapuka, is not counted with the inhabited islands in this context). Each council is headed by a mayor.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Cook Islands}}
The economy is strongly affected by geography. It is isolated from foreign markets, and has some inadequate infrastructure; it lacks major natural resources, has limited manufacturing and suffers moderately from natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;''Polynesia French Business Law Handbook: Strategic Information and Laws'' {{ISBN|1-4387-7081-2}} p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism provides the economic base that makes up approximately 67.5% of GDP. Additionally, the economy is supported by foreign aid, largely from New Zealand. [[China]] has also contributed foreign aid, which has resulted in, among other projects, the Police Headquarters building. The Cook Islands is expanding its agriculture, mining and fishing sectors, with varying success.

Since approximately 1989, the Cook Islands have become a location specialising in so-called [[asset-protection trusts#Cook Islands|asset protection trusts]], by which investors shelter assets from the reach of creditors and legal authorities.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Jurisdictions: Cook Islands|url=http://protectyou.com/1996/01/review-of-offshore-jurisdictions-part-1/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|last1=Rosen |first1=Howard |last2=Donlevy-Rosen |first2=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'', the Cooks have &quot;laws devised to protect foreigners' assets from legal claims in their home countries&quot;, which were apparently crafted specifically to thwart the long arm of American justice; creditors must travel to the Cook Islands and argue their cases under Cooks law, often at prohibitive expense.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt; Unlike other foreign jurisdictions such as the [[British Virgin Islands]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Switzerland]], the Cooks &quot;generally disregard foreign court orders&quot; and do not require that bank accounts, real estate, or other assets protected from scrutiny (it is illegal to disclose names or any information about Cooks trusts) be physically located within the archipelago.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt; Taxes on trusts and trust employees account for some 8% of the Cook Islands economy, behind tourism but ahead of fishing.&lt;ref name=flyspeck/&gt;

In recent years, the Cook Islands has gained a reputation as a debtor paradise, through the enactment of legislation that permits debtors to shield their property from the claims of creditors.&lt;ref name=flyspeck&gt;{{cite news |last=Wayne |first=Leslie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/business/international/paradise-of-untouchable-assets.html |title=Cook Islands, a Paradise of Untouchable Assets |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 December 2013 |accessdate= 27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The languages of the Cook Islands include [[English language|English]], [[Cook Islands Māori]], or &quot;[[Rarotongan]],&quot; and [[Pukapukan language|Pukapukan]]. Dialects of Cook Islands Maori include [[Penrhyn language|Penrhyn]]; [[Rakahanga-Manihiki language|Rakahanga-Manihiki]]; the [[Nga-Pu-Toru|Ngaputoru]] dialect of [[Atiu]], [[Mitiaro]], and [[Mauke]]; the [[Aitutaki]] dialect; and the [[Mangaia]]n dialect. Cook Islands Maori and its dialectic variants are closely related to both [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] and to New Zealand [[Māori language|Māori]]. [[Pukapukan]] is considered closely related to the [[Samoan language]]. English and Cook Islands Māori are [[official language]]s of the Cook Islands; per the [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/trma2003130/ Te Reo Maori Act]. The legal definition of Cook Islands Māori includes Pukapukan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CK/languages|title=Cook Islands|website=Ethnologue|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carving====
[[File:Cook Islands carved wood figure, British Museum.jpg|thumb|This wooden late eighteenth or early nineteenth century carved [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|figure]] escaped [[emasculation]]. Only one other comparable example is known apart from this one in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/standing-male-figure/iAEuMZBGSYaByg |title=Standing male figure – Google Arts &amp; Culture |website=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]

[[Woodcarving]] is a common art form in the Cook Islands. The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but that had special developments in each island. Rarotonga is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, [[Atiu]] for its wooden seats, [[Mitiaro]], [[Mauke]] and Atiu for mace and slab gods and [[Mangaia]] for its ceremonial adzes. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionaries. Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the Maori in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as tapa. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive limestone caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/culture.htm#visual |title=Lords of the Dance : Culture of the Cook Islands|publisher=Ck|date=2013-11-12|accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Weaving====
The outer islands produce traditional [[weaving]] of mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of rito hats are worn by women to church. They are made from the uncurled immature fibre of the coconut palm and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of Panama hats, they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule pupu shells that are painted and stitched on by hand. Although pupu are found on other islands the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of Mangaia. The weaving of rito is a speciality of the northern islands, Manihiki, Rakahanga and Penrhyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/culture.htm#crafts |title=Lords of the Dance : Culture of the Cook Islands |publisher=Ck |date=2013-11-12|accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tivaevae====
A major art form in the Cook Islands is [[tivaevae]]. This is, in essence, the art of handmade Island scenery patchwork quilts. Introduced by the wives of missionaries in the 19th century, the craft grew into a communal activity, which is probably one of the main reasons for its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/tivaevae.htm |title=Tivaevae – Quilts of the Cook Islands |publisher=Ck |date=2004-07-15 |accessdate=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary art====
The Cook Islands has produced internationally recognised contemporary artists, especially in the main island of Rarotonga. Artists include painter (and photographer) Mahiriki Tangaroa, sculptors Eruera (Ted) Nia (originally a film maker) and master carver Mike Tavioni, painter (and Polynesian tattoo enthusiast) Upoko'ina Ian George, Aitutakian-born painter Tim Manavaroa Buchanan, Loretta Reynolds, Judith Kunzlé, Joan Rolls Gragg, Kay George (who is also known for her fabric designs), Apii Rongo, Varu Samuel, and multi-media, installation and community-project artist [[Ani O'Neill]], all of whom currently live on the main island of Rarotonga. Atiuan-based Andrea Eimke is an artist who works in the medium of tapa and other textiles, and also co-authored the book 'Tivaivai – The Social Fabric of the Cook Islands' with British academic [[Susanne Kuechler]]. Many of these artists have studied at university art schools in New Zealand and continue to enjoy close links with the New Zealand art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cook Islands Arts Community|url=http://cookislandsarts.com|website=Cookislandsarts.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand-based Cook Islander artists include [[Michel Tuffery]], print-maker David Teata, Richard Shortland Cooper, Sylvia Marsters and [[Jim Vivieaere]].
