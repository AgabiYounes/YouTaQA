The [[Aérospatiale]]/[[British Aircraft Corporation|BAC]] '''Concorde''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|ŋ|k|ɔr|d}}) is&lt;!-- Aircraft still exists in museums. Read end of sentence for retired part. --&gt; a British–French [[turbojet]]-powered [[Supersonic transport|supersonic passenger]] [[airliner]] that was operated until 2003. It had a maximum speed over twice the [[speed of sound]], at [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.04 ({{convert|1354|mph|km/h|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=or}} at cruise altitude), with seating for 92 to 128 passengers. First flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued flying for the next 27 years. It is one of only two [[supersonic transport]]s to have been operated commercially; the other is the Soviet-built [[Tupolev Tu-144]], which operated in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon Tu-144&quot;&gt;Gordon and Rigmant 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Melik-Karamov 2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |last=Melik-Karamov [Мелик-Карамов] |first=Vitaly [Виталий] |url=http://www.ropnet.ru/ogonyok/win/200003/03-26-31.html |title=Life and Death of the Tu-144, [Жизнь и смерть самолёта Ту-144] |publisher=Flame [Огонёк] |series=No. 3 |date=January 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001115093200/http://www.ropnet.ru/ogonyok/win/200003/03-26-31.html |archive-date=15 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concorde was jointly developed and manufactured by [[Sud Aviation]] (later Aérospatiale) and the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) under an Anglo-French treaty. Twenty aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development aircraft. [[Air France]] (AF) and [[British Airways]] (BA) were the only airlines to purchase and fly Concorde. The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for the aircraft's speed and luxury service. For example, in 1997, the round-trip ticket price from New York to London was $7,995 (${{format price|{{Inflation|US|8e3|1997}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars),{{Inflation-fn|US}} more than 30 times the cost of the cheapest option to fly this route.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F2D_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 ''New Design Concepts for High Speed Air Transport''] edited by H. Sobieczky (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

The original programme cost estimate of £70 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Concorde |work=BBC Timewatch documentary |date=2003 |quote=By 1962, the cost estimates had already soared from 70 to 150 million pounds.&quot; &lt;br&gt;&quot;[By 1964], costs had doubled yet again to nearly 300 million pounds.&quot; &lt;!--The documentary goes on to explain how the international treaty had been written in such a way that if either party wished to back out, the cost penalty for doing so would be exorbitant. (Whereas neither the US nor USSR had such barriers to canceling their SST programs, which both countries eventually did.)--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; met huge overruns and delays, with the program eventually costing £1.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Other estimates of total program cost exceeded £2 billion. &lt;br&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F2D_CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 New Design Concepts for High Speed Air Transport] edited by H. Sobieczky (1997) &lt;br&gt;Quote: &lt;br&gt;&quot;The program's cost, through March 1976, was put at between 1.5 and 2.1 billion in 1976 pounds sterling, or between 3.6 and 5.1 billion in 1977 U.S. dollars (yearly weighted exchange rates).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It was this extreme cost that became the main factor in the production run being much smaller than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Concorde'' (BBC Timewatch, 2003) Chris Benjamin, Concorde Administrator (UK) 1971–74 said: &quot;It's really a matter of great regret that an enormous amount of creativity, effort and resources were used to produce this aeroplane which has actually no sustainable benefit at all.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later, another factor, which affected the viability of all [[supersonic transport]] programmes, was that supersonic flight could only be used on ocean-crossing routes, to prevent [[sonic boom]] disturbance over populated areas. With only [[Concorde aircraft histories|seven airframes each]] being operated by the British and French, the per-unit cost was impossible to recoup, so the French and British governments absorbed the development costs. British Airways and Air France were able to operate Concorde at a profit, in spite of very high maintenance costs, because the aircraft was able to sustain a high ticket price.

Among other [[#Scheduled flights|destinations]], Concorde flew regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from London's [[Heathrow Airport]] and Paris's [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York, [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia and [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] in Barbados; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners.

Concorde won the 2006 Great British Design Quest, organised by the BBC and the [[Design Museum]] of London, beating other well-known designs such as the [[BMC Mini]], the [[miniskirt]], the [[Jaguar E-Type]], the [[London Tube map]] and the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. The type was retired in 2003, three years after the crash of [[Air France Flight 4590]], in which all passengers and crew were killed. The general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the end of maintenance support for Concorde by [[Airbus]] (the successor company of both Aérospatiale and BAC) also contributed to the retirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Concorde Grounded&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title=Concorde grounded for good |work=BBC News |date=10 April 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Early studies===
The origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when [[Arnold Hall]], director of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) asked [[Morien Morgan]] to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=35}}

At the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.&lt;ref group=N&gt;In particular, R. T. Jones' work at NACA demonstrated this in depth.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the use of very short-span, very thin trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] or the [[Avro 730]] that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}

This same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long take-off runs and frighteningly high landing speeds.&lt;ref&gt;
Jan Meyer, [http://starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html &quot;High altitude flying with F-104&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103071113/http://www.starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html |date=3 January 2014}}, Starfighterens veneer Norge.&lt;/ref&gt; In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, &quot;some horribly large aeroplanes&quot; resulted.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST infeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}

===Slender deltas===
Soon after, [[Johanna Weber]] and [[Dietrich Küchemann]] at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]], known in the UK as the &quot;slender delta&quot; concept.&lt;ref name='deltawing'&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A6825061AH&amp;q=Concorde+Delta&amp;uid=788872723|title=The development of the slender delta concept|journal=Aircraft Engineering|author=Maltby, R.L.|volume=40|date=1968|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526165008/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A6825061AH&amp;q=Concorde+Delta&amp;uid=788872723&amp;setcookie=yes|archivedate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aerosoc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aerosociety.com/News/Society-News/2742/OBITUARY-DR-JOHANNA-WEBER|title=Obituary: Dr Johanna Weber|publisher=[[Royal Aeronautical Society]]|date=12 January 2015|last=Green |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team, including Eric Maskell whose report &quot;Flow Separation in Three Dimensions&quot; contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow,&lt;ref&gt;''Three Centuries To Concorde'', Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, {{ISBN|0 85298 412 X}}, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; worked with the fact that [[delta wing]]s can produce strong [[vortex|vortices]] on their upper surfaces at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by [[Chuck Yeager]] in the [[Convair XF-92]], but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.&lt;ref name=aerosoc /&gt;{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}

Küchemann's and Weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight. Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were not much different from a [[swept wing]] of the same span.&lt;ref group=N&gt;Consider especially the [[English Electric Lightning]], whose wing can be considered either a highly swept rectangle, or a delta with a notch cut out of the root.&lt;/ref&gt; Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation.&lt;ref name=aerosoc /&gt; The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very &quot;nose high&quot; to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design.&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; It would also need to have long [[landing gear]] to produce the required angle of attack while still on the runway.

Küchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. Test pilot [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Eric Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MMEK1jwD03AC&amp;pg=PT121 &quot;Wings On My Sleeve&quot;], Hachette UK, 2008, end of Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee===
[[File:HP.115.gif|thumb|right|The HP.115 tested the low-speed performance of the slender delta layout.]]

On 1 October 1956 the [[Ministry of Supply]] asked Morgan to form a new study group, the ''Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee'' (''STAC''){{sfn|Conway|2005|p=39}} (sometimes referred to as the ''Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee''), with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the [[Handley Page HP.115]].&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as {{convert|69|mph|abbr=on}}, about {{sfrac|1|3}} that of the F-104 Starfighter.{{sfn|Winchester|2005b|p=134}}

STAC stated that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more [[sorties]] in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}

STAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan suggested that a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90&amp;nbsp;million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80&amp;nbsp;million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=68}}

In 1959, a study contract was awarded to [[Hawker Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept,{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}} which developed as the [[Hawker Siddeley HSA.1000|HSA.1000]] and [[Bristol Type 223#STAC|Bristol 198]]. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and after the creation of [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Sud Aviation]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}

===Ogee planform selected===
Küchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout this period, considering three basic shapes; the classic straight-edge delta, the &quot;gothic delta&quot; that was rounded outwards to appear like a [[Gothic architecture#Equilateral arch|gothic arch]], and the &quot;[[ogive|ogival]] wing&quot; that was compound-rounded into the shape of an [[ogee]]. Each of these planforms had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}

Generally one wants to have the wing's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] (CP, or &quot;lift point&quot;) close to the aircraft's [[centre of gravity]] (CG, or &quot;balance point&quot;) to reduce the amount of control force required to [[Pitch axis (kinematics)|pitch]] the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this.&lt;ref group=N&gt;Or, more rarely, &quot;bent&quot; back into position. Examples include the [[Douglas DC-3]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 262]].&lt;/ref&gt; With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}

[[File:Bristol Type 223 top-view silhouette.png|thumb|200px|right|Plan-view silhouette of the Bristol Type 223 SST project]]

While the wing planform was evolving, so was the basic SST concept. Bristol's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing,&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Thompson and R. A. Fail, [http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0815.pdf &quot;Measurements of Oscillatory Derivatives at Mach Numbers up to 2.6 on a Model of a Supersonic Transport Design Study (Bristol Type 198)&quot;], RAE Bedford, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; but evolved into the larger [[Bristol Type 223|Type 223]].

To test the new wing, NASA privately assisted the team by modifying a [[Douglas F5D Skylancer]] with temporary wing modifications to mimic the wing selection. In 1965 the NASA test aircraft successfully tested the wing, and found that it reduced landing speeds noticeably over the standard delta wing. NASA Ames test center also ran simulations which showed that the aircraft would suffer a sudden change in pitch when entering ground effect. Ames test pilots later participated in a joint cooperative test with the French and British test pilots and found that the simulations had been correct, and this information was added to pilot training.&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center. Seth B. Anderson, United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. History Office, Ames Research Center. P.38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership with Sud Aviation===
By this time similar political and economic concerns in France&lt;!-- do not link major countries--&gt; had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and [[Nord Aviation]], as well as [[Dassault]].&lt;ref group=N&gt;This apparently took place some time in 1957, according to Conway's unclear statement about &quot;the following year&quot; which apparently references the first STAC meeting in late 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a [[ramjet]] powered design flying at Mach 3, the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle]] won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}

As soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked &quot;For UK Eyes Only&quot;, had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour. Sud made minor changes to the paper, and presented it as their own work.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=49}}

Unsurprisingly, the two teams found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already concluded they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]]).{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=47}} As neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used&amp;nbsp;– above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}

The only disagreements were over the size and range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved not to be the barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=41}} The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Bristol Siddeley Olympus]] engines, being developed for the [[TSR-2]], allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=50}}

===Cabinet response, treaty===
While the development teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport [[Robert Buron]] was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation [[Peter Thorneycroft]], and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}} The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of &quot;giving away&quot; US technological leadership to a European partner.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}

When the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be £150&amp;nbsp;million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that &quot;the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the £150&amp;nbsp;million [cost] to turn out much too low.&quot;{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}

This concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}

After considerable argument, the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the [[European Common Market]], which was being controlled by [[Charles de Gaulle]] who felt the UK's [[Special Relationship]] with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}} It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}}

The development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot;&gt;[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a &quot;Early History.&quot;] concordesst.com. Retrieved 8 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
Reflecting the treaty between the British and French governments that led to Concorde's construction, the name ''Concorde'' is from the French word ''[[wikt:concorde#French|concorde]]'' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃kɔʁd|IPA}}), which has an English equivalent, ''[[wikt:concord#English|concord]]''. Both words mean ''agreement'', ''harmony'' or ''union''. The name was officially changed to ''Concord'' by [[Harold Macmillan]] in response to a perceived slight by [[Charles de Gaulle]]. At the French roll-out in [[Toulouse]] in late 1967,&lt;ref name=ssccunv&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=50ExAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xRAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5265%2C2127687 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=Associated Press |title=Supersonic Concorde unveiled |date=12 December 1967 |page=3, part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the British Government [[Minister of Technology]], [[Tony Benn]], announced that he would change the spelling back to ''Concorde''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1064752,00.html |title=Sonic booms and that 'e' on the end: Tony Benn remembers his role in getting Concorde off the ground |first=Tony |last=Benn |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=17 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This created a nationalist uproar that died down when Benn stated that the suffixed &quot;e&quot; represented &quot;Excellence, England, Europe and [[Entente Cordiale|Entente (Cordiale)]]&quot;. In his memoirs, he recounts a tale of a letter from an irate Scotsman claiming: &quot;[Y]ou talk about 'E' for England, but part of it is made in Scotland.&quot; Given Scotland's contribution of providing the nose cone for the aircraft, Benn replied, &quot;[I]t was also 'E' for 'Écosse' (the French name for Scotland)&amp;nbsp;– and I might have added 'e' for extravagance and 'e' for escalation as well!&quot;{{sfn|McIntyre|1992|p=20}}

Concorde also acquired an unusual [[nomenclature]] for an aircraft. In common usage in the United Kingdom, the type is known as &quot;Concorde&quot; without an [[article (grammar)|article]], rather than &quot;{{em|the}} Concorde&quot; or &quot;{{em|a}} Concorde&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Note this British convention is used throughout this article: {{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2003/concorde_retirement/default.stm |title= In depth: Farewell to Concorde |work=[[BBC News]] |date=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/aboutconcorde.html |title= About Concorde&amp;nbsp;– main page |publisher=British Airways |accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by ''[[Flight International]]'' as an &quot;aviation icon&quot; and &quot;one of aerospace's most ambitious but commercially flawed projects&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2003/2003%20-%202360.html |title=concorde – 2003–2360 – Flight Archive |work=Flight International |publisher=Reed Business Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Concorde Special – Flawed Icon |date=21 October 2003 |work=Flight Global |publisher=Reed Business Information |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/concorde-special-flawed-icon-172669/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concorde failed to meet its original sales targets, despite initial interest from several airlines.

At first, the new consortium intended to produce one long-range and one short-range version. However, prospective customers showed no interest in the short-range version and it was dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;earlyhist&quot; /&gt;

An advertisement covering two full pages, promoting Concorde, ran in the 29 May 1967 issue of ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology''. The advertisement predicted a market for 350 aircraft by 1980 and boasted of Concorde's head start over the United States' SST project.&lt;ref&gt;48 years ago in AW&amp;ST, Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, 25 May – 7 June 2015, p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Concorde had considerable difficulties that led to its dismal sales performance. Costs had spiralled during development to more than six times the original projections, arriving at a unit cost of £23&amp;nbsp;million in 1977 (equivalent to £{{Inflation|UK|23|1977|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|UK}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1352927/Is-this-the-end-of-the-Concorde-dream.html |title=Is this the end of the Concorde dream? |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=Paul |last=Marston |date=16 August 2000 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sonic boom made travelling supersonically over land impossible without causing complaints from citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concordes limited to 16&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Concordes limited to 16 |work=Virgin Islands Daily News|date=5 June 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; World events had also dampened Concorde sales prospects, the [[1973–74 stock market crash]] and the [[1973 oil crisis]] had made many airlines cautious about aircraft with high fuel consumption rates; and new [[wide-body aircraft]], such as the [[Boeing 747]], had recently made subsonic aircraft significantly more efficient and presented a low-risk option for airlines.{{sfn|Ross|1978|pp=47–49}} While carrying a full load, Concorde achieved 15.8 [[passenger miles per gallon]] of fuel, while the [[Boeing 707]] reached 33.3&amp;nbsp;pm/g, the Boeing 747 46.4&amp;nbsp;pm/g, and the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] 53.6&amp;nbsp;pm/g.{{sfn|Ross|1978|p=49}} An emerging trend in the industry in favour of cheaper airline tickets had also caused airlines such as [[Qantas]] to question Concorde's market suitability.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn 2010, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consortium received orders, i.e., non-binding options, for over 100 of the long-range version from the major airlines of the day: [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], and Air France were the launch customers, with six Concordes each.

The design work was supported by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio [[delta wing]]s. A supersonic [[Fairey Delta 2]] was modified to carry the ogee planform, and, renamed as the BAC 221, used for flight tests of the high speed flight envelope,{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p=130}} the [[Handley Page HP.115]] also provided valuable information on low speed performance.{{sfn|Winchester|2005a|p=134}}

Construction of two prototypes began in February 1965: 001, built by Aérospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at [[Filton]], Bristol.

While Concorde had initially held a great deal of customer interest, the project was hit by a large number of order cancellations. The [[1973 Paris Air Show crash|Paris Le Bourget air show crash]] of the competing Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-144]] had shocked potential buyers, and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraft—the [[sonic boom]], take-off noise and pollution—had produced a shift in public opinion of SSTs. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concordes limited to 16&quot; /&gt; Only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/faq.html#6 |title=Payments for Concorde |publisher=British Airways |accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government cut federal funding for the [[Boeing 2707]], its rival supersonic transport programme, in 1971; Boeing did not complete its two 2707 prototypes. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70813F83F5511728DDDAE0994DA415B888BF1D3 |title=Malaysia lifting ban on the use of its Airspace by the Concorde |work=The New York Times |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=17 December 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xTMsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=48sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6855,2298265 |title=News from around the world |work=Herald-Journal |date=13 January 1978 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration as having been an act of [[protectionism]] of American aircraft manufacturers.{{sfn|Ross|1978|p=46}}

===General features===
Concorde is an [[ogival delta]] winged aircraft with four [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593|Olympus]] engines based on those employed in the RAF's [[Avro Vulcan]] [[strategic bomber]]. It is one of the few commercial aircraft to employ a [[tailless aircraft|tailless design]] (the [[Tupolev Tu-144]] being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) [[fly-by-wire]] flight-control system; the [[avionics]] system Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid circuits]].&lt;ref name='elecflybywire' /&gt; The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with [[Archibald Russell|Sir Archibald Russell]] as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Masefield |title=Obituary: Sir Archibald Russell |work=The Independent |date=1 July 1995 |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concorde pioneered the following technologies:

For high speed and optimisation of flight:
* [[Double delta]] ([[ogee]]/ogival) shaped wings&lt;ref name= 'deltawing' /&gt;
* Variable engine air [[intake ramp]] system controlled by [[digital computer]]s&lt;ref name=nova /&gt;
* [[Supercruise]] capability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/transport/news/jae/jae000725_1_n.shtml |title=Rolls-Royce Snecma Olympus |publisher=Janes |date=25 July 2000 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806140324/http://www.janes.com/transport/news/jae/jae000725_1_n.shtml |archivedate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thrust-by-wire engines, predecessor of today's [[FADEC]]-controlled engines&lt;ref name=nova /&gt;
* [[Droop-nose]] section for better landing visibility

For weight-saving and enhanced performance:

A symposium titled &quot;Supersonic-Transport Implications&quot; was hosted by the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] on 8 December 1960. Various views were put forward on the likely type of powerplant for a supersonic transport, such as podded or buried installation and turbojet or ducted-fan engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%203039.html |title=Supersonic – Transport Implications |work=Flight |date=23 December 1960 |page=971 |via=FlightGlobal archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%203108.html?search=supersonic%20transport%20implications |title=Boundary layer &amp;#124; hawker siddeley &amp;#124; supersonic aircraft &amp;#124; 1960 &amp;#124; 3108 &amp;#124; Flight Archive |accessdate=26 February 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226132358/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1960/1960%20-%203108.html?search=supersonic%20transport%20implications |archivedate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boundary layer management in the podded installation was put forward as simpler with only an inlet cone but Dr. Seddon of the RAE saw &quot;a future in a more sophisticated integration of shapes&quot; in a buried installation. Another concern highlighted the case with two or more engines situated behind a single intake. An intake failure could lead to a double or triple engine failure. The advantage of the ducted fan over the turbojet was reduced airport noise but with considerable economic penalties with its larger cross-section producing excessive drag.&lt;ref&gt;Birtles, Philip. ''Concorde'', pp. 62–63. Vergennes, Vermont: Plymouth Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-882663-44-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time it was considered that the noise from a turbojet optimised for supersonic cruise could be reduced to an acceptable level using noise suppressors as used on subsonic jets.

The powerplant configuration selected for Concorde, and its development to a certificated design, can be seen in light of the above symposium topics (which highlighted airfield noise, boundary layer management and interactions between adjacent engines) and the requirement that the powerplant, at Mach 2, tolerate combinations of pushovers, sideslips, pull-ups and throttle slamming without surging.&lt;ref name=talbot /&gt;{{rp|p.131}} Extensive development testing with design changes and changes to intake and engine control laws would address most of the issues except airfield noise and the interaction between adjacent powerplants at speeds above Mach 1.6 which meant Concorde &quot;had to be certified aerodynamically as a twin-engined aircraft above Mach 1.6&quot;.&lt;ref name=talbot&gt;Concorde A Designer's Life The Journey To Mach 2, Ted Talbot 2013, The History Press, {{ISBN|978 0 7524 8928 5}}, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolls-Royce had a design proposal, the RB.169, for the aircraft at the time of Concorde's initial design&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal=Flight International |date=28 June 1962 |page=1018 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201020.html |title=Aero Engines 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; but &quot;to develop a brand-new engine for Concorde would have been prohibitively expensive&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=R.|title=Aircraft engines: a proud heritage and an exciting future|journal=The Aeronautical Journal|date=2016|volume=120|issue=1223|pages=131–169|doi=10.1017/aer.2015.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; so an existing engine, already flying in the [[BAC TSR-2|TSR-2]] prototype, was chosen. It was the Olympus 320 turbojet, a development of the Bristol engine first used for the [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber.

Great confidence was placed in being able to reduce the noise of a turbojet and massive strides by SNECMA in silencer design were reported during the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200616.html?search=april%20noise%20and%20environment |title=1971 &amp;#124; 0616 &amp;#124; Flight Archive |accessdate=26 February 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226212746/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200616.html?search=april%20noise%20and%20environment |archivedate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1974 the spade silencers which projected into the exhaust were reported to be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%201690.html |title=Concorde &amp;#124; 1974 &amp;#124; 1690 &amp;#124; Flight Archive |accessdate=26 February 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226132353/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%201690.html |archivedate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olympus Mk.622 with reduced jet velocity was proposed to reduce the noise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%200593.html |title=Concorde &amp;#124; 1974 &amp;#124; 0593 &amp;#124; Flight Archive |accessdate=26 February 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226132427/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1974/1974%20-%200593.html |archivedate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not developed.

Situated behind the leading edge of the wing the engine intake had wing boundary layer ahead of it. Two-thirds was diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency&lt;ref name=talbot /&gt;{{rp|p.21}} except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the intake and caused surging. Extensive wind tunnel testing helped define leading edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Concorde Airframe Design and Development, D. Collard, Zurich, April 1999, Swiss Association of aeronautical Sciences, ETH-Zentrum, 8092 Zürich p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Each engine had its own intake and the engine nacelles were paired with a splitter plate between them to minimise adverse behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above {{convert|1.6|Mach}} was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.&lt;ref name=talbot /&gt;

Concorde needed to fly long distances to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. [[Turbofan]] engines were rejected due to their larger cross-section producing excessive drag. Olympus [[turbojet]] technology was available to be developed to meet the design requirements of the aircraft, although [[turbofan]]s would be studied for any future SST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papers.sae.org/760891/Olympus|title=SAE International – mobility engineering|website=Papers.sae.org|accessdate=21 December 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801033212/http://papers.sae.org/760891/Olympus/|archivedate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft used reheat ([[afterburner]]s) at take-off and to pass through the upper [[transonic]] regime and to supersonic speeds, between Mach 0.95 and 1.7. The afterburners were switched off at all other times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A9110958AH&amp;q=Rolls-Royce%2FSnecma+Olympus+593&amp;uid=788858323&amp;setcookie=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921053303/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=A9110958AH&amp;q=Rolls-Royce%2FSnecma+Olympus+593&amp;uid=788858323&amp;setcookie=yes |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 September 2011 |title=The Rolls Royce/SNECMA Olympus 593 engine operational experience and the lessons learned |publisher=European Symposium on the Future of High Speed Air Transport |author=Ganley, G. |author2=G. Laviec |year=1989 |pages=73–80 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to jet engines being [[propulsive efficiency|highly inefficient at low speeds]], Concorde burned {{convert|2|t|lb|spell=in}} of fuel (almost 2% of the maximum fuel load) taxiing to the runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/5195964.stm |title=Are the skies turning green? |work=BBC News |first=Joe |last=Lynam |date=19 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel used is [[Jet fuel|Jet A-1]]. Due to the high thrust produced even with the engines at idle, only the two outer engines were run after landing for easier taxiing and less [[brake pad]] wear – at low weights after landing, the aircraft would not remain stationary with all four engines idling requiring the brakes to be continuously applied to prevent the aircraft from rolling.

The intake design for Concorde's engines was especially critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/912180/ |title=Concorde Propulsion—Did we get it right?

The Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 Engine Reviewed |series=SAE Technical Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures to be met in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternative path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Design and Development of an Air Intake for a Supersonic Transport Aircraft|authors=Rettie and Lewis|journal=Journal of Aircraft|volume=5|issue=6|date=November–December 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a dump door, an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Concorde A Designer's Life&quot; Talbot, {{ISBN|978 0 7524 8928 5}}, plate 4&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as supplying air to the engine, the intake also supplied air through the ramp bleed to the propelling nozzle. The nozzle ejector (or aerodynamic) design, with variable exit area and secondary flow from the intake, contributed to good expansion efficiency from take-off to cruise.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An experiment on aerodynamic nozzles at M=2&quot; Reid, Ministry of Aviation, R. &amp; M. No. 3382, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Engine failure causes problems on conventional [[subsonic aircraft]]; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/concorde-special-the-test-pilot-john-cochrane-172657/ |title=Concorde Special&amp;nbsp;– The test pilot&amp;nbsp;– John Cochrane |publisher=[[Flight International]] |date=21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63710463.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207015537/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63710463.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 February 2012 |title=How a Concorde pilot would handle a nightmare failure |newspaper=Birmingham Post |first=Peter |last=Woodman |date=27 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concorde's Air Intake Control Units (AICUs) made use of a digital processor to provide the necessary accuracy for intake control. It was the world's first use of a digital processor to be given full authority control of an essential system in a passenger aircraft. It was developed by the Electronics and Space Systems (ESS) division of the British Aircraft Corporation after it became clear that the analogue AICUs fitted to the prototype aircraft and developed by [[Ultra Electronics]] were found to be insufficiently accurate for the tasks in hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=N.|last2=Dale|first2=R.

Concorde's thrust-by-wire engine control system was developed by Ultra Electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%201835.html |title=1976 &amp;#124; 1835 &amp;#124; Flight Archive |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date=4 September 1976 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heating problems===
Air compression on the outer surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch by the end of the flight.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Alastair. [http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/supersonic-the-enduring-allure-of-concorde-1-2415088 &quot;Supersonic: The enduring allure of Concorde&quot;]. Scotsman.com, 17 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the [[nose cone|nose]], due to [[aerodynamic heating]]. The engineers used [[Hiduminium]] R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was {{convert|127|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3951418 |title=When the SST Is Too Slow.. |journal=Science News |first=Jonathan |last=Eberhart |volume=91 |issue=22 |date=3 June 1967 |pages=528–529 |jstor=3951418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/eb034143 |title=The Concorde takes shape: Test programme and construction proceeding according to schedule |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |page=38 |year=1966 |volume=38 |issue=4 |issn=0002-2667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1972NASSP.309..631N |volume=309 |title=Fatigue Tests on Big Structure Assemblies of Concorde Aircraft |page=631 |year=1972 |author=N'guyen, V.P. |author2=J.P. Perrais |journal=Advanced Approaches to Fatigue Evaluation. NASA SP-309}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%202250.html|title=concorde – 1967–2250 – Flight Archive|work=flightglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Concorde - airframe temperatures.svg|thumb|Concorde skin temperatures]]
Owing to [[ram pressure|air compression]] in front of the plane as it travelled at [[supersonic speed]], the fuselage heated up and [[Thermal expansion|expanded]] by as much as {{cvt|300|mm}}. The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the [[flight engineer]]'s console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.seattlepi.com/business/147276_pilot07.html |first= James |last= Wallace |title= Those who flew the Concorde will miss it |work=Seattle Post Intelligencer|date= 7 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a [[heat sink]] for the heat from the air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Introduction to Concorde: A brief review of the Concorde and its prospects |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |author=Gedge, G.T. |author2=M.I. Prod |volume= 40 |issue= 3 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=14}}

Concorde had [[aircraft livery|livery]] restrictions; the majority of the surface had to be covered with a [[Anti-flash white|highly reflective white]] paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by {{convert|6|to|11|C-change|F-change}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%200821.html |title=1967 &amp;#124; 0821 &amp;#124; Flight Archive |publisher=Flightglobal.com |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, with the exception of the wings, in a promotional deal with [[Pepsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4794332.html |title=Is this the colour of the new millennium? |work=The Independent |date=3 April 1996 |location=UK |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516143325/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4794332.html |archivedate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paint scheme, Air France was advised to remain at {{convert|2|Mach|60000|sigfig=3}} for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Azul contra rojo |work=El Mundo |date=5 April 1996 |first=Cristina |last=Frade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural issues===
[[File:Concorde fuel trim.svg|thumb|upright|Fuel pitch trim]]

Due to its high speeds, large forces were applied to the aircraft during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard [[elevon]]s, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=78}} Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nova&quot; /&gt; This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.&lt;ref name=&quot;popular&quot;&gt;Kocivar, Ben. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&amp;lpg=PA142 &quot;Aboard the Concorde SST.&quot;] ''Popular Science'', October 1973, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

When any aircraft passes the [[critical mach]] of that particular airframe, the [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, but there was still a shift of about {{convert|2|m}}. This could have been countered by the use of [[Trim tab|trim controls]], but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.&lt;ref name='fueltrim'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/eb035344 |title=Flight Refuelling Limited and Concorde: The fuel system aboard is largely their work |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |volume=48 |issue=9 |date=September 1976 |issn=0002-2667 |pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Range===
To fly non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean, Concorde required the greatest supersonic [[Range (aeronautics)|range]] of any aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating Concorde|url=http://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/about-ba/history-and-heritage/celebrating-concorde|publisher=British Airways|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved by a combination of engines which were highly efficient at supersonic speeds,{{refn|&quot;It is the world's most efficient jet engine.&quot; -Ricky Bastin, Concorde Engineer&lt;ref name=nova /&gt;|group=N}}&lt;ref name=nova /&gt; a slender fuselage with high [[fineness ratio]], and a complex wing shape for a high [[lift-to-drag ratio]]. This also required carrying only a modest payload and a high fuel capacity, and the aircraft was trimmed with precision to avoid unnecessary drag.&lt;ref name='deltawing' /&gt;&lt;ref name='fueltrim' /&gt;

Nevertheless, soon after Concorde began flying, a Concorde &quot;B&quot; model was designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with [[leading edge slats]] to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds, with the objective of expanding the range to reach markets in new regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concordesst.com/concordeb.html |title=CONCORDE SST: CONCORDE B |work=concordesst.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy [[afterburner]]. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=N9222540AH&amp;q=Concorde+engines&amp;uid=788858323&amp;setcookie=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921055740/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=TRD&amp;recid=N9222540AH&amp;q=Concorde+engines&amp;uid=788858323&amp;setcookie=yes |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 September 2011 |title=Propulsion challenges and opportunities for high-speed transport aircraft |journal=Aeropropulsion |date=1987 |author=Strack, William |pages=437–452 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have given {{convert|500|mi|0|abbr=on}} additional range and a greater payload, making new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Q-0cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rGcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6914,3256355 |title=Fuel costs kill Second Generation of Concordes |first=Alison |last=Smale |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |date=22 September 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concorde's high cruising altitude meant passengers received almost twice the [[flux]] of extraterrestrial [[ionising radiation]] as those travelling on a conventional long-haul flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/healthcosmic/public/en_gb#4 |title=How much radiation might I be exposed to? |publisher=British Airways |accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='concradi'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/eb035011 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=E0A02B0587619C9A40D5736FCE7B3F02?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf |title=Electronic safety test replaces radioactive test source |author=Guerin, D.W. |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |year=1973 |volume=45 |issue=4 |issn=0002-2667 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Concorde's introduction, it was speculated that this exposure during supersonic travels would increase the likelihood of skin cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GfUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dnkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2948,4208 |title=Skin cancer danger linked to stratospheric jet planes |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date=1 April 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the proportionally reduced flight time, the overall [[equivalent dose]] would normally be less than a conventional flight over the same distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/healthcosmic/public/en_gb |title=Cosmic radiation |publisher=British Airways |accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual [[Solar variation|solar activity]] might lead to an increase in incident radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arctowski |first=Henryk |year=1940 |title=On Solar Faculae and Solar Constant Variations |pmid=16588370 |volume=26 |issue=6 |pmc=1078196 |pages=406–411 |doi=10.1073/pnas.26.6.406 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/26/6/406.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|bibcode=1940PNAS...26..406A}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent incidents of excessive radiation exposure, the flight deck had a radiometer and an instrument to measure the rate of decrease of radiation.&lt;ref name='concradi' /&gt; If the radiation level became too high, Concorde would descend below {{convert|47000|ft|m}}.

===Cabin pressurisation===
[[Aircraft cabin|Airliner cabins]] were usually maintained at a pressure equivalent to {{convert|6000|-|8,000|ft}} elevation. Concorde's [[Cabin pressurization|pressurisation]] was set to an altitude at the lower end of this range, {{convert|6000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/occmed/17.2.47 |url=http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/17/2/47.pdf |title=Human Factors in the Concorde |journal=Occupational Medicine |last=Hepburn |first=A.N. |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=1967 |pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concorde's maximum cruising altitude was {{convert|60000|ft|m}}; subsonic airliners typically cruise below {{convert|44000|ft|m}}.

A sudden [[Uncontrolled decompression|reduction in cabin pressure]] is hazardous to all passengers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Flight Training Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ioRTAAAAMAAJ |year=1980|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, [[Federal Aviation Administration]], Flight Standards Service, 1980 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above {{convert|50000|ft|m}}, a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a &quot;[[time of useful consciousness]]&quot; up to 10–15 seconds for a conditioned athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theairlinepilots.com/medical/decompressionandhypoxia.htm |title=Cabin Decompression and Hypoxia |first=Mark |last=Wolff |publisher=PIA Air Safety Publication |date=6 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Concorde's altitude, the air density is very low; a breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough that the plastic [[emergency oxygen system|emergency oxygen masks]] installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the event of a breach,{{sfn|Nunn|1993|p=341}} a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde's higher operating altitude, concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument |title=Interim Policy on High Altitude Cabin Decompression&amp;nbsp;– Relevant Past Practice |first=Steve |last=Happenny |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |date=24 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continuous positive airway pressure]] would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.{{sfn|Nunn|1993|p=341}}

===Flight characteristics===
[[File:Concorde at Baginton - geograph.org.uk - 156846.jpg|thumb|Concorde performing a low-level fly-by at an air show in August 1981]]

While subsonic commercial jets took eight hours to fly from New York to Paris, the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under 3.5 hours. Concorde had a maximum cruise altitude of {{convert|18300|m|ft|sigfig=3}} and an average cruise speed of {{convert|2.02|Mach|60000|sigfig=3}}, more than twice the speed of conventional aircraft.{{sfn|Schrader|1989|p=64}}

With no other civil traffic operating at its cruising altitude of about {{convert|56000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, Concorde had exclusive use of dedicated oceanic airways, or &quot;tracks&quot;, separate from the [[North Atlantic Tracks]], the routes used by other aircraft to cross the Atlantic. Due to the significantly less variable nature of high altitude winds compared to those at standard cruising altitudes, these dedicated SST tracks had fixed co-ordinates, unlike the standard routes at lower altitudes, whose co-ordinates are replotted twice daily based on forecast weather patterns ([[jetstream]]s).{{sfn|Orlebar|2004|p=84}} Concorde would also be cleared in a {{convert|15000|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=3}} block, allowing for a slow climb from {{convert|45000|to|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shanwick Oceanic Control|Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre]]: Manual of Air Traffic Services (Part 2). [[National Air Traffic Services|NATS]]&lt;/ref&gt; In regular service, Concorde employed an efficient ''cruise-climb'' flight profile following take-off.{{sfn|Orlebar|2004|p=92}}

The delta-shaped wings required Concorde to adopt a higher [[angle of attack]] at low speeds than conventional aircraft, but it allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire upper wing surface, maintaining lift.{{sfn|Orlebar|2004|p=44}} The normal landing speed was {{convert|170|mph|km/h|0}}.{{sfn|Schrader|1989|p=84}} Because of this high angle, during a landing approach Concorde was on the &quot;back side&quot; of the [[Parasitic drag|drag force]] curve, where raising the nose would increase the rate of descent; the aircraft was thus largely flown on the throttle and was fitted with an autothrottle to reduce the pilot's workload.{{sfn|Orlebar|2004|p=110}}

The aeroplane was an absolute delight to fly, it handled beautifully. And remember we are talking about an aeroplane that was being designed in the late 1950s&amp;nbsp;– mid 1960s.

===Brakes and undercarriage===

}}

Because of the way Concorde's delta-wing generated lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually strong and tall to allow for the angle of attack at low speed. At [[Rotation (aviation)|rotation]], Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation ({{convert|199|knot|disp=or}} [[indicated airspeed]]), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |title=The real story of Flight 4590: Special Investigation |publisher=iasa.com.au |date=13 May 2001 |first=David |last=Rose |access-date=26 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207121508/http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |archive-date=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels was added aft to prevent [[tailstrike]]s. The main undercarriage units swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to contract in length telescopically before swinging to clear each other when stowed.&lt;ref&gt;Brooklands Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The four main wheel tyres&lt;!-- please leave British spelling of &quot;tyres&quot; on British/French aircraft ---&gt; on each [[bogie]] unit are inflated to {{convert|232|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}. The twin-wheel nose undercarriage retracts forwards and its tyres are inflated to a pressure of {{convert|191|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}, and the wheel assembly carries a spray deflector to prevent standing water being thrown up into the engine intakes. The tyres are rated to a maximum speed on the runway of {{convert|250|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;After the Paris accident in 2000 Concorde was fitted with improved tyres uprated to {{cvt|290|mph}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The starboard nose wheel carries a single disc brake to halt wheel rotation during retraction of the undercarriage. The port nose wheel carries speed generators for the anti-skid braking system which prevents brake activation until nose and main wheels rotate at the same rate.

Additionally, due to the high average take-off speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h}}, Concorde needed upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has [[anti-lock braking system|anti-skid braking]]&amp;nbsp;– a system which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out. The brakes, developed by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]], were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Design and Engineering of Carbon Brakes |author=Stimson, I.L. |author2=R. Fisher |volume=294 |issue=1411 |date=January 1980 |pages=583–590 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |jstor=36383 |bibcode=1980RSPTA.294..583S |doi=10.1098/rsta.1980.0068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of carbon over equivalent steel brakes provided a weight-saving of {{convert|1200|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=118}} Each wheel has multiple discs which are cooled by electric fans. Wheel sensors include brake overload, brake temperature, and tyre deflation. After a typical landing at Heathrow, brake temperatures were around {{convert|300|-|400|°C|°F|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. Landing Concorde required a minimum of {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=out}} runway length, this in fact being considerably less than the shortest runway Concorde ever actually landed on, that of [[Cardiff Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concorde takes off from Cardiff|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3118506.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 January 2016|date=18 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Droop nose===
{{Main|Droop-nose}}
Concorde's drooping nose, developed by [[Marshall Aerospace|Marshall's of Cambridge]] at [[Cambridge Airport]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Concorde nose&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%201503.html |title=Droop nose |publisher=Flight International |date=12 August 1971 |pages=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due to the high angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concorde nose&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Concorde landing Farnborough Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|left|Concorde landing at [[Farnborough Aerodrome|Farnborough]] in September 1974]]
A controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below horizontal for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concorde nose&quot; /&gt;

The US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] had objected to the restrictive visibility of the visor used on the first two prototype Concordes, which had been designed before a suitable high-temperature window glass had become available, and thus requiring alteration before the FAA would permit Concorde to serve US airports. This led to the redesigned visor used on the production and the four pre-production aircraft (101, 102, 201, and 202).{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=84}} The nose window and visor glass, needed to endure temperatures in excess of {{convert|100|°C|°F|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} at supersonic flight, were developed by [[Triplex Safety Glass|Triplex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%202105.html &quot;Triplex in Concorde: The story behind the film&quot;].

When the US ban on JFK Concorde operations was lifted in February 1977, New York banned Concorde locally. The ban came to an end on 17 October 1977 when the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declined to overturn a lower court's ruling rejecting efforts by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] and a grass-roots campaign led by [[Carol Berman]] to continue the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Grady |first=Jim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/27/nyregion/neighborhood-report-rockaways-ears-ringing-it-s-cheering-over-demise-concorde.html |title=Neighborhood Report: The Rockaways; Ears Ringing?

In 1977, British Airways and [[Singapore Airlines]] shared a Concorde for flights between London and [[Singapore International Airport]] at Paya Lebar via Bahrain.

A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eZckAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=raQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2330,3152191 |title=Concorde route cut |work=Montreal Gazette |date=16 September 1980 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Mexican oil boom]], Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City's [[Benito Juárez International Airport]] via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uekpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4tIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4845,5120670 |title=French Concorde to Mexico City |work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |date=11 August 1978 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TuwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8t8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3054,6003139 |title=Supersonic Jet flights suspended |work=Daytona Beach Morning Journal |date=27 September 1982 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide economic crisis during that period resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida to the east and south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cramoisi|first1=George|title=Air Crash Investigations: The End of the Concorde Era, the Crash of Air France Flight 4590|date=2010|publisher=Lulu|isbn=978-0-557-84950-5|page=510|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aekGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of British Airways Concorde services, Britain's other major airline, [[British Caledonian]] (BCal), set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA's former Concorde director, to investigate the possibility of their own Concorde operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%200919.html &quot;B.CAL appoints Concorde consultant&quot;.] ''Flight International'', 24 March 1979, p. 881.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201617.html &quot;Caledonian reports best results&quot;.] ''Flight International'', 12 May 1979, p. 1547.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%202664.html &quot;New job for B.CAL Concorde man&quot;.] ''Flight International'', 21 July 1979, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; This was seen as particularly viable for the airline's long-haul network as there were two unsold aircraft then available for purchase.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitetails&quot;&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%200541.html &quot;B.CAL to lease unsold Concorde?&quot;.] ''Flight International'', 24 February 1979, p. 517.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Concorde_details&quot;&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201182.html &quot;Tories support B.CAL's Concorde plan&quot;.] ''Flight International'', 14 April 1979, p. 1132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;final_SST&quot;&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201348.html World News.] ''Flight International'', 28 April 1979, p. 1286.&lt;/ref&gt;

One important reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the [[British Caledonian in the 1970s#Spheres of influence|British Government's 1976 aviation policy review]] had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, as well as a partnership with BA.&lt;ref&gt;''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Thomson, A., Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, pp. 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cancel_Concorde&quot;&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%202433.html ''B.CAL drops Concorde plans but asks for Hong Kong licence''.] Flight International, 30 June 1979, p. 2331.&lt;/ref&gt; BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=BCAL's African Profit... |journal=Flight |date=23 December 1971 |page=994 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%202766.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Caledonian punchbag&quot;, ''Flight International'', 21 March 1987, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; BCal's Concorde task force did assess the viability of a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concorde_details&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cancel_Concorde&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BCAL_Concorde&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201007.html|title=1979 – 1007 – Flight Archive|work=flightglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BCal entered into a bid to acquire at least one Concorde.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitetails&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;final_SST&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BCAL_Concorde&quot; /&gt; However, BCal eventually arranged for two aircraft to be leased from BA and [[Aérospatiale]] respectively, to be maintained by either BA or Air France. BCal's envisaged two-Concorde fleet would have required a high level of aircraft usage to be cost-effective; therefore, BCal had decided to operate the second aircraft on a supersonic service between Gatwick and Atlanta, with a stopover at either Gander or Halifax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Concorde_details&quot; /&gt; Consideration was given to services to Houston and various points on its South American network at a later stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCAL_Concorde&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BCal_Package&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201711.html|title=1979 – 1711 – Flight Archive|work=flightglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both supersonic services were to be launched at some point during 1980; however, steeply rising oil prices caused by the [[1979 energy crisis]] led to BCal shelving their supersonic ambitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;cancel_Concorde&quot; /&gt;

===British Airways buys its Concordes outright===
By around 1981 in the UK, the future for Concorde looked bleak. The British government had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Sir John King]], convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then [[Nationalization|state-owned]] British Airways for £16.5&amp;nbsp;million plus the first year's profits.&lt;ref&gt;Backroom boys&amp;nbsp;– Francis Spufford&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'concewhitele'&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/632500842.html?dids=632500842:632500842&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Apr+01%2C+1984&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=The+plane+fact+is%2C+Concorde+has+broken+the+profit+barrier+for+the+first+time&amp;pqatl=google |title=The plane fact is, Concorde has broken the profit barrier for the first time |work=Chicago Tribune |first= Peter |last= Greenberg |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=1 April 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Lord [[Michael Heseltine|Heseltine]], who was the Minister responsible at the time, revealed to Alan Robb on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], that the aircraft had been sold for &quot;next to nothing&quot;. Asked by Robb if it was the worst deal ever negotiated by a government minister, he replied &quot;That is probably right. But if you have your hands tied behind your back and no cards and a very skillful negotiator on the other side of the table...

===Operating economics===
In 1983, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] accused the [[British Government]] of subsidising [[British Airways]] Concorde air fares, on which a return London–New York was £2,399 (£{{inflation|UK|2,399|1983}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}} prices), compared to £1,986 (£{{inflation|UK|1,986|1983}}) with a subsonic first class return, and London–Washington return was £2,426 (£{{inflation|UK|2,426|1983}}) instead of £2,258 (£{{inflation|UK|2,258|1983}}) subsonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1984/1984%20-%200003.html |title=Concorde fares anger Pan Am |magazine=Flight International |date=7 January 1984 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pan American World Airways Tuesday charged the British government... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/12/27/Pan-American-World-Airways-Tuesday-charged-the-British-government/2778441349200/ |accessdate=3 February 2019 |agency=UPI |date=27 December 1983 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=British Airways |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/29/business/british-airways.html |accessdate=3 February 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=29 December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research revealed that passengers thought that the fare was higher than it actually was, so the airline raised ticket prices to match these perceptions.&lt;ref name=nova&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3203_concorde.html |title=NOVA transcript: Supersonic Dream |publisher=PBS |date=18 January 2005 |quote=JOCK LOWE (Concorde Chief Pilot): We did some research which showed that the Concorde passengers actually didn't know how much the fare was.

On 10 April 2003, Air France and British Airways simultaneously announced they would retire Concorde later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title=Concorde grounded for good |work=BBC News |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=10 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cited low passenger numbers following the 25 July 2000 crash, the [[Economic effects arising from the September 11 attacks|slump in air travel]] following the [[September 11 attacks]], and rising maintenance costs: [[Airbus]] (the company that acquired Aerospatiale in 2000) had made a decision in 2003 to no longer supply replacement parts for the aircraft. Although Concorde was technologically advanced when introduced in the 1970s, 30&amp;nbsp;years later, its analogue cockpit was outdated.

It has been suggested that Concorde was not withdrawn for the reasons usually given but that it became apparent during the grounding of Concorde that the airlines could make more profit carrying first-class passengers subsonically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetravelinsider.info/2003/0411.htm |title=Concorde: An Untimely and Unnecessary Demise |work=Travel Insider |date=2003 |accessdate=13 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of commitment to Concorde from Director of Engineering Alan MacDonald was cited as having undermined BA's resolve to continue operating Concorde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concorde-spirit-tours.com/concorde.htm |title=The Betrayal of Concorde |first=Donald L. |last=Pevsner |publisher=Concorde Spirit Tours |accessdate=13 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202181316/http://www.concorde-spirit-tours.com/concorde.htm |archive-date=2 February 2010 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reasons why the attempted revival of Concorde never happened relate to the fact that the narrow fuselage did not allow for &quot;luxury&quot; features of subsonic air travel such as moving space, reclining seats and overall comfort.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/05/supersonic-flight-concorde-crash|title=Supersonic flight: will it ever rise out of the ashes of Concorde?|last=Hall|first=Dave|date=5 June 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Dave Hall, &quot;Concorde was an outdated notion of prestige that left sheer speed the only luxury of supersonic travel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

This led to rumours that they could be prepared for future flights for special occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;vafhtk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=This is not a flight of fancy: Volunteers say Concorde can realise an Olympic dream if BA will help |work=The Times|date=31 May 2006 |first=Ben |last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Air France signed a letter of agreement to donate a Concorde to the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft's retirement. On 12 June 2003, Air France honoured that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first Air France Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is on display at the Smithsonian's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy]] Center at [[Dulles Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concorde, Fox Alpha, Air France|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?object=nasm_A20030139000|publisher=Smithsnian National Air and Space Museum|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displays and restoration===
[[File:British Airways Concorde at Brooklands Museum.JPG|thumb|Concorde G-BBDG on display at [[Brooklands Museum]]|alt=]]
Concorde G-BBDG was used for test flying and trials work. It was retired in 1981 and then only used for spares. It was dismantled and transported by road from [[Filton]] to the [[Brooklands Museum]] in Surrey where it was restored from essentially a shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concordeproject.com/ |title=The Brooklands Concorde Project |publisher=Brooklands Museum |accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains open to visitors to the museum.

Concorde ''G-BOAB'', nicknamed ''Alpha Bravo'', was never modified and returned to service with the rest of British Airways' fleet, and has remained at [[London Heathrow Airport]] since its final flight, a ferry flight from JFK in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=G-BOAB (208) |url=https://www.heritageconcorde.com/g-boab-208 |website=Heritage Concorde |accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the aircraft was effectively retired, G-BOAB was used as a test aircraft for the Project Rocket interiors that were in the process of being added to the rest of BA's fleet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritageconcorde.com/project-rocket|title=Concorde Project Rocket|website=heritage-concorde|language=en|access-date=2020-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After retirement of the type, G-BOAB was moved around the apron at Heathrow several times, and can be regularly seen from other aircraft departing or arriving at the airport. Between 2017 and 2018, with its interior largely stripped of fittings and in a poor state, G-BOAB was renovated after spending 17 years exposed to the elements. Since its renovation, G-BOAB has been occasionally used by BA for apprentice training.{{cn|date=February 2020}}

One of the youngest Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at [[Musée de l'Air|Le Bourget Air and Space Museum]] in Paris. In February 2010, it was announced that the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/02/05/338114/air-france-concorde-to-taxi-again-under-own-power.html |title=Air France Concorde to taxi again under own power |work=FlightGlobal |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent was to restore the airliner to a condition where it could fly in demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8712806.stm |title=Work starts in £15m plan to get Concorde Flying |work=BBC News |date=29 May 2010 |accessdate=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air France Flight 4590===
[[File:Concorde Air France Flight 4590 fire on runway.jpg|thumb|Flight 4590 during takeoff]]

On 25 July 2000, [[Air France Flight 4590]], registration F-BTSC, crashed in [[Gonesse]], France, after departing from [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] en route to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York City, killing all 100 passengers and nine crew members on board as well as four people on the ground.&lt;!-- per MOS:NUMERAL, comparable quantities should be all spelled out or all in figures --&gt; It was the only fatal accident involving Concorde.

According to the official investigation conducted by the ''[[Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile]]'' (BEA), the crash was caused by a metallic strip that had fallen from a [[Continental Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|DC-10]] that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre&lt;!-- please leave British spelling of &quot;tyres&quot; on British/French aircraft ---&gt; on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a sudden descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.{{sfn|Endres|2001|pp=110–113}}

The claim that a metallic strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses (including the pilot of then [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]]'s aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|title=What Price Supersonic Grandeur?|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=21 December 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|archivedate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; British investigators and former French Concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the BEA report ignored, including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear. They came to the conclusion that the Concorde veered off course on the runway, which reduced takeoff speed below the crucial minimum. John Hutchinson, who had served as a Concorde captain for 15 years with British Airways, said &quot;the fire on its own should have been 'eminently survivable; the pilot should have been able to fly his way out of trouble'&quot;, had it not been for a &quot;lethal combination of operational error and 'negligence' by the maintenance department of Air France&quot; that &quot;nobody wants to talk about&quot;.&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/13/davidrose.focus |title=Concorde: The unanswered questions|series=The Observer |date=13 May 2001 |accessdate=18 April 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=David |last=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html|title=Concorde: For the Want of a Spacer|website=Iasa.com|accessdate=21 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207121508/http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html|archive-date=7 February 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askthepilot.com/untold-concorde-story/|title=Untold Story of the Concorde Disaster|website=Askthepilot.com|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the accident, Concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world with zero passenger deaths-per-kilometres travelled; but there had been two prior non-fatal accidents and a rate of tyre damage some 30 times higher than subsonic airliners from 1995 to 2000.&lt;ref name=AAIB89&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/6-1989-concorde-102-g-boaf-12-april-1989|title=Report No: 6/1989.

===Other accidents and incidents===
[[File:G-BOAF rudder damage.jpg|thumb|Damage to Concorde rudder after 1989 accident]]

Concorde had suffered two previous non-fatal accidents that were similar to each other.
* 12 April 1989: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAF, on a chartered flight from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, to Sydney, suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1.7 a &quot;thud&quot; was heard. The crew did not notice any handling problems, and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor [[Compressor stall|engine surge]]. No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40,000 feet at Mach 1.3, when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, lasting two to three minutes. Most of the upper rudder had become separated from the aircraft at this point. Aircraft handling was unaffected, and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney. The UK's [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) concluded that the skin of the rudder had been separating from the rudder structure over a period of time before the accident due to moisture seepage past the [[rivet]]s in the rudder. Furthermore, production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder, but the procedures were difficult to adhere to.&lt;ref name=AAIB89 /&gt; The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.&lt;ref name=AAIB89 /&gt;
* 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a scheduled flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a &quot;thump&quot;. No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected there had been a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and while decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden &quot;severe&quot; vibration began throughout the aircraft.&lt;ref name=AAIB93 /&gt; The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The AAIB concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.&lt;ref name=AAIB93 /&gt;
* The 2010 trial involving [[Continental Airlines]] over the crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during takeoffs, including a near-crash at [[Dulles Airport]] on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane's fuel tank and damaged the port-side engine and electrical cables, with the loss of two of the craft's hydraulic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|url-status=dead|title=Joseph A.

The only supersonic airliner in direct competition with Concorde was the Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-144]], nicknamed &quot;Concordski&quot; by Western European journalists for its outward similarity to Concorde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912014,00.html |title=Soviet Union: Christening the Concordski |work=Time |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=14 November 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been alleged that Soviet espionage efforts had resulted in the theft of Concorde blueprints, supposedly to assist in the design of the Tu-144.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Yefim. ''Tupolev Tu-144''. London: Midland, 2006. {{ISBN|1-85780-216-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of a rushed development programme, the first Tu-144 prototype was substantially different from the preproduction machines, but both were cruder than Concorde. The Tu-144''S'' had a significantly shorter range than Concorde. Jean Rech, Sud Aviation, attributed this to two things,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hans-Reichel|first1=Michael|title=Subsonic versus Supersonic Business Jets – Full Concept Comparison considering Technical, Environmental and Economic Aspects|date=2012|publisher=diplom.de|isbn=978-3-8428-2809-4|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5eNoAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a very heavy powerplant with an intake twice as long as that on Concorde, and [[Turbofan#Low-bypass turbofan|low-bypass turbofan engines]] with too-high a bypass ratio which needed afterburning for cruise. The aircraft had poor control at low speeds because of a simpler supersonic wing design; in addition the Tu-144 required [[drogue parachute|braking parachutes]] to land while Concorde used anti-lock brakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F4091EFB3954127B93C4AB178ED85F458785F9 |title=Soviet SST, in Its First Flight to the West, Arrives in Paris for Air Show |first=John L |last=Hess |work=The New York Times |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=26 May 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tu-144 had two crashes, one at the [[1973 Paris Air Show Tu-144 crash|1973 Paris Air Show]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2JwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5l8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4974,3987586 |title=Soviet SST stalls, dives into towns |first=George |last=Deruaz |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=4 June 1973 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DBsfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ko0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3185,500285 |title=Pride of Soviet air fleet explodes during exhibition |work=Sarasota Journal |date=4 June 1973 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another during a pre-delivery test flight in May 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/659730132.html?dids=659730132:659730132&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+27%2C+1978&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Russia+Confirms+Crash+of+Supersonic+Airliner+in+Test&amp;pqatl=google |title=Russia confirms crash of Supersonic Airliner in test: Latest failure of Trouble-plagued TU-144 seen as blow to Soviet hopes of expanding industry |work=Los Angeles Times |first=Dan |last=Fisher |date=27 October 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19780523-1 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Tupolev 144D CCCP-77111 Yegoryevsk |publisher=Flight Safety Foundation |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later production Tu-144 versions were more refined and competitive. They had retractable [[canard (aeronautics)|canards]] for better low-speed control, turbojet engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency and range of Concorde&lt;ref name='rus144'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20080603/109170103.html |title=The Tu-144: the future that never was |work=RIA Novosti |date=3 January 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a top speed of Mach 2.35. Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of passenger service after only 55 flights, which carried an average of 58 passengers. The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fridlyander&quot;&gt;Fridlyander, Iosif. &quot;Sad Epic of the Tu-144.&quot; ''Messenger of Russian Academy of Sciences'', №1, 2002 (in Russian: И.Н.

===SST and others===
{{further|Supersonic transport}}
The American designs, the &quot;SST&quot; project (for Supersonic Transport) were the [[Boeing 2707]] and the [[Lockheed L-2000]]. These were to have been larger, with seating for up to 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%200377.html |title=The United States SST Contenders |work=Flight International |date=13 February 1964 |pages=234–235 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Winchester|2005a|p=84}} Running a few years behind Concorde, the Boeing 2707 was redesigned to a cropped delta layout; the extra cost of these changes helped to kill the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D11F6395F127A93C7A9178AD85F4D8685F9 |title=The Russians Lead With the SST... |first=Richard D |last=Lyons |work=The New York Times |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=5 January 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of US military aircraft such as the Mach 3+ [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie]] prototypes and [[Convair B-58 Hustler]] strategic nuclear bomber had shown that sonic booms were quite capable of reaching the ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/574189232.html?dids=574189232:574189232&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;date=Dec+19%2C+1961&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune&amp;desc=B-58%27s+SONIC+BOOM+RATTLES+KENTUCKIANS&amp;pqatl=google |title=B-58's Sonic Boom Rattles Kentuckians |work=Chicago Daily Tribune |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=19 December 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the experience from the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]] led to the same environmental concerns that hindered the commercial success of Concorde. The American government cancelled its SST project in 1971, after having spent more than $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944291,00.html |title=The Nation: Showdown on the SST |work=Time |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=29 March 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Concorde's flight trials, developments in the civil aviation industry were largely accepted by governments and their respective electorates. Opposition to Concorde's noise, particularly on the east coast of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918012,00.html |title=Here Comes the Concorde, Maybe |work=Time |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=16 February 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jalc42&amp;div=28&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Legal and Environmental ramifications of the Concorde |journal=Journal of Air Law and Commerce |volume=42 |pages=433 |first=Robert M. |last=Allen |publisher=J.

Air L. &amp; Com |volume=43 |page=753 |date=1977 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Concorde led directly to the introduction of a general noise abatement programme for aircraft flying out of John F. Kennedy Airport, many found that Concorde was quieter than expected,&lt;ref name=nova /&gt; partly due to the pilots temporarily throttling back their engines to reduce noise during overflight of residential areas.{{sfn|Endres|2001||p=90}} Even before commercial flights started, it had been claimed that Concorde was quieter than many other aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/eb035013 |title=Reducing noise with type 28 nozzle |journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |year=1973 |volume=45 |issue=4 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, BAC's technical director was quoted as saying, &quot;It is certain on present evidence and calculations that in the airport context, production Concordes will be no worse than aircraft now in service and will in fact be better than many of them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Daily'', 18 February 1971, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Concorde produced nitrogen oxides in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood to result in degradation to the [[ozone layer]] at the [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] altitudes it cruised.&lt;ref name='emissions'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.270.5233.70 |title=Emission Measurements of the Concorde Supersonic Aircraft in the Lower Stratosphere |author=Fahey, D. W. |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |page=70 |issue=5233 |bibcode=1995Sci...270...70F |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible.&lt;ref name='emissions' /&gt; In 1995, David Fahey, of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce a 2 percent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 percent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 percent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-10-08/news/1995281022_1_ozone-sulfur-exhaust-particles|title=Increase in supersonic jets could be threat to ozone|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=8 October 1995|author=Newsday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concorde's technical leap forward boosted the public's understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/cjel5&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Decision Analysis in Environmental Decisionmaking: Improving the Concorde Balance |journal=Columbia Journal of Environmental Law |volume=5 |pages=156 |first=Jon |last=Anderson |publisher=HeinOnline |date=1978 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the use of [[noise barrier|acoustic fencing]] alongside [[TGV]] tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://esemag.com/archives/essay-train-a-grande-vitesse-causes-distress/ |title=Train à grande vitesse causes distress |date=November 2001 |work=Environmental Science and Engineering Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119214555/https://esemag.com/archives/essay-train-a-grande-vitesse-causes-distress/|archive-date=2018-11-19|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]] has issued [[Tranquillity#Mapping tranquillity|tranquillity maps]] since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpre.org.uk/campaigns/landscape/tranquillity/national-and-regional-tranquillity-maps |title=National and regional tranquillity maps |publisher=Campaign to Protect Rural England |accessdate=25 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914025157/http://www.cpre.org.uk/campaigns/landscape/tranquillity/national-and-regional-tranquillity-maps |archivedate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eastbound record was set by the same Air France Concorde (F-BTSD) under charter to Concorde Spirit Tours&lt;ref name=&quot;spirit&quot; /&gt; in the US on 15–16 August 1995. This promotional flight circumnavigated the world from New York/JFK International Airport in 31 hours 27 minutes 49 seconds, including six refuelling stops at [[Toulouse]], [[Dubai]], Bangkok, Andersen AFB in [[Guam]], Honolulu, and [[Acapulco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Concorde jets occupants on record ride |website=Deseret News |date=17 August 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; By its 30th flight anniversary on 2 March 1999 Concorde had clocked up 920,000 flight hours, with more than 600,000 supersonic, many more than all of the other supersonic aircraft in the Western world combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rolls-Royce SNECMA Olympus |publisher=Janes |date=25 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its way to the [[Museum of Flight]] in November 2003, G-BOAG set a New York City-to-Seattle speed record of 3 hours, 55 minutes, and 12 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofflight.org/aircraft/concorde |title=Concorde |publisher=Museum of Flight |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the restrictions on supersonic overflights within the US the flight was granted permission by the Canadian authorities for the majority of the journey to be flown supersonically over sparsely-populated Canadian territory.
