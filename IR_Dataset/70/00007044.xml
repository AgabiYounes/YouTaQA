'''Beetles''' are a group of [[insect]]s that form the [[Taxonomic rank|order]] '''Coleoptera''', in the superorder [[Endopterygota]]. Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases, [[Elytron|elytra]], distinguishing them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of all [[Family (biology)|families]], the [[Curculionidae]] (weevils), with some 83,000 member species,
belongs to this order. Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the [[polar region]]s, they interact with their [[ecosystem]]s in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and [[fungus|fungi]], break down animal and plant debris, and eat other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the [[Colorado potato beetle]], while others such as [[Coccinellidae]] (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat [[aphid]]s, [[scale insect]]s, [[thrips]], and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.

Beetles typically have a particularly hard [[exoskeleton]] including the [[Elytron|elytra]], though some such as the [[rove beetles]] have very short elytra while [[blister beetle]]s have softer elytra. The general [[anatomy]] of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in [[water beetle]]s which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are [[Endopterygota|endopterygotes]], which means that they undergo complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile [[pupa]]l stage. Some, such as [[stag beetle]]s, have a marked [[sexual dimorphism]], the males possessing enormously enlarged [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are [[aposematism|aposematic]], with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective [[camouflage]].

Beetles are prominent [[insects in culture|in human culture]], from the [[Scarab (artifact)|sacred scarabs]] of [[ancient Egypt]] to [[beetlewing]] art and use as [[pet]]s or [[insect fighting|fighting insects]] for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species are [[entomophagy|used as food]], mostly as [[larva]]e; species widely consumed include [[mealworm]]s and [[Dynastinae|rhinoceros beetle]] larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural [[Pest (organism)|pests]]. Serious pests include the [[boll weevil]] of cotton, the [[Colorado potato beetle]], the [[Brontispa longissima|coconut hispine beetle]], and the [[mountain pine beetle]]. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the [[lady beetle]]s and [[dung beetle]]s are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.

==Etymology==
[[File:Coleoptera SMNK.jpg|thumb|Coleoptera at the [[Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe]], Germany]]

The name of the taxonomic order, Coleoptera, comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''koleopteros'' (κολεόπτερος), given to the group by [[Aristotle]] for their [[elytron|elytra]], hardened shield-like forewings, from ''koleos'', sheath, and ''pteron'', wing. The English name beetle comes from the [[Old English]] word ''bitela'', little biter, related to ''bītan'' (to bite),&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|Coleoptera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology_Beetle&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|Beetle}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to [[Middle English]] ''betylle''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merriam_Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Beetle |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Beetle |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Old English name for beetle is ''ċeafor'', chafer, used in names such as [[cockchafer]], from the Proto-Germanic *''kebrô'' (&quot;beetle&quot;; compare German ''Käfer'', Dutch ''kever'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Etymology_Chafer&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|Chafer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and diversity==
Beetles are by far the largest order of insects: the roughly 400,000 species make up about 40% of all insect species so far described, and about 25% of all animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bouchard_et_al_2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilliott |first=Cedric |title=Entomology |publisher=Springer-Verlag |date=August 1995 |edition=2 |isbn=978-0-306-44967-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrTKxvZq_IcC&amp;pg=PA96 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insenc&gt;[[#refMcHugh|McHugh (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenzweig_1995&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Rosenzweig |first1=M.

==Evolution==
===Late Paleozoic===

[[File:Phylogenetic chart of Coleoptera.svg|thumb|Beetle [[genus|genera]] were mainly saprophages ([[detritivore]]s) in the [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]]. During the [[Jurassic]], [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] and then [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] genera became more common. In the [[Cenozoic]], genera at all three [[trophic level]]s became far more numerous.]]

The oldest known fossil insect that unequivocally resembles a Coleopteran is from the [[Permian|Lower Permian Period]] about {{ma|270}} (mya), though these members of the family [[Tshekardocoleidae]] have 13-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antenna]]e, [[elytra]] with more fully developed venation and more irregular longitudinal ribbing, and abdomen and [[ovipositor]] extending beyond the apex of the elytra. In the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] at the end of the Permian, some 30% of all insect species became extinct, so the fossil record of insects only includes beetles from the [[Triassic|Lower Triassic]] {{ma|220|mya}}. Around this time, during the Late Triassic, [[mycetophagous|fungus-feeding]] species such as [[Cupedidae]] appear in the fossil record. In the stages of the Upper Triassic, [[algophagous|alga-feeding]] insects such as [[Triaplidae]] and [[Hydrophilidae]] begin to appear, alongside predatory water beetles. The first weevils, including the [[Obrienidae]], appear alongside the first rove beetles ([[Staphylinidae]]), which closely resemble recent species.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt; Some entomologists are sceptical that such early insects are so closely related to present-day species, arguing that this is extremely unlikely; for example, the structure of the metepisternum suggests that the Obrienidae could be Archostemata, not weevils at all, despite fossils with weevil-like snouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimaldi |first1=David |last2=Engel |first2=Michael S. |title=Evolution of the Insects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=odQmAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA397 |year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-26877-7 |page=397 |quote=Triassic Curculionoidea have the same status as Triassic Chrysoleloidea: a relationship that is highly improbably and presently impossible to verify.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a fossil beetle was described from the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] of [[Mazon Creek fossils|Mazon Creek]], Illinois, pushing the origin of the beetles to an earlier date, {{Ma|318|299|mya}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Béthoux, Oliver |year=2009 |title=The earliest beetle identified |journal=[[Journal of Paleontology]] |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=931–937 |doi=10.1666/08-158.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fossils from this time have been found in Asia and Europe, for instance in the red slate fossil beds of Niedermoschel near Mainz, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Die Insektentaphozönose von Niedermoschel (Asselian, unt.

As a consequence of the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], the fossil record of insects is scant, including beetles from the Lower Triassic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On Permian and Triassic insect faunas in relation to biogeography and the Permian-Triassic crisis |journal=Paleontological Journal |year=2008|author=Shcherbakov, D.

===Jurassic===
During the [[Jurassic]] ({{Ma|210|145|mya}}), there was a dramatic increase in the diversity of beetle families,&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt; including the development and growth of carnivorous and herbivorous species. The [[Chrysomeloidea]] diversified around the same time, feeding on a wide array of plant hosts from [[cycad]]s and [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s to [[Flowering plants|angiosperm]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;insenc186&quot;&gt;[[#refMcHugh|McHugh (2009)]], p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; Close to the Upper Jurassic, the Cupedidae decreased, but the diversity of the early plant-eating species increased. Most recent plant-eating beetles feed on flowering plants or angiosperms, whose success contributed to a doubling of plant-eating species during the [[Middle Jurassic]]. However, the increase of the number of beetle families during the Cretaceous does not correlate with the increase of the number of angiosperm species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Labandeira |first1=C.

===Cretaceous===

The [[Cretaceous]] saw the fragmenting of the southern landmass, with the opening of the southern Atlantic Ocean and the isolation of New Zealand, while South America, Antarctica, and Australia grew more distant.&lt;ref name=&quot;insenc186&quot;/&gt; The diversity of Cupedidae and [[Archostemata]] decreased considerably. Predatory ground beetles (Carabidae) and rove beetles (Staphylinidae) began to distribute into different patterns; the [[Carabidae]] predominantly occurred in the warm regions, while the [[Staphylinidae]] and [[click beetle]]s (Elateridae) preferred temperate climates. Likewise, predatory species of [[Cleroidea]] and [[Cucujoidea]] hunted their prey under the bark of trees together with the [[jewel beetle]]s (Buprestidae). The diversity of jewel beetles increased rapidly, as they were the primary consumers of wood,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Jewel Beetles (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) from the Cretaceous of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mongolia |journal=Paleontological Journal |year=2009 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=277–281 |url=http://fossilinsects.net/pdfs/Alexeev_2009_PalJ_BuprestidaeCretaceousRussiaKazakhstanMongolia.pdf |doi=10.1134/s0031030109030058 |last1=Alexeev |first1=A.

Whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) were moderately diverse, although other early beetles (e.g. Dytiscidae) were less, with the most widespread being the species of [[Coptoclavidae]], which preyed on aquatic fly larvae.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt;

Many fossil sites worldwide contain beetles from the Cretaceous. Most are in Europe and Asia and belong to the temperate climate zone during the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=&quot;liaoning&quot;/&gt; Lower Cretaceous sites include the Crato fossil beds in the Araripe basin in the [[Ceará]], North Brazil, as well as overlying Santana formation; the latter was near the equator at that time. In Spain, important sites are near [[Serra del Montsec|Montsec]] and [[Las Hoyas]]. In Australia, the Koonwarra fossil beds of the Korumburra group, [[South Gippsland]], Victoria, are noteworthy. Major sites from the Upper Cretaceous include [[Kzyl-Dzhar]] in South Kazakhstan and [[Arkagala]] in Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;evo&quot;/&gt;

Beetle fossils are abundant in the Cenozoic; by the [[Quaternary]] (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the [[Late Miocene]] (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The [[Quaternary glaciation|large oscillations in climate]] during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved under the influence of changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coope&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coope |first1=G.

==Phylogeny==
The very large number of beetle species poses special problems for [[Linnaean taxonomy|classification]]. Some families contain tens of thousands of species, and need to be divided into subfamilies and tribes. This immense number led the evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] to quip, when some theologians asked him what could be inferred about the mind of the Creator from the works of His Creation, &quot;An inordinate fondness for beetles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutchinson_1959&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hutchinson |first1=G.

[[Polyphaga]] is the largest suborder, containing more than 300,000 described species in more than 170 families, including [[rove beetle]]s (Staphylinidae), scarab beetles ([[Scarabaeidae]]), [[blister beetle]]s (Meloidae), [[stag beetle]]s (Lucanidae) and true weevils ([[Curculionidae]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt_et_al_2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TOLweb_1995&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Polyphaga/8870 |title=Polyphaga |last1=Maddison |first1=D.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis confirms that the Coleoptera are monophyletic. Duane McKenna et al. (2015) used eight nuclear genes for 367 species from 172 of 183 Coleopteran families. They split the Adephaga into 2 clades, Hydradephaga and Geadephaga, broke up the Cucujoidea into 3 clades, and placed the Lymexyloidea within the Tenebrionoidea. The Polyphaga appear to date from the Triassic.

Beetles are generally characterized by a particularly hard [[exoskeleton]] and hard forewings ([[elytron|elytra]]) not usable for flying. Almost all beetles have mandibles that move in a horizontal plane. The mouthparts are rarely suctorial, though they are sometimes reduced; the maxillae always bear palps. The antennae usually have 11 or fewer segments, except in some groups like the Cerambycidae (longhorn beetles) and the Rhipiceridae (cicada parasite beetles). The coxae of the legs are usually located recessed within a coxal cavity. The genitalic structures are telescoped into the last abdominal segment in all extant beetles. Beetle larvae can often be confused with those of other endopterygote groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;ausbeetle&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Beetles.

This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general [[anatomy]] of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and [[appendage]]s vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; Because there are so many species, identification is quite difficult, and relies on attributes including the shape of the antennae, the [[tarsal formula]]e{{efn|These count fore, mid, and hind leg tarsal segments, such as 5-5-4.}} and shapes of these small segments on the legs, the mouthparts, and the ventral plates (sterna, pleura, coxae). In many species accurate identification can only be made by examination of the unique male genitalic structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Introduction to the Identification of Beetles (Coleoptera)| url = http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/choate/beetles.pdf |publisher=University of Florida| accessdate=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Head===

The head, having mouthparts projecting forward or sometimes downturned, is usually heavily [[Sclerotin|sclerotized]] and is sometimes very large.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt; The eyes are [[compound eye|compound]] and may display remarkable adaptability, as in the case of the aquatic whirligig beetles ([[Gyrinidae]]), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline.

[[File:Polyphylla fullo up.jpg|thumb|''[[Polyphylla fullo]]'' has distinctive fan-like [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], one of several distinct forms for the appendages among beetles.|left]]

Beetle [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] are primarily organs of sensory perception and can detect motion, odour and chemical substances,&lt;ref name='Antennae'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kerbtier.de/Pages/Themenseiten/enKoerperbau.html#Fuehler |title=3.

Beetle families may use antennae in different ways. For example, when moving quickly, tiger beetles may not be able to see very well and instead hold their antennae rigidly in front of them in order to avoid obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.3072 |pmid=24500171 |title=Static antennae act as locomotory guides that compensate for visual motion blur in a diurnal, keen-eyed predator |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=281 |issue=1779 |pages=20133072 |year=2014 |last1=Zurek |first1=D.B. |last2=Gilbert |first2=C. |pmc=3924084 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Certain Cerambycidae use antennae to balance, and blister beetles may use them for grasping. Some aquatic beetle species may use antennae for gathering air and passing it under the body whilst submerged. Equally, some families use antennae during mating, and a few species use them for defence. In the cerambycid ''[[Onychocerus albitarsis]]'', the antennae have venom injecting structures used in defence, which is unique among [[arthropod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00114-007-0316-1|pmid=18004534|title=Convergent evolution in the antennae of a cerambycid beetle, ''Onychocerus albitarsis'', and the sting of a scorpion|journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=95|issue=3|pages=257–61|year=2007|last1=Berkov|first1=Amy|last2=Rodríguez|first2=Nelson|last3=Centeno|first3=Pedro|bibcode=2008NW.....95..257B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antennae vary greatly in form, sometimes between the sexes, but are often similar within any given family. Antennae may be [[Wiktionary:clavate|clubbed]], [[Wiktionary:filiform|threadlike]], [[Wiktionary:geniculate|angled]], [[Wiktionary:moniliform|shaped like a string of beads]], [[Wiktionary:pectinate|comb-like]] (either on one side or both, bipectinate), or [[Wiktionary:serrate|toothed]]. The physical variation of antennae is important for the identification of many beetle groups. The Curculionidae have elbowed or geniculate antennae. Feather like flabellate antennae are a restricted form found in the Rhipiceridae and a few other families. The Silphidae have a capitate antennae with a spherical head at the tip. The Scarabaeidae typically have lamellate antennae with the terminal segments extended into long flat structures stacked together. The Carabidae typically have thread-like antennae. The antennae arises between the eye and the mandibles and in the Tenebrionidae, the antennae rise in front of a notch that breaks the usually circular outline of the compound eye. They are segmented and usually consist of 11 parts, the first part is called the scape and the second part is the pedicel. The other segments are jointly called the flagellum.&lt;ref name='Antennae' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bugs.bio.usyd.edu.au/learning/resources/Entomology/externalMorphology/antennaTypes.html |title=Antennae Types |publisher=University of Sydney |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Beetles, Volume I: Archostemata, Myxophaga, Adephaga, Polyphaga: Staphyliniformia |author1= Arnett, Jr., R.

Beetles have [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] like those of [[grasshopper]]s. The [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]] appear as large pincers on the front of some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see [[#Defence|defence]], below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those of the males enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

===Thorax===
The thorax is [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] into the two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the [[pronotum]], which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's [[insect wing|wings]]. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://what-when-how.com/insects/anatomy-head-thorax-abdomen-and-genitalia-insects/ |title=Anatomy: Head, Thorax, Abdomen, and Genitalia (Insects) |publisher=what-when-how.com |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acilius sulcatus.gemeiner furchenschwimmer.jpg|thumb|''[[Acilius sulcatus]]'', a diving beetle with hind legs adapted as [[Animal locomotion#Swimming|swimming]] limbs]]

===Legs===
The multisegmented [[arthropod leg|legs]] end in two to five small segments called tarsi. Like many other insect orders, beetles have claws, usually one pair, on the end of the last tarsal segment of each leg. While most beetles use their legs for walking, legs have been variously adapted for other uses. Aquatic beetles including the [[Dytiscidae|Dytiscidae (diving beetles)]], [[Haliplidae]], and many species of [[Hydrophilidae]], the legs, often the last pair, are modified for swimming, typically with rows of long hairs. Male diving beetles have suctorial cups on their forelegs that they use to grasp females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Green |first=Kristina Karlsson |last2=Kovalev |first2=Alexander |last3=Svensson |first3=Erik I. |last4=Gorb |first4=Stanislav N. |date=2013 |title=Male clasping ability, female polymorphism and sexual conflict: fine-scale elytral morphology as a sexually antagonistic adaptation in female diving beetles |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface  |volume=10 |issue=86 |page=20130409 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2013.0409 |pmc=3730688 |pmid=23825114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other beetles have [[fossorial]] legs widened and often spined for digging. Species with such adaptations are found among the scarabs, ground beetles, and [[clown beetle]]s ([[Histeridae]]). The hind legs of some beetles, such as [[flea beetle]]s (within Chrysomelidae) and flea weevils (within Curculionidae), have enlarged femurs that help them leap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/insects/find/flea-beetles/ |author1=Burkness, S. |author2=Hahn, J. |title=Flea beetles in home gardens |date=2007 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] (Extension) |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wings===
[[File: Soldier Beetle Trichodes alvearius taking off from Knapweed (cropped).jpg|thumb|Checkered beetle ''[[Trichodes alvearius]]'' taking off, showing the hard elytra (forewings adapted as wing-cases) held stiffly away from the flight wings|left]]

The forewings of beetles are not used for [[insect flight|flight]], but form elytra which cover the hind part of the body and protect the hindwings. The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hind wings to move for flight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter&quot;/&gt; However, in the soldier beetles ([[Cantharidae]]), the elytra are soft, earning this family the name of leatherwings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Leatherwing (Soldier) Beetles |author1=Philips, Chris |author2=Fread, Elizabeth |author3=Kuhar, Tom  | accessdate = 14 March 2017| url = http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/ENTO/ENTO-53/ENTO-53-pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other soft wing beetles include the [[Lycidae|net-winged beetle]] ''[[Calopteron discrepans]]'', which has brittle wings that rupture easily in order to release chemicals for defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/beetles/banded_net-winged_beetle.htm |title=Calopteron discrepans (Newman) (Insecta: Coleoptera: Lycidae) |author1=Donald W. Hall |author2=Marc A. Branham |date=2016 |publisher=[[University of Florida]] |accessdate=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetles' flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and stored below the elytra. A fold (''jugum'') of the membrane at the base of each wing is characteristic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Insects, their structure and life |first=George Herbert |last=Carpenter |year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some beetles have lost the ability to fly. These include some ground beetles (Carabidae) and some true weevils (Curculionidae), as well as desert- and cave-dwelling species of other families. Many have the two elytra fused together, forming a solid shield over the abdomen. In a few families, both the ability to fly and the elytra have been lost, as in the [[glowworm|glow-worms]] ([[Phengodidae]]), where the females [[Larviform female|resemble larvae]] throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://delta-intkey.com/elateria/www/phenmplf.htm |title=''Elateriformia'' (Coleoptera): descriptions, illustrations, identification, and information retrieval for families and subfamilies |author1=Lawrence, J.

J. |date=2005 |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of elytra and wings does not always indicate that the beetle will fly. For example, the [[tansy beetle]] walks between habitats despite being physically capable of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beenen, R |author2=Winkelman, J.

===Abdomen===
The [[abdomen]] is the section behind the metathorax, made up of a series of rings, each with a hole for breathing and respiration, called a [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]], composing three different segmented sclerites: the tergum, pleura, and the sternum. The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle. The sternum is the most widely visible part of the abdomen, being a more or less sclerotized segment. The abdomen itself does not have any appendages, but some (for example, [[Mordellidae]]) have articulating sternal lobes.&lt;ref name=&quot;American&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnett|first1=Ross H., Jr |last2=Thomas |first2=Michael C. |title=American Beetles, Volume I: Archostemata, Myxophaga, Adephaga, Polyphaga: Staphyliniformia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJjSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 |year=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4822-7432-5 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomy and physiology==&lt;!--or, Body systems--&gt;
[[File:Internal morphology of Coleoptera.svg|upright=1.7&lt;!--diagram with small captions--&gt;|thumb|A beetle's body systems]]

===Digestive system===
The [[digestive system]] of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place mostly in the anterior [[midgut]], although in predatory groups like the [[Carabidae]], most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the [[Elateridae]], the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow [[pharynx]], a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed [[gizzard]]. This is followed by the midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of [[cecum]], and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six [[Malpighian tubule]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

===Nervous system===
The [[nervous system]] in beetles contains all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and seven or eight abdominal ganglia which can be distinguished to that in which all the thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

===Respiratory system===
[[File:DytiscusSpiracles.png|thumb|''[[Dytiscus]]'' [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s (right) on upper side of abdomen, normally covered by the elytra, are in contact with an air bubble when the beetle dives.|left|175x175px]]Like most insects, beetles inhale air, for the [[oxygen]] it contains, and exhale [[carbon dioxide]], via a [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]]. Air enters the body through [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s, and circulates within the haemocoel in a system of [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]] and tracheoles, through whose walls the gases can diffuse.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

Diving beetles, such as the [[Dytiscidae]], carry a bubble of air with them when they dive. Such a bubble may be contained under the elytra or against the body by specialized [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] hairs. The bubble covers at least some of the spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; The function of the bubble is not only to contain a store of air but to act as a [[Gill#Plastron|physical gill]]. The air that it traps is in contact with oxygenated water, so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in the bubble, more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1242/jeb.070276 |pmid=23255190 |title=Physical gills in diving insects and spiders: Theory and experiment |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=216 |issue=2 |pages=164–70 |year=2012 |last1=Seymour |first1=Roger S. |last2=Matthews |first2=Philip G. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the bubble, and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the bubble and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of the bubble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schmidt-Nielsen |first=Knut |title=Animal Physiology: Adaptation and Environment |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=Af7IwQWJoCMC&amp;pg=PA55|edition=5th |date=January 15, 1997|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-57098-5 |page=55 |chapter=Insect Respiration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circulatory system===
Like other insects, beetles have [[open circulatory system]]s, based on [[hemolymph]] rather than blood. As in other insects, a segmented tube-like heart is attached to the dorsal wall of the [[circulatory system#Nonhuman|hemocoel]]. It has paired inlets or ''ostia'' at intervals down its length, and circulates the hemolymph from the main cavity of the haemocoel and out through the anterior cavity in the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Miller |first=T. A. |editor1=Kerkut, G. A. |editor2=Gilbert, L. I. |title=Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry and Pharmacology.

===Specialized organs===
Different glands are specialized for different pheromones to attract mates. Pheromones from species of [[Rutelinae]] are produced from [[epithelium|epithelial cell]]s lining the inner surface of the apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of [[Melolonthinae]] are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. [[Dermestidae|Dermestid]]s produce [[ester]]s, and species of [[Elateridae]] produce [[aldehyde|fatty acid-derived aldehyde]]s and [[acetate]]s.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces backed with reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by [[bioluminescence]]. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of [[Firefly luciferin|luciferin]] catalyzed by enzymes ([[luciferase]]s) in the presence of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) and oxygen, producing [[oxyluciferin]], carbon dioxide, and light.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

[[Tympanal organ]]s or hearing organs consist of a membrane (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons, are found in two families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scoble&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Scoble, M. J. |title=The Lepidoptera: Form, function, and diversity |url=https://archive.org/details/lepidopteraformf0000scob |url-access=registration |year=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several species of the genus ''[[Cicindela]]'' (Carabidae) have hearing organs on the dorsal surfaces of their first abdominal segments beneath the wings; two tribes in the [[Dynastinae]] (within the [[Scarabaeidae]]) have hearing organs just beneath their pronotal shields or neck membranes. Both families are sensitive to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence indicating they function to detect the presence of bats by their ultrasonic echolocation.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

==Reproduction and development==
Beetles are members of the [[Order (biology)|superorder]] [[Endopterygota]], and accordingly most of them undergo complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], the [[larva]], the [[pupa]], and the [[imago]] or adult. The larvae are commonly called [[Larva|grubs]] and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final [[instar]]. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families [[Meloidae]] and [[Rhipiphoridae]], go further, undergoing [[hypermetamorphosis]] in which the first instar takes the form of a [[triungulin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242221698 |author1=Ozbek, H. |author2=Szalokia, D. |date=1998 |title=A contribution to the knowledge of the Meloidae (Coleoptera) fauna of Turkey along with new record |journal=Turkish Journal of Zoology |volume=22 |pages=23–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mating===
[[File:Punctate Flower Chafer.jpg|thumb|[[Punctate flower chafer]]s (''Neorrhina punctata'', Scarabaeidae) mating]]

Some beetles have intricate mating behaviour. [[Pheromone]] communication is often important in locating a mate.
Different species use different pheromones. Scarab beetles such as the [[Rutelinae]] use pheromones derived from [[fatty acid synthesis]], while other scarabs such as the [[Melolonthinae]] use [[amino acid]]s and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates is seen in the [[Firefly|fireflies]] (Lampyridae) which are [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]], with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in a complex dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

Before mating, males and females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his antennae on her head, palps, and antennae. In ''[[Eupompha]]'', the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all if they do not perform the precopulatory ritual.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a [[Russia]]n population of [[tansy Beetle|tansy beetle]] (''Chysolina graminis'') is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Medvedev, L. N. |author2=Pavlov, S. I. |date=1988 |title=Mating behavior of the Chrysomelidae (Coleoptera) |journal=Entomological Review |volume=67 |pages=100–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Competition (biology)|Competition]] can play a part in the mating rituals of species such as [[burying beetle]]s (''Nicrophorus''), the insects fighting to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]]s are transferred to the female to [[fertilization|fertilize]] the egg.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

===Life cycle===
[[File:Life cycle of stag beetle.svg|thumb|300px|The life cycle of the [[stag beetle]] includes three [[instar]]s.]]

====Egg====
Essentially all beetles lay eggs, though some [[myrmecophily|myrmecophilous]] [[Aleocharinae]] and some [[Chrysomelinae]] which live in mountains or the subarctic are [[ovoviviparous]], laying eggs which hatch almost immediately. Beetle eggs generally have smooth surfaces and are soft, though the [[Cupedidae]] have hard eggs. Eggs vary widely between species: the eggs tend to be small in species with many instars (larval stages), and in those that lay large numbers of eggs.
A female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime, depending on the extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]], which house, feed and protect their young. The [[Attelabidae]] roll leaves and lay their eggs inside the roll for protection.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;&lt;ref name=Crowson&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowson |first=R.

====Larva====
The [[larva]] is usually the principal feeding stage of the beetle [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most [[Buprestidae]] and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species, but can be as long as several years. The larvae of [[skin beetle]]s undergo a degree of reversed development when starved, and later grow back to the previously attained level of maturity. The cycle can be repeated many times (see [[Biological immortality]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=S. D. |last2=Bharadwaj |first2=R. K. |year=1972 |title=Reversed development and cellular ageing in an insect |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=178 |pages=1210–1211 |bibcode=1972Sci...178.1210B |doi=10.1126/science.178.4066.1210 |pmid=4637808 |issue=4066}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larval morphology is highly varied amongst species, with well-developed and sclerotized heads, distinguishable thoracic and abdominal segments (usually the tenth, though sometimes the eighth or ninth).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Hercules beetle (larva).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Scarabaeoidea|Scarabaeiform]] larva of [[Hercules beetle]]]]

Beetle larvae can be differentiated from other insect larvae by their hardened, often darkened heads, the presence of chewing mouthparts, and [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s along the sides of their bodies. Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the [[click beetle]] (Elateridae) and [[darkling beetle]] (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the [[Scarabaeoidea]] have short, thick larvae described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/scarabaeiform |title=Definition of 'Scarabaeiform' |publisher=[[Amateur Entomologists' Society]] |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All beetle larvae go through several [[instar]]s, which are the developmental stages between each [[ecdysis|moult]]. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the [[planidium]]) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as [[hypermetamorphosis]]; it occurs in the [[Meloidae]], [[Micromalthidae]], and [[Ripiphoridae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Krinsky, W. L. |editor1=Mullen, G. R. |editor2=Durden, L. A. |date=2009 |title=Medical and Veterinary Entomology |edition=2nd |chapter=8 Beetles (''Coleoptera'') |pages=101–115 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=978-0-12-372500-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blister beetle ''[[Epicauta vittata]]'' (Meloidae), for example, has three distinct larval stages. Its first stage, the [[triungulin]], has longer legs to go in search of the eggs of grasshoppers. After feeding for a week it moults to the second stage, called the caraboid stage, which resembles the larva of a [[Carabidae|carabid beetle]]. In another week it moults and assumes the appearance of a [[Scarabaeidae|scarabaeid larva]] – the scarabaeidoid stage. Its penultimate larval stage is the pseudo-pupa or the coarcate larva, which will overwinter and pupate until the next spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bugguide.net/node/view/149686 |title=Hypermetamorphosis of Striped Blister Beetle – ''Epicauta vittata'' |date=2007 |publisher=BugGuide |accessdate=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larval period can vary widely. A fungus feeding staphylinid ''[[Phanerota fasciata]]'' undergoes three moults in 3.2 days at room temperature while ''Anisotoma'' sp. (Leiodidae) completes its larval stage in the fruiting body of slime mold in 2 days and possibly represents the fastest growing beetles. Dermestid beetles, ''Trogoderma inclusum'' can remain in an extended larval state under unfavourable conditions, even reducing their size between moults. A larva is reported to have survived for 3.5 years in an enclosed container.&lt;ref name=insenc /&gt;

====Pupa and adult====
[[File:Eburia quadrigeminata.jpg|thumb|The ivory-marked beetle, ''[[Eburia quadrigeminata]]'', may live up to 40 years inside the [[hardwood]]s on which the larva feeds.]]

As with all endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these [[pupa]]e emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or [[imago]]s. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the appendages are not attached to the body and are said to be [[exarate]]; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as [[Pupa#Position in life cycle|obtect]] pupae).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;

Adults have extremely variable lifespans, from weeks to years, depending on the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilliott&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ausbeetle&quot; /&gt; Some wood-boring beetles can have extremely long life-cycles. It is believed that when furniture or house timbers are infested by beetle larvae, the timber already contained the larvae when it was first sawn up. A [[birch]] bookcase 40 years old released adult ''[[Eburia quadrigeminata]]'' ([[Cerambycidae]]), while ''[[Buprestis aurulenta]]'' and other [[Buprestidae]] have been documented as emerging as much as 51 years after manufacture of wooden items.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zeng&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zeng|first1=Yong|title=Longest Life Cycle|url=http://entnemdept.ifas.ufl.edu/walker/ufbir/chapters/chapter_12.shtml|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=17 March 2017|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour==
===Locomotion===
[[File:Photinus pyralis Firefly 2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Photinus pyralis]]'', firefly, in flight]]

The elytra allow beetles to both fly and move through confined spaces, doing so by folding the delicate wings under the elytra while not flying, and folding their wings out just before takeoff. The unfolding and folding of the wings is operated by muscles attached to the wing base; as long as the tension on the radial and cubital veins remains, the wings remain straight. In some day-flying species (for example, [[Buprestidae]], [[Scarabaeidae]]), flight does not include large amounts of lifting of the elytra, having the metathorac wings extended under the lateral elytra margins.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; The altitude reached by beetles in flight varies. One study investigating the flight altitude of the ladybird species ''[[Coccinella septempunctata]]'' and ''[[Harmonia axyridis]]'' using radar showed that, whilst the majority in flight over a single location were at 150–195&amp;nbsp;m above ground level, some reached altitudes of over 1100&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeffries, Daniel L. |author2=Chapman, Jason |author3=Roy, Helen E. |author3-link=Helen Roy |author4=Humphries, Stuart |author5=Harrington, Richard |author6=Brown, Peter M.

Many rove beetles have greatly reduced elytra, and while they are capable of flight, they most often move on the ground: their soft bodies and strong abdominal muscles make them flexible, easily able to wriggle into small cracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=3218–3219 |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |first1=John L. |last1= Capinera |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2008 |edition=2 |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic beetles use several techniques for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain a layer of air against their bodies. Adult crawling [[water beetle]]s use both their elytra and their hind [[Arthropod leg|coxa]]e (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while [[whirligig beetle]]s simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=2001 |chapter=Haliplidae |pages=138–143 |author1=Arnett R. H., Jr. |author2=Thomas, M. C. |title=American Beetles, Volume 1 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-1925-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
Beetles have a variety of ways to communicate, including the use of [[pheromone]]s. The [[mountain pine beetle]] emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. This species can [[stridulate]] to communicate,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beetle love&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/v-g/dpp-mpb/sec2/dpp-mpb2b.aspx|title=Mountain Pine Beetle – Beetle Love|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but others may use sound to defend themselves when attacked.&lt;ref name= &quot;stridulation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= Meyer-Rochow| first= V.B.| title= Observations on stridulating Australian beetles (Hydrophilidae, Cerambycidae, Passalidae, Dynastinae) using scanning electron microscopical and electrophysiological techniques| journal=Forma et Functio | date=1971| volume= 4| pages= 326–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parental care===
[[File:Scarabaeus laticollis.jpg|upright|thumb|right|A dung beetle rolling dung]]
Parental care is found in a few families&lt;ref&gt;Brandmayr P. 1992. Short review of the presocial evolution in Coleoptera. Ethol Ecol Evol. 4:7–16.&lt;/ref&gt; of beetle, perhaps for protection against adverse conditions and predators.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt; The rove beetle ''[[Bledius spectabilis]]'' lives in [[salt marsh]]es, so the eggs and larvae are endangered by the rising [[tide]]. The maternal beetle patrols the eggs and larvae, burrowing to keep them from flooding and [[asphyxiation|asphyxiating]], and protects them from the predatory carabid beetle ''[[Dicheirotrichus gustavi]]'' and from the [[parasitism|parasitoidal]] wasp ''[[Barycnemis blediator]]'', which kills some 15% of the larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wyatt, T. D. |author2=Foster, W.

[[Burying beetle]]s are attentive parents, and participate in cooperative care and feeding of their offspring. Both parents work to bury small animal carcass to serve as a food resource for their young and build a brood chamber around it. The parents prepare the carcass and protect it from competitors and from early decomposition. After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae clean of fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Milne|first=Lorus J.|last2=Milne|first2=Margery J.|date=1944|title=Notes on the Behavior of Burying Beetles (Nicrophorus spp.)|jstor=25005075|journal=Journal of the New York Entomological Society|volume=52|issue=4|pages=311–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[dung beetle]]s provide parental care, collecting herbivore dung and laying eggs within that food supply, an instance of [[mass provisioning]]. Some species do not leave after this stage, but remain to safeguard their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Hanski |first1=Ilkka |last2=Yves |first2=Cambefort| title=Dung Beetle Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1991 |pages=626–672 |isbn=978-0-691-08739-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most species of beetles do not display parental care behaviors after the eggs have been laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/beetle|title=Beetle {{!}} San Diego Zoo Animals &amp; Plants|website=animals.sandiegozoo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eusociality===
[[Eusociality]] involves cooperative brood care (including brood care of offspring from other individuals), overlapping generations within a colony of adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Crespi, B.

Beetles are able to exploit a wide diversity of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are [[omnivore]]s, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. [[Ground beetle]]s and [[rove beetle]]s ([[Staphylinidae]]), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other [[arthropod]]s and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zin.ru/animalia/coleoptera/eng/biol3.htm|title=feeding|author=Lobanov, A.L. |year=2002|work=Beetle Biology And Ecology|publisher=Beetles (Coleoptera) and Coleopterologist|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decaying organic matter is a primary diet for many species. This can range from [[Feces|dung]], which is consumed by [[coprophagous]] species (such as certain [[dung beetle|scarab beetle]]s in the [[Scarabaeidae]]), to dead animals, which are eaten by [[necrophagous]] species (such as the [[carrion beetle]]s, [[Silphidae]]). Some beetles found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the [[Histeridae]] and [[Silphidae]], preying on the larvae of [[Coprophagia|coprophagous]] and [[Scavenger|necrophagous]] insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Islam, M. |author2=Hossain, A. |author3=Mostafa, M.

===Anti-predator adaptations===
Beetles, both adults and larvae, are the prey of many animal [[predator]]s including [[mammals]] from [[bat]]s to [[rodent]]s, [[birds]], [[lizard]]s, [[amphibians]], [[fishes]], [[dragonflies]], [[Asilidae|robberflies]], [[Reduviidae|reduviid bugs]], [[ant]]s, other beetles, and [[spider]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans27&quot;&gt;[[#refEvans|Evans &amp; Bellamy (2000)]], pp. 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cott, H.

These include [[camouflage]] and [[mimicry]] against predators that hunt by sight, toxicity, and defensive behaviour.

====Camouflage====
{{further|Camouflage}}
Camouflage is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as [[leaf beetle]]s (Chrysomelidae, which are often green) and [[weevil]]s. In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the [[avocado]] weevil ''[[Heilipus apiatus]]'' to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans27&quot;/&gt; Many beetles that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of that substrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans126&quot;&gt;[[#refEvans|Evans &amp; Bellamy (2000)]], p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mimicry and aposematism====
[[File:Clyte bélier - MHNT - Vue dorsale.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Clytus arietis]]'' ([[Longhorn beetle|Cerambycidae]]), a [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimic]] of wasps]]
{{further|Mimicry|Aposematism}}

Some [[longhorn beetle]]s (Cerambycidae) are effective [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of [[wasp]]s. Beetles may combine coloration with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many other beetles, including [[Coccinellidae|ladybirds]], [[blister beetle]]s, and [[Lycidae|lycid beetles]] secrete distasteful or toxic substances to make them unpalatable or poisonous, and are often [[aposematic]], where bright or contrasting [[animal coloration|coloration]] warn off predators; many beetles and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Blister beetle (26390828032).jpg|thumb|Blister beetles such as ''[[Hycleus]]'' have brilliant [[aposematic]] coloration, warning of their toxicity.]]
[[File:Bloody -nosed Beetle^ Timarcha tenebricosa - Flickr - gailhampshire.jpg|thumb|The bloody-nosed beetle, ''[[Timarcha tenebricosa]]'', [[antipredator adaptation|defending itself]] by releasing a droplet of noxious red liquid (base of leg, on right)|left|172x172px]]

Chemical defense is important in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some [[Tenebrionidae]] use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection from a wide range of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans126&quot;/&gt;

Other species have special glands to produce deterrent chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce a variety of [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[phenol]]s, [[quinone]]s, [[ester]]s, and [[acid]]s released from an opening at the end of the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, ''[[Anthia]]'' and ''[[Thermophilum]]'' – ''Thermophilum'' is sometimes included within ''[[Anthia]]'') employ the same chemicals as ants: [[formic acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans&quot;&gt;[[#refEvans|Evans &amp; Bellamy (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bombardier beetle]]s have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for [[hydroquinone]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], the other holding hydrogen peroxide and [[catalase]] enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around {{convert|100|C|F}}, with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.&lt;ref name=insenc/&gt;

====Other defences====
Large ground-dwelling beetles such as [[Carabidae]], the [[rhinoceros beetle]] and the longhorn beetles defend themselves using strong [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]], or heavily sclerotised (armored) spines or horns to deter or fight off predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans126&quot;/&gt; Many species of weevil that feed out in the open on leaves of plants react to attack by employing a drop-off reflex. Some combine it with [[thanatosis]], in which they close up their appendages and &quot;play dead&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;insenc199&quot;&gt;[[#refMcHugh|McHugh (2009)]], p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; The click beetles ([[Elateridae]]) can suddenly catapult themselves out of danger by releasing the energy stored by a click mechanism, which consists of a stout spine on the prosternum and a matching groove in the mesosternum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans27&quot;/&gt; Some species startle an attacker by producing sounds through a process known as [[stridulation]].&lt;ref name= &quot;stridulation&quot;/&gt;

===Parasitism===
A few species of beetles are [[Parasitism#Types|ectoparasitic]] on mammals. One such species, ''[[Platypsyllus castoris]]'', parasitises beavers ([[Beaver|''Castor'']] spp.). This beetle lives as a parasite both as a larva and as an adult, feeding on epidermal tissue and possibly on skin secretions and wound exudates.

Beetle-pollinated flowers are usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to decaying organic material. Beetles were most likely the first insects to pollinate flowers.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include [[Pollination trap|traps]] to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle families that habitually pollinate flowers are the [[Buprestidae]], [[Cantharidae]], [[Cerambycidae]], [[Cleridae]], [[Dermestidae]], [[Lycidae]], [[Melyridae]], [[Mordellidae]], [[Sap beetle|Nitidulidae]] and [[Scarabaeidae]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gullan&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Gullan |first=P.

[[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]] is well known in a few beetles, such as the [[ambrosia beetle]], which partners with fungi to digest the wood of dead trees. The beetles excavate tunnels in dead trees in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal [[symbiont]]. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malloch&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Malloch|first1= D. |last2= Blackwell |first2= M. |year=1993|chapter=Dispersal biology of ophiostomatoid fungi|pages= 195–206 |title=Ceratocystis and Ophiostoma: Taxonomy, Ecology and Pathology |editor1= Wingfield, M.

About 90% of beetle species enter a period of adult [[diapause]], a quiet phase with reduced metabolism to tide unfavourable environmental conditions. Adult diapause is the most common form of diapause in Coleoptera. To endure the period without food (often lasting many months) adults prepare by accumulating reserves of lipids, glycogen, proteins and other substances needed for resistance to future hazardous changes of environmental conditions. This diapause is induced by signals heralding the arrival of the unfavourable season; usually the cue is [[photoperiodic]]. Short (decreasing) day length serves as a signal of approaching winter and induces winter diapause (hibernation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hodek |first1=Ivo |title=Review Article: Adult Diapause in Coleoptera |journal=Psyche: A Journal of Entomology |volume=2012 |pages=1–10 |date=2012 |doi=10.1155/2012/249081 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of hibernation in the Arctic beetle ''[[Pterostichus brevicorni]]'' showed that the body fat levels of adults were highest in autumn with the [[alimentary canal]] filled with food, but empty by the end of January. This loss of body fat was a gradual process, occurring in combination with dehydration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hibernation in the Arctic Beetle, Pterostichus brevicornis, in Alaska |author1=Kaufmann, T. |date=1971 |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=81–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fogstand beetle of the [[Namib Desert]], ''[[Stenocara gracilipes]]'', is able to [[fog collection|collect water from fog]], as its elytra have a textured surface combining [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (water-loving) bumps and waxy, [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] troughs.

Some terrestrial beetles that exploit shoreline and floodplain habitats have physiological adaptations for surviving floods. In the event of flooding, adult beetles may be mobile enough to move away from flooding, but larvae and pupa often cannot. Adults of ''[[Cicindela togata]]'' are unable to survive immersion in water, but larvae are able to survive a prolonged period, up to 6 days, of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxia]] during floods. Anoxia tolerance in the larvae may have been sustained by switching to anaerobic metabolic pathways or by reducing metabolic rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hoback, W.

===As biodiversity indicators===

Due to their habitat specificity, many species of beetles have been suggested as suitable as indicators, their presence, numbers, or absence providing a measure of habitat quality. Predatory beetles such as the tiger beetles ([[Cicindelidae]]) have found scientific use as an indicator taxon for measuring regional patterns of biodiversity. They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and simple to observe when visiting a site; they occur around the world in many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pearson |first1=David L. |last2=Cassola |first2=Fabio |title=World-Wide Species Richness Patterns of Tiger Beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae): Indicator Taxon for Biodiversity and Conservation Studies |journal=Conservation Biology |date=1992 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=376–391 |jstor=2386038 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1992.06030376.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove beetles in human-modified habitats, dung beetles in savannas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00743.x |title=The verification and application of bioindicators: A case study of dung beetles in a savanna ecosystem |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=661 |year=2002 |last1=McGeoch |first1=Melodie A. |last2=Van Rensburg |first2=Berndt J. |last3=Botes |first3=Antoinette}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saproxylic beetles in forests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.04.013|title=Saproxylic beetles as indicator species for dead-wood amount and temperature in European beech forests |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=23 |pages=323–331 |year=2012 |last1=Lachat |first1=Thibault |last2=Wermelinger |first2=Beat |last3=Gossner |first3=Martin M. |last4=Bussler |first4=Heinz |last5=Isacsson |first5=Gunnar |last6=Müller |first6=Jörg}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been suggested as potential indicator species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00043-2 |title=Staphylinid beetles as bioindicators |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment |volume=74 |issue=1–3 |pages=357–372 |year=1999 |last1=Bohac |first1=Jaroslav|url=http://www.zin.ru/animalia/coleoptera/pdf/bohac_1999_357-372.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.496.4273 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] funded project implanted electrodes into ''[[Mecynorhina torquata]]'' beetles, allowing them to be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held on its back, as proof-of-concept for surveillance work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/411814/the-armys-remote-controlled-beetle/ |title=The Army's Remote-Controlled Beetle |last1=Singer |first1=Emily |date=2009-01-29 |magazine=MIT Technology Review |accessdate=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar technology has been applied to enable a human operator to control the free-flight steering and walking gaits of  ''[[Mecynorhina torquata]]'' as well as graded turning and backward walking of  ''[[Zophobas morio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Insect–computer hybrid legged robot with user-adjustable speed, step length and walking gait |last1=Cao |first1=Feng |last2=Zhang |first2=Chao |author3=Hao Yu Choo |last4=Sato |first4=Hirotaka |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date=2016 |volume=13 |issue=116 |pages=20160060 |doi=10.1098/rsif.2016.0060|pmid=27030043 |pmc=4843679 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sato |first=Hirotaka |last2=Doan |first2=Tat Thang Vo |last3=Kolev |first3=Svetoslav |last4=Huynh |first4=Ngoc Anh |last5=Zhang |first5=Chao |last6=Massey |first6=Travis L. |last7=Kleef |first7=Joshua van |last8=Ikeda |first8=Kazuo |last9=[[Pieter Abbeel|Abbeel]] |first9=Pieter |date=2015-03-16 |title=Deciphering the Role of a Coleopteran Steering Muscle via Free Flight Stimulation |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)00083-4 |journal=Current Biology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=798–803 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.01.051|pmid=25784033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vo Doan |first=Tat Thang |last2=Tan |first2=Melvin Y.W. |last3=Bui |first3=Xuan Hien |last4=Sato |first4=Hirotaka |date=2017-11-03 |title=An Ultralightweight and Living Legged Robot |journal=Soft Robotics |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17–23 |doi=10.1089/soro.2017.0038|pmid=29412086 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In conservation===

Since beetles form such a large part of the world's biodiversity, their conservation is important, and equally, loss of habitat and biodiversity is essentially certain to impact on beetles. Many species of beetles have very specific habitats and long life cycles that make them vulnerable. Some species are highly threatened while others are already feared extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kotze |first=D.

In Japan the Genji firefly, ''[[Luciola cruciata]]'', is extremely popular, and in South Africa the Addo elephant dung beetle offers promise for broadening [[ecotourism]] beyond the [[big five game|big five tourist mammal species]]. Popular dislike of pest beetles, too, can be turned into public interest in insects, as can unusual ecological adaptations of species like the fairy shrimp hunting beetle, ''[[Cicinis bruchi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=New |first=T.
