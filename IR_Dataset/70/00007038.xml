Signs and symptoms of candidiasis vary depending on the area affected.&lt;ref name=&quot;ID10&quot; /&gt; Most candidal infections result in minimal complications such as redness, itching, and discomfort, though complications may be severe or even fatal if left untreated in certain populations. In healthy ([[immunocompetence|immunocompetent]]) persons, candidiasis is usually a localized infection of the skin, fingernails or toenails (onychomycosis), or mucosal membranes, including the [[oral cavity]] and [[pharynx]] ([[oral thrush|thrush]]), [[esophagus]], and the genitalia ([[vagina]], [[penis]], etc.);&lt;ref name=&quot;Medscape clinical&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baron&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Walsh TJ, Dixon DM |chapter=Deep Mycoses |title=Baron's Medical Microbiology |editor=Baron S |edition=4th |publisher=Univ of Texas Medical Branch |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-9631172-1-2 |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.4006 |display-editors=etal |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201115047/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.section.4006 |archive-date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thrush - 2015 review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patil S, Rao RS, Majumdar B, Anil S | title = Clinical Appearance of Oral Candida Infection and Therapeutic Strategies | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 1391 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26733948 | pmc = 4681845 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2015.01391 }}&lt;/ref&gt; less commonly in healthy individuals, the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24789109&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martins N, Ferreira IC, Barros L, Silva S, Henriques M | title = Candidiasis: predisposing factors, prevention, diagnosis and alternative treatment | journal = Mycopathologia | volume = 177 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 223–40 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24789109 | doi = 10.1007/s11046-014-9749-1 | quote = Candida species and other microorganisms are involved in this complicated fungal infection, but Candida albicans continues to be the most prevalent.

Although IFI associated with digestive diseases are less common, they can induce fatal outcomes due to less specificity of related symptoms, signs, endoscopic and imaging manifestations, and the poor treatment options.&amp;nbsp;... Candida sp. is also the most frequently identified species among patients with gastric IFI.&amp;nbsp;...  Gastric IFI is often characterised by the abdominal pain and vomiting and with the endoscopic characteristics including gastric giant and multiple ulcers, stenosis, perforation, and fistula.

Candidiasis is known to cause GI symptoms particularly in immunocompromised patients or those receiving steroids or antibiotics. However, only recently, there is emerging literature that an overgrowth of fungus in the small intestine of non-immunocompromised subjects may cause unexplained GI symptoms. Two recent studies showed that 26 % (24/94) and 25.3 % (38/150) of a series of patients with unexplained GI symptoms had SIFO. The most common symptoms observed in these patients were belching, bloating, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, and gas. The underlying mechanism(s) that predisposes to SIFO is unclear but small intestinal dysmotility and use of proton pump inhibitors has been implicated. However, further studies are needed; both to confirm these observations and to examine the clinical relevance of fungal overgrowth, both in healthy subjects and in patients with otherwise unexplained GI symptoms.&amp;nbsp;... For routine SIFO in an immunocompetent host, a 2–3 week oral course of fluconazole 100–200 mg will suffice. }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[urinary tract]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24789109&quot; /&gt; and [[respiratory tract]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24789109&quot; /&gt; are sites of candida infection.

Diagnosis of a yeast infection is done either via microscopic examination or culturing.  For identification by light microscopy, a scraping or swab of the affected area is placed on a [[microscope slide]]. A single drop of 10% [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution is then added to the specimen. The KOH dissolves the skin cells, but leaves the ''Candida'' cells intact, permitting visualization of [[hyphae|pseudohyphae]] and budding [[yeast cell]]s typical of many ''Candida'' species.

For the culturing method, a sterile swab is rubbed on the infected skin surface. The swab is then streaked on a culture medium. The culture is incubated at 37&amp;nbsp;°C (98.6&amp;nbsp;°F) for several days, to allow development of yeast or bacterial colonies. The characteristics (such as morphology and colour) of the colonies may allow initial diagnosis of the organism causing disease symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guarner Brandt 2011 pp. 247–280&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Guarner | first=J. | last2=Brandt | first2=M.

The 2016 revision of the [[clinical practice guideline]] for the management of candidiasis lists a large number of specific treatment regimens for ''Candida'' infections that involve different ''Candida'' species, forms of antifungal drug resistance, immune statuses, and infection localization and severity.&lt;ref name=IDSA2016 /&gt; Gastrointestinal candidiasis in immunocompetent individuals is treated with 100–200&amp;nbsp;mg&lt;!--dosage is included here because the cited ref is the only secondary source (as of June 2016) that gives a treatment protocol for immunocompetent GI candidiasis--&gt; fluconazole per day for 2–3&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIFO&quot; /&gt;

===Localized infection===
Mouth and throat candidiasis are treated with antifungal medication. Oral candidiasis usually responds to topical treatments; otherwise, systemic antifungal medication may be needed for oral infections. Candidal skin infections [[candidal intertrigo|in the skin folds (candidal intertrigo)]] typically respond well to topical antifungal treatments (e.g., [[nystatin]] or [[miconazole]]). For breastfeeding mothers topical miconazole is the most effective treatment for treating candidiasis on the breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Marsha|date=2008|title=Conquering Common Breast-feeding Problems|journal=The Journal of Perinatal &amp; Neonatal Nursing|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=267–274|doi=10.1097/01.JPN.0000341356.45446.23|pmid=19011490|issn=0893-2190}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gentian violet]] can be used for thrush in [[breastfeeding]] babies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker_2008&quot; /&gt; Systemic treatment with antifungals by mouth is reserved for severe cases or if treatment with topical therapy is unsuccessful. Candida esophagitis may be treated orally or intravenously; for severe or azole-resistant esophageal candidiasis, treatment with amphotericin B may be necessary.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Otx/&gt;

Vaginal yeast infections are typically treated with topical antifungal agents.&lt;ref name=IDSA2016 /&gt; A one-time dose of fluconazole by mouth is 90% effective in treating a vaginal yeast infection.&lt;ref name=Moosa&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moosa MY, Sobel JD, Elhalis H, Du W, Akins RA | title = Fungicidal activity of fluconazole against Candida albicans in a synthetic vagina-simulative medium | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–7 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14693534 | pmc = 310176 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.48.1.161-167.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For severe nonrecurring cases, several doses of fluconazole is recommended.&lt;ref name=IDSA2016 /&gt; Local treatment may include vaginal [[suppository|suppositories]] or medicated [[douche]]s. Other types of yeast infections require different dosing.  ''C. albicans'' can develop resistance to fluconazole, this being more of an issue in those with HIV/AIDS who are often treated with multiple courses of fluconazole for recurrent oral infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morschhäuser J | title = The genetic basis of fluconazole resistance development in Candida albicans | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1587 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 240–8 | date = July 2002 | pmid = 12084466 | doi = 10.1016/s0925-4439(02)00087-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For vaginal yeast infection in [[pregnancy]], topical [[imidazole]] or [[triazole]] antifungals are considered the therapy of choice owing to available safety data.&lt;ref name=&quot;soong2009&quot;/&gt; Systemic absorption of these topical formulations is minimal, posing little risk of [[transplacental]] transfer.&lt;ref name=&quot;soong2009&quot;/&gt; In vaginal yeast infection in pregnancy, treatment with topical azole antifungals is recommended for 7 days instead of a shorter duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;soong2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Soong D, Einarson A | title = Vaginal yeast infections during pregnancy | journal = Canadian Family Physician | volume = 55 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–6 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19282531 | pmc = 2654841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For vaginal yeast infections, many complementary treatments are proposed, however a number have side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Felix TC, de Brito Röder DV, Dos Santos Pedroso R | title = Alternative and complementary therapies for vulvovaginal candidiasis | journal = Folia Microbiologica | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–141 | date = March 2019 | pmid = 30269301 | doi = 10.1007/s12223-018-0652-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; No benefit from probiotics has been found for active infections.&lt;ref name=Ab2009/&gt;

===Blood infection===
Treatment typically consists of oral or [[intravenous]] antifungal medications.&lt;ref name=NIHSystemic&gt;{{cite web |title=Systemic candidiasis |url=http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/1076/systemic-candidiasis/resources/1 |website=NIH.gov |publisher=U.S. DHHS, National Institute of Health |date=Oct 2014 |access-date=April 19, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111120/http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/1076/systemic-candidiasis/resources/1 |archive-date=April 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In candidal infections of the blood, intravenous fluconazole or an [[echinocandin]] such as [[caspofungin]] may be used.&lt;ref name=IDSA2016 /&gt; [[Amphotericin B]] is another option.&lt;ref name=IDSA2016 /&gt;

==Prognosis==
Among individuals being treated in [[intensive care unit]]s, the [[mortality rate]] is about 30–50% when systemic candidiasis develops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williams 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams D, Lewis M | title = Pathogenesis and treatment of oral candidosis | journal = Journal of Oral Microbiology | volume = 3 | pages = 5771 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21547018 | pmc = 3087208 | doi = 10.3402/jom.v3i0.5771 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Descriptions of what sounds like oral thrush go back to the time of [[Hippocrates]] ''circa'' 460–370 BCE.&lt;ref name=ID10&gt;{{cite book|last=Dolin|first= Gerald L. | last2 = Mandell | first2 = John E. | last3 = Bennett | first3 = Raphael | name-list-format = vanc |title=Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's principles and practice of infectious diseases|year=2010|publisher=Churchill Livingstone/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-443-06839-3|pages=Chapter 250|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vulvovaginal candidiasis was first described in 1849 by Wilkinson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1994&quot; /&gt; In 1875, Haussmann demonstrated the causative organism in both vulvovaginal and oral candidiasis is the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1994&quot; /&gt;

With the advent of antibiotics following World War II, the rates of candidiasis increased. The rates then decreased in the 1950s following the development of [[nystatin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Obladen 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Obladen M | title = Thrush - nightmare of the foundling hospitals | journal = Neonatology | volume = 101 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–65 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22024688 | doi = 10.1159/000329879 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colloquial term &quot;thrush&quot; refers to the resemblance of the white flecks present in some forms of candidiasis (''e.g.'' pseudomembranous candidiasis) with the breast of the [[thrush (bird)|bird of the same name]].&lt;ref name=&quot;emedicine/Medscape&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scully|first=Crispian| name-list-format = vanc |title=Mucosal Candidiasis | journal = Medscape |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1075227-overview|publisher=WebMD LLC|access-date=8 September 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102083621/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1075227-overview|archive-date=2 November 2013|date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term candidosis is largely used in British English, and candidiasis in American English.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1994&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynch DP | title = Oral candidiasis. History, classification, and clinical presentation | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, and Oral Pathology | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–93 | date = August 1994 | pmid = 7936588 | doi = 10.1016/0030-4220(94)90146-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Candida'' is also pronounced differently; in American English, the stress is on the &quot;i&quot;, whereas in British English the stress is on the first syllable.

The [[genus]] ''Candida'' and [[species]] ''C. albicans'' were described by botanist [[Christine Marie Berkhout]] in her doctoral thesis at the [[University of Utrecht]] in 1923. Over the years, the classification of the genera and species has evolved. Obsolete names for this genus include ''Mycotorula'' and ''Torulopsis''. The species has also been known in the past as ''Monilia albicans'' and ''Oidium albicans''. The current classification is ''[[nomen conservandum]]'', which means the name is authorized for use by the International Botanical Congress (IBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0000St.Luistitle.htm |title=International Code of Botanical Nomenclature |year=2000 |isbn=978-3-904144-22-3 |location=Königstein |access-date=2008-11-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202001439/http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/nomenclature/code/SaintLouis/0000St.Luistitle.htm |archive-date=2008-12-02 | vauthors = Greuter W, McNeill J, Burdet HM, Barrie FR }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus ''Candida'' includes about 150 different species; however, only a few are known to cause human infections. ''C. albicans'' is the most significant [[pathogen]]ic species. Other species pathogenic in humans include ''C. auris'', ''C. tropicalis'', ''C. glabrata'', ''C. krusei'', ''C. parapsilosis'', ''C. dubliniensis'', and ''C. lusitaniae''.

The name ''Candida'' was proposed by Berkhout. It is from the Latin word ''toga candida'', referring to the white [[toga]] (robe) worn by candidates for the Senate of the ancient Roman republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1994&quot; /&gt; The specific epithet ''albicans'' also comes from Latin, ''albicare'' meaning &quot;to whiten&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch 1994&quot; /&gt; These names refer to the generally white appearance of ''Candida'' species when cultured.
