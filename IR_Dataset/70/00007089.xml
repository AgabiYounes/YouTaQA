'''Chocolate''' is a usually sweet, brown food preparation of roasted and ground [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] seeds that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. The earliest evidence of use traces to the [[Olmecs]] (modern day [[Mexico]]), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating to 1900 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;powis&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Powis |first=Terry G. |last2=Cyphers |first2=Ann |last3=Gaikwad |first3=Nilesh W. |last4=Grivetti |first4=Louis |last5=Cheong |first5=Kong |date=24 May 2011 |title=Cacao use and the San Lorenzo Olmec |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/21/8595 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=108 |issue=21 |pages=8595–8600 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1100620108 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=21555564 |pmc=3102397|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.8595P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/526113.html |title=Consumían olmecas chocolate hace 3000&amp;nbsp;años |date=29 July 2008 |location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Mesoamerican]] people made chocolate beverages, including the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/Chocolate/history_mesoamerican7.html |title=Chocolate: A Mesoamerican Luxury 1200–1521 – Obtaining Cacao |publisher=[[Field Museum]] |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;chocolate&quot; is derived from the Spanish word chocolate, which in turn derive from the [[Classical Nahuatl]] word ''xocolātl''.&lt;ref name=&quot;The American Heritage Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0316800.html|title=The American Heritage Dictionary|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011033809/http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0316800.html|archivedate=11 October 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense [[bitter (taste)|bitter]] taste and must be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to [[cocoa mass]], unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called [[chocolate liquor]]. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: [[cocoa solids]] and [[cocoa butter]]. [[Baking chocolate]], also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any [[added sugar]]. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more [[dietary fiber|fiber]] than it contains cocoa butter, can be processed with [[alkali]] to produce [[dutch process chocolate|dutch cocoa]]. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of [[sweet chocolate]], a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. [[Milk chocolate]] is sweet chocolate that additionally contains [[milk powder]] or [[condensed milk]]. [[White chocolate]] contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.

Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly [[dessert]]s, including [[chocolate cake|cakes]], [[chocolate pudding|pudding]], [[chocolate mousse|mousse]], [[chocolate brownie]]s, and [[chocolate chip cookie]]s. Many [[candy|candies]] are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. [[Chocolate bar]]s, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as [[snack]]s. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including [[Christmas]], [[Easter egg#Chocolate eggs|Easter]], [[Valentine's Day]], and [[Hanukkah gelt|Hanukkah]]. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as [[chocolate milk]] and [[hot chocolate]], and in some alcoholic drinks, such as [[creme de cacao]].

Although cocoa originated in the Americas, [[West Africa|West African countries]], particularly [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[Ghana]], are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.

With some two million [[Child labour in cocoa production|children involved in the farming of cocoa]] in West Africa, [[Child labour in cocoa production#Child slavery and trafficking|child slavery and trafficking]] were major concerns in 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;balch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author1=Oliver Balch |title=Child labour: the true cost of chocolate production |url=https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/child-labour-cocoa-production |publisher=Raconteur |accessdate=7 January 2019 |date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters2017&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author1=Kieran Guilbert |title=Falling cocoa prices threaten child labor spike in Ghana, Ivory Coast |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-westafrica-cocoa-children/falling-cocoa-prices-threaten-child-labor-spike-in-ghana-ivory-coast-idUSKBN1931ZQ |accessdate=7 January 2019 |work=Reuters |date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, international attempts to improve conditions for children were failing because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.&lt;ref name=balch/&gt;

Chocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history.

By the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cacao into their culture. They associated chocolate with [[Quetzalcoatl]], who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,&lt;ref name=&quot;kerr&quot;/&gt; and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/6194447/Aztecs-and-cacao-the-bittersweet-past-of-chocolate.html | title = Aztecs and Cacao: the bittersweet past of chocolate | work = The Daily Telegraph | date = 15 September 2009 | accessdate = 8 March 2014 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140418180336/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/6194447/Aztecs-and-cacao-the-bittersweet-past-of-chocolate.html | archivedate = 18 April 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the ''[[Cymbopetalum penduliflorum]]'' tree, [[chile pepper]], [[allspice]], [[vanilla]], and [[honey]].

The Aztecs were unable to grow cacao themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;kerr&quot;/&gt; Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cacao seeds in payment of the tax they deemed &quot;tribute&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kerr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/chocolate/history.html |title=History of Chocolate |publisher=[[Field Museum]] |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cocoa beans were often used as currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1990_Jan/ai_8560999 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527012838/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1990_Jan/ai_8560999 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 May 2012 |title=When cocoa was used as currency – pre-Columbian America – The Fortunes of Money |last=Peniche Rivero |first=Piedad |accessdate=26 June 2008 |newspaper=[[UNESCO Courier]] |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cacao beans and one fresh [[avocado]] was worth three beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Buford|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/29/071029fa_fact_buford|title=Notes of a Gastronome: Extreme Chocolate|website=The New Yorker|date=29 October 2007|accessdate=17 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616173209/http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/29/071029fa_fact_buford|archivedate=16 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maya and Aztecs associated cacao with [[human sacrifice]], and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human [[blood]].{{sfnp|Coe|Coe|2013|p=46}}{{sfnp|Chinchilla Mazariegos|2016|p=361}}
The Spanish royal chronicler [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]] described a chocolate drink he had seen in [[Nicaragua]] in 1528, mixed with [[achiote]]: &quot;because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.&quot;{{sfnp|Chinchilla Mazariegos|2016|p=361}}

While Columbus had taken cacao beans with him back to Spain,&lt;ref name=Exploratorium/&gt; chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.&lt;ref name=&quot;kerr&quot;/&gt; After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe.

It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/a-brief-history-of-chocolate-21860917/?no-ist | title = A Brief History of Chocolate | first =Amanda |last=Bensen|journal=Smithsonian Magazine | date = 1 March 2008 | accessdate = 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vanilla]], another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices had the tendency to unsettle the European constitution; the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' states, &quot;The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one's stomach&quot;, which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as &quot;healthy chocolate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Diderot, Denis.

The new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cacao bean was manual.&lt;ref name=&quot;kerr&quot;/&gt; Cacao plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cacao production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=219|editor1-last=Wilson|editor1-first=Philip K.|editor2-last=Hurst|editor2-first=W.

New processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In 1815, Dutch chemist [[Coenraad van Houten]] introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.&lt;ref name=&quot;kerr&quot;/&gt; A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat ([[cocoa butter]] or cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.&lt;ref name=Exploratorium/&gt; 
[[File:Fry's Chocolate advertisement.JPG|thumb|[[J. S.

Known as &quot;[[Dutch process chocolate|Dutch cocoa]]&quot;, this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier [[J. S. Fry &amp; Sons|Joseph Fry]] discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; Subsequently, his chocolate factory, [[J.

Besides [[Nestlé]], a number of notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Rowntree's]] of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the [[Tuke family]] business. [[Cadbury]] was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.&lt;ref name=&quot;kerr&quot;/&gt; Manufacturing their first [[Easter egg]] in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be moulded into smooth shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Amazing archive images show how Cadbury cracked Easter egg market |url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/nostalgia/easter-2015-amazing-archive-images-8963621 |accessdate=21 May 2019 |work=Birmingham Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, [[Milton S. Hershey]] purchased chocolate processing equipment at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, and soon began the career of [[Hershey Foods Corporation|Hershey's]] chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.

===Introduction to the United States===
[[Walter Baker &amp; Company|The Baker Chocolate Company]], famous for producing [[Baker's Chocolate]], is the oldest producer of chocolate in the [[United States]].

===Etymology===
[[File:Kakaw (Mayan word).png|thumb|[[Maya script|Maya glyph]] for cacao]]

Cacao, pronounced by the Olmecs as ''kakawa'',&lt;ref name=powis/&gt; dates to 1000&amp;nbsp;BC or earlier.&lt;ref name=powis/&gt; The word &quot;chocolate&quot; entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.&lt;ref name=heritagedictionary&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chocolate |title=The American Heritage Dictionary |chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0316800.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517202741/http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/C0316800.html |archivedate=17 May 2008 |accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word entered Spanish from the word ''xocolātl'' in [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is ''cacahuatl'', &quot;cacao water&quot;. It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid ''caca'', a vulgar Spanish word for &quot;faeces&quot;) by combining the Yucatec Mayan word ''chocol'', &quot;hot&quot;, with the Nahuatl word ''atl'', &quot;water&quot;.{{sfnp|Coe|Coe|2013|pp=121–123}} Another proposed etymology derives it from the word ''chicolatl'', meaning &quot;beaten drink&quot;, which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, ''chicoli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0956536100111058|title=Cacao and Chocolate: A Uto-Aztecan perspective |year=2000 |last1=Dakin |first1=Karen |last2=Wichmann |first2=Søren |journal=Ancient Mesoamerica |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=55–75 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231965433 |accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;[[chocolatier]]&quot;, for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymonline.com&quot;&gt;{{OEtymD|Chocolate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{Main|Types of chocolate}}
[[File:Cella-Chocolate-Cherries.jpg|thumb|Chocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as [[cherry|cherries]] and/or fillings, such as [[liqueur]]s]]

Several types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called &quot;baking chocolate&quot;, contains primarily [[cocoa solids]] and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with [[sugar]].

=== Milk ===
Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0036:EN:NOT|title=Directive 2000/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 June 2000 relating to cocoa and chocolate products intended for human consumption|publisher=[[Publications Office of the European Union]]|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White ===
{{Main|White chocolate}}
[[File:White chocolate with rose petals.jpg|thumb|White chocolate]]
White chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] established a standard for white chocolate as the &quot;common or usual name of products made from cacao fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cacao solids&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fda&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr021004.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321150727/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr021004.html |archivedate=21 March 2008|title=US Federal Register – White Chocolate; Establishment of a Standard of Identity|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dark ===
[[Dark chocolate]] is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture. The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] calls this &quot;sweet chocolate&quot;, and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa&quot; /&gt; A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is a dark chocolate with a low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chocolate Delights Cookbook: A Collection of Chocolate Recipes|last=Matsko Hood|first=Karen Jean|publisher=Whispering Pine Press International, Inc|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. {{as of|2017}}, there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=28439881|year=2017|author1=Ried|first1=K|title=Effect of cocoa on blood pressure|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD008893|last2=Fakler|first2=P|last3=Stocks|first3=N. P|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008893.pub3|pmc=6478304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unsweetened ===
Unsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cacao, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cacao. 
[[File:Cooking chocolate, broken bar.jpg|thumb|Unsweetened &quot;Baking&quot; Chocolate]]
Poorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called [[chocolate bloom]]; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kinta |first=Yasuyoshi |last2=Hartel |first2=Richard W. |date=20 August 2009 |title=Bloom Formation on Poorly-Tempered Chocolate and Effects of Seed Addition |url=http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/files_mf/kinta2009.pdf |journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society |volume=87 |issue=1 |doi=10.1007/s11746-009-1473-5 |access-date=12 September 2016 |pages=19–27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919114750/http://www.worldcocoafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/files_mf/kinta2009.pdf |archivedate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called &quot;chocolate&quot;, due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;pantograph&quot; /&gt;

===Cacao varieties===
[[File:CacaoChonita14.JPG|thumb|left|Toasted cacao beans at a chocolate workshop at the [[La Chonita Hacienda]] in [[Tabasco]].]]
Chocolate is made from [[cocoa bean]]s, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (''[[Theobroma cacao]]''), a small, 4–8 m tall (15–26&amp;nbsp;ft tall) [[evergreen]] tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common [[genotype]] of the plant originated in the [[Amazon basin]] and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now [[Venezuela]]. The scientific name, ''[[Theobroma]]'', means &quot;food of the [[deity|gods]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/c/cacao-02.html|title=Cacao|accessdate=27 June 2008|publisher=Botanica.com|date=1995–2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514090427/http://botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/c/cacao-02.html|archivedate=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fruit, called a cacao pod, is ovoid, {{convert|15|–|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8|–|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about {{convert|500|g|lb|abbr=on}} when ripe.

[[Cacao tree]]s are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20° of either side of the equator because they need about 2000&amp;nbsp;mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of {{convert|21|to|32|C|F}}. Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than {{convert|15|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xocoatl.org/tree.htm|title=All About Chocolate: The Cacao Tree|publisher=Xocoatl|accessdate=20 December 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219204425/http://www.xocoatl.org/tree.htm|archivedate=19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three main varieties of [[cacao bean]]s used in chocolate are [[criollo (cocoa bean)|criollo]], forastero, and trinitario.

====Criollo====
Representing only 5% of all cocoa beans grown {{as of |2008|lc=y}},&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Kristine|last=Kowalchuk|url=http://www.ama.ab.ca/cps/rde/xchg/ama/web/membership_WWarticle-Feb08-UpFront-10192.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228014251/http://www.ama.ab.ca/cps/rde/xchg/ama/web/membership_WWarticle-Feb08-UpFront-10192.htm|archivedate=28 February 2008|title=Cuckoo for Cocoa|publisher=[[Westworld Alberta]]|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the [[Caribbean islands]] and the northern tier of South American states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metaefficient.com/food-and-drink/criollo-chocolate-efficient-food-of-the-gods.html|title=Criollo Chocolate: Efficient Food of the Gods|publisher=MetaEfficient|accessdate=17 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828212223/http://www.metaefficient.com/food-and-drink/criollo-chocolate-efficient-food-of-the-gods.html|archivedate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.

Criollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in &quot;secondary&quot; notes of long duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sensationalchocolates.com/ingredients.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328013647/http://www.sensationalchocolates.com/ingredients.html|archivedate=28 March 2008|title=Sensational Chocolates: Discover the Intense Robust flavor of 100% 'Grand Cru' Chocolate|publisher=Sensational Chocolates|accessdate=17 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forastero====
The most commonly grown bean is forastero,&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot; /&gt; a large group of wild and cultivated cacaos, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely of the forastero variety. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot; /&gt; forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic &quot;chocolate&quot; flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing &quot;quite bland&quot; chocolate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot; /&gt;

====Trinitario====
Trinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in [[Trinidad]] after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cacao produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icco.org/questions/varieties.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218083848/http://www.icco.org/questions/varieties.htm|archivedate=18 February 2006|title=What are the varieties of cocoa?|date=21 July 1998|accessdate=27 June 2006|publisher=International Cocoa Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dancing The Cocoa, McBride's estate, El Cidros, Trinidad c. 1957.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;Dancing the cocoa&quot;, El Cidros, [[Trinidad]], c. 1957]]
Cacao pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a [[machete]], or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the [[pectin]]-containing material can begin. [[Yeast]]s produce [[ethanol]], [[lactic acid bacteria]] produce [[lactic acid]], and [[acetic acid bacteria]] produce [[acetic acid]]. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

It is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.&lt;ref name=&quot;beans&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xocoatl.org/harvest.htm|title=Harvesting the seeds|publisher=Xocoatl|accessdate=20 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521035551/http://www.xocoatl.org/harvest.htm|archivedate=21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), [[dry roasting|roasted]], and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Making Chocolate from Scratch |url=http://api.ning.com/files/Gr6vd-Aqjs2vj5t4p5tX-cZBB1kpTzKVDk8I59vVV6*FgB5zFYsVooD0wRRlQHO8tNMURHMwKR5hmuPX2Pe3al3iWOhcsi5S/Makingchocolatefromscratch.pdf |accessdate=2 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331152948/http://api.ning.com/files/Gr6vd-Aqjs2vj5t4p5tX-cZBB1kpTzKVDk8I59vVV6*FgB5zFYsVooD0wRRlQHO8tNMURHMwKR5hmuPX2Pe3al3iWOhcsi5S/Makingchocolatefromscratch.pdf |archivedate=31 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.&lt;ref name=&quot;tree&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cocoatree.org/frombeantobar/atthechocolatefactory.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114080555/http://www.cocoatree.org/frombeantobar/atthechocolatefactory.asp |archivedate=14 January 2007 |title=At the chocolate factory |publisher=The Cocoa Tree |accessdate=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blending===
{{Main|Types of chocolate}}
Chocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couvertures. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:
[[File:Chocolate fountain.jpg|thumb|upright|Fountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a [[chocolate fountain]] to serve as [[Chocolate fondue|dessert fondue]].]]
* Dark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla
* Milk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla
* White chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla

Usually, an [[emulsifying agent]], such as [[soy lecithin]], is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain [[Genetically modified organism|GMO]]-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using [[Polyglycerol polyricinoleate|PGPR]], an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same [[mouthfeel]].

The texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus have a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.

Different manufacturers develop their own &quot;signature&quot; blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couvertures contain at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couvertures contain only about 35% cocoa butter.

Producers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot;/&gt; Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and [[artificial flavor|artificial]] vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ww&quot;/&gt;

===Conching===
{{Main|Conching}}
[[File:Chocolate melanger.jpg|thumb|Chocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients]]
The penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate prior to conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72&amp;nbsp;hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about {{convert|45|to|50|C|F}} until final processing.&lt;ref name=&quot;conch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephanie|last=Zonis|url=http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/zonis/conching.htm|title=Conching: Crucial Step in Chocolate's Flavor and Texture?|publisher=Sally's Place|accessdate=20 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617203722/http://www.sallys-place.com/food/columns/zonis/conching.htm|archivedate=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tempering===
[[File:Making Chocolate in Oaxaca.ogg|thumb|Video of cacao beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a [[Mayordomo]] store in [[Oaxaca de Juarez|Oaxaca]]]]
The final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled [[crystallization]] of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be clearly seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;temp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Afoakwa|first1=Emmanuel Ohene|last2=Paterson|first2=Alistair|last3=Fowler|first3=Mark|last4=Vieira|first4=Joselio|title=Effects of tempering and fat crystallisation behaviour on microstructure, mechanical properties and appearance in dark chocolate systems|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=November 2008|volume=89|issue=2|pages=128–136|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2008.04.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the result of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.

The fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms ([[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphous crystallization]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;temp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;temp2&quot;/&gt; The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.

As a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter are able to break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases – the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Confectioner's Association|title=The Sweet Truth about Cocoa Butter |url=http://nca.files.cms-plus.com/Sweet_Truth_Cocoa_Butter_WEB.pdf |accessdate=23 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810033936/http://nca.files.cms-plus.com/Sweet_Truth_Cocoa_Butter_WEB.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butter fat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why Chocolate Melts and Jet Planes Don't |url=http://www.rigb.org/assets/uploads/docs/Lecture%20two_designed.pdf |website=The Royal Institution of Great Britain |accessdate=24 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making chocolate considered &quot;good&quot; is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.

Generally, the chocolate is first heated to {{convert|45|C|F}} to melt all six forms of crystals.&lt;ref name=&quot;temp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=LaBau|url=http://candy.about.com/od/candybasics/ht/temperchoc.htm|title=How To Temper Chocolate|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=20 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008005049/http://candy.about.com/od/candybasics/ht/temperchoc.htm|archivedate=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;temp2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Phase Transitions and Polymorphism of Cocoa Butter|journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society|author1-last=Loisel |author1-first=C.|author2= Keller |author2-first=G.|author3= Lecq |author3-first=G.|author4= Bourgaux |author4-first=C.|author5= Ollivon |author5-first=M. |doi=10.1007/s11746-998-0245-y|volume=75|issue=4|pages=&lt;!-- 425–439 --&gt;|at=pp.425–439, see Table&amp;nbsp;2 p.&amp;nbsp;426 for tempering temperatures|year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the chocolate is cooled to about {{convert|27|C|F}}, which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal &quot;seeds&quot; which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about {{convert|31|C|F}} to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid &quot;seed&quot; chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a [[chocolate temper meter]] to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.

Two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:
* Working the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal &quot;seeds&quot;; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.
* Stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to &quot;inoculate&quot; the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to &quot;seed&quot; the molten chocolate).

Chocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, [[continuous production|continuous]] tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and [[Bühler|Buhler]], three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40–50&amp;nbsp;°C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26–30&amp;nbsp;°C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce [[shear force|shear]], then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=EP |number=0289849 |status=Granted |title=Process and apparatus for the continuous preparation of cacao butter or similar fat-containing masses to be processed |pubdate=1988-11-09 |gdate= |fdate=1988-04-19 |pridate= |inventor=Helmut Sollich |invent1= |invent2= |assign1=Sollich KG |assign2= |class= |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0289849A2/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=EP |number=2862449 |status=Pending |title=Method and use of an apparatus for continuous tempering of chocolate mass comprising crystals |pubdate=2015-04-22 |gdate= |fdate=2013-10-18 |pridate= |inventor=Peter Braun |invent1=Konstantinos Paggios |invent2= |assign1=Bühler AG |assign2= |class= |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/EP2862449A1/en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
[[File:Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop Inside, SF, CA, jjron 25.03.2012.jpg|thumb|Packaged chocolate in the [[Ghirardelli Chocolate Company]] is stored in controlled conditions.]]
Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between {{convert|15|and|17|C|F}}, with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of &quot;blooming&quot; effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=X-rays reveal how chocolate turns white|journal=Science|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/chemistry/2015/05/x-rays-reveal-how-chocolate-turns-white|last=DeMarco|first=E.|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=8 May 2015 |doi=10.1126/science.aac4563 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508180034/http://news.sciencemag.org/chemistry/2015/05/x-rays-reveal-how-chocolate-turns-white |archivedate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chocolate bloom]] is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding {{convert|24|C|F}}, while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below {{convert|15|C|F}} or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Ghirardelli]] |title=Tips for Chocolate Care |url=http://www.ghirardelli.com/chocopedia/tips.aspx |accessdate=16 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206082048/http://ghirardelli.com/chocopedia/tips.aspx |archivedate=6 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Teresa |last=Miller |url=http://www.cals.wisc.edu/media/news/01_97/milkfat_chocolate.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609144511/http://www.cals.wisc.edu/media/news/01_97/milkfat_chocolate.html |archivedate=9 June 2007 |title=Milkfat Fractions Help Beat Blooming Chocolate |publisher=College of Agricultural Life and Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cocoabella.com/chocolates02.php |publisher=CocoaBella |title=How to Store Chocolate |accessdate=16 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208160345/http://www.cocoabella.com/chocolates02.php |archivedate=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Bau |editor-first=Frederic |year=2011 |title=Cooking With Chocolate: Essential Recipes and Techniques |location=Paris |publisher=Flammarion, S.A. |page=147 |isbn=978-2-08-020081-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bhg.com/recipes/desserts/chocolate/chocolate-types-selection--storage/|title=Chocolate: Types (Unsweetened, Bittersweet, Semisweet, Milk), Selection, and Storage |date=9 June 2015|work=Better Homes &amp; Gardens|access-date=10 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair trade===
{{Main|Fair trade}}
In the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in [[fair trade]] initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fair trade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Michael Barratt | year = 2007 | title = 'Fair Trade' with Africa | journal = Review of African Political Economy | volume = 34 | issue = 112| pages = 267–77 | doi=10.1080/03056240701449653 |jstor=20406397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an [[Agricultural cooperative]]. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Michael K | year = 2004 | title = Reading fairtrade: political ecological imaginary and the moral economy of fairtrade foods | journal = Political Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 7| pages = 891–915 | doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2004.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, ''[[The Economist]]'' stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/05/agriculture-ethiopia-and-uganda?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/notsofairtrade|accessdate=3 July 2014|title=Agriculture in Ethiopia and Uganda: Not so fair trade|work=[[The Economist]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714192341/http://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2014/05/agriculture-ethiopia-and-uganda?fsrc=scn%2Ffb%2Fwl%2Fbl%2Fnotsofairtrade|archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bars ===
{{Main|Chocolate bar}}
Chocolate is sold in [[chocolate bar]]s, which come in [[dark chocolate]], [[milk chocolate]] and [[white chocolate]] varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., [[nougat]], [[wafer]]s, [[caramel]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], etc.) which are coated in chocolate.
