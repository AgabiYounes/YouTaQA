This is a '''list of cryptographers'''. [[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of techniques for [[secure communication]] in the presence of third parties called [[adversary (cryptography)|adversaries]].

==Pre twentieth century==
* [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]]: wrote a (now lost) book on cryptography titled the &quot;''Book of Cryptographic Messages''&quot;.
* [[Al-Kindi]], 9th century [[Arabic]] polymath and originator of [[frequency analysis]].
* [[Athanasius Kircher]], attempts to decipher crypted messages
* [[Augustus the Younger, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], wrote a standard book on cryptography
* [[Ibn Wahshiyya]]: published several cipher alphabets that were used to encrypt magic formulas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mattord|first=Michael E.

* [[Ibn 'Adlan]]: 13th-century cryptographer who made important contributions on the sample size of the frequency analysis.
* [[Duke of Mantua]] [[Francesco I Gonzaga]] is the one who used the earliest example of homophonic [[Substitution cipher]] in early 1400s.&lt;ref&gt;David Salomon. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A88kvYwIVu0C&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=homophonic+cipher+mantua+1400s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yFuWwRbqiG&amp;sig=SUYa0tmxxaeZhkBMkk84p1Nb4m8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiokPLgyvTKAhULCywKHegKDYEQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=homophonic%20cipher%20mantua%201400s&amp;f=false Coding for Data and Computer Communications].
