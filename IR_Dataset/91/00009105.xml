The themed anthology that revolved originally on fictional detective stories became in modern times the longest-running ongoing comic series. A notable debut in the first issue was [[Slam Bradley]] created in contribution by Malcom-Wheeler-Nicholson, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. &lt;ref name=&quot;CBR DO&quot;/&gt; In 1937, in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor [[Harry Donenfeld]]—who also published pulp magazines and operated as a principal in the magazine distributorship [[Independent News]]—Wheeler-Nicholson had to take Donenfeld on as a partner in order to publish ''Detective Comics'' #1. Detective Comics, Inc. (which would help inspired the abbreviation DC) was formed, with Wheeler-Nicholson and [[Jack Liebowitz|Jack S. Liebowitz]], Donenfeld's accountant, listed as owners. Major Wheeler-Nicholson remained for a year, but cash-flow problems continued, and he was forced out. Shortly afterwards, Detective Comics, Inc. purchased the remains of National Allied, also known as Nicholson Publishing, at a bankruptcy auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2004|page= 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Max Gaines]], formed the sister company [[All-American Publications]] around 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Gerard|authorlink=Gerard Jones|title=Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book|url=https://archive.org/details/menoftomorrowgee0000jone|url-access=registration|date=2004|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465036561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detective Comics, Inc. soon launched a fourth anthology title, entitled ''[[Action Comics]]''. [[Action Comics 1|Issue #1]], cover dated in June 1938, first featured characters such as [[Superman]] by Siegel and Shuster, [[Zatara]] by [[Fred Guardineer]] and [[Tex Thompson]] by Ken Finch and [[Bernard Baily]]. It is considered to be the first comic book to feature the new character archetype—soon known as &quot;superheroes&quot; and was a sales hit bringing to life a [[Golden Age of Comic Books|new age of comic books]] with the credit going to the [[first appearance]] of Superman both being featured on the cover and within the issue.

Starting in 1939, Siegel and Shuster's Superman would be the first comic derived character to appear outside of comic magazines and later appear in newspaper strips [[Superman (comic strip)|starring himself]] which first introduced Superman's biological parents, [[Jor-El]] and [[Lara (comics)|Lara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.tcj.com/reviews/superman-the-golden-age-sundays-1943-1946/|title=Superman: The Golden Age Sundays 1943-1946| website=The Comics Journal|accessdate=3 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; All-American Publications' first comic series called ''[[All-American Comics]]'' was first published in April 1939. &lt;ref name=&quot;DC one&quot;/&gt; The series of ''Detective Comics'' would make successful history as first featuring [[Batman]] by [[Bob Kane]] and [[Bill Finger]] in issue #27 (March 1939) (&quot;[[The Case of the Chemical Syndicate]]&quot;) with the request of more superhero titles.

Despite the official names &quot;National Comics&quot; and &quot;National Periodical Publications&quot;, the company began branding itself as &quot;Superman-DC&quot; as early as 1940, and the company became known colloquially as DC Comics for years before the official adoption of that name in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7621531 DC Comics, Inc.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516000711/http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=7621531 |date=May 16, 2010 }} at Bloomberg Businessweek.

DC purchased many of their competitors' comic stables, including [[Fawcett Comics]], whose Beck-created Captain Marvel was central to a lawsuit with DC.]]

The company began to move aggressively against what it saw as [[copyright infringement|copyright-violating]] imitations from other companies, such as [[Fox Comics]]' [[Wonder Man (Fox Publications)|Wonder Man]], which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing [[Fawcett Comics]] over [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], at the time comics' top-selling character (see ''[[National Comics Publications, Inc. v. Fawcett Publications, Inc.]]''). Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1953 and ceased publishing comics. Years later, Fawcett sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC—which in 1972 revived Captain Marvel in the new title ''Shazam!'' featuring artwork by his creator, [[C. C. Beck]]. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by [[Marvel Comics]] in 1967, with the creation of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|their Captain Marvel]], forbidding the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning [[Shazam! (TV series)|live action TV adaptation]] and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the [[DC Universe]].

When the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s the company focused on such genres as [[science fiction]], [[Western comics|Westerns]], [[humour|humor]], and [[Romance comics|romance]]. DC also published [[Crime comics|crime]] and [[Horror comics|horror]] titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles, including ''Action Comics'' and ''Detective Comics'', the medium's two longest-running titles, continued publication.

===Silver Age===
{{Main|Silver Age of Comic Books}}

In the mid-1950s, editorial director [[Irwin Donenfeld]] and publisher Liebowitz directed editor [[Julius Schwartz]] (whose roots lay in the [[science-fiction]] book market) to produce a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] story in the try-out title ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers [[Robert Kanigher]] and [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[penciller|penciler]] [[Carmine Infantino]], and [[inker]] [[Joe Kubert]] create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash's [[civilian]] identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash's reimagining in ''Showcase'' #4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the [[Green Lantern]] character, the introduction of the modern all-star team [[Justice League of America]] (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age of comic books]].

National did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor [[Mort Weisinger]], introduced such enduring characters as [[Supergirl]], [[Bizarro]], and [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful [[Batwoman]], [[Bette Kane|Bat-Girl]], [[Ace the Bat-Hound]], and [[Bat-Mite]] in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the &quot;New Look&quot;, re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context.

Since the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company's other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC's characters inhabited a shared [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that, decades later, was dubbed the &quot;[[DC Universe]]&quot; by fans. With the story &quot;[[Flash of Two Worlds]]&quot;, in ''Flash'' #123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer [[Gardner Fox]] and artists Infantino and [[Joe Giella]]) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional &quot;Earth 2&quot;, as opposed to the modern heroes' &quot;Earth 1&quot;—in the process creating the foundation for what was later called the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Multiverse]].

DC's introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC's JLA as the specific spur,{{refn|Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either [[Jack Liebowitz]] or [[Irwin Donenfeld]] of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications)&lt;!--also known as name is mentioned here because Stan Lee says &quot;National Comics&quot; in quote directly below this paragraph--&gt; bragged about DC's success with the Justice League (which had debuted in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to [[publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] (whose holdings included the nascent [[Marvel Comics]], which was being distributed by DC's Independent News at this time.) during a game of golf.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, film producer and comics historian [[Michael Uslan]] partly debunked the story in a letter published in ''Alter Ego'' #43 (December 2004), pp. 43–44
{{quote|Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC's 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as [[Sol Harrison]] and [production chief] [[Jack Adler]] were schmoozing with some of us&amp;nbsp;... who worked for DC during our college summers&amp;nbsp;... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC ''owned'' Independent News)&amp;nbsp;... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. ... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces&amp;nbsp;... Sol worked closely with Independent News' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse's mouth.}}

Goodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA's strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor, [[Stan Lee]], to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in ''Origins of Marvel Comics'' ([[Marvel Fireside Books|Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books]], 1974), p. 16:
&quot;Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called ''The'' {{sic}} ''Justice League of America'' and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... ' If the Justice League is selling ', spoke he, 'why don't we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?'&quot;|group=n}} [[Marvel Comics]] writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and a robust creator [[Jack Kirby]] ushered in the sub-Silver Age &quot;Marvel Age&quot; of comics with the debut issue of ''[[The Fantastic Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk6silver.html Integrative Arts 10: &quot;The Silver Age&quot; by Jamie Coville] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624145720/http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk6silver.html |date=June 24, 2008 }}. Retrieved June 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, DC ignored the initial success of Marvel with this editorial change until its consistently strengthening sales, albeit also benefiting Independent News' business as their distributor as well, made that impossible. That commercial situation especially applied with Marvel's superior [[sell-through]] percentage numbers which were typically 70% to DC's roughly 50%, which meant DC's publications were barely making a profit in comparison after returns from the distributors were calculated while Marvel was making an excellent profit by comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Reed |title=Slugfest: In the Epic 50-Year Battle between Marvel and DC |date=2017 |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=xiii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the senior DC staff were reportedly at a loss at this time to understand how this small publishing house was achieving this increasingly threatening commercial strength. For instance, when Marvel's product was examined in a meeting, Marvel's emphasis on more sophisticated character-based narrative and artist-driven visual storytelling was apparently ignored for self-deluding guesses at the brand's popularity which included superficial reasons like the presence of the color red or word balloons on the cover, or that the perceived crudeness of the interior art was somehow more appealing to readers. When Lee learned about DC's subsequent experimental attempts to imitate these perceived details, he amused himself by arranging direct defiance of those assumptions in Marvel's publications as sales strengthened further to frustrate the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Reed|title=Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle between Marvel and DC|date=2017|publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this ignorance of Marvel's true appeal did not extend to some of the writing talent during this period, from which there were some attempts to emulate Marvel's narrative approach. For instance, there was the ''[[Doom Patrol]]'' series by [[Arnold Drake]], a writer who previously warned the management of the new rival's strength;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |title=Slugfest |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a superhero team of outsiders who resented their freakish powers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eury |first=Michael|title=The Doom Patrol Interviews: Editor's Note|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65 |page=37|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013 |location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Drake later speculated was plagiarized by Stan Lee to create ''[[The X-Men]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://classic.newsarama.com/general/ArnoldDrake/DrakneInterview.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011174524/http://newsarama.com/general/ArnoldDrake/DrakneInterview.htm |title= Talking to Arnold Drake| archivedate= 2007-10-11 |accessdate= 2009-05-15 |last= Epstein |first= Daniel Robert |date= 2005-11-11 |work= [[Newsarama]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the young [[Jim Shooter]] who purposely emulated Marvel's writing when he wrote for DC after much study of both companies' styles, such as for the ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' feature.&lt;ref name=GraphicNYC&gt;Irving, Christopher (July 20, 2012).

A [[Batman (TV series)|1966 Batman]] [[Television program|TV show]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network sparked a temporary spike in comic book sales, and a brief fad for superheroes in [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning animation]] ([[Filmation#1960s|Filmation]] created most of DC's initial cartoons) and other media. DC significantly lightened the [[tone (literature)|tone]] of many DC comics—particularly ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]''—to better complement the &quot;camp&quot; tone of the TV series. This tone coincided with the famous &quot;Go-Go Checks&quot; [[Check (pattern)|checkerboard]] cover-dress which featured a black-and-white checkerboard strip (all DC books cover dated February 1966 until August 1967) at the top of each comic, a misguided attempt by then-managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC's output &quot;stand out on the newsracks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2004_12_01.html#009267 &quot;Irwin Donenfeld, R.I.P.&quot; by Mark Evanier, December 1, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518104754/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2004_12_01.html |date=May 18, 2008 }}. Retrieved June 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, DC artist, [[Carmine Infantino]], complained that the visual cover distinctiveness made DC's titles easier for readers to see and then avoid in favor of Marvel's titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |title=Slugfest |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Batman artist Infantino (who had designed popular Silver Age characters [[Batgirl]] and the [[Phantom Stranger]]) rose from art director to become DC's editorial director. With the growing popularity of upstart rival [[Marvel Comics]] threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with more focus towards marketing new and existing titles and characters with more adult sensibilities towards an emerging older age group of superhero comic book fans that grew out of Marvel's efforts to market their superhero [[line (comics)|line]] to college-aged adults. He also recruited major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and [[Spider-Man]] co-creator [[Steve Ditko]] and promising newcomers [[Neal Adams]] and [[Denny O'Neil]] and replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including [[Joe Kubert]] and [[Dick Giordano]], to give DC's output a more artistic critical eye.

===Kinney National Company/Warner Communications subsidiary (1967-1990)===
In 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/dc.htm |title=DC Comics |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] in 1969. Kinney National spun off its non-entertainment assets in 1972 (as [[National Kinney Corporation]]) and changed its name to [[Warner Communications|Warner Communications Inc.]]

In 1970, [[Jack Kirby]] moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the [[Silver Age of Comics]], in which Kirby's contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively [[Fourth World (comics)|The Fourth World]]. In the existing series ''[[Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen]]'' and in his own, newly launched series ''[[New Gods]]'', ''[[Mister Miracle]]'', and ''[[Forever People|The Forever People]]'', Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain [[Darkseid]] and the other-dimensional realm [[Apokolips]]. Furthermore, Kirby intended their stories to be reprinted in collected editions, in a publishing format that was later called the [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]], which became a standard industry practice decades later. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management's initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the &quot;Fourth World&quot; was all cancelled, although Kirby's conceptions soon became integral to the broadening of the DC Universe, especially after the major toy company, [[Kenner Products]], judged them ideal for their [[action figure]] adaptation of the [[DC Universe]], the [[Super Powers Collection]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaiman|first=Mark Evanier ; introduction by Neil|title=Kirby : King of Comics|year=2008|publisher=Abrams|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-8109-9447-8|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obligated by his contract, Kirby created other unrelated series for DC, including ''[[Kamandi]]'', ''[[Etrigan the Demon|The Demon]]'', and ''[[OMAC (Buddy Blank)|OMAC]]'', before ultimately returning to Marvel Comics.

===The Bronze Age===
{{Main|Bronze Age of Comic Books}}

Following the science-fiction innovations of the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]], the comics of the 1970s and 1980s became known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the [[Comics Code Authority]], explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics' story &quot;[[Green Goblin Reborn!]]&quot; in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #96 (May 1971), and after the Code's updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer [[Dennis O'Neil]] and artist [[Neal Adams]]' ''[[Green Lantern]]'', beginning with the story &quot;[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]]&quot; in the retitled ''Green Lantern / Green Arrow'' #85 (September 1971), which depicted [[Roy Harper (comics)|Speedy]], the teen sidekick of superhero archer [[Green Arrow]], as having become a [[heroin]] addict.

[[Jenette Kahn]], a former children's magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' and ''[[Shade, the Changing Man]]'', as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-[[Fredric Wertham|Wertham]] days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the [[Superman (1978 film)|first Superman movie]], Kahn expanded the [[line (comics)|line]] further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five-page stories. This was a move the company called the &quot;DC Explosion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Jenette. [http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/252/publishorial.gif &quot;Publishorial: Onward and Upward&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329065319/http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/252/publishorial.gif |date=March 29, 2014 }}, DC Comics cover-dated September 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The move was not successful, however, and corporate parent Warner dramatically cut back on these largely unsuccessful titles, firing many staffers in what industry watchers dubbed &quot;the [[DC Implosion]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The DC Implosion&quot;, ''The Comics Journal'' #41 (August 1978), pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1978, the [[line (comics)|line]] was dramatically reduced and standard-size books returned to 17 story pages but for a still increased 40 cents.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Post-Implosion Fill-In Fallout&quot;, ''The Comics Journal'' #43 (December 1978), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, the books returned to 50 cents with a 25-page story count but the story pages replaced house ads in the books.

Seeking new ways to boost [[market share]], the new team of publisher Kahn, vice president [[Paul Levitz]], and managing editor Giordano addressed the issue of talent instability. To that end—and following the example of [[Atlas/Seaboard Comics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mediascene |authorlink=Jim Steranko |last=Steranko |first=Jim |issue=11 |date=February 1975 |page=? |quote=Atlas/Seaboard publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s [[Goliath (Bible)|David and Goliath]] strategy is insidiously simple and outrageous—possibly even considered dirty tactics by the competition—[and consists of] such [things] as higher page rates, artwork returned to the artist, rights to the creation of an original character, and a certain amount of professional courtesy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such independent companies as [[Eclipse Comics]]—DC began to offer [[royalties]] in place of the industry-standard [[work for hire|work-for-hire]] agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. As it happened, the implementation of these incentives proved opportune considering Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief, [[Jim Shooter]], was alienating much of his company's creative staff with his authoritarian manner and major talents there went to DC like [[Roy Thomas]], [[Gene Colan]], [[Marv Wolfman]], and [[George Perez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |title=Slugfest |pages=112–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, emulating the era's new television form, the [[miniseries]] while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable open-ended commitments. The first such title was ''[[World of Krypton]]'' in 1979, and its positive results lead to subsequent similar titles and later more ambitious productions like ''[[Camelot 3000]]'' for the direct market in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|title=GHM Columns : GHM Staff : Steve Higgins A+ Graphic Novels &amp;#93|website=Newcomicreviews.com|access-date=March 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204110919/http://www.newcomicreviews.com/GHM/columns/A+/archives/071103.html|archive-date=February 4, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series ''[[Teen Titans|The New Teen Titans]]'', by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[George Pérez]], two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel's ensemble series ''[[X-Men]]'', but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Heidi D. &quot;DC's Titanic Success&quot;, ''The Comics Journal'' #76 (October 1982), pp. 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt; in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and Pérez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] title, ''Tales of the New Teen Titans'', to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title.

===Modern Age===

This successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans led DC's editors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises|title=Why TEEN TITANS Is DC Comics' Most Important (But Undervalued) Franchise - Nerdist|date=August 30, 2016|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118073919/https://nerdist.com/why-teen-titans-dc-comics-most-important-but-undervalued-franchises/|archive-date=November 18, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to seek the same for the wider [[DC Universe]]. The result, the Wolfman/Pérez 12-issue limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the characters' complicated backstory and continuity discrepancies. A companion publication, two volumes entitled ''The History of the DC Universe'', set out the revised history of the major DC characters. ''Crisis'' featured many key deaths that shaped the DC Universe for the following decades, and it separated the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-&quot;Crisis&quot;.

Meanwhile, a parallel update had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since early 1984, the work of [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[Alan Moore]] had revitalized the horror series ''[[Swamp Thing|The Saga of the Swamp Thing]]'', and soon numerous British writers, including [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Grant Morrison]], began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror-fantasy material led to DC in 1993 establishing the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] mature-readers imprint, which did not subscribe to the [[Comics Code Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521|title=Vertigo (Publisher) - Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine|access-date=July 11, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715180039/https://comicvine.gamespot.com/vertigo/4010-521/|archive-date=July 15, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two DC limited series, ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and ''[[Watchmen]]'' by Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]], drew attention in the mainstream press for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |title=Batman's Dark Side |access-date=July 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407131449/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/432973/batmans-dark-side |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all |date=March 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These titles helped pave the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these series as commercially successful [[trade paperbacks]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC [[war comics]], including series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included ''[[Sgt. Rock (comics)|Sgt. Rock]]'', ''[[G.I. Combat]]'', ''[[The Unknown Soldier (comics)|The Unknown Soldier]]'', and ''[[Weird War Tales]]''.

===Time Warner/AOL Time Warner/WarnerMedia unit (1990–present)===
In March 1989, Warner Communications merged with [[Time Inc.]], making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the [[Batman (1989 film)|first Tim Burton directed Batman movie]] was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of [[DC Archive Editions]], collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with colour restoration by DC's long-time resident colourist, [[Bob LeRose]]. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics when individual credits were few and far between.

The comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues, was thought to imply that ''all'' comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC's extended storylines in which [[The Death of Superman|Superman was killed]], [[Batman: Knightfall|Batman was crippled]] and superhero [[Emerald Twilight|''Green Lantern'' turned into the supervillain Parallax]] resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero's replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured &quot;collectables&quot; numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves.

DC's [[Piranha Press]] and other imprints (including the mature readers [[line (comics)|line]] [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]], and [[Helix (comics)|Helix]], a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] collections of individual serial comics, as well as original [[graphic novel]]s.

One of the other imprints was [[Impact Comics]] from 1991 to 1992 in which the [[Archie Comics]] superheroes were licensed and revamped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Arrant |first=Chris |title=Completing the Red Circle: Talking to JMS |url=http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |accessdate=August 15, 2011 |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=April 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224714/http://www.newsarama.com/2773-completing-the-red-circle-talking-to-jms.html |archive-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Markstein |first=Don |title=Archie (MLJ) Comics |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vzfkTHvJWnIJ:www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm+http://www.toonopedia.com/mlj_arch.htm&amp;cd=1&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |archivedate=April 13, 2013 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories in the line were part of its own shared universe.&lt;ref name=cbr&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=21346 &quot;JMS Circles the DC Universe in Red&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008225108/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=21346 |date=October 8, 2013 }}.

DC entered into a publishing agreement with [[Milestone Media]] that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters. Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series ''[[Static Shock]]''. DC established [[Paradox Press]] to publish material such as the large-format ''Big Book of...'' series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel ''[[Road to Perdition]]''. In 1998, DC purchased [[WildStorm]] Comics, [[Jim Lee]]'s imprint under the [[Image Comics]] banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint – and [[Wildstorm Universe|fictional universe]] – with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint [[America's Best Comics (DC)|America's Best Comics]] (ABC), a series of titles created by [[Alan Moore]], including ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Tom Strong]]'', and ''[[Promethea]]''. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC.

===2000s===
In March 2003 DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series ''[[Elfquest]]'', previously self-published by creators [[Wendy and Richard Pini]] under their [[WaRP Graphics]] publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, [[Tower Comics]]' series [[T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents]], in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004 DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] and [[Les Humanoïdes Associés|Humanoids]]. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot [[Johnny DC]] and established the [[CMX (comics)|CMX]] imprint to reprint translated [[manga]]. In 2006, CMX took over from [[Dark Horse Comics]] publication of the webcomic ''[[Megatokyo]]'' in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and acquired the rights to much of the work of [[Will Eisner]], such as his ''[[The Spirit]]'' series and his graphic novels.

In 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' event which similarly tried to [[Comics vocabulary#Retcon|ret-con]] the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded ''[[Batman Begins]]'' film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC's heroes, with events climaxing in the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' limited series. Immediately after this event, DC's ongoing series jumped [[One Year Later|forward a full year]] in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to &quot;Superboy&quot; (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of [[Jerry Siegel]] used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership.

In 2005, DC launched its &quot;[[All Star DC Comics|All-Star]]&quot; line (evoking the title of the [[All Star Comics|1940s publication]]), designed to feature some of the company's best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe. The line began with ''All-Star Batman &amp; Robin the Boy Wonder'' and ''All-Star Superman'', with ''All-Star Wonder Woman'' and ''All-Star Batgirl'' announced in 2006 but neither being released nor scheduled as of the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brady |first=Matt |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |title=Adam Hughes on His New Exclusive &amp; All Star Wonder Woman |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=August 21, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830202046/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=81341 |archivedate=August 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
In 2011, DC rebooted all of its running titles following the [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] storyline. The reboot called [[The New 52]] gave new origin stories and costume designs to many of DC's characters.

DC licensed pulp characters including [[Doc Savage]] and the [[Spirit (comics)|Spirit]] which it then used, along with some DC heroes, as part of the [[First Wave (comics)|First Wave]] comics line launched in 2010 and lasting through fall 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/brian_azzarello-first-wave-100303.html |title=Brian Azzarello Gets Ready to Break DC's First Wave |work=[[Newsarama]] |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407094828/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/brian_azzarello-first-wave-100303.html |archive-date=April 7, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First Wave Crashes – DC To Cancel Line |first=Rich |last=Johnston |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/02/23/first-wave-crashes-dc-to-cancel-line/ |newspaper=Bleeding Cool |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191523/http://www.bleedingcool.com/2011/02/23/first-wave-crashes-dc-to-cancel-line/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grumpy Old Fan Growing the garden: DC's May solicits |first=Tom |last=Bondurant |url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/grumpy-old-fan-surprise-me-dc-comics-solicitations-for-august-2011/ |newspaper=Comic Book Resources |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195659/http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/05/grumpy-old-fan-surprise-me-dc-comics-solicitations-for-august-2011/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2011, DC announced that it would end all ongoing series set in the DC Universe in August and [[The New 52|relaunch]] its comic line with 52 issue #1s, starting with ''[[Justice League]]'' on August 31 (written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee), with the rest to follow later on in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Truitt |first=Brian |title=DC Comics unleashes a new universe of superhero titles |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2011-05-31-dc-comics-reinvents_n.htm |work=USA Today |accessdate=June 5, 2011 |date=May 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302021317/http://www.usatoday.com/life/comics/2011-05-31-dc-comics-reinvents_n.htm |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Definitive Guide to the DC Comics Reboot |date=June 6, 2011 |accessdate=2011-06-22 |first=Ron |last=Richards |publisher=iFanboy.com |url=http://www.ifanboy.com/content/articles/The_Definitive_Guide_To_The_DC_Comics_Reboot |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619101806/http://www.ifanboy.com/content/articles/The_Definitive_Guide_To_The_DC_Comics_Reboot |archivedate=June 19, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2013, DC unveiled two new digital comic innovations to enhance interactivity: ''DC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''DC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Multiverse''. ''DC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' layers dynamic artwork onto digital comic panels, adding a new level of dimension to digital storytelling, while ''DC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Multiverse'' allows readers to determine a specific story outcome by selecting individual characters, storylines and plot developments while reading the comic, meaning one digital comic has multiple outcomes.

'''DC Entertainment, Inc.''' is a subsidiary of [[Warner Bros.]] that manages its comic book units and intellectual property (characters) in other units as they work with other Warner Bros units.

In September 2009, Warner Bros. announced that DC Comics would become a subsidiary of DC Entertainment, Inc., with [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]], President of [[Warner Premiere]], becoming president of the newly formed holding company and DC Comics President and Publisher Paul Levitz moving to the position of Contributing Editor and Overall Consultant there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Warner Bros.

On February 18, 2010, DC Entertainment named [[Jim Lee]] and [[Dan DiDio]] as Co-Publishers of DC Comics, [[Geoff Johns]] as Chief Creative Officer, John Rood as EVP (Executive Vice President) of Sales, Marketing and Business Development, and Patrick Caldon as EVP of Finance and Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=24897 |title=DC Names DiDio &amp; Lee Co-Publisher, Johns Chief Creative Officer |website=Comic Book Resources |date=February 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026235244/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article |archive-date=October 26, 2008 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, DC Entertainment announced that the DC Comics offices were going to move from New York City to Warner Bros. Burbank, California, headquarters in 2015. The other units, animation, movie, TV and portfolio planning, had preceded DC Comics by moving there in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Warner's DC comic-book unit leaving Gotham |url= http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-warners-dc-comic-book-unit-leaving-gotham-2013oct29-story.html |newspaper= The San Diego Union Tribune |date= October 29, 2013 |access-date= July 11, 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180424202336/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-warners-dc-comic-book-unit-leaving-gotham-2013oct29-story.html |archive-date= April 24, 2018 |url-status=live |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner Bros. Pictures reorganized in May 2016 to have genre responsible film executives, thus DC Entertainment franchise films under Warner Bros. were placed under a newly created division, DC Films, created under Warner Bros. executive vice president [[Jon Berg]] and DC chief content officer Geoff Johns. This was done in the same vein as [[Marvel Studios]] in unifying DC-related filmmaking under a single vision and clarifying the greenlighting process. Johns also kept his existing role at DC Comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-v-superman-fallout-warner-895174 |title='Batman v.

DC's first [[logo]] appeared on the April 1940 issues of its titles. The letters &quot;DC&quot; stood for ''Detective Comics'', the name of Batman's flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, &quot;A DC Publication&quot;.

The November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one and was the first version with a white background. The name &quot;Superman&quot; was added to &quot;A DC Publication&quot;, effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as &quot;Superman-DC&quot;.

In November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company's formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo also served as the round body of Johnny DC, DC's [[mascot]] in the 1960s.

In October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favour of a simple &quot;DC&quot; in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of ''Action Comics'', for example, read &quot;DC Superman&quot;. An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as [[Anthology|anthologies]] like ''[[House of Mystery]]'' or team series such as ''Justice League of America'', the title and &quot;DC&quot; appeared in a stylized logo, such as a [[bat]] for &quot;House of Mystery&quot;. This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as [[trademark]]s, and was similar to Marvel's contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.

DC's &quot;100 Page Super-Spectacular&quot; titles and later 100-page and &quot;Giant&quot; issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters &quot;DC&quot; in a simple [[sans-serif]] [[typeface]] within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square.

The July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters &quot;DC&quot; were rendered in a block-like typeface that remained through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.

In December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words &quot;The Line of DC Super-Stars&quot; and the star motif that continued in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976.

When Jenette Kahn became DC's [[Publishing|publisher]] in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer [[Milton Glaser]] to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the &quot;DC bullet&quot;, this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and colour and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old &quot;DC bullet&quot; continues to be used only on the [[DC Archive Editions]] series.

In July 1987, DC released variant editions of ''Justice League'' #3 and ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #61 with a new DC logo. It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words &quot;SUPERMAN COMICS&quot;. The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rozakis |first1=Bob |title=Conspiracy? Icons?

On May 8, 2005, a new logo (dubbed the &quot;DC spin&quot;) was unveiled, debuting on DC titles in June 2005 with ''DC Special: The Return of [[Donna Troy]]'' #1 and the rest of the titles the following week. In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since ''[[Batman Begins]]'', with ''[[Superman Returns]]'' showing the logo's normal variant, and the TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', the animated series ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' and others, as well as for [[collectible]]s and other merchandise. The logo was designed by Josh Beatman of Brainchild Studios&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainchildstudiosnyc.com/downloads/DC_brandHistory.pdf DC Comics Brand History by Brainchild Studios] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910083021/http://www.brainchildstudiosnyc.com/downloads/DC_brandHistory.pdf |date=September 10, 2008 }}.

Retrieved July 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, DC unveiled a new logo consisting of the letter &quot;D&quot; flipping back to reveal the letter &quot;C&quot; and &quot;DC ENTERTAINMENT&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://comicsalliance.com/new-dc-logo-images-interactive/ |title=NEW INTERACTIVE DC COMICS LOGOS TO BE DEPLOYED IN MARCH |last=Khouri |first=Andy |work=Comics Alliance |date=January 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233304/http://comicsalliance.com/new-dc-logo-images-interactive/ |archivedate=December 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' was the first film to use the new logo, while the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' was the first series to feature the new logo.
