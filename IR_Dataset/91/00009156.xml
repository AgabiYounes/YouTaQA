'''Dolores Agnes Fuller''' (née Eble; March 10, 1923 &amp;ndash; May 9, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|title=Dolores Fuller dies at 88; actress dated director Ed Wood|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dolores-fuller-20110511,0,5525788.story?track=rss|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=May 11, 2011|date=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American actress and songwriter best known as the one-time girlfriend of the low-budget film director [[Ed Wood]]. She played the protagonist's girlfriend in ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'', co-starred in Wood's ''[[Jail Bait (1954 film)|Jail Bait]]'', and had a minor role in his ''[[Bride of the Monster]]''. Later, [[Elvis Presley]] recorded a number of her songs written for his films.

==Film career==
Her first screen appearance was at the age of 10, when she appeared briefly in [[Frank Capra]]’s ''[[It Happened One Night]]''. According to Fuller,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/147880%7C0/Bride-of-the-Monster.html |title=Bride of the Monster |last=Miller |first=John M. |date= |website=Turner Classic Movies |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the female lead in ''[[Bride of the Monster]]'' was written for her but Wood gave it to [[Loretta King Hadler|Loretta King]] instead.

In August 1954, Fuller was cast in Wood's ''The Vampire's Tomb'', intended to star [[Bela Lugosi]]. Frank Yaconelli was named as her co-star and 'comic killer'. The film was never made. She ended up making an appearance in ''Bride of the Monster'' (1956), also with Lugosi.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Vampire Types Gathering For Movie&quot; (August 2, 1954) ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', p. B9&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller hosted a benefit for Lugosi which preceded the showing of ''Bride of the Atom'' (early working title of ''Bride of the Monster'') on May 11, 1955. A cocktail party was held at the Gardens Restaurant at 4311 Magnolia Avenue in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], California. [[Maila Nurmi|Vampira]] attended and was escorted by [[Paul Marco]]. A single screening of the film was presented at the Hollywood Paramount.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lugosi Benefit Slated Tonight&quot; (May 11, 1955) ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fuller, as quoted in Wood biography ''Nightmare of Ecstasy'' (1992), she first met Ed Wood when she attended a casting call with a friend for a movie he was supposed to direct called ''Behind Locked Doors''; it has also been stated that they met in a restaurant.&lt;ref name=telegraph-obit/&gt;

She became his girlfriend shortly thereafter and began acting in his films. Her movie career included a bit part in ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934) and roles in ''Outlaw Women'' (1952), ''[[Glen or Glenda]]'' (1953), ''Body Beautiful'' (1953), ''[[The Blue Gardenia]]'' (1953), ''[[Count the Hours]]'' (1953), ''[[Mesa of Lost Women]]'' (1953), ''College Capers'' (1954), ''[[Jail Bait (1954 film)|Jail Bait]]'' (1954), ''[[The Raid (1954 film)|The Raid]]'' (1954), ''This Is My Love'' (1954), ''[[The Opposite Sex]]'' (1956), ''The Ironbound Vampire'' (1997), and ''Dimensions in Fear'' (1998).

==Television performer and songwriter==
Fuller had already had earlier experience on television in ''[[Queen for a Day]]'' and ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]''. 

She also appeared on an episode of ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]'' as &quot;the blonde in the mink coat.&quot;

Fuller's ability as a songwriter manifested itself through the intervention of her friend, producer [[Hal B. Wallis|Hal Wallis]]; Fuller had wanted to get an acting role in the Elvis Presley movie ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'', which Wallis was producing, but instead he put her in touch with [[Hill &amp; Range]], the publisher that provided Presley with songs. Fuller went into a collaborative partnership with composer [[Ben Weisman]] and co-wrote one song, &quot;[[Rock-A-Hula Baby]]&quot;, for the film. It was a beginning that eventually led to Elvis Presley recording a dozen of her songs, including &quot;I Got Lucky&quot; and &quot;Spinout&quot;. Fuller's music was recorded by [[Nat 'King' Cole]], [[Peggy Lee]], and other leading talents of the time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dolores-fuller-20110511-story.html|title=Dolores Fuller dies at 88; actress dated director Ed Wood|date=2011-05-11|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
Grey quotes Fuller as saying of the period before her success, &quot;He (Ed Wood) begged me to marry him. I loved him in a way, but I couldn't handle the transvestism. I'm a very normal person. It's hard for me to deviate! I wanted a man that was all man. After we broke up, he would stand outside my home in Burbank and cry. 'Let me in, I love you!' What good would I have done if I had married him? We would have starved together. I bettered myself. I had to uplift myself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Grey (1992) ''Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr'',  Feral House, New York {{ISBN|978-0-92291-504-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also been quoted as saying that &quot;His dressing up didn’t bother me — we all have our little queer habits&quot; and giving Wood's drinking as the reason for their breakup.&lt;ref name=telegraph-obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8513025/Dolores-Fuller.html|title=Dolores Fuller|journal=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=May 13, 2011|accessdate=June 3, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller's autobiography, ''A Fuller Life: Hollywood, Ed Wood and Me'', co-authored by Winnipeg writer Stone Wallace and her husband Philip Chamberlin, was published in 2008.&lt;ref name=telegraph-obit/&gt;

==Portrayal in ''Ed Wood''==
Fuller was portrayed by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s 1994 Wood biographical film ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', a portrayal of which she disapproved due to the fact that she was depicted smoking in the film, while Fuller said she herself was a lifelong non-smoker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/interview_doris_fuller.shtml Interview with Dolores Fuller], ''For Elvis Fans Only'', Elvis Australia: Official Elvis Presley Fan Club, July 15, 2006. Retrieved August 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She also complained that she was only portrayed as &quot;sort of as an actress&quot; and did not feel she was given credit for her other accomplishments and contributions towards Wood's career.&lt;ref&gt;''Dolores Fuller on Ed Wood Jr., Being Dissed By Sarah Jessica Parker Interview'', retrieved May 12, 2010 from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-TAnzid1sQ&lt;/ref&gt; However, she stated that she liked the film overall, praising [[Johnny Depp]]'s performance in the title role.
