In [[law]] and [[government]], '''de jure''' ({{IPAc-en|d|eɪ|_|ˈ|dʒ|ʊər|i|,_|d|i|_|-}} {{respell|day|_|JOOR|ee|,_|dee|_-}}; {{Lang-la|de iure}} {{IPA-la|deː ˈjuːrɛ|}}, &quot;by law&quot;) describes practices that are legally recognised, regardless whether the practice exists in reality.&lt;ref name=Dictionary.cm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Dictionary.com/browse/de-jure|title=de jure|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC.|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, {{no wrap|''[[de facto]]''}} (&quot;in fact&quot;) describes situations that exist in reality, even if not legally recognised.&lt;ref name=&quot;OxfordDF2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of 'de facto' adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|url=http://www.OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com/definition/english/de-facto_2|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are often used to contrast different scenarios: for a colloquial example, &quot;I know that, ''de jure'', this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it's a ''de facto'' swimming pool&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashULaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal English: &quot;De Facture/De Jure&quot;|url=https://onlinelaw.wustl.edu/blog/legal-english-de-factode-jure/|publisher=Washington University School of Law|website=@WashULaw|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further explain, even if the signs around the flooded parking lot say &quot;Parking Lot&quot; (the &quot;law&quot; determining it as a parking lot), it is &quot;in fact&quot; a swimming pool (due to the current practical circumstances of it being flooded).

==Examples==
It is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (''de jure'') legalities, possibly none of which is in force (''de facto'').  After seizing power in 1526, [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] made his brother, [[Umar Din]], the lawful (''de jure'') [[Sultan]] of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]].  Ahmad, however, was in practice (de facto) the actual Sultan, and his brother was a figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aḥmad Grāñ - Somalian Muslim leader|url=https://www.Britannica.com/biography/Ahmad-Gran|work=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1805 and 1914, the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|ruling dynasty]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]] ruled as de jure [[viceroy]]s of the [[Ottoman Empire]], but acted as de facto independent rulers who maintained a [[polite fiction]] of Ottoman [[suzerainty]].  However, from about 1882, the rulers had only de jure rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British [[puppet state]].  Thus, Egypt was by Ottoman law de jure a province of the Ottoman Empire, but de facto was part of the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cfJC1zLvBhQC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;ved=0ahUKEwijoK6thuzWAhXJExoKHTYvBTE4ChDoAQgnMAA&amp;q=veiled%20protectorate|title=The British in Egypt: Community, Crime and Crises 1882-1922|last=Mak|first=Lanver|date=2012-03-15|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848857094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Law of the United States|U.S. law]], particularly after ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954), the difference between de facto segregation (segregation that existed because of the voluntary associations and neighborhoods) and de jure segregation (segregation that existed because of local laws that mandated the segregation) became important distinctions for court-mandated remedial purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndersonByrne2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Anderson|author2=Dara N.
