The '''Daleks''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Mgm_pronunciation_Dalek.ogg|ˈ|d|ɑː|l|ɛ|k|s}} {{Respell|DAH|leks}}) are a fictional [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] race of [[mutant]]s principally portrayed in the British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The Daleks were conceived by science-fiction writer [[Terry Nation]] and first appeared in the 1963 ''Doctor Who'' serial ''[[The Daleks]]'', in the shells designed by [[Raymond Cusick]].

Drawing inspiration from the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s, Nation portrayed the Daleks as violent, merciless and pitiless cyborg aliens, who demand total conformity to their will,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2015/doctor-who-50-things-you-didnt-know/ |title=The Daleks were based on the Nazis... |access-date=4 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226224555/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2015/doctor-who-50-things-you-didnt-know/ |archive-date=26 February 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and who are bent on the conquest of the universe and the [[Genocide|extermination]] of what they see as inferior races.

In the programme's narrative the Daleks were engineered by the scientist [[Davros]] during the final years of a thousand-year war between his people, the Kaleds, and their enemies the [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]]s. With some Kaleds already badly mutated and damaged by [[nuclear war]], Davros genetically modified the Kaleds and integrated them with a [[tank]]-like [[robot]]ic shell, removing their every emotion apart from hate. His creations soon came to view themselves as the supreme race in the universe, intent on purging the universe of all non-Dalek life. Collectively they are the greatest enemies of ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s protagonist, the [[Time Lord]] known as &quot;[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]&quot;. Later in the programme's run the Daleks acquired [[time travel in fiction|time travel technology]] and engaged the Time Lords in a brutal [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] affecting most of the universe, with battles taking place across the whole of history.

The Daleks are the show's most popular and famous villains and their returns to the series over the decades have gained media attention. Their frequent order to &quot;Exterminate!&quot; has become common usage.

==Creation==
The Daleks were created by [[Terry Nation]] and designed by the [[BBC]] designer [[Raymond Cusick]].&lt;ref name=Cusick&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=Asa |authorlink=Asa Briggs |title=The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom |year=1995 |volume=vol. 5 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0pRGjVGtUvwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A019215964X&amp;pg=PA422#v=onepage&amp;q= |accessdate=20 March 2010 |isbn=0-19-215964-X }}&lt;br/&gt;Designer Raymond Cusick said that he got the idea for their appearance &quot;whilst fiddling with a pepperpot&quot; and had them produced in fibreglass, at a cost of less than £250 each.&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced in December 1963 in the second ''Doctor Who'' serial, colloquially known as ''[[The Daleks]]''.&lt;ref name=B2&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They became an immediate and huge hit with viewers, featuring in many subsequent serials and, in the 1960s, two films. They have become as synonymous with ''Doctor Who'' as the Doctor himself, and their behaviour and catchphrases are now part of British [[popular culture]]. &quot;Hiding [[behind the sofa]] whenever the Daleks appear&quot; has been cited as an element of British cultural identity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Entry into popular culture==
As early as one year after first appearing on ''Doctor Who'', the Daleks had become popular enough to be recognized even by non-viewers. In December 1964 [[editorial cartoonist]] [[Leslie Gilbert Illingworth]] published a cartoon in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' captioned &quot;THE DEGAULLEK&quot;, caricaturing French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] arriving at a [[NATO]] meeting as a Dalek with de Gaulle's prominent nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.cartoons.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=06435|title=The Degaullek|last=Illingworth|first=Leslie Gilbert|date=16 December 1964|website=[[British Cartoon Archive]]|publisher=[[University of Kent]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728195136/https://archive.cartoons.ac.uk/record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&amp;id=06435|archive-date=28 July 2019|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;Dalek&quot; has entered major dictionaries, including the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines &quot;Dalek&quot; as &quot;a type of robot appearing in 'Dr. Who'{{sic}}, a B.B.C. Television science-fiction programme; hence used allusively.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=J. A. |editor1-last=Simpson |editor1-link=John Simpson (lexicographer) |editor2-first=E. S.

For example, [[John Birt]], the [[Director-General of the BBC]] from 1992 to 2000, was called a &quot;croak-voiced Dalek&quot; by playwright [[Dennis Potter]] in the MacTaggart Lecture at the 1993 [[Edinburgh International Television Festival|Edinburgh Television Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Externally Daleks resemble human-sized [[salt and pepper shakers|pepper pots]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cusick&quot;/&gt; with a single mechanical eyestalk mounted on a rotating dome, a gun mount containing an energy weapon (&quot;gunstick&quot; or &quot;[[death ray]]&quot;) resembling an egg whisk, and a telescopic manipulator arm usually tipped by an appendage resembling a sink [[plunger]].

The lower half of a Dalek's shell is covered with hemispherical protrusions, or &quot;Dalek bumps&quot;, which are shown in the episode &quot;[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]&quot; to be spheres embedded in the casing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt; Both the BBC-licensed ''Dalek Book'' (1964) and ''The Doctor Who Technical Manual'' (1983) describe these items as being part of a sensory array,&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1983), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; while in the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|2005 series]] episode &quot;Dalek&quot; they are integral to a Dalek's [[self-destruct]] mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt; Their armour has a forcefield that evaporates most bullets and resists most types of energy weapons. The forcefield seems to be concentrated around the Dalek's midsection (where the mutant is located), as normally ineffective firepower can be concentrated on the eyestalk to blind a Dalek.

Daleks' voices are electronic; when out of its casing the mutant is able only to squeak.&lt;ref name=Resurrection1/&gt; Once the mutant is removed the casing itself can be entered and operated by humanoids; for example, in ''[[The Daleks]]'', [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]) enters a Dalek shell to masquerade as a guard as part of an escape plan.&lt;ref name=B3/&gt;

The Daleks were actually controlled from inside by short operators,&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters-82&quot;&gt;Howe (1997), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; who had to manipulate their eyestalks, domes and arms, as well as flashing the lights on their heads in sync with the actors supplying their voices. The Dalek cases were built in two pieces; an operator would step into the lower section and then the top would be secured. The operators looked out between the cylindrical louvres just beneath the dome, which were lined with mesh to conceal their faces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters-82&quot;/&gt;

In addition to being hot and cramped, the Dalek casings also muffled external sounds, making it difficult for operators to hear the director or dialogue. [[John Scott Martin]], a Dalek operator from the original series, said that Dalek operation was a challenge: &quot;You had to have about six hands: one to do the eyestalk, one to do the lights, one for the gun, another for the smoke canister underneath, yet another for the sink plunger. If you were related to an octopus then it helped.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters_85&quot;&gt;Howe (1997), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''Doctor Who'''s 21st-century revival the Dalek casings retain the same overall shape and dimensional proportions of previous Daleks, although many details have been redesigned to give the Dalek a heavier and more solid look.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Arnopp |first=Jason |date=July 2005 |title=Tucker's Luck |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] Special Edition |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|Royal Tunbridge Wells]], Kent |issue=11 |pages=62–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes include a larger, more pointed base; a glowing eyepiece; an all-over metallic-brass finish (specified by Davies); thicker, nailed strips on the &quot;neck&quot; section; a housing for the eyestalk pivot; and significantly larger dome lights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;/&gt; The new prop made its on-screen debut in the 2005 episode &quot;Dalek&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;/&gt; These Dalek casings use a short operator inside the housing while the 'head' and eyestalk are operated via remote control.

====Movement====
Terry Nation's original plan was for the Daleks to glide across the floor. Early versions of the Daleks rolled on nylon [[Caster|castors]], propelled by the operator's feet. Although castors were adequate for the Daleks' debut serial, which was shot entirely at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]], for ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' Terry Nation wanted the Daleks to be filmed on the streets of London. To enable the Daleks to travel smoothly on location, designer Spencer Chapman built the new Dalek shells around miniature [[tricycle]]s with sturdier wheels, which were hidden by enlarged fenders fitted below the original base.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1997), pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; The uneven flagstones of Central London caused the Daleks to rattle as they moved and it was not possible to remove this noise from the final soundtrack. A small parabolic dish was added to the rear of the prop's casing to explain why these Daleks, unlike the ones in their first serial, were not dependent on [[static electricity]] drawn up from the floors of the Dalek city for their motive power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters_85&quot;/&gt;

Later versions of the prop had more efficient wheels and were once again simply propelled by the seated operators' feet, but they remained so heavy that when going up ramps they often had to be pushed by stagehands out of camera shot. The difficulty of operating all the prop's parts at once contributed to the occasionally jerky Dalek movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters_85&quot;/&gt; This problem has largely been eradicated with the advent of the &quot;new series&quot; version, as its remotely controlled dome and eyestalk allow the operator to concentrate on the smooth movement of the Dalek and its arms.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (2006), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voices====
The [[staccato]] delivery, harsh tone and rising inflection of the Dalek voice were initially developed by two voice actors, [[Peter Hawkins]] and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], who varied the pitch and speed of the lines according to the emotion needed. Their voices were further processed electronically by [[Brian Hodgson]] at the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]]. The sound-processing devices used have varied over the decades. In 1963 Hodgson and his colleagues used equalisation to boost the mid-range of the actor's voice, then subjected it to [[ring modulation]] with a 30&amp;nbsp;Hz [[sine wave]]. The distinctive harsh, grating vocal timbre this produced has remained the pattern for all Dalek voices since (with the exception of those in the 1985 serial ''[[Revelation of the Daleks]]'', for which the director, [[Graeme Harper]], deliberately used less distortion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |title=BBC – Doctor Who – Dalek Empire III [interview with Nicholas Briggs] |date=8 July 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010 |work=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110052452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2004/07/08/12725.shtml |archivedate=10 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Hawkins and Graham, other voice actors for the Daleks have included [[Roy Skelton]], who first voiced the Daleks in the 1967 story ''[[The Evil of the Daleks]]'' and provided voices for five additional Dalek serials including ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'',&lt;ref name=Planet&gt;''[[Planet of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[David Maloney]], Producer [[Barry Letts]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 7 April–12 May 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the one-off anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]''. [[Michael Wisher]], the actor who originated the role of Dalek creator Davros in ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'', provided Dalek voices for that same story, as well as for ''[[Frontier in Space]]'', ''[[Planet of the Daleks]]'', and ''[[Death to the Daleks]]''. Other Dalek voice actors include [[Royce Mills]] (three stories),&lt;ref name=Revelation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;&lt;ref name=Resurrection/&gt; [[Brian Miller (actor)|Brian Miller]] (two stories),&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;&lt;ref name=Resurrection/&gt; and Oliver Gilbert and Peter Messaline (one story).&lt;ref name=Day&gt;''[[Day of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Louis Marks]], Director [[Paul Bernard (director)|Paul Bernard]], Producer Barry Letts. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 1–22 January 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Leeson]], who performed the voice of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] in several ''Doctor Who'' stories, and Davros actors [[Terry Molloy]] and [[David Gooderson]] also contributed supporting voices for various Dalek serials.&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;&lt;ref name=Destiny/&gt;

Since 2005 the Dalek voice in the television series has been provided by [[Nicholas Briggs]], speaking into a microphone connected to a voice modulator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dalek confidential&quot;&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs had previously provided Dalek and other alien voices for [[Big Finish Productions]] [[radio drama|audio plays]], and continues to do so. In a 2006 BBC Radio interview, Briggs said that when the BBC asked him to do the voice for the new television series, they instructed him to bring his own analogue ring modulator that he had used in the audio plays. The BBC's sound department had changed to a digital platform and could not adequately create the distinctive Dalek sound with their modern equipment. Briggs went as far as to bring the voice modulator to the actors' readings of the scripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dalek confidential&quot;/&gt;

====Construction====
Manufacturing the props was expensive.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judicious editing techniques also gave the impression that there were more Daleks than were actually available, such as using a [[Split screen (video production)|split screen]] in &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot;.&lt;ref name=Parting/&gt;

Four fully functioning props were commissioned for the first serial &quot;The Daleks&quot; in 1963, and were constructed from BBC plans by Shawcraft Engineering.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} These became known in fan circles as [[Dalek variants#Mark I Daleks|&quot;Mk I Daleks&quot;]]. Shawcraft were also commissioned to construct approximately 20 Daleks for the two Dalek movies in 1965 and 1966 (see [[#Other appearances|below]]). Some of these movie props filtered back to the BBC and were seen in the televised serials, notably ''The Chase'', which was aired before the first movie's debut.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} The remaining props not bought by the BBC were either donated to charity or given away as prizes in competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), pp. 132, 137&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC's own Dalek props were reused many times, with components of the original Shawcraft &quot;Mk I Daleks&quot; surviving right through to their final classic series appearance in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/remembrance-of-the-daleks.htm |title=Dalek 6388 Remembrance |work=Dalek 6388 – A Dalek Prop History – Remembrance of the Daleks |accessdate=9 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325193549/http://www.dalek6388.co.uk/remembrance-of-the-daleks.htm |archive-date=25 March 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; But years of storage and repainting took their toll. By the time of the [[Sixth Doctor]]'s ''Revelation of the Daleks'' new props were being manufactured out of [[fibreglass]]. These models were lighter and more affordable to construct than their predecessors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters_92&quot;&gt;Howe (1997), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These newer models were slightly bulkier in appearance around the mid-shoulder section, and also had a redesigned skirt section which was more vertical at the back. Other minor changes were made to the design due to these new construction methods, including altering the fender and incorporating the arm boxes, collars, and slats into a single fibreglass moulding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monsters_92&quot;/&gt; These props were repainted in grey for the [[Seventh Doctor]] serial ''Remembrance of the Daleks'' and designated as &quot;[[Dalek variants#Renegade Daleks|Renegade Daleks]]&quot;; another redesign, painted in cream and gold, became the &quot;[[Dalek variants#Imperial Daleks|Imperial Dalek]]&quot; faction.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

New Dalek props were built for the 21st-century version of ''Doctor Who''. The first, which appeared alone in the 2005 episode &quot;[[Dalek (episode)|Dalek]]&quot;, was built by modelmaker [[Mike Tucker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker&quot;/&gt; Additional Dalek props based on Tucker's master were subsequently built out of fibreglass by [[Cardiff]]-based Specialist Models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Specialist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialistmodels.co.uk/services/film_and_tv/bbc_wales_dr_who_daleks_fibreglass_props |title=BBC Wales Dr Who Daleks Fibreglass Props |date=21 March 2010 |publisher=Specialist Models &amp; Displays |accessdate=23 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904183235/http://www.specialistmodels.co.uk/services/film_and_tv/BBC_Wales_Dr_Who_Daleks_Fibreglass_Props |archivedate=4 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Wishing to create an alien creature that did not look like a &quot;man in a suit&quot;, Terry Nation stated in his script for the first Dalek serial that they should have no legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;;Monsters-80&quot;&gt;Howe (1997), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; He was also inspired by a performance by the [[Georgian National Ballet]], in which dancers in long skirts appeared to glide across the stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;;Monsters-80&quot;/&gt; For many of the shows the Daleks were operated by retired ballet dancers wearing black socks while sitting inside the Dalek.&lt;ref name=&quot;dalek companion&quot;/&gt; Raymond Cusick was given the task of designing the Daleks when [[Ridley Scott]], then a designer for the BBC, proved unavailable after having been initially assigned to their debut serial.&lt;ref name=&quot;scott&quot;&gt;Howe (1994), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jeremy Bentham's ''Doctor Who—The Early Years'' (1986). after Nation wrote the script Cusick was given only an hour to come up with the design for the Daleks and was inspired in his initial sketches by a pepper pot on a table.&lt;ref name=&quot;bentham&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |title=Doctor Who—The Early Years |date=May 1986 |publisher=W.H. Allen |location=England |isbn=0-491-03612-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cusick himself, however, states that he based it on a man seated in a chair, and used the pepper pot only to demonstrate how it might move.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (2006), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Cusick is generally given sole credit for the design of the Dalek,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Nation (1979), p. 42, Howe (1992), p. 124, Peel (1988) pp. 18–20)&lt;/ref&gt; but Jeremy Rewse-Davies is occasionally described as the Daleks' co-designer.&lt;ref name=&quot;rewsedavies&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=No more transports of delight |first=Jonathan |last=Glancey |authorlink=Jonathan Glancey |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/no-more-transports-of-delight-1584494.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=1 June 1995 |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

In 1964 Nation told a ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reporter that the Dalek name came from a dictionary or encyclopaedia volume, the spine of which read &quot;Dal – Lek&quot; (or, according to another version, &quot;Dal – Eks&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel2122&quot;&gt;Peel (1988), pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; He later admitted that this book and the associated origin of the Dalek name were completely fictitious, and that anyone bothering to check out his story would have found him out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel2122&quot;/&gt; The name had simply rolled off his typewriter.&lt;ref name=&quot;companion 13&quot;&gt;Howe (1998), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Later Nation was pleasantly surprised to discover that in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] the word &quot;dalek&quot; means &quot;far&quot; or &quot;distant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;30 years&quot;&gt;Davies, Kevin (director) (1993).

Nation grew up during the Second World War and remembered the fear caused by German bombings. He consciously based the Daleks on the [[Nazism|Nazis]], conceiving the species as faceless, authoritarian figures dedicated to conquest and complete conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The allusion is most obvious in the Dalek stories written by Nation, in particular ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' (1964) and ''[[Genesis of the Daleks]]'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Miles (2006), pp. 105–109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1998), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/genesisofdaleks/detail.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide – Genesis of the Daleks – Details |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Howe |first=David J. |authorlink=David J.

Before he wrote the first Dalek serial Nation was a scriptwriter for the comedian [[Tony Hancock]]. The two men had a falling out and Nation either resigned or was fired.&lt;ref name=&quot;;Monsters-80&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel2122&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles (2006), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock worked on several series proposals, one of which was called ''From Plip to Plop'', a comedic history of the world that would have ended with a nuclear apocalypse, the survivors being reduced to living in dustbin-like robot casings and eating radiation to stay alive. According to Hancock's biographer Cliff Goodwin, when Hancock saw the Daleks he allegedly shouted at the screen, &quot;That bloody Nation—he's stolen my robots!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hancock&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodwin |first=Cliff |title=When the Wind Changed: The Life and Death of Tony Hancock |date=Nov 2000 |publisher=Arrow |location=England |isbn=0-09-960941-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instant appeal of the Daleks caught the BBC off guard,&lt;ref name=&quot;Peel2122&quot;/&gt; and transformed ''Doctor Who'' into a national phenomenon. Children were alternately frightened and fascinated by the alien look of the monsters, and the ''Doctor Who'' production office was inundated with letters and calls asking about the creatures. Newspaper articles focused attention on the series and the Daleks, further enhancing their popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;dalek companion&quot;/&gt;

Nation jointly owned the intellectual property rights to the Daleks with the BBC, and the money-making concept proved nearly impossible to sell to anyone else, so he was dependent on the BBC wanting to produce stories featuring the creatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;dioe notes&quot;&gt;On-screen production notes, ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' London, UK: BBC Video, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Several attempts to market the Daleks outside the series were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Peel (1988), p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1997), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Since Nation's death in 1997, his share of the rights is now administered by his former agent, Tim Hancock.&lt;ref name=&quot;daleksback&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3535588.stm|title=Daleks back to fight Doctor Who|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2004|accessdate=20 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427051852/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3535588.stm|archive-date=27 April 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early plans for what eventually became the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television movie]] included radically redesigned Daleks whose cases unfolded like spiders' legs.&lt;ref&gt;Segal (2000), pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; The concept for these &quot;[[Spider Dalek]]s&quot; was abandoned, but it was picked up again in several [[Doctor Who spin-offs|''Doctor Who'' spin-offs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spider&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic

==Fictional history==
{{Main|History of the Daleks}}

Dalek in-universe history has seen many [[retcon|retroactive changes]], which have caused [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;Peel (1988), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; When the Daleks first appeared, they were presented as the descendants of the Dals, mutated after a brief nuclear war between the Dal and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thal]] races 500 years ago. This race of Daleks is destroyed when their power supply is wrecked.&lt;ref name=B&gt;''[[The Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[Christopher Barry]], Producer [[Verity Lambert]]. ''Doctor Who''. [[BBC]], London. 21 December 1963 – 1 February 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when they reappear in ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'', they have conquered Earth in the 22nd century. Later stories saw them develop time travel and a space empire. In 1975, Terry Nation revised the Daleks' origins in ''Genesis of the Daleks'', where the Dals were now called [[Kaled]]s (of which &quot;Daleks&quot; is an [[anagram]]), and the Dalek design was attributed to one man, the crippled Kaled chief scientist and evil genius, Davros.&lt;ref name=Genesis&gt;''[[Genesis of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[David Maloney]], Producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 8 March–12 April 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of a short nuclear exchange, the Kaled-Thal war was portrayed as a thousand-year-long war of [[attrition warfare|attrition]], fought with [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[Biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapon]]s which caused widespread mutations among the Kaled race. Davros experimented on living Kaled cells to find the ultimate mutated form of the Kaled species and placed the subjects in [[tank]]-like &quot;travel machines&quot; whose design was based on his own life-support chair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genesis&quot;/&gt;

''Genesis of the Daleks'' marked a new era for the depiction of the species, with most of their previous history either forgotten or barely referred to again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory2.shtml |title=The second history of the Daleks |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |authorlink1=Paul Cornell |first2=Martin |last2=Day |authorlink2=Martin Day |first3=Keith |last3=Topping |authorlink3=Keith Topping |year=1995 |work=Official Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001075248/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory2.shtml |archive-date=1 October 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future stories in the original ''Doctor Who'' series, which followed a rough [[story arc]],&lt;ref&gt;Parkin (2006), p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; would also focus more on Davros, much to the dissatisfaction of some fans who felt that the Daleks should take centre stage rather than merely becoming minions of their creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=David J.

One faction, the &quot;Imperial Daleks&quot;, were loyal to Davros, who had become their Emperor, whilst the other, the &quot;Renegade Daleks&quot;, followed a black Supreme Dalek. By the end of the story, both factions have been wiped out and the Doctor has tricked them into destroying Skaro, though Davros escapes.&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;

A single Dalek appeared in &quot;[[Dalek (Doctor Who episode)|Dalek]]&quot;, written by [[Rob Shearman|Robert Shearman]], which was broadcast on BBC One on 30 April 2005. This Dalek appeared to be the sole Dalek survivor of the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] which had destroyed both the Daleks and the Time Lords.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt; A [[Emperor Dalek|Dalek Emperor]] returned at the end of the 2005 series, having rebuilt the Dalek race with genetic material harvested from human subjects. It saw itself as a god, and the new Daleks were shown worshipping it. These Daleks and their fleet were destroyed in &quot;[[The Parting of the Ways]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Parting/&gt; The 2006 season finale &quot;[[Army of Ghosts]]&quot;/&quot;[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]&quot; featured a squad of four Dalek survivors from the old Empire, known as the [[Cult of Skaro]], led by a black Dalek known as &quot;[[Dalek Sec|Sec]]&quot;, that had survived the Time War by escaping into the Void between dimensions. They emerged, along with the Genesis Ark, a Time Lord prison vessel containing millions of Daleks, at Canary Wharf due to the actions of the [[Torchwood Institute]] and [[Cyberman#Revived series|Cybermen from a parallel world]]. This resulted in a Cyberman-Dalek clash in London, which was resolved when the [[Tenth Doctor]] caused both groups to be sucked back into the Void. The Cult survived by utilising an &quot;emergency temporal shift&quot; to escape.&lt;ref name=Doomsday/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;army&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[Army of Ghosts]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = Cardiff | airdate = 1 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These four Daleks - Sec, Jast, Thay and Caan - returned in the two-part story &quot;[[Daleks in Manhattan]]&quot;/&quot;[[Evolution of the Daleks]]&quot;, in which whilst stranded in 1930s New York, they set up a base in the partially built [[Empire State Building]] and attempt to rebuild the Dalek race. To this end, Dalek Sec merges with a human being to become a Human/Dalek hybrid. The Cult then set about creating &quot;Human Daleks&quot; by &quot;formatting&quot; the brains of a few thousand captured humans, with the intention of producing hybrids which remain fully human in appearance but with Dalek minds.&lt;ref name=Evolution&gt;{{cite episode | title = Evolution of the Daleks | episodelink = Evolution of the Daleks | series = Doctor Who | serieslink = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Helen Raynor]], Director [[James Strong (director)|James Strong]], Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC1 | location = Cardiff | airdate = 28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalek Sec, however, starts to become so human that he changes the DNA to make the hybrids more human. This angers the rest of the Cult, resulting in mutiny and the death of Sec, Thay and Jast as well as the wiping out of all the hybrids. This leaves Dalek Caan as the last Dalek in existence. When the Doctor makes Caan realise that he is the last of his kind, Caan uses emergency temporal shift and escapes once more.&lt;ref name=Evolution/&gt;

The Daleks returned in the 2008 season's two-part finale, &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot;/&quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, accompanied once again by their creator Davros. The story reveals that Caan's temporal shift sent him into the Time War whence he rescued Davros, in the process gaining the ability to see the future at the cost of his own sanity. Davros has created a new race using his own body's cells. The episode depicts a Dalek invasion of Earth, which with other planets is taken to the Medusa Cascade, led by a red Supreme Dalek, who has kept Caan and Davros imprisoned in &quot;The Vault&quot;, a section of the Dalek flagship, the ''Crucible''. Davros and the Daleks plan to destroy reality itself with a &quot;reality bomb&quot; for which they need the stolen planets. The plan fails due to the interference of [[Donna Noble]], a companion of the Doctor, and Caan himself, who has been manipulating events to destroy the Daleks after realising the severity of the atrocities they have committed.&lt;ref name=Stolen&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[The Stolen Earth]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Journey&gt;{{cite episode | title = [[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]] | series = Doctor Who | credits = Writer [[Russell T Davies]], Director Graeme Harper, Producer [[Phil Collinson]] | network = BBC | station = BBC One | location = [[Cardiff]] | airdate = 5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Daleks returned in the 2010 episode &quot;[[Victory of the Daleks]]&quot;, the third episode of the series; Daleks who escaped the destruction of Davros' empire fell back in time and, by chance, managed to retrieve the &quot;Progenitor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532/doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |publisher=BBC |title=BBC concept artwork for Dalek Progenator |last=McKinstry |first=Peter |access-date=23 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224205734/http://static.bbc.co.uk/images/ic/qe/crop/946x532//doctorwho/episodes/d11/s01/e03/art/d11s01e03_dalek_art_14.jpg |archive-date=24 February 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a tiny apparatus which contains 'original' Dalek DNA. The activation of the Progenitor results in the creation of a &quot;new paradigm&quot; of Daleks. The [[The New Daleks|New Paradigm Daleks]] deem their creators inferior and exterminate them; their creators make no resistance to this, deeming themselves inferior as well. They are organised into different roles (drone, scientist, strategists, supreme and eternal), which are identifiable with colour-coded armour instead of the identification plates under the eyestalk used by their predecessors. They escape the Doctor at the end of the episode via time travel with the intent to rebuild their Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=3 March 2010 |title=The Eleventh Doctor is coming! |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=418 |page=5 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent|Royal Tunbridge Wells]], Kent |issn=0957-9818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Daleks appeared only briefly in subsequent finales &quot;[[The Pandorica Opens]]&quot;/&quot;[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]&quot; (2010) and [[The Wedding of River Song]] (2011) as Steven Moffat decided to &quot;give them a rest&quot; and stated &quot;There's a problem with the Daleks. They are the most famous of the Doctor's adversaries and the most frequent, which means they are the most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13594932 | work=BBC News | title=Doctor Who writer Steven Moffat to 'rest' Daleks | date=30 May 2011 | access-date=21 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181122053000/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13594932 | archive-date=22 November 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; They next appear in &quot;[[Asylum of the Daleks]]&quot; (2012), where the Daleks are shown to have greatly increased numbers and have a Parliament; in addition to the traditional &quot;modern&quot; Daleks, several designs from both the original and new series appear. All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness at the end of the episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special &quot;[[The Day of the Doctor]]&quot;, where they are seen being defeated in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]]. In &quot;[[The Time of the Doctor]]&quot;, the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.

The [[Twelfth Doctor]]'s first encounter with the Daleks is in his second full episode, &quot;[[Into the Dalek]]&quot; (2014), where he encounters a damaged Dalek, which he names 'Rusty', aboard a human resistance ship. Left with the Doctor's love of the universe and his hatred of the Daleks, he spares its life; it assumes a mission to destroy other Daleks. In &quot;[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]&quot;/&quot;[[The Witch's Familiar]]&quot; (2015), the Doctor is summoned to Skaro where he learns Davros is alive, but dying, and has rebuilt the Dalek Empire. He escapes Davros' clutches by enlivening the decrepit Daleks of Skaro's sewers, who tear the empire apart, leaving behind the Master ([[Michelle Gomez]]), who accompanied him to Skaro. In &quot;[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]&quot; (2017), the Doctor briefly visits a battle in the Dalek-Movellan war while trying to escape a time travelling enemy.

The [[Thirteenth Doctor]] encountered a Dalek in a New Year's Day episode, &quot;[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]&quot; (2019). A Dalek mutant, separated from its armoured casing, takes control of a human in order to rebuild itself and summon more Daleks to conquer [[Earth]].

==Dalek culture==
Daleks have little, if any, individual personality,&lt;ref name=Doomsday/&gt; ostensibly no emotions other than hatred and anger,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt; and a strict command structure in which they are conditioned to obey superiors' orders without question.&lt;ref name=Evil&gt;''[[The Evil of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]], Director Derek Martinus, Producer [[Innes Lloyd]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 20 May–1 July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Dalek speech is characterised by repeated phrases, and by orders given to themselves and to others.&lt;ref&gt;Peel (1988), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the stereotypical emotionless robots often found in science fiction, Daleks are often angry; author [[Kim Newman]] has described the Daleks as behaving &quot;like toddlers in perpetual hissy fits&quot;, gloating when in power and flying into a rage when thwarted.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be excitable and will repeat the same word or phrase over and over again in heightened emotional states, most famously &quot;Exterminate! Exterminate!&quot;

Daleks are extremely aggressive, and seem driven by an instinct to attack. This instinct is so strong that Daleks have been depicted fighting the urge to kill&lt;ref name=Evolution/&gt;&lt;ref name=Resurrection/&gt; or even attacking when unarmed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Death&gt;''[[Death to the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Terry Nation]], Director [[Michael E. Briant]], Producer [[Barry Letts]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 23 February–16 March 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifth Doctor]] characterises this impulse by saying, &quot;However you respond [to Daleks] is seen as an act of provocation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Resurrection/&gt; The fundamental feature of Dalek culture and psychology is an unquestioned belief in the superiority of the Dalek race,&lt;ref name=Evil/&gt; and their default directive is to destroy all non-Dalek life-forms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt; Other species are either to be exterminated immediately or enslaved and then exterminated once they are no longer useful.&lt;ref name=Resurrection&gt;''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Eric Saward]], Director [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 8–15 February 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalek obsession with their own superiority is illustrated by the schism between the Renegade and Imperial Daleks seen in ''Revelation of the Daleks'' and ''Remembrance of the Daleks'': the two factions each consider the other to be a perversion despite the relatively minor differences between them.&lt;ref name=Remembrance&gt;''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Ben Aaronovitch]], Director Andrew Morgan, Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 5–26 October 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; This intolerance of any &quot;contamination&quot; within themselves is also shown in &quot;Dalek&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt; ''The Evil of the Daleks''&lt;ref name=Evil/&gt; and in the [[Big Finish Productions]] [[radio drama|audio play]] ''[[The Mutant Phase]]''.&lt;ref name=Mutant&gt;''[[The Mutant Phase]]''. Writer and Director [[Nicholas Briggs]]. Producers [[Gary Russell]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]]. [[Big Finish Productions]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This superiority complex is the basis of the Daleks' ruthlessness and lack of compassion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evil/&gt; This is shown in extreme in &quot;[[Victory of the Daleks]]&quot;, where the new, pure Daleks destroy their creators, impure Daleks, with the latters' consent. It is nearly impossible to negotiate or reason with a Dalek, a single-mindedness that makes them dangerous and not to be underestimated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalek (episode)&quot;/&gt; The [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) is later puzzled in the &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot; as to why the Daleks don't just kill the sequestered ones that have &quot;gone wrong&quot;. Although the Asylum is subsequently obliterated, the Prime Minister of the Daleks explains that &quot;it is offensive to us to destroy such divine hatred&quot;, and the Doctor is sickened at the revelation that hatred is actually considered beautiful by the Daleks.

Dalek society is depicted as one of extreme scientific and technological advancement; the Third Doctor states that &quot;it was their inventive genius that made them one of the greatest powers in the universe.&quot;&lt;ref name=Death/&gt; However, their reliance on logic and machinery is also a strategic weakness which they recognise,&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;&lt;ref name=Destiny/&gt; and thus use more emotion-driven species as agents to compensate for these shortcomings.&lt;ref name=Remembrance/&gt;&lt;ref name=Resurrection/&gt;&lt;ref name=Evil/&gt;

Although the Daleks are not known for their regard for [[due process]], they have taken at least two enemies back to Skaro for a &quot;trial&quot;, rather than killing them immediately. The first was their creator, Davros, in ''Revelation of the Daleks'',&lt;ref name=Revelation&gt;''[[Revelation of the Daleks]].'' Writer [[Eric Saward]], Director [[Graeme Harper]], Producer [[John Nathan-Turner]]. ''Doctor Who''. BBC1, London. 23–30 March 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second was the renegade [[Time Lord]] known as [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] in the 1996 television movie.&lt;ref name=TVM&gt;''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]''. Writer [[Matthew Jacobs]], Director [[Geoffrey Sax]], Executive Producer [[Philip Segal]]. 1996. DVD. [[BBC Video]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the Master's trial, and why the Doctor would be asked to retrieve the Master's remains, have never been explained on screen. The ''Doctor Who Annual 2006'' implies that the trial may have been due to a treaty signed between the Time Lords and the Daleks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell T Davies|Davies, Russell T.]] &quot;Meet the Doctor.&quot; ''Doctor Who Annual 2006''. Ed. [[Clayton Hickman]]. [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]]: [[Panini Comics|Panini]], 2005. pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The framing device for the ''[[I, Davros: Innocence|I, Davros]]'' audio plays is a Dalek trial to determine if Davros should be the Daleks' leader once more.&lt;ref&gt;''[[I, Davros: Innocence]]''. Writer Gary Hopkins, Director [[Gary Russell]]. Producers [[Gary Russell]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]]. [[Big Finish Productions]], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin-off novels contain several [[tongue-in-cheek]] mentions of Dalek poetry, and an anecdote about an opera based upon it, which was lost to posterity when the entire cast was exterminated on the opening night. Two stanzas are given in the novel ''[[The Also People]]'' by Ben Aaronovitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaronovitch |first=Ben |authorlink=Ben Aaronovitch| year=1995 |title=[[The Also People]]| location=London |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=0-426-20456-5| page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative timeline]] portrayed in the [[Big Finish Productions]] audio adventure ''[[The Time of the Daleks]]'', the Daleks show a fondness for the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Time of the Daleks]]''. Writer [[Justin Richards]], Director [[Nicholas Briggs]], Producers [[Gary Russell]] and [[Jason Haigh-Ellery]]. [[Big Finish Productions]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar idea was satirised by comedian [[Frankie Boyle]] in the BBC comedy quiz programme ''[[Mock the Week]]''; he gave the fictional Dalek poem &quot;Daffodils; EXTERMINATE DAFFODILS!&quot; as an &quot;unlikely line to hear in ''Doctor Who''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mock the Week]]''. 7 July 2007. Season 5, episode 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Doctor has defeated the Daleks so often, he has become their collective [[Archenemy|arch-enemy]] and they have standing orders to capture or exterminate him on sight. In later fiction, the Daleks know the Doctor as ''&quot;Ka Faraq Gatri&quot;'' (&quot;Bringer of Darkness&quot; or &quot;Destroyer of Worlds&quot;), and &quot;The Oncoming Storm&quot;.&lt;ref name=Parting/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Journey&quot;/&gt; Both the [[Ninth Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) and [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) suggest that the Doctor is one of the few beings the Daleks fear. In &quot;[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]&quot;, Rose notes that while the Daleks see the extermination of five million [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as &quot;pest control&quot;, &quot;one Doctor&quot; visibly un-nerves them (to the point they physically recoil).&lt;ref name=&quot;Doomsday&quot;/&gt; To his indignant surprise, in &quot;Asylum of the Daleks&quot;, the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) learns that the Daleks have designated him as &quot;The Predator&quot;.

As the Doctor escapes the Asylum (with companions Amy and Rory), a Dalek-converted-human (Oswin Oswald) prisoner provides critical assistance, which culminates in completely deleting the Doctor from the Dalek hive-consciousness (the PathWeb), thus wiping the slate entirely blank. However, this was reversed in &quot;[[The Time of the Doctor]]&quot;, when the Daleks regained knowledge of the Doctor through the memory of an old acquaintance of the Doctor, Tasha Lem.

=== Measurements ===
A ''rel'' is a Dalek and Kaled unit of measurement. It was usually a measurement of [[time]], with a duration of slightly more than one second, as mentioned in &quot;[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]&quot;, &quot;[[Evolution of the Daleks]]&quot; and &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, counting down to the ignition of the reality bomb. (One earth minute most likely equals about 50 ''rels''.) However, in some comic books it was also used as a unit of [[velocity]]. Finally, in some cases it was used as a unit of hydroelectric energy (not to be confused with a vep, the unit used to measure artificial sunlight).

The ''rel'' was first used in the non-canonical feature film ''[[Daleks – Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.]]'', soon after appearing in early Doctor Who comic books.

[[File:Dalek Chronicles 4.jpg|thumb|alt=A comics page with eleven panels. The first panel contains the title &quot;The Daleks&quot; in jagged white letters. Subsequent panels show Dalek cylinders (slightly narrower than those depicted in previous images) and blue-skinned humanoids with bulbous heads. The last panel shows a gold-coloured Dalek-like shape with a large spherical top.|A page from the TV 21 comic strip, featuring the creation of the Emperor Dalek]]
Two ''Doctor Who'' movies starring [[Peter Cushing]] featured the Daleks as the main villains: ''[[Dr. Who and the Daleks]]'', and ''[[Daleks - Invasion Earth 2150 AD]]'', based on the television serials ''The Daleks'' and ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'', respectively. The movies were not direct remakes; for example, the Doctor in the Cushing films was a human inventor called &quot;Dr. Who&quot; who built a time-travelling device named ''Tardis'', instead of a mysterious alien who stole a device called &quot;the TARDIS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peel (1988), p. 96; Howe (1992), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Four books focusing on the Daleks were published in the 1960s. ''[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#The Dalek Book|The Dalek Book]]'' (1964, written by Terry Nation and [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]]), ''The Dalek World'' (1965, written by Nation and Whitaker) and ''The Dalek Outer Space Book'' (1966, by Nation and Brad Ashton) were all hardcover books formatted like [[annual publication#British annuals|annuals]], containing text stories and comics about the Daleks, along with fictional information (sometimes based on the television serials, other times made up for the books).&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Nation also published ''The Dalek Pocketbook and Space-Travellers Guide'', which collected articles and features treating the Daleks as if they were real.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (2003), pp.126–127&lt;/ref&gt; Four more annuals were published in the 1970s by World Distributors under the title ''Terry Nation's Dalek Annual'' (with cover dates 1976–1979, but published 1975–1978).&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;  Two original novels by [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]], ''[[War of the Daleks]]'' (1997) and ''[[Legacy of the Daleks]]'' (1998), were released as part of the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series of ''Doctor Who'' novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[War of the Daleks]] |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |year=1997 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-40573-2}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Legacy of the Daleks]] |last=Peel |first=John |authorlink=John Peel (writer) |year=1998 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-40574-0}}&lt;br/&gt;Howe (2003), pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;  A novella, ''[[The Dalek Factor]]'' by [[Simon Clark (novelist)|Simon Clark]], was published in 2004, and two books featuring the Daleks and the [[Tenth Doctor]] (''[[I am a Dalek]]'' by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], 2006, and ''[[Prisoner of the Daleks]]'' by [[Trevor Baxendale]], 2009) have been released as part of the [[New Series Adventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Dalek Factor]] |last=Clark |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Clark (novelist) |year=2004 |publisher=[[Telos Publishing]] |location=[[Tolworth]], Surrey |isbn=1-903889-30-8}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |title=[[I am a Dalek]] |last=Roberts |first=Gareth |authorlink=Gareth Roberts (writer) |year=2006 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=1-84607-641-2}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Prisoner of the Daleks]] |last=Baxendale |first=Trevor |authorlink=Trevor Baxendale |year=2009 |publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=0-563-48648-1}}&lt;br/&gt;Howe (2006), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Nation authorised the publication of the comic strip ''[[Dalek comic strips, illustrated annuals and graphic novels#TV Century 21|The Daleks]]'' in the comic ''[[TV Century 21]]'' in 1965. The weekly one-page strip, written by Whitaker but credited to Nation, featured the Daleks as protagonists and &quot;heroes&quot;, and continued for two years, from their creation of the mechanised Daleks by the humanoid Dalek scientist, Yarvelling, to their eventual discovery in the ruins of a crashed space-liner of the co-ordinates for [[Earth]], which they proposed to invade. Although much of the material in these strips directly contradicted what was shown on television, some concepts like the Daleks using humanoid duplicates and the design of the [[Dalek variants|Dalek Emperor]] did show up later on in the programme.&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1992), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, a ''Doctor Who'' strip was also being published in ''[[TV Comic]]''. Initially, the strip did not have the rights to use the Daleks, so the [[First Doctor]] battled the &quot;Trods&quot; instead, cone-shaped robotic creatures that ran on static electricity. By the time the [[Second Doctor]] appeared in the strip in 1967 the rights issues had been resolved, and the Daleks began making appearances starting in ''The Trodos Ambush'' (TVC #788-#791), where they massacred the Trods. The Daleks also made appearances in the [[Third Doctor]]-era ''Dr. Who'' comic strip that featured in the combined ''[[Countdown (comic)|Countdown]]/[[TV Action (comic)|TV Action]]'' comic during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |title=Countdown / TV Action Strips and Stories featuring the Third Doctor |accessdate=20 March 2010 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |publisher=Doctor Who Reference Guide |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101172230/http://drwhoguide.com/tvaction3.htm |archive-date=1 January 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the television special ''[[Red Dwarf#Red Dwarf Night|The Red Dwarf A–Z]]'', two Daleks are shown (under &quot;E&quot; for &quot;Exterminate&quot;) arguing that all Earth television is human propaganda, and the works more commonly attributed to [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] were actually written by Daleks, although they deny having written &quot;[[Mandy (Barry Manilow song)|Mandy]]&quot; by [[Barry Manilow]]; subsequently, one of them remarks that the &quot;change the bulb&quot; joke from the episode &quot;[[Legion (Red Dwarf episode)|Legion]]&quot; was funny, and is promptly exterminated by the other for the crime of &quot;not behaving like a true Dalek&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Daleks have appeared on magazine covers promoting ''Doctor Who'' since the &quot;Dalekmania&quot; fad of the 1960s. ''[[Radio Times]]'' has featured the Daleks on its cover several times, beginning with the 21–27 November 1964 issue which promoted ''The Dalek Invasion of Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/galleries/doctorwhocovers/02/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20081203002552/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/features/galleries/doctorwhocovers/02/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 December 2008 |title=Doctor Who covers: The Dalek Invasion of Earth |accessdate=24 March 2010 |work=Radio Times |publisher=BBC Magazines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other magazines also used Daleks to attract readers' attention, including ''Girl Illustrated''.&lt;ref name=porn&gt;Howe (1996), pp. 60–61, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensed ''Doctor Who'' games featuring Daleks include 1984's ''[[The Key to Time]]'', a text adventure game for the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Price |first=Richard |date=December 1984 |title=Have Tardis will travel |journal=[[Sinclair User]] |issue=33 |page=38 |publisher=[[EMAP]] |location=London |issn=0262-5458 |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser/Issue033/Pages/SinclairUser03300038.jpg |accessdate=14 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903221910/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser%2FIssue033%2FPages%2FSinclairUser03300038.jpg |archive-date=3 September 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daleks also appeared in minor roles or as thinly disguised versions in other, minor games throughout the 80s, but did not feature as central adversaries in a licensed game until 1992, when Admiral Software published ''[[Dalek Attack]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bingegamer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bingegamer.net/2009/greatest-games-youve-never-played-dalek-attack/ |title=Greatest Games You've Never Played: Dalek Attack |last=Walker |first=James |date=8 July 2009 |work=Binge Gamer |accessdate=16 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126001019/http://www.bingegamer.net/2009/greatest-games-youve-never-played-dalek-attack/ |archivedate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game allowed the player to play various Doctors or companions, running them through several environments to defeat the Daleks.&lt;ref name=&quot;bingegamer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/dalek-attack |title=Dalek Attack |last1=Stryker |first1=B.L. |last2=Smith |first2=Martin |work=[[MobyGames]] |accessdate=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407031157/http://www.mobygames.com/game/dalek-attack |archive-date=7 April 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/1017/Dalek+Attack.html |title=Dalek Attack |author=Sebatianos |work=[[Abandonia]] |accessdate=16 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529011028/http://www.abandonia.com/en/games/1017/Dalek+Attack.html |archive-date=29 May 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan |last=Nash |date=July 1993 |title=Doctor Who: Dalek Attack |journal=[[Your Sinclair]] |issue=91 |pages=8–9 |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |location=[[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=YourSinclair/Issue91/Pages/YourSinclair9100008.jpg |accessdate=14 January 2010 |issn=0269-6983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the BBC released a [[Personal computer|PC]] game entitled ''[[Destiny of the Doctors]]'' which also featured the Daleks, among other adversaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gillatt |first=Gary |date=22 October 1997 |title=The game's up! |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=257 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unauthorized games featuring Daleks continued to appear through the 1990s and 2000s, including Dalek-based [[mod (computer gaming)|modifications]] of ''[[Dark Forces]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', and ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', and even more recently, a mod of ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''; many of these can be found online, including an [[Adobe Flash]] game, ''Dalek:Dissolution Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ludodoesjudo.com/dalek.html |title=Dalek: Dissolution Earth |accessdate=24 March 2010 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103085852/http://ludodoesjudo.com/dalek.html |archivedate=3 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 ''QWho'', a [[mod (computer gaming)|modification]] for ''Quake'', featured the Daleks as adversaries. This also formed the basis of ''TimeQuake'', a total conversion written in 2000 which included other ''Doctor Who'' monsters such as [[Sontaran]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otranto.demon.co.uk/timequake/ |title=Doctor Who – Timequake |accessdate=24 March 2010 |last=Williams |first=Giles |author2=Christian Darkin |author3=Conrad Feinson |date=11 August 2000 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103063647/http://www.otranto.demon.co.uk/timequake/ |archivedate=3 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another unauthorised game is ''DalekTron'', a based on ''[[Robotron: 2084]]'' written to coincide with the 2005 series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dalektron.org/ |title=DalekTron |accessdate=24 March 2010 |last=Bower |first=Andy |author2=James Bower |date=20 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420064717/http://www.dalektron.org/ |archive-date=20 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One authorised online game is ''The Last Dalek'', a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game created by New Media Collective for the BBC. It is based on the 2005 episode &quot;Dalek&quot; and can be played at the official BBC ''Doctor Who'' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/lastdalek/index.shtml |title=The Last Dalek |accessdate=24 March 2010 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=BBC Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823095245/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/lastdalek/index.shtml |archivedate=23 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Doctor Who'' website also features another game, ''Daleks vs Cybermen'' (also known as ''Cyber Troop Control Interface''), based on the 2006 episode &quot;Doomsday&quot;; in this game, the player controls troops of Cybermen which must fight Daleks as well as [[Torchwood Institute]] members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/game13/index.shtml |title=Cyber Troop Control Interface |accessdate=24 March 2010 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=BBC Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC News |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926023759/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/game13/index.shtml |archivedate=26 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2010, the BBC released the first of four official computer games on its website, ''Doctor Who: The Adventure Games'', which are intended as part of the official TV series adventures. In the first of these, 'The City of the Daleks', the Doctor in his 11th incarnation and Amy Pond must stop the Daleks re-writing time and reviving Skaro, their homeland.

They also appear in the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Wii]] games ''[[Doctor Who: Evacuation Earth]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who: Return to Earth]]''.

Several Daleks appear in the [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] game ''[[Doctor Who: The Mazes of Time|The Mazes of Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;Release of Mazes of Time http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/doctor-who-mazes-of-time-out-now-12916.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218160706/http://doctorwhotv.co.uk/doctor-who-mazes-of-time-out-now-12916.htm |date=18 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as rare enemies the player faces, appearing only in the first and final levels.

The robot model ''883'' in the game ''[[Paradroid]]'' for the ''[[Commodore 64]]'' looks like a Dalek. The game was later ported to other platforms, and several [[free software]] clones have been developed since, among them ''Freedroid Classic''. Based on this game is a ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'' style role-playing game called ''Freedroid RPG'' where several Dalek-like robots appear. The base version is called ''Dalex'', its powerful, but slow weapon, the ''Exterminator'', is also available to the player.

The Daleks also appear in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'' where they ally themselves with Lord Vortech and possess the size-altering scale keystone. When Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle encounter them, they assume that they are allies of the Doctor and attack the trio. The main characters continue to fight the Daleks until they call the Doctor to save them. A Dalek saucer also appears in the level based on [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], in which the top of it serves as the stage for the boss battle against [[Sauron]] and includes Daleks among the various enemies summoned to attack the player. A Dalek is also among the elements summoned by the player to deal with the obstacles in the ''[[Portal 2]]'' story level.

The Daleks also appear in Doctor Who: The Edge of Time, a Virtual Reality Game for the [[PlayStation VR]], [[Oculus Rift]], [[Oculus Quest]], [[HTC Vive]], and Vive Cosmos, which is set to be released in September 2019.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who The Edge of Time https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=a-fully-interactive-doctor-who-vr-game-the-edge-of-time-is-arriving-in-september {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522224836/https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=a-fully-interactive-doctor-who-vr-game-the-edge-of-time-is-arriving-in-september |date=22 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
