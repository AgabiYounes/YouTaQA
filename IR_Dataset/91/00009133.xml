'''Dean Lawrence Kamen''' (born April 5, 1951) is an American engineer, inventor, and businessman. He is known for his invention of the [[Segway PT|Segway]], as well as founding the non-profit organization [[FIRST]] with [[Woodie Flowers]].

==Early life and family==
Kamen was born in [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], to a [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://jewishjournal.com/news/nation/63620/|title=Segway inventor Dean Kamen brings his high-tech vision to Israel |last= Kraft| first= Dina|newspaper=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|date=April 24, 2008|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
His father is [[Jack Kamen]], an illustrator for ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', ''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'' and other [[EC Comics]] publications.

He attended [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]], but dropped out before graduating, after five years of private advanced research for the [[insulin pump]] AutoSyringe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/result.html?p=1&amp;edit_alert=&amp;srch=xprtsrch&amp;query_txt=IN%2F%22kamen+dean%22&amp;uspat=on&amp;usapp=on&amp;date_range=all&amp;stemming=on&amp;sort=chron&amp;search=Search| title=AutoSyringe|publisher=freepatentsonline.com|accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| website= mit.edu| url= http://web.mit.edu/invent/n-pressreleases/n-press-02LMP.html|title=$500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize Awarded To Dean Kamen |publisher= Massachusetts Institute of Technology School of Engineering|accessdate=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Inventions===
Kamen is best known for inventing the product that eventually became known as the [[Segway PT]], an electric, self-balancing human transporter with a computer-controlled [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] stabilization and control system. The device is balanced on two parallel wheels and is controlled by moving body weight. The machine's development was the object of much speculation and hype after segments of a book quoting [[Steve Jobs]] and other notable [[information technology|IT]] visionaries espousing its society-revolutionizing potential were leaked in December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heilemann |first1=John |title=Reinventing the Wheel |url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,186660,00.html |journal=Time |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |date=December 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamen was already a successful inventor: his company ''Auto Syringe'' manufactures and markets the first drug [[infusion pump]].&lt;ref name= CodeNG&gt;{{Cite book|title=Code Name Ginger: the story behind Segway and Dean Kamen's quest to invent a new world| first= Steve|last=Kemper|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|isbn=1-57851-673-0|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}}  His company DEKA also holds patents for the technology used in portable [[dialysis]] machines, an insulin pump (based on the drug infusion pump technology),&lt;ref name= CodeNG /&gt;{{rp|19}} and an all-terrain electric [[wheelchair]] known as the [[iBOT]], using many of the same gyroscopic balancing technologies that later made their way into the Segway.

[[File:Kamen still.JPG|thumb|right|Kamen Stirling Generator 10 coupled to Water Still 12 (from US patent 7,340,879)]]
Kamen has worked extensively on a project involving [[Stirling engine]] designs, attempting to create two machines: one that would generate power, and the [[Slingshot (water vapor distillation system)|Slingshot]] that would serve as a [[water purification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/03/colbert-and-kam|title=Colbert and Kamen Solve the World's Water Problems|last=Whitesides|first=Loretta Hidalgo|journal=[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]]|date=March 25, 2008| accessdate=August 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He hopes the project will help improve living standards in developing countries.&lt;ref name= &quot;wired&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/kamen_pr.html|title=Breakout Artist |first= Scott| last= Kirsner| journal= [[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]]|date=January 9, 2000|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/22/dean-kamen-interview|title=Segway inventor on future technology |first= Mark|last=Harris|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 22, 2009|accessdate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamen has a [[patent]] on his water purifier,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|7340879}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other patents pending.  In 2014, the film ''SlingShot'' was released, detailing Kamen's quest to use his vapor compression distiller to fix the world's water crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title= About{{!}}SlingShot|url= http://www.slingshotdoc.com/about-slingshot-dean-kamen/|website= slingshotdoc.com |accessdate= January 4, 2016|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101455/http://www.slingshotdoc.com/about-slingshot-dean-kamen/| archive-date= March 4, 2016|url-status= dead|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamen is also the co-inventor of a [[pneumatics|compressed air]] device that would launch a human into the air in order to quickly launch [[SWAT]] teams or other emergency workers to the roofs of tall, inaccessible buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/16/man_slinger|title=DARPA plots emergency man-cannon|first=Chris|last=Williams| work=[[The Register]]| date= May 16, 2006| accessdate=August 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USPTO Application|docnum=20060086349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Kamen stated that his company [[DEKA (company)|DEKA]] was now working on [[solar power]]ed inventions.&lt;ref name= &quot;guardian&quot;/&gt;

Kamen and DEKA also developed the DEKA Arm System or &quot;[[Luke Arm|Luke]]&quot;, a [[prosthetic]] arm replacement that offers its user much more fine motor control than traditional prosthetic limbs. It was approved for use by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in May 2014, and DEKA is looking for partners to mass-produce the prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Lawler| first= Richard|title=FDA approves a life-like prosthetic arm from the man who invented the Segway |url= https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/09/luke-bionic-arm-approved-by-fda| website= [[Engadget]]| date=September 5, 2014 |accessdate= August 25, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===FIRST===
In 1989, Kamen founded [[FIRST]] (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a program for students to get people interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]). One competition started and run by FIRST is the FRC or FIRST Robotics Competition. In 2017, the organization chose to host two international competitions, one in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], and another in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], each a week apart. From 2018 to 2020, it will be held in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], instead of [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]].

FIRST has many robotics programs for students in grades K-12, including FLL JR. ([[FIRST Lego League Jr.]]) for younger elementary school students, FLL ([[FIRST Lego League]]) for older elementary school and middle school students, FTC ([[FIRST Tech Challenge]]) for middle and high school students, and FRC ([[FIRST Robotics Competition]]) for high school students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfirst.org/ FIRST Official Website] – accessed December 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, FIRST held the inaugural event of its first olympics-style competition – FGC (FIRST Global Challenge) – in Washington, D.C.  

Kamen says that FIRST is the invention he is most proud of, and predicts that the 1 million students who have taken part in the contests so far will be responsible for some significant technological advances in years to come.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/16295592?story_id=16295592|title=Brain scan: Mr Segway's difficult path| first= Mark|last=Harris|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
During his career Kamen has won numerous awards. He was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 1997 for his biomedical devices and for making engineering more popular among high school students. In 1999 he was awarded the 5th Annual [[Heinz Award]] in Technology, the Economy and Employment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/dean-kamen| publisher= The Heinz Awards| title= Dean Kamen | website= heinzawards.net| date= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2000 received the National Medal of Technology from then [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] for inventions that have advanced medical care worldwide. In April 2002, Kamen was awarded the [[Lemelson-MIT Prize]] for inventors, for his invention of the Segway and of an infusion pump for diabetics. In 2003 his &quot;Project Slingshot&quot;, an inexpensive portable [[water purification]] system, was named a runner-up for &quot;coolest invention of 2003&quot; by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.gartner.com/research/fellows/asset_55323_1176.jsp|title=The Gartner Fellows: Dean Kamen Interview| website= Gartner.com| date=October 30, 2003|accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]] for his invention of the AutoSyringe. In 2006 Kamen was awarded the &quot;Global Humanitarian Action Award&quot; by the [[United Nations]]. In 2007 he received the [[ASME Medal]], the highest award from the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/asme-medal|title=ASME Medal|publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]]|accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008 he was the recipient of the [[IRI Achievement Award]] from the [[Industrial Research Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://204.178.115.136/iri/Public_Site/Navigation/About_IRI/newsroom/Dean_Kamen_Honored_with_IRI_2008_Achievement_Award.aspx | title= Dean Kamen Honored with IRI 2008 Achievement Award| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130925131156/http://204.178.115.136/iri/Public_Site/Navigation/About_IRI/newsroom/Dean_Kamen_Honored_with_IRI_2008_Achievement_Award.aspx |archivedate=September 25, 2013 | publisher= Industrial Research Institute| access-date= February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 Kamen was awarded the [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in Mechanical Engineering of the [[Franklin Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.fi.edu/franklinawards/11/bf_mechanical.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120801101740/http://www.fi.edu/franklinawards/11/bf_mechanical.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 1, 2012 |title=Benjamin Franklin Medal in Mechanical Engineering |year=2011 |publisher=[[Franklin Institute]] |accessdate= December 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Will I Am FIRST.TIF|thumb|[[Will.i.am]] speaking at the 2011 [[For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology|FIRST]] kickoff at [[Southern New Hampshire University]] with Kamen]]
In 2007, his residence was a [[hexagon]]al, [[shed style]] mansion he dubbed Westwind,&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;/&gt; located in [[Bedford, New Hampshire]], just outside [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]]. The house has at least four different levels and is very eclectically conceived, with such things as hallways resembling [[mine shaft]]s, 1960s novelty furniture, a collection of vintage wheelchairs, [[spiral staircase]]s and at least one [[secret passage]], an observation tower, a fully equipped machine shop, and a huge [[cast iron]] [[steam engine]] which once belonged to [[Henry Ford]] built into the multi-story center atrium of the house which Kamen is working to convert into a [[Stirling engine]]-powered [[kinetic sculpture]].{{Cn|date=August 2019}} Kamen owns and pilots an [[Embraer Phenom 300]] light jet aircraft&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=116DK|title=N-Number Inquiry Results |accessdate= September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three Enstrom helicopters, including a [[Enstrom 280|280FX]], a [[Enstrom 480|480]], and a 480B.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=36DK |title= N-Number Inquiry Results |accessdate= September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aircraftinquiry1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=46DK|title=N-Number Inquiry Results|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=56DK|title=N-Number Inquiry Results| accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regularly commutes to work via his helicopters and had a hangar built into his house.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iconoclasts (TV series)|Iconoclasts]]'', Season 2, Show #10. Isabella Rossellini and Dean Kamen, November 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he piloted a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit bomber]] at [[Whiteman Air Force Base|Whiteman AFB]], marking the opening of the [[FIRST Stronghold|2016 FRC World Championship]] in St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160426005009/en/founder-Dean-Kamen-flies-B-2-Spirit-Whiteman |title= FIRST founder, Dean Kamen, flies in B-2 Spirit At Whiteman AFB maintained by FIRST alumni |website= businesswire.com |access-date= May 3, 2016 |date= April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the main subject of ''Code Name Ginger: the Story Behind Segway and Dean Kamen's Quest to Invent a New World'', a nonfiction narrative book by journalist Steve Kemper published by Harvard Business School Press in 2003 (released in paperback as ''Reinventing the Wheel'').&lt;ref name= CodeNG /&gt;

His company, DEKA, annually creates intricate mechanical presents for him. The company has created a robotic chess player, which is a mechanical arm attached to a chess board, and a vintage-looking computer with antique wood, and a converted typewriter as a keyboard. In addition, DEKA has received funding from [[DARPA]] to work on a brain-controlled prosthetic limb called the [[Luke Arm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2008/06/new_luke_arm_video.html|title=New Luke Arm Video| work= Medgadget.com| accessdate=March 11, 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090112152448/http://www.medgadget.com/archives/2008/06/new_luke_arm_video.html |archive-date= January 12, 2009| url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
