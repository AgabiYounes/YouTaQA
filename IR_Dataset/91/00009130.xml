'''Devo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|v|oʊ}}, originally {{IPAc-en|d|iː|ˈ|v|oʊ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cluefree.org/devo/Jerry.shtml |title=Info From Jerry Casale |website=Clue Free |accessdate=February 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050206204821/http://cluefree.org/devo/Jerry.shtml |archivedate=February 6, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Akron, Ohio]] formed in 1973. Their classic lineup consisted of two sets of brothers, the Mothersbaughs ([[Mark Mothersbaugh|Mark]] and [[Bob Mothersbaugh|Bob]]) and the Casales ([[Gerald Casale|Gerald]] and [[Bob Casale|Bob]]), along with [[Alan Myers (drummer)|Alan Myers]]. The band had a No. 14 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' chart]] hit in 1980 with the single &quot;[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]&quot;, the song that gave the band mainstream popularity.

Devo is known for their music and [[Stage (theatre)|stage show]]s mingling [[kitsch]] science fiction themes, [[deadpan]] [[Surreal humour|surrealist humor]] and mordantly [[satire|satirical]] [[social commentary]]. Their early, pre Warner Bros. [[dissonant]] songs use synthetic instrumentation and [[time signature]]s proven influential on subsequent popular music, particularly [[New wave music|new wave]], [[industrial music|industrial]], and [[alternative rock]] artists. Devo (most enthusiastically [[Gerald Casale]]) was also a pioneer of the [[music video]], creating clips for the [[LaserDisc]] format, with &quot;Whip It&quot; getting heavy airplay in the early days of [[MTV]].

==History==
===1973–1978: Formation===
The name ''Devo'' comes from the concept of '[[Devolution (biology)|de-evolution]]'—the idea that instead of continuing to evolve, mankind has actually begun to regress, as evidenced by the dysfunction and [[herd mentality]] of American society.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clubdevo.com/mp/bio.html |title=Devo Bio |website=Clubdevo.com |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011183248/http://clubdevo.com/mp/bio.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, this idea was developed as a joke by [[Kent State University]] art students [[Gerald Casale]] and [[Bob Lewis (musician)|Bob Lewis]], who created a number of satirical art pieces in a devolution vein. At this time, Casale had also performed with the local band 15-60-75 ([[The Numbers Band]]). They met [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] around 1970, a talented keyboardist who had been playing with the band Flossy Bobbitt.&lt;ref name=thoughts /&gt; Mothersbaugh brought a more humorous feel to the band, introducing them to material like the pamphlet &quot;Jocko Homo Heavenbound&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fw_alden.tripod.com/id1.html |title=Jocko-Homo Heavenbound |website=F. W. Alden (1873–1955) |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes an illustration of a winged devil labelled &quot;D-EVOLUTION&quot; and would later inspire the song &quot;[[Jocko Homo]]&quot;. The &quot;joke&quot; about de-evolution became serious following the [[Kent State shootings]] of May 4, 1970. This event would be cited multiple times as the impetus for forming the band Devo.&lt;ref name=&quot;WaPo&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sommer|first1=Tim | title= How the Kent State massacre helped give birth to punk rock |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-the-kent-state-massacre-changed-music/2018/05/03/b45ca462-4cb6-11e8-b725-92c89fe3ca4c_story.html  |newspaper= Washington Post |accessdate=2018-05-03 |date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the band's career, they would often be considered a &quot;joke band&quot; by the music press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Christgau |first1=Robert |title=Devo Take a Stand |url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/devo-81.php |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |accessdate=23 May 2017 |date=1981 |via=robertchristgau.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kaufman |first1=Gil |title=Devo Reveal Truth About De-Evolution |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/508115/devo-reveal-truth-about-de-evolution/ |website=[[MTV]] |accessdate=23 May 2017 |date=21 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first form of Devo was the &quot;Sextet Devo&quot; which performed at the 1973 Kent State performing arts festival.&lt;ref name =thoughts&gt;{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=Robert |authorlink=Bob Lewis (musician) |title=Some thoughts on Devo: the first Postmodern Band |year=2006 |website=devo.devaluate.com |url=http://devo.devaluate.com/Devolution.doc |accessdate=January 21, 2011 |quote=Let me be plain about this: contrary to popular belief DEVO was not and is not a phenomenon of Akron, Ohio. It was rather a logical extension of a series of inexplicable forces that made Kent State University a mass culture nexus for a brief and shining moment. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207091108/http://devo.devaluate.com/Devolution.doc |archivedate=February 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://devobook.com/sextet.html |title=Sextet Devo |date=2003 |first=Jeff |last=Winner |website=Devobook.com |accessdate=February 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814135057/http://devobook.com/sextet.html |archivedate=August 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It included Casale, Lewis and Mothersbaugh, as well as Gerald's brother [[Bob Casale]] on guitar, and friends [[Rod Reisman]] and [[Fred Weber (singer)|Fred Weber]] on drums and vocals, respectively. This performance was filmed and a part was included on the home video ''[[The Complete Truth About De-Evolution]]''. This lineup performed only once. Devo returned to perform in the Student Governance Center (featured prominently in the film) at the 1974 Creative Arts Festival with a lineup including the Casale brothers, Bob Lewis, Mark Mothersbaugh, and [[Jim Mothersbaugh]] on drums.
[[File:Devo Jocko Homo Mongoloid.jpg|thumb|right|Front and back covers of Devo's first release, the [[Gramophone record|45rpm]] [[single (music)|single]] &quot;[[Mongoloid (song)|Mongoloid]]&quot; b/w &quot;[[Jocko Homo]]&quot; (1977), released on the band's [[Booji Boy Records]]]]
The band continued to perform, generally as a quartet, but with a fluid lineup including Mark's brothers [[Bob Mothersbaugh]] and Jim Mothersbaugh. Bob played electric guitar, and Jim provided percussion using a set of home-made [[electronic drum]]s. Their first two music videos, &quot;[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]&quot; and &quot;Jocko Homo&quot; featured on ''[[The Truth About De-Evolution]]'', were filmed in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], and [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio]], the hometown of most members. This lineup of Devo lasted until 1976 when Jim left the band. Bob Lewis would sometimes play guitar during this period. In concert, Devo would often perform in the guise of [[Characters in Devo music videos|theatrical characters]], such as [[Booji Boy]] and the Chinaman. Live concerts from this period were often confrontational, and would remain so until 1977. A recording of an early Devo performance from 1975 with the quartet lineup appears on ''[[DEVO Live: The Mongoloid Years]]'', ending with the promoters unplugging Devo's equipment.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

Following Jim Mothersbaugh's departure, Bob Mothersbaugh found a new drummer, [[Alan Myers (drummer)|Alan Myers]], who played on a conventional, acoustic [[drum kit]]. Casale re-recruited his brother Bob Casale, and the lineup of Devo remained the same for nearly ten years.

Devo gained some fame in 1976 when the short film ''[[The Truth About De-Evolution]]'' directed by Chuck Statler&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to Devo, &quot;Mongoloid&quot; b/w &quot;Jocko Homo&quot;. [[Booji Boy Records]], 1977, which say {{&quot;'}}Jocko Homo' – from the soundtrack of 'In the Beginning Was the End... (the truth about De-Evoluation)' ''a film by Chuck Statler''.&quot; (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; won a prize at the [[Ann Arbor Film Festival]]. This attracted the attention of [[David Bowie]], who began work to get the band a recording contract with [[Warner Music Group]]. In 1977, Devo were asked by [[Neil Young]] to participate in the making of his film ''[[Human Highway]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vermontreview.tripod.com/Interviews/devo.htm |title=Oh Yes, It's Devo: An Interview with Jerry Casale |last=Knight |first=Brian L. |date= |website=The Vermont Review |accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in 1982, the film featured the band as &quot;Nuclear garbagemen&quot;. The band members were asked to write their own parts and Mark Mothersbaugh scored and recorded much of the soundtrack, his first of many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zulaica |first=Don |url=http://www.livedaily.com/news/2987.html |title=liveDaily Interview: Mark Mothersbaugh on soundtracks, surf and Devo |date=April 25, 2001 |website=LiveDaily.com |accessdate=September 5, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201817/http://www.livedaily.com/news/2987.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1977, Devo released their first single &quot;[[Mongoloid (song)|Mongoloid]]&quot; b/w &quot;Jocko Homo&quot;, the B-side of which came from the soundtrack to ''The Truth About De-Evolution'', on their independent label Booji Boy. This was followed by a [[cover version|cover]] of [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''&quot;''[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction#Devo|(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]''&quot;.

In 1978, the ''[[B Stiff EP]]'' was released by British independent label [[Stiff Records|Stiff]], which included the single &quot;[[Be Stiff]]&quot; plus two previous Booji Boy releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/be-stiff-ep-mw0000939256 |title=Devo: Be Stiff |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Mechanical Man EP|Mechanical Man]]&quot;, a 4 track 7&quot; EP of demos, an apparent [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] but rumored to be put out by the band themselves, was also released that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://devo-obsesso.com/html/7in-pgs/main/mechman-blu.html |title=Mechanical Man |website=Devo-obsesso.com |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978–1980: Recording contract, ''Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!'', and ''Duty Now for the Future''===
[[File:Devo, Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 27, 1978 Agora Ballroom.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Live performance in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, 1978: [[Bob Casale]] and [[Gerald Casale]]]]
Recommendations from David Bowie and [[Iggy Pop]] enabled Devo to secure a recording contract with [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] in 1978. After Bowie backed out of the business deal due to previous commitments, their first album, ''[[Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!|Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!]]'' was produced by [[Brian Eno]] and featured re-recordings of their previous singles &quot;Mongoloid&quot; and &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/q-are-we-not-men-a-we-are-devo%21-mw0000195665 |title=Q: Are We Not Men A: We Are Devo! |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, 1978, Devo gained national exposure with an appearance on the late-night show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a week after the Rolling Stones, performing &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; and &quot;Jocko Homo&quot;.

After the band achieved this success, co-founder Bob Lewis asked for accreditation and compensation in 1978 for his contributions to the band. The band refused to negotiate, and sued Lewis in [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]],&lt;ref name=lewisinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://warmowski.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/devo-founder-bob-lewis-my-1997-interview/ |first=Rob |last=Warmowski |date=March 1, 2010 |title=Devo Co-Founder Bob Lewis: My 1997 Interview |website=RW370 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; seeking a declaratory judgment stating that Lewis had no rights to the name or theory of de-evolution. Lewis then filed an action in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio]], alleging theft of intellectual property. During discovery, Lewis produced articles, promotional materials, documentary evidence and an interview&lt;ref name=lewisinterview/&gt; recorded at the [[Akron Art Museum]] following the premiere of ''In the Beginning was the End'' in which Mothersbaugh and other band members credited Lewis with developing the theory of de-evolution. The band quickly settled for an undisclosed sum.

The band followed up with ''[[Duty Now for the Future]]'' in 1979, which moved the band more towards electronic instrumentation. While not as successful as their first album, it did produce some fan favorites with the songs &quot;Blockhead&quot; and &quot;The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize&quot; {{sic}}, as well as a cover of the [[Johnny Rivers]] hit &quot;[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]&quot;. &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot; had been recorded first in 1974 for Devo's first film and performed live as early as 1976. In 1979, Devo traveled to Japan for the first time, and a live show from this tour was partially recorded. Devo appeared on ''[[Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]]'' in 1979, performing &quot;Blockhead&quot;, &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;, &quot;Uncontrollable Urge&quot;, and &quot;Mongoloid&quot;. Also in 1979, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]]—in conjunction with the LA radio station [[KROQ-FM]]—released ''Devotees'', a tribute album. It contained a set of covers of Devo songs interspersed with renditions of popular songs in Devo's style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-KROQ-Devotees-Album/release/1570542 |title=KROQ Devotees Album: RNSP 301 |website=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devo actively embraced the parody religion [[Church of the SubGenius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westword.com/music/devos-gerald-casale-were-the-predators-that-nobody-can-stop-5113527 |title=Devo's Gerald Casale: &quot;We're the predators that nobody can stop&quot; |last=Murphy |first=Tom |date=July 26, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In concert, Devo sometimes performed as their own opening act, pretending to be a [[Christian rock|Christian soft rock]] band called &quot;Dove (the Band of Love)&quot;, which is an [[anagram]] of &quot;Devo&quot;. They appeared as Dove in the 1980 [[televangelism]] spoof film ''[[Pray TV (1980 film)|Pray TV]]''.

===1980–1982: Mainstream breakthrough, ''Freedom of Choice'', and ''New Traditionalists''===
Devo gained a new level of visibility with 1980's ''[[Freedom of Choice (album)|Freedom of Choice]]''. This album included their best-known hit, &quot;[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]&quot;, which quickly became a [[Top 40]] hit. The album moved to an almost completely electronic sound, with the exception of acoustic drums and Bob Mothersbaugh's guitar. The tour for ''Freedom of Choice'' was ambitious for the band, including dates in Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huboon.com/1980.html |first=Mike |last=Ziegler |title=Devo Live Guide 1980 |website=Huboon.com |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band used a minimalist set including large custom light boxes which could be laid on their back to form a second, smaller stage during the second half of the set. Other popular songs from ''Freedom of Choice'' were &quot;[[Girl U Want]]&quot;, the [[Freedom of Choice (song)|title-track]], and &quot;Gates of Steel&quot;. The band released popular music videos for &quot;Whip It&quot; and &quot;Girl U Want&quot;. Devo made two appearances on the TV show ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'' in 1980, as well as on ''Don Kirshner's Rock Concert'', ''[[American Bandstand]]'', and other shows. The band members often wore red, terraced [[Energy dome]] hats as part of its stage outfit. The dome was first worn during the band's ''Freedom of Choice'' campaign of 1980. It reappeared in the 1981, 1982, and 1988 tours, as well as in most of their performances since 1997. Devo also recorded two albums of their own songs as elevator music for their fan club, Club Devo, released on cassette in 1981 and 1984. These were later re-released on the album ''[[E-Z Listening Disc]]'' (1987), with all but two of the original Club Devo songs. These songs were often played as house music before Devo concerts.

In August 1981, the band's ''[[DEV-O Live]]'' EP spent [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s#1981 (Kent Music Report)|three weeks at the top of the Australian charts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australianmusichistory.com/australian-singles-chart-for-1981 |title=Australian Singles chart for 1981 |date=November 5, 2010 |first=Mark |last=Gibson |website=Australian Music History |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, they toured Australia and appeared on the TV show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''. Devo enjoyed continued popularity in Australia, where the nationally broadcast 1970s–1980s pop TV show ''Countdown'' was one of the first programs in the world to broadcast their video clips. They were given consistent radio support by Sydney-based non-commercial rock station [[Triple J|Double Jay]] (2JJ) and Brisbane-based independent community station Triple Zed ([[4ZZZ]]), two of the first rock stations outside America to play their recordings. The late-night music program ''Nightmoves'' aired ''The Truth About De-Evolution''.

In 1981, Devo contributed a cover of &quot;[[Working in the Coal Mine]]&quot;, recorded during the ''Freedom of Choice'' sessions, to the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''. They offered the song to be used in the film when Warner Bros. refused to include it on the album. Warner then included it as an independent bonus single accompanying their 1981 release, ''[[New Traditionalists]]''. For this album Devo wore self-described &quot;Utopian Boy Scout uniforms&quot; topped with a &quot;New Traditionalist Pomp&quot;—a plastic half-wig modeled on the hairstyle of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Among the singles from the album was &quot;[[Through Being Cool (Devo song)|Through Being Cool]]&quot;, written as a reaction to their new-found fame from &quot;Whip It&quot; and seen as a response to new fans who had misinterpreted the message behind the hit song. The album's accompanying tour featured the band performing an intensely physical show with treadmills and a large Greek temple set. That same year they served as [[Toni Basil]]'s backing band on [[Word of Mouth (Toni Basil album)|''Word of Mouth'']], her debut album, which included versions of three Devo songs, recorded with Basil singing lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top One Hit Wonders: Mickey&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Mickey – Toni Basil |url=http://toponehitwonders.com/pop/mickey-toni-basil/ |website=Top One Hit Wonders |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gruber: Mickey&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Gruber |first=Xaque |title='Mickey' Turns 30: A Closer Look at the One and Only Toni Basil |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/xaque-gruber/toni-basil-mickey-anniversary_b_2080971.html |website=The Huffington Post |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982–1987: ''Oh No! It's Devo'', ''Shout'', and Myers's departure===
''[[Oh, No! It's Devo]]'' followed in 1982. Produced by [[Roy Thomas Baker]], the album featured a more synth-pop-oriented sound than its predecessors. According to Gerald Casale, the album's sound was inspired by reviewers alternately describing them as both &quot;[[Fascism|fascists]]&quot; and &quot;[[clown]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.expressmilwaukee.com/article-11426-lsdevo-is-like-the-house-band-on-the-titanicrs.html |title=Devo Is Like the House Band on the Titanic |first=Alan |last=Sculley |date=June 30, 2010 |newspaper=[[Shepherd Express]] |accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's tour featured the band performing seven songs in front of a 12-foot high rear-projection screen with synchronized video, an image recreated using [[Chroma key|blue screen]] effects in the album's accompanying music videos. Devo also contributed two songs, &quot;[[Theme from Doctor Detroit]]&quot; and &quot;Luv-Luv&quot; to the 1983 [[Dan Aykroyd]] film ''[[Doctor Detroit]]'', and produced a music video for &quot;Theme from Doctor Detroit&quot; featuring clips from the film with live-action segments.

Devo released their sixth album, ''[[Shout (Devo album)|Shout]]'', in 1984 to poor reviews. The album has been criticized for its overuse of the [[Fairlight CMI]] digital [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampling]] synthesizer and weak songwriting. However, the band's cover of the [[Jimi Hendrix]] song &quot;[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]&quot; and the accompanying music video received some praise. Following the critical and commercial failure of ''Shout'', Warner Bros. dropped Devo. Shortly after, claiming to feel creatively unfulfilled, Alan Myers left the band,&lt;ref name=Myers /&gt; causing the remaining band members to abandon the plans for a ''Shout'' video LP, as well as a tour. In the interim, Mark Mothersbaugh began composing music for the TV show ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' and released an elaborately packaged solo [[Compact Cassette|cassette]], ''[[Muzik for Insomniaks, Volume 1 and Volume 2|Musik for Insomniaks]]'', which was later expanded and released as two [[Compact disc|CD]]s in 1988.

===1987–1991: ''Total Devo'', ''Smooth Noodle Maps'', and breakup===
In 1987, Devo re-formed with former [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] drummer David Kendrick to replace Myers. Their first project was a soundtrack for the flop horror film ''[[Slaughterhouse Rock]]'', starring [[Toni Basil]]. The band released the album ''[[Total Devo]]'' in 1988, on [[Enigma Records]]. This album included two songs used in the ''Slaughterhouse Rock'' soundtrack. The song &quot;Baby Doll&quot; was used that same year in the comedy film ''[[Tapeheads]]'', with newly recorded Swedish lyrics, and was credited to (and shown in a music video by) a fictitious Swedish band called Cube-Squared. Devo followed this up with a world tour, and released the live album ''[[Now It Can Be Told: DEVO at the Palace]]''. However, ''Total Devo'' was not a commercial success and received poor critical reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/total-devo-19880811 |title=Total Devo |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Azerrad |first=Michael |date=August 11, 1988 |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, members of Devo were involved in the project Visiting Kids, releasing a self-titled EP on the New Rose label in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_spawn_of_devo_the_visiting_kids |title=The Spawn of Devo: Visiting Kids |date=26 April 2012 |website=Dangerousminds.net |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band featured Mark's then-wife Nancye Ferguson, as well as David Kendrick, Bob Mothersbaugh, and Bob's daughter Alex Mothersbaugh. Their record was produced by Bob Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh, and Mark also co-wrote some of the songs. Visiting Kids appeared on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Rockula]]'', as well as on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. A promotional video was filmed for the song &quot;Trilobites&quot;.

In 1990, ''[[Smooth Noodle Maps]]'', Devo's last album for twenty years, was released. It too was a critical and commercial failure which, along with its two singles &quot;Stuck in a Loop&quot; and &quot;Post Post-Modern Man&quot;, hold the distinction of being Devo's worst-selling efforts; all failed to appear on the U.S. charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/smooth-noodle-maps-mw0000689854 |title=Devo: Smooth Noodle Maps |website=AllMusic |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devo launched a concert tour in support of the album, but poor ticket sales and the bankruptcy and dissolution of Enigma Records, who was responsible for organizing and financing the tour, caused it to be cancelled part way through. They had a falling out and played one final show in March 1991 before breaking up. In an interview with Mark Mothersbaugh from excerpts on their 1996 computer game ''[[Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol (album)|Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol]]'', &quot;Around '88, '89, '90 maybe, we did our last tour in Europe, and it was kind of at that point, We were watching ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' on the bus and said, 'Oh my God, that's our life.' And we just said, 'Things have to change.' So we kind of agreed from there that we wouldn't do live shows anymore.&quot; Around this time, members of Devo appeared in the film ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1990 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', except for Bob Mothersbaugh. Two albums of demo recordings from 1974–1977—''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume One]]'' (1990) and ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume Two]]'' (1991)—were released on [[Rykodisc]], as well as an album of early live recordings, ''[[DEVO Live: The Mongoloid Years]]''.

===1991–1996: Hiatus===
Following the split, Mark Mothersbaugh established [[Mutato Muzika]], a commercial music production studio, along with Bob Mothersbaugh and Bob Casale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/are-you-not-devo-you-are-mutato-2151061 |title=Are you not Devo? You are Mutato |first=Randall |last=Roberts |date=December 5, 2007 |newspaper=[[LA Weekly]] |access-date=August 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mothersbaugh meant to further a career as a [[composer]], and the latter worked as an [[audio engineer]]. Mothersbaugh has had considerable success writing and producing music for television programs, including ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' and  ''[[Rugrats]]'', video games, cartoons, and films, where he worked alongside director [[Wes Anderson]]. David Kendrick also worked at Mutato for a period during the early 1990s. Gerald Casale began a career as a director of music videos and commercials, working with bands including [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Silverchair]] and the [[Foo Fighters]]. In the wake of Devo's dissolution, Bob Mothersbaugh attempted to start a solo career with The Bob I Band, recording an album that was never released. The tapes for this are now lost, though a bootleg recording of the band in concert exists and can be obtained through the bootleg aggregator Booji Boy's Basement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boojiboysbasement.com/audiopages/S016.html |first=Alex |last=Brunelle |title=S016 – The Bob I Band: Live @ The China Club – Los Angeles, CA 1992 |website=Booji Boys Basement |accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While they did not release any studio albums during this period, Devo sporadically reconvened to record a number of songs for various films and compilations, including a cover of the [[Nine Inch Nails]] hit &quot;[[Head Like a Hole]]&quot; for the 1992 film ''[[Police Story 3: Super Cop]]'' and a new recording of &quot;[[Girl U Want]]&quot; on the soundtrack to the 1995 film ''[[Tank Girl (film)|Tank Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rosen |first=Craig |date=March 25, 1995 |title='Tank Girl' Set shoots From Hip |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=107 |issue=12 |pages=10, 44 |access-date=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–2007: Reunion===
In January 1996, Devo performed a reunion concert at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in [[Park City, Utah]]. The band performed on part of the 1996 [[Lollapalooza]] tour in the rotating Mystery Spot. On these tours and most subsequent tours, Devo performed a set-list mostly composed of material from between 1978 and 1982, ignoring their Enigma Records-era material. Also in 1996, Devo released a multimedia CD-ROM [[adventure game]], ''[[Adventures of the Smart Patrol]]'' with [[Inscape (publisher)|Inscape]]. The game was not a success, but the Lollapalooza tour was received well enough to allow Devo to return in 1997 as a headliner. Devo performed sporadically from 1997 onwards.

The ''[[Oh, No! It's Devo]]'' era outtakes &quot;Faster and Faster&quot; and &quot;One Dumb Thing&quot;, as well as the ''[[Shout (Devo album)|Shout]]'' era outtake &quot;Modern Life&quot;, were restored, completed and used in the video game ''[[Interstate '82]]'', developed by [[Activision]] and released in 1999. Also that year, Mothersbaugh started the Devo side-project The Wipeouters, featuring himself (keyboards, organ), Bob Mothersbaugh (guitar), Bob Casale (guitar), and Mutato Muzika composer [[Josh Mancell]] (drums). The Wipeouters performed the theme song to the [[Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[Rocket Power]]'', and in 2001 they released an album of [[surf rock]] material, titled ''P'Twaaang!!!''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wipeouters ABC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gdula |first1=Steve |title=Devo Enters Time Warp With Wipeouters – ABC News |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=107199&amp;page=1 |website=abcnews.go.com |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=21 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Devo recorded a new version of &quot;[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]&quot; to be used in [[Swiffer]] television commercials, a decision they have said they regretted. During an interview with the ''[[Dallas Observer]]'', Gerald Casale said, &quot;It's just aesthetically offensive. It's got everything a commercial that turns people off has.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dearmore |first=Kelly |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2006-08-17/music/jihad-jerry/ |title=Jihad Jerry |newspaper=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song &quot;[[Beautiful World (Devo song)|Beautiful World]]&quot; was also used in a re-recorded form for an ad for [[Target Corporation|Target]] stores. Due to rights issues with their back catalog, Devo has re-recorded songs for films and ads.

In 2005, Gerald Casale announced his &quot;solo&quot; project, [[Jihad Jerry &amp; the Evildoers]] (the Evildoers themselves including the other members of Devo), and released the first EP, ''[[Army Girls Gone Wild]]'' in 2006. A full-length album, ''[[Jihad Jerry &amp; the Evildoers#Mine Is Not a Holy War (2006)|Mine Is Not a Holy War]]'', was released on September 12, 2006, after a several-month delay. It featured mostly new material, plus re-recordings of four obscure Devo songs: &quot;I Need a Chick&quot; and &quot;I Been Refused&quot; (from ''[[Hardcore Devo: Volume Two]]''), &quot;Find Out&quot; (which appeared on the single and EP of &quot;[[Peek-a-Boo!]]&quot; in 1982), and &quot;Beehive&quot; (which was recorded by the band in 1974, at which point it was apparently abandoned with the exception of one appearance at a special show in 2001). Devo continued to tour actively in 2005 and 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.devo-obsesso.com/html/news_pgs/tour_05-1.html |title=Devo Live in 2005 |website=Devo-obsesso.com |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; unveiling a new stage show at appearances in October 2006, with the Jihad Jerry character performing &quot;Beautiful World&quot; as an encore.

Also in 2006, Devo worked on a project with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] known as [[Devo 2.0]]. A band of child performers was assembled and re-recorded Devo songs. A quote from the ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' stated, &quot;Devo recently finished a new project in cahoots with Disney called Devo 2.0, which features the band playing old songs and two new ones with vocals provided by children. Their debut album, a two disc CD/DVD combo entitled ''DEV2.0'', was released on March 14, 2006. The lyrics of some of the songs were changed for [[family-friendly]] airplay, which has been claimed by the band to be a play on irony of the messages of their classic hits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Abram |first=Malcolm X |url=http://www.ohio.com/mld/beaconjournal/living/12412576.htm |title=Still DEVOlutionary |newspaper=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |date=August 18, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026163419/http://www.ohio.com/mld/beaconjournal/living/12412576.htm |archivedate=October 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Devo.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Mark Mothersbaugh]] performing live with Devo at the [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim]], 2007]]
In an April 2007 interview, Gerald Casale mentioned a tentative project for a [[biographical film]] about Devo's early days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getreadytorock.com/rock_stars/devo.htm |title=Interview: David Casale |website=Get Ready to Rock.com |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Casale, a script was supposedly in development, called ''The Beginning Was the End''. Devo played their first European tour since 1990 in the summer of 2007, including a performance at [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim]].

===2007–present: ''Something for Everybody'' and current activities===
In December 2007, Devo released their first new single since 1990, &quot;[[Watch Us Work It]]&quot;, which was featured in a commercial for [[Dell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modulatethis.com/2007/08/synth-pioneers--1.html |title=Synth Pioneers DEVO New Song &quot;Watch Us Work It&quot; in Dell Commercial |date=August 4, 2007 |website=ModulateThis.com |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song features a sample drum track from the ''New Traditionalists'' song &quot;The Super Thing&quot;. Casale said that the song was chosen from a batch that the band was working on, and that it was the closest the band had been to a new album.

When Devo performed at [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] in March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/devo-sxsw |title=Devo at SXSW |date=January 17, 2009 |website=Gratefulweb.com |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the band presented a new stage show with synchronized video backdrops (similar to the 1982 tour), new costumes, and three new songs: &quot;Don't Shoot, I'm a Man!&quot;, &quot;What We Do&quot;, and &quot;Fresh&quot;. The album, ''[[Something for Everybody (Devo album)|Something for Everybody]]'' was eventually released in June 2010, preceded by a 12&quot; single of &quot;Fresh&quot;/&quot;What We Do&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s82.photobucket.com/albums/j278/ChadGrisly/?action=view&amp;current=SOMETHIN.jpg |title=SOMETHIN.jpg |author=ChadGrisly |website=Photobucket.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2009, Warner Bros. and Devo announced a re-release of ''Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!'' and ''Freedom of Choice'', with a tour performing both albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-devo/devo-inks-new-record-deal-suits-up-for-tour-idUSTRE58G0U120090917 |title=Devo inks new record deal, suits up for tour |date=September 17, 2009 |first=Gary |last=Graff |website=Reuters |accessdate=August 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devo was awarded the first [[Robert Moog|Moog]] Innovator Award on October 29, 2010, during [[Moogfest]] 2010 in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]. The Moog Innovator Award has been said to celebrate &quot;pioneering artists whose genre-defying work exemplifies the bold, innovative spirit of Bob Moog&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moogfest.com/2010/news/moogfest-2010-announces-devo-as-recipient-of-moog-innovation-award |title=MoogFest 2010 Announces Devo as Recipient of Moog Innovation Award |website=Moogfest.com |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112154806/http://moogfest.com/2010/news/moogfest-2010-announces-devo-as-recipient-of-moog-innovation-award |archivedate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devo was scheduled to perform at Moogfest, but Bob Mothersbaugh severely injured his hand three days prior, and the band was forced to cancel. Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald Casale collaborated with Austin, Texas, band [[The Octopus Project]] to perform &quot;Girl U Want&quot; and &quot;Beautiful World&quot; at the event instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pareles |first=Jon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/arts/music/02moog.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |title=Honoring the Moment When Music Met Moog |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 1, 2010 |accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band split from Warner Bros in 2012 and launched a new &quot;post-Warner Brothers&quot; website that would offer &quot;new protective gear&quot; and &quot;unreleased material from the archives in vinyl disc format&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clubdevo.com/tmppage/general_boy.html |title=From the Desk of General Boy |date=March 1, 2012 |website=ClubDevo.com |accessdate=March 3, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304032156/http://clubdevo.com/tmppage/general_boy.html |archivedate=March 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the band released a single called &quot;Don't Roof Rack Me, Bro (Seamus Unleashed)&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/devo-backs-seamus-dont-roof-rack-me-bro/ |title=Devo Backs Seamus: 'Don't Roof Rack Me, Bro!' |first=Mary |last=Bruce |website=ABC News |date=August 16, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624073112/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/devo-backs-seamus-dont-roof-rack-me-bro/ |archivedate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]'s former pet dog Seamus.

The band toured the US and Canada in June and July 2014, playing ten dates consisting of their &quot;experimental music&quot; composed and recorded from 1974–1978.

After a four-year hiatus from live performances, Devo headlined the [[Burger Records|Burger Boogaloo]] festival in Oakland, California on June 30, 2018.

'''Notes'''
&lt;div class=&quot;references&quot;&gt;
*A{{anchor|endnote_A}}'''[[#ref A|^]]''' David Kendrick performed with Devo at several 2002–2004 shows (including their tour of Japan (commemorated on the &quot;Devo – Live in the Land of the Rising Sun&quot; DVD) as well as the 2004 Nike [[Run Hit Wonder]]) due to the unavailability of Josh Freese. In addition, Kendrick also continued to play drums on all Devo studio tracks in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This would include &quot;It's All Good&quot;, &quot;Are You Ready&quot;, and &quot;Go Monkey Go&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alt.fan.devo.narkive.com/yyfiFqlS/billboard-article-on-possible-new-album |title=Billboard article on possible new album |website=alt.fan.devo.narkive.com |date=2006 |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*B{{anchor|endnote_B}}'''[[#ref B|^]]''' [[Ashes Divide]] drummer Jeff Friedl (formerly of [[Eagles of Death Metal]] and [[Puscifer]]) performed with Devo on June 5, 2010, at the KROQ Weenie Roast in Los Angeles, and accompanied Devo on other selected dates between 2008 and 2013 due to Freese performing with Weezer. Friedl returned for several performances in late 2014 following the &quot;Hardcore Devo&quot; tour for similar reasons, and also played drums on a few tracks from the 2013 compilation album ''[[Something for Everybody (Devo album)|Something Else for Everybody]].''
