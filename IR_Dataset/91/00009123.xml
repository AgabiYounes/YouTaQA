== History ==
Davis grew into a [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] [[railroad station|depot]] built in 1868. It was then known as &quot;Davisville&quot;, named after [[Jerome C. Davis]], a prominent local farmer. However, the post office at Davisville shortened the town name to &quot;Davis&quot; in 1907. The name stuck, and the city of Davis was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] on March 28, 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daviswiki.org/Jerome_C._Davis|title=Jerome C. Davis - Davis - LocalWiki|website=daviswiki.org|accessdate=April 28, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015150303/https://daviswiki.org/Jerome_C._Davis|archivedate=October 15, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its inception as a farming community, Davis is known for its contributions to agricultural policy along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the University Farm Bill in 1905 by the [[California State Legislature]], Governor [[George Pardee]] selected Davis out of 50 other sites as the future home to the [[University of California]]'s University Farm, officially opening to students in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucd/overview.html Davis: Historical Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214005337/http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucd/overview.html |date=February 14, 2009 }} ''University of California History'' Retrieved on 02-17-08&lt;/ref&gt; The farm, later renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture in 1922, was upgraded to become the seventh [[University of California|UC]] general campus, the [[University of California, Davis]], in 1959.

==Geography and environment==

===Location===
Davis is located in [[Yolo County, California]], {{convert|18|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} west of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], {{convert|113|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} northeast of San Francisco, {{convert|619|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} north of Los Angeles, at the intersection of [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]] and [[California State Route 113|State Route 113]]. Neighboring towns include [[Dixon, California|Dixon]], [[Winters, California|Winters]], [[Woodland, California|Woodland]], and [[West Sacramento, California|West Sacramento]].

Davis lies in the [[Sacramento Valley]], the northern portion of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], in [[Northern California]], at an elevation of about {{convert|52|ft|m}} above sea level.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.5|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|10.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.04|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.19%) is water.

The [[topography]] is flat, which has helped Davis to become known as a haven for [[bicycle|bicyclists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/03/davis-california-the-american-city-which-fell-in-love-with-the-bicycle|title=Davis, California – the American city which fell in love with the bicycle|first=Carlton|last=Reid|date=August 3, 2015|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=April 28, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701173332/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/03/davis-california-the-american-city-which-fell-in-love-with-the-bicycle|archivedate=July 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/05/league-american-bicyclists-bicycle-friendly-community-awards/|title=The Best Communities For Bicycling|date=2010-05-03|journal=Wired|accessdate=April 28, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525170706/https://www.wired.com/2010/05/league-american-bicyclists-bicycle-friendly-community-awards/|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
The Davis climate resembles that of nearby [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and is typical of California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] [[Mediterranean climate]] region: warm and dry in the spring, summer and autumn, and cool and wet in the winter. It is classified as a [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Csa climate. Summer days are hot, ranging from {{convert|85|°F}} to {{convert|105|°F}}, but the nights turn pleasantly cool, almost always dropping below {{convert|70|°F}}. The Delta Breeze, a flow of cool marine air originating from the [[Pacific Ocean]] via [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]], frequently provides relief in the evening. Winter temperatures generally reach between {{convert|45|°F}} and {{convert|65|°F}} in the afternoon; nights average at about {{convert|40|°F}}, but occasionally fall below freezing.

Average temperatures range from {{convert|46|°F}} in December and January to {{convert|75|°F}} in July and August. Thick ground fog called [[tule fog]] settles into Davis during late fall and winter. This fog can be dense with visibility nearly zero. As in other areas of northern California, the tule fog is a leading cause of road accidents in the winter season.

Mean rainfall per annum is about {{convert|20|inch}}. The bulk of rain occurs between about mid-November to mid-March, with typically no precipitation falling from mid-June to mid-September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/1120/Average-Weather-in-Davis-California-United-States-Year-Round |title=
Average Weather in Davis California, United States |publisher=Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.|accessdate=February 15, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record temperatures range from a high of {{convert|116|°F}} on July 17, 1925, to a low of {{convert|12|°F}} on December 11, 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrcc.dri.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca2294 |title=DAVIS 1 WSW, CALIFORNIA – Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811223156/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca2294 |archivedate=August 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighborhoods===
Davis is internally divided by two freeways ([[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] and [[California State Route 113|State Route 113]]), a north–south railroad (California Northern), an east–west mainline (Union Pacific) and several major streets. The city is unofficially divided into six main districts made up of smaller neighborhoods (often originally named as housing [[Subdivision (land)|subdivisions]]):
[[Image:Davisca.jpg|thumb|Part of the UC Davis Arboretum]]

There are over 150 free events and over 50,000 attend every year. Other highlights include: the [[Dachshund]] races, a.k.a. the Doxie Derby, held in the Pavilion; the Davis Rock Challenge, the Chemistry Magic Show, and the sheep dog trials. Many departments have exhibits and demonstrations, such as the Cole Facility, which until recently showed a [[fistula]]ted cow (a cow that has been fitted with a plastic portal (a &quot;[[fistula]]&quot;) into its digestive system to observe digestion processes). Its name was &quot;Hole-y Cow&quot;.

=== Davis Transmedia Art Walk ===

The walk is a roughly circuitous path that can be completed within an hour or two. Every piece of art on the Art Walk has been embedded with an RFID chip. Using a cellphone that supports this technology, you access multimedia files that relate to each work. You can even leave a comment or &quot;burn your own message&quot; for other visitors to see. Artist hosted tours are held on the weekend by appointment only. To pick up a copy of the Davis Art Walk map, visit the Yolo County Visitors Bureau (132 E St., Suite 200; (530) 297-1900) or the John Natsoulas Center for the Arts (521 1st St.; (530) 756-3938).

=== Toad Tunnel ===
[[Image:toadhotel.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Toad Tunnel in front of the Post Office]]
Davis' '''[[Toad]] Tunnel''' is a [[wildlife crossing]] that was constructed in 1995 and has drawn much attention over the years, including a mention on ''[[The Daily Show]]''. Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21&amp;nbsp;inches (53&amp;nbsp;cm) wide and 18&amp;nbsp;inches (46&amp;nbsp;cm) high.

The tunnel has created problems of its own. The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel. Once through the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.

=== Davis Food Coop ===
The [http://davisfood.coop/ Davis Food Coop] is a Davis institution. Founded in 1972, this cooperative is presently owned and operated by over 9,000 members and families of the Davis Community. The Coop is a full service supermarket that has championed organic, healthy eating in the community, sponsoring community events including summer programs for children, cooking classes, and many other activities.

=== Davis Pride Run/Walk for Equality and Community Festival ===
Davis Pride is an all-day, all-inclusive, family-friendly celebration event for members and supporters of the LGBTQ+ community. Davis Pride is a two-part large-scale fundraising event for the Davis Phoenix Coalition developed each year by a volunteer planning committee made of community members invested not only in the city of Davis but Yolo County and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole.

After which is followed by the FREE Community Fair which includes the Pride Music Festival, vendor booths, exhibits, cultural presentations, delicious food booths, and many of your closest friends!

==Education==

===University of California===
{{Main|University of California, Davis}}

The [[University of California, Davis]], or UC Davis, a campus of the [[University of California]], had a 2015 Fall enrollment of 36,104 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance|title=Fall enrollment at a glance|date=December 20, 2017|website=universityofcalifornia.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320232403/https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance|archivedate=March 20, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; UC Davis has a dominant influence on the social and cultural life of the town.

===D-Q University===
{{Main|D-Q University}}
[[Image:D-q university entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance and mural at D-Q University]]
Also known as '''Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University''' and much smaller than UC Davis, D-Q University was a two-year institution located on Road 31 in [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]] 6.7 miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[California State Route 113|State Route 113]]. This is just west of Davis near the [[Yolo County Airport]]. About four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) to the west, the Road 31 exit from [[Interstate 505 (California)|Interstate 505]] is marked with cryptic signage, &quot;DQU.&quot; The site is about 100 feet (30 m) above mean sea level (AMSL). NAD83 coordinates for the campus are {{Coord|38|34|02|N|121|53|12|W}}

The college closed in 2005. The curriculum was said to include heritage and traditional [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] ceremonies. The {{convert|643|acre|km2}} and 5 buildings were formerly a military reservation according to a [[National Park Service]] publication, ''Five Views.'' The full name of the school is included here so that readers can accurately identify the topic. According to some tribal members, use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive. People who want to be culturally respectful refer to the institution as ''D-Q University''. Tribal members in appropriate circumstances may use the full name.

===Other colleges===
An off-campus branch of [[Sacramento City College]] is located in Davis. The satellite is located in West Village, an area built by UC Davis to house students and others affiliated with the university.

===Public schools===
Davis' public school system is administrated by the [[Davis Joint Unified School District]].

The city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District's oldest public school)). Davis has one school for [[Alternative education|independent study]] (Davis School for Independent Study), three public [[Middle school|junior high schools]] (Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Junior High School|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], and Frances Harper), one main high school ([[Davis Senior High School (California)|Davis Senior High School]]), one [[Alternative school|alternative high school]] (Martin Luther King High School), and a small technology-based high school ([[Leonardo da Vinci High School]]). Cesar Chavez is a [[Language immersion|Spanish immersion]] school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, two of the elementary schools in south Davis may have their district boundaries changed, or magnet programs may be moved to equalize enrollment. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007–08 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High's campus) and a special-ed preschool. On average, class size is about 25 students: 1 teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed-data.org/district/Yolo/Davis-Joint-Unified|title=EdData - District Profile - Davis Joint Unified|website=ed-data.org|access-date=2018-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712052603/http://www.ed-data.org/district/Yolo/Davis-Joint-Unified|archive-date=July 12, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K–6 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis. César Chávez served grades K–3 and was called West Davis Elementary, and Robert E. Willett (named for a long-time teacher at the school, now deceased) served grades 4–6 and was known as West Davis Intermediate. Willett now serves K–6 English-speaking students, and Chavez supports the Spanish immersion program for K–6.
