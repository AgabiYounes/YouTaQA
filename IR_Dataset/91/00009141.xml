'''David Thomas Jones''' (30 December 1945&amp;nbsp;– 29 February 2012) was an English singer-songwriter, musician, actor and businessman, best known as a member of the band [[the Monkees]], and for starring in the [[The Monkees (TV series)|TV series]] of the same name. 

His acting credits include a [[Tony Award|Tony]]-nominated performance as [[Artful Dodger|the Artful Dodger]] in the [[Oliver!#Productions|original London and Broadway productions of ''Oliver!'']] as well as a guest star role in a [[List of The Brady Bunch episodes#Season 3 (1971–72)|hallmark episode]] of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' television show and later [[The Brady Bunch Movie|reprised parody film]]; ''[[Love, American Style]]''; and ''[[My Two Dads]]''. 

Jones was considered a [[teen idol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oconnor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=O'Connor |first=Rob |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/listoftheday/104315/the-top-25-teen-idols-of-all-time/ |title=Yahoo Music: The Top 25 Teen Idols Of All-Time |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003182018/http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/listoftheday/104315/the-top-25-teen-idols-of-all-time |archivedate=3 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaufman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1680227/monkees-davy-jones-teen-heartthrob-justin-bieber.jhtml |title=Monkee Davy Jones Paved Way For Heartthrobs Like Justin Bieber |work=Mtv |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
David Thomas Jones was born at 20 Leamington Street, [[Openshaw]], [[Manchester]], on 30 December 1945. His television acting debut was on the British television soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]''. He portrayed Colin Lomax, [[Ena Sharples]]' grandson, for one episode on 6 March 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/davyjonesoncorrie/ |title=Davy Jones in Corrie |date=1 March 2012 |publisher=ITV |accessdate=16 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411044603/http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/davyjonesoncorrie/ |archivedate= 11 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;biography1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Davy-Jones-377858 |title=Davy Jones Biography&amp;nbsp;– Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date=30 December 1945 |accessdate=31 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209234841/http://www.biography.com/articles/Davy-Jones-377858 |archivedate= 9 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appeared in the BBC police series ''[[Z-Cars]]''. After the death of his mother from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]] when he was 14 years old, Jones rejected acting in favour of a career as a jockey, commencing an apprenticeship with [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] trainer Basil Foster.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography1&quot;/&gt; He dropped out of secondary school to begin his career in that field.&lt;ref&gt;

 | journal = People
 | pages = 68–72, 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This career was short-lived, however. Even though Foster believed Jones would be successful as a jockey, he encouraged his young protégé to take a role as the [[Artful Dodger]] in a production of ''[[Oliver!]]'' in [[West End of London|London's West End]].

==Early acting and recording career==

Foster was approached by a friend who worked in a theatre in the [[West End of London]] during casting for the musical ''[[Oliver!]]''. Foster replied, &quot;I've got the kid.&quot; Jones was cast and appeared to great acclaim as the [[Artful Dodger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/9114540/Davy-Jones.html |title=Davy Jones |newspaper=Telegraph |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played the role in London and then on Broadway and was nominated for a [[Tony Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davyjones.net/djbio.html |title=Davy Jones Bio |publisher=davyjones.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311012316/http://www.davyjones.net/djbio.html |archivedate=11 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February 1964, he appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' with [[Georgia Brown (English singer)|Georgia Brown]] who was playing Nancy in the Broadway production of ''[[Oliver!]]''. This was the same episode of the show in which [[the Beatles]] made their first appearance. Jones said of that night, &quot;I watched the Beatles from the side of the stage, I saw the girls going crazy, and I said to myself, this is it, I want a piece of that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/arts/music/davy-jones-a-singer-in-the-monkees-dies-at-66.html?_r=1&amp;hp|title=Davy Jones, Monkees Singer, Dies at 66|last=Fox |first= Margalit|date=29 February 2012|work=New York Times|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his ''Ed Sullivan'' appearance, Jones signed a contract with [[Ward Sylvester]] of [[Screen Gems]] (then the television division of [[Columbia Pictures]]). A pair of American television appearances followed, as Jones received screen time in episodes of ''[[Ben Casey]]'' and ''[[The Farmer's Daughter (TV series)|The Farmer's Daughter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Davy Jones|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0427888/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in the week of 14 August 1965, with the single &quot;What Are We Going To Do?&quot; The 19-year-old singer was signed to [[Colpix Records]], a label owned by Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/genre/rock-and-pop/davy-jones-and-the-monkees-billboard-chart-1006322552.story |title=Davy Jones and the Monkees' Billboard Chart Legacy &amp;#124; Billboard |publisher=Billboard.biz |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His debut album ''David Jones'', on the same label, followed soon after (CP493).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Davy-Jones-David-Jones/release/2912492 |title=David Jones* - David Jones (Vinyl, Album, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the album was issued in the UK, in mono only, on the [[Pye Records]] label (NPL 18178).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Jones-David-Jones/release/3032165 |title=Davy Jones - Davy Jones (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Monkees==
{{Main|The Monkees}}
From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With [[Screen Gems]] producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers [[Bob Rafelson]]'s and [[Bert Schneider]]'s standards.&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt; Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including &quot;[[I Wanna Be Free (The Monkees song)|I Wanna Be Free]]&quot; and &quot;[[Daydream Believer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=lefco&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lefcowitz |first=Eric | authorlink =  |title=Monkee Business: The Revolutionary Made-For-TV Band |publisher=Retrofuture Products, LLC |year=2011 | location = [[Port Washington, New York]] | id = |isbn = 978-0-943249-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD release of the first season of the show contained commentary from the various bandmates. In [[Peter Tork]]'s commentary, he stated that Jones was a good drummer and had the live performance lineups been based solely on playing ability, it should have been Tork on guitar, Mike Nesmith on bass, and Jones on drums, with Micky Dolenz taking the fronting role, rather than as it was done (with Nesmith on guitar, Tork on bass, and Dolenz on drums). Mostly playing tambourine or maracas, Jones filled in briefly for Tork on bass when he played keyboards.

[[File:Davy Jones 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Davy Jones performing in 2011]]
The NBC television series the Monkees was popular, and remained in syndication. After the group disbanded in 1971, Jones reunited with [[Micky Dolenz]] as well as Monkees songwriters [[Boyce and Hart|Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart]] in 1974 as a short-lived group called [[Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart]].&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt;

A Monkees television show marathon (&quot;[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]&quot;) broadcast on 23 February 1986 by MTV resulted in a wave of Monkeemania not seen since the group's heyday. Jones reunited with Dolenz and [[Peter Tork]] from 1986 to 1989 to celebrate the band's renewed success and promote the 20th anniversary of the group. A new top 20 hit, &quot;That Was Then, This Is Now&quot; was released (though Jones did not perform on the song) as well as an album, ''[[Pool It!]]''.&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt;

Monkees activity ceased until 1996 when Jones reunited with Dolenz, Tork and [[Michael Nesmith]] to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band. The group released a new album entitled ''[[Justus (album)|Justus]]'', the first album since 1967's ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'' that featured the band members performing all instrumental duties. It was the last time all four Monkees performed together.&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt;

In February 2011, Jones confirmed rumours of another Monkees reunion. &quot;There's even talk of putting the Monkees back together again in the next year or so for a U.S. and UK tour,&quot; he told Disney's Backstage Pass newsletter. &quot;You're always hearing all those great songs on the radio, in commercials, movies, almost everywhere.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/myVacation/newsletter/download?id=BackstagePassS1NFPage&amp;module=S1NF201102Article&amp;CMP=NLC-WDWFY11Q2Feb2011WDWDomEnews0030 |title=Disney's Backstage Pass Feb. 2001 |publisher=Disneyworld.disney.go.com |accessdate=2 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour (Jones's last) came to fruition entitled, ''[[An Evening with The Monkees: The 45th Anniversary Tour]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Monkees announce 10-date concert tour |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2011/02/21/Monkees-announce-10-date-concert-tour/UPI-30601298316685/ |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones is the next closest member of the Monkees (to Micky Dolenz) who had worked with the band since its inception. The exceptions have been the new songs recorded in 1986 and since his death (see below).

==Post-Monkees career==
[[File:Davy Jones and Ilene 1972.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|Jones and Ilene of &quot;Sunday's Child&quot; in the 1972 ABC special ''Pop Goes Davy Jones'']]
In 1967, Jones opened his first store, called Zilch, at 217 [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]] in the [[Greenwich Village]] section of [[New York City]]. The store sold &quot;hip&quot; clothing and accessories and also allowed customers to design their own clothes.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

After the Monkees officially disbanded in 1971, Jones kept himself busy by establishing a New York City-style street market in Los Angeles, called &quot;The Street&quot; which cost approximately $40,000.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; He also collaborated with musical director Doug Trevor on a one-hour ABC television special entitled ''Pop Goes Davy Jones'', which featured new artists [[The Jackson 5]] and [[the Osmonds]].&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

[[Bell Records]], then having a string of hits with ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', signed Jones to a somewhat inflexible solo record contract in 1971.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; Jones was not allowed to choose his songs or producer, resulting in several lacklustre and aimless records.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; His second solo album, ''[[Davy Jones (album)|Davy Jones]]'' (1971) was notable for the song &quot;[[Rainy Jane]]&quot;, which reached No. 52 in the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]]. To promote the album, Jones performed &quot;[[Girl (Davy Jones song)|Girl]]&quot; on an episode of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' entitled &quot;[[List of The Brady Bunch episodes|Getting Davy Jones]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; Although the single sold poorly, the popularity of Jones's appearance on the show resulted in &quot;Girl&quot; becoming his best-remembered solo hit, even though it was not included in the album. The final single, &quot;I'll Believe In You&quot;/&quot;Road to Love,&quot; was poorly received.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

==Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart==

Thanks in part to reruns of ''The Monkees'' on Saturday mornings and in syndication, ''[[The Monkees Greatest Hits]]'' charted in 1976. The LP, issued by Arista (a subsidiary of Screen Gems), was actually a repackaging of a 1972 compilation LP called ''Refocus'' that had been issued by Arista's previous label imprint, [[Bell Records]], also owned by Screen Gems.

Dolenz and Jones took advantage of this, joining ex-Monkees songwriters [[Boyce and Hart|Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart]] to tour the United States. From 1975 to 1977, as the &quot;Golden Hits of The Monkees&quot; show (&quot;The Guys who Wrote 'Em and the Guys who Sang 'Em!&quot;), they successfully performed in smaller venues such as state fairs and amusement parks as well as making stops in Japan, Thailand, and Singapore (although they were forbidden from using the &quot;Monkees&quot; name, as it was owned by Screen Gems at the time). They also released an album of new material appropriately as ''[[Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart]]''; a live album entitled ''Concert in Japan'' was also released by [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in 1976).

[[Mike Nesmith]] had not been interested in a reunion (due largely to his dislike of touring). [[Peter Tork]] claimed later that he had not been asked, which agreed with what one of the CD booklets stated that they did not know where he was at that time. A Christmas single (credited to Micky Dolenz, Davy Jones and Peter Tork) was produced by former Monkees producer [[Chip Douglas]] and released on his own label in 1976. The single featured Douglas's and [[Howard Kaylan]]'s &quot;[[Christmas Is My Time of Year]]&quot; (originally recorded by a 1960s supergroup, Christmas Spirit), with a B-side of [[Irving Berlin]]'s &quot;[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]&quot; (Douglas released a remixed version of the single, with additional overdubbed instruments, in 1986). Tork also joined Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart on stage at Disneyland on 4 July 1976, and also joined Dolenz and Jones on stage at the Starwood in Hollywood, California, in 1977.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

==Further stage and screen appearances==

[[File:Davy Jones Maureen McCormick Brady Bunch 1971.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Jones with [[Maureen McCormick]] in the 1971 ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' episode &quot;Getting Davy Jones&quot;, in which he was a guest star]]

Jones also continued his acting career after the Monkees, either as himself or another character.

He returned to theatre several times after the Monkees. 1977 saw him performing with former bandmate [[Micky Dolenz]] in a stage production of the [[Harry Nilsson]] musical ''[[The Point!]]'' in London at the Mermaid Theatre, playing and singing the starring role of &quot;Oblio&quot; to Dolenz' roles as the &quot;Count's Kid&quot; and the &quot;Leafman&quot;, (according to the CD booklet). An original cast recording was made and released. The comedic chemistry of Jones and Dolenz proved so strong that the show was revived in 1978 with Nilsson inserting additional comedy for the two, plus two more songs, with one of them (&quot;[[Gotta Get Up]]&quot;) being sung by Jones and Dolenz. The show was considered so good that it was planned to be revived again in 1979 but it proved cost prohibitive (source CD booklet &quot;Harry Nilsson's The Point&quot;).&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; Jones also appeared in several productions of ''[[Oliver!]]'' as the Artful Dodger, and in 1989 toured the US portraying &quot;Fagin&quot;.

He appeared in two episodes each of ''[[Love, American Style]]'' and ''[[My Two Dads]]''.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; Jones also appeared in animated form as himself in 1972 in an hour-long episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''.&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; Other television appearances include ''[[Sledge Hammer!]]'', ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!]]'', ''[[The Single Guy]]'' (where he is mistaken for [[Dudley Moore]]) and ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'' in which he sang &quot;[[Daydream Believer]]&quot; to Sabrina ([[Melissa Joan Hart]]) as well as (I'll) Love You Forever.&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt;
In 1995 Jones played in a notable episode of the sitcom ''Boy Meets World''. His two former fellow [[Monkees]] [[Micky Dolenz]] and [[Peter Tork]] had already appeared separately as characters on previous episodes.  Suddenly in episode eight of the 3rd season (titled &quot;Rave On&quot;), all three former-Monkees turn up, although they did not play the Monkees per se (Davy Jones is &quot;Reginald Fairfield&quot;, while Dolenz is &quot;Gordy&quot; and Tork is &quot;Jedidiah Lawrence&quot;). Much of the comedy of the show is thrown to Jones.  However at the climax of the program the three are put on stage together and perform the classic [[Buddy Holly]] song &quot;[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]&quot;, and the [[Temptations]]' &quot;[[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]&quot;. As an inside-joke, actor [[Dave Madden]] who'd played the manager on &quot;[[The Partridge Family]]&quot; cameoed as a manager who suddenly appeared wanting to handle the &quot;new&quot; group telling them that they &quot;could be bigger than the [[Beatles]]&quot;. Purportedly both ex-[[Monkee]] [[Mike Nesmith]] and [[Pattie Boyd]] (ex-wife of [[Beatle]] [[George Harrison]]) were in attendance at the taping. (per IMDB entry &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; episode &quot;Rave On&quot;).

In 2009, Jones made a cameo appearance as himself in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode &quot;[[SpongeBob SquarePants vs. The Big One]]&quot; (his appearance was meant as a pun on the phrase &quot;[[Davy Jones' Locker]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt;

Despite his initial high profile after the end of the Monkees, Jones struggled to establish himself as a solo music artist. [[Glenn A. Baker]], author of ''Monkeemania: The True Story of the Monkees'', commented in 1986 that &quot;for an artist as versatile and confident as (Davy) Jones, the relative failure of his post-Monkees activities is puzzling. For all his cocky predictions to the press about his future plans, Davy fell into a directionless heap when left to his own devices.&quot;&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

The continued popularity of his 1971 ''Brady Bunch'' appearance led to his being cast as himself in ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]''. Jones sang his signature solo hit &quot;Girl&quot;, with a [[grunge]] band providing backing,&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt; this time with middle-aged women swooning over him.&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt; Micky Dolenz and Peter Tork also appeared alongside Jones as judges.&lt;ref name=lefco/&gt;

==Later recording career==
On 21 June 1997, during a concert at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], Jones joined [[U2]]'s [[The Edge]] onstage for a karaoke performance of &quot;[[Daydream Believer]],&quot; which had become a fixture of the band's set during that year's [[PopMart Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU-VF9dtWeE|title=The Edge &amp; Davy Jones - Daydream Believer (U2 Popmart Tour, 1997)|last=Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson|date=1 March 2013|accessdate=14 July 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Jones released ''[[Just Me (Davy Jones album)|Just Me]]'', an album of his own songs, some written for the album and others originally on Monkees releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aaron Badgley |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/just-me-mw0001230763 |title=Just Me - Davy Jones &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s he was performing in the Flower Power Concert Series during [[Epcot]]'s Flower and Garden Festival, a yearly gig he would continue until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monkeesrule43.com/myexperiences_davy_epcot02.html |title=Davy Jones Solo – April 19, 2002 – EPCOT's Flower Power Festival |publisher=Monkeesrule43.com |date=19 April 2002 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/guides/epcot/events/ep-flower-garden.htm |title=2014 Epcot Flower and Garden Festival, Flower Garden Epcot |publisher=Wdwinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Jones recorded the single &quot;Your Personal Penguin&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workman.com/boynton/songs/boynton/YourPersonalPenguin.mp3 |title=MP3 of the song Personal Penguin |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by children's author [[Sandra Boynton]], as a companion piece to her new board book of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workman.com/boynton/ |title=Workman Publishing author site for Sandra Boynton |publisher=Workman.com |accessdate=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121224759/http://www.workman.com/boynton/ |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, Davy Jones performed the main title theme song for the movie ''Sexina: Popstar P.I.''. On 1 November 2007, the Boynton book and CD titled ''Blue Moo'' was released and Jones is featured in both the book and CD, singing &quot;Your Personal Penguin&quot;. In 2009, Jones released a collection of classics and standards from the 1940s through the 1970s entitled ''She''.

In December 2008, ''[[Yahoo! Music]]'' named Jones the &quot;Number 1 [[teen idol]] of all time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;oconnor&quot; /&gt; In 2009, Jones was rated second in a list of 10&amp;nbsp;best teen idols compiled by [[Fox News Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,474846,00.html |title=Then &amp; Now: 10 Best Teen Idols of All Time |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=2 March 2012 |date=30 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429051109/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,474846,00.html |archive-date=29 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Family life===
Jones was married three times. In December 1968, he married Dixie Linda Haines, with whom he had been living. Their relationship had been kept out of the public eye until after the birth of their first child in October 1968. It caused a considerable backlash for Jones from his fans when it was finally made public. Jones later stated in ''[[Tiger Beat]]'' magazine, &quot;I kept my marriage a secret because I believe stars should be allowed a private life.&quot;&lt;ref name=baker&gt;{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=Glenn A.| authorlink = Glenn A.

Jones married his second wife, Anita Pollinger, on 24 January 1981, and also had two daughters with her: Jessica Lillian (born 4 September 1981) and Annabel Charlotte (born 26 June 1988). They divorced in 1996 during the Monkees' 30th-anniversary reunion tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;spouse&quot; /&gt; Jones married for a third time in 2009 to Jessica Pacheco. This was Pacheco's third marriage as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Jones and his wife appeared on the [[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]] show in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYkr8wj643A|title=Davy Jones Dr Phil Show 2011 04 21|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 July 2011, Pacheco filed to divorce Jones in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]], but dropped the suit in October.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} They were still married when he died in February 2012. Pacheco was omitted from Jones's will, which he had made before their marriage. His oldest daughter Talia, whom he named his executrix, was granted by the court the unusual request that her father's will be sealed, on the basis that &quot;planning documents and financial affairs as public opinion could have a material effect on his copyrights, royalties and ongoing goodwill.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/trialandheirs/2012/08/20/monkey-business-surrounding-davy-jones-estate/ |title=Monkey Business Surrounding Davy Jones Estate |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horse racing===
In addition to his career as an entertainer, Jones's other great love was horses. Training as a jockey in his teens in the UK, he had intended to pursue a career as a professional race jockey. He held an amateur rider's licence and rode in his first race at [[Newbury Racecourse|Newbury]] in Berkshire for renowned trainer [[Toby Balding]].

On 1 February 1996, Jones won his first race, on Digpast, in the one-mile Ontario Amateur Riders Handicap at [[Lingfield Park Racecourse|Lingfield]] in Surrey. Jones also had horse ownership interests in both the US and the UK, and served as a commercial spokesman for [[Colonial Downs]] racetrack in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbpa.org/NewsDisplay.asp?section=2&amp;type=l&amp;Affid=30 |title=Welcome to the National HBPA |publisher=Hbpa.org |accessdate=2 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209130933/http://www.hbpa.org/NewsDisplay.asp?section=2&amp;type=l&amp;Affid=30 |archivedate=9 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Jones's death, [[Lingfield Park Racecourse|Lingfield]] announced that the first two races on the [[Racecard|card]] for 3 March 2012 would be renamed the &quot;Hey Hey We're The Monkees Handicap&quot; and the &quot;In Memory of Davy Jones Selling Stakes&quot;, with successful horses in those races accompanied into the winners' enclosure by some of the Monkees' biggest hits. Plans were also announced to erect a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] to commemorate Jones next to a [[Araucaria araucana|Monkey Puzzle]] tree on the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saturday 3rd March Afternoon Racing|url=http://www.lingfield-racecourse.co.uk/racing-calendar.html?mode=view&amp;fix=2304|publisher=lingfield-racecourse.co.uk|accessdate=2 March 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122035629/http://www.lingfield-racecourse.co.uk/racing-calendar.html?mode=view&amp;fix=2304|archivedate=22 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On the morning of Leap Year Day [[Leap year|29 February]] 2012, Jones went to tend to his 14 horses at a farm in [[Indiantown, Florida]]. After riding one of his favourite horses around the track, he complained of chest pains and difficulty breathing, and was rushed to Martin Memorial South Hospital in [[Stuart, Florida]], where he was pronounced dead of a severe [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] resulting from [[arteriosclerosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Davy Jones' Death Caused By Severe Heart Attack|url=http://idolator.com/6205531/davy-jones-death-severe-heart-attack|accessdate=2 March 2012|newspaper=idolator.com|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Davy Jones, lead singer of the Monkees, dies in Indiantown, according to medical examiner's office |url=http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/region_martin_county/davy-jones-lead-singer-of-the-monkees-dies-from-heart-attack-this-morning-according-to-tmz-report |accessdate=29 February 2012 |newspaper=WPTV |date=29 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302183131/http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/region_martin_county/davy-jones-lead-singer-of-the-monkees-dies-from-heart-attack-this-morning-according-to-tmz-report |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17214430 |title=Davy Jones of The Monkees dies aged 66|date=1 March 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, 7 March 2012, a private funeral service was held at Holy Cross [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] parish in Indiantown. To avoid drawing attention to the grieving family, the three surviving Monkees did not attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.yahoo.com/monkees-star-davy-jones-mourned-private-funeral-170308803.html |title=Monkees star Davy Jones mourned in private funeral |first=Matt|last=Sedensky|agency=Associated Press|date= 8 March 2012|publisher=Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the group attended memorial services in New York City and organized their own private memorial in Los Angeles along with Jones's family and close friends. A public memorial service was held on 10 March 2012 in [[Beavertown, Snyder County, Pennsylvania|Beavertown]], [[Pennsylvania]], near a church Jones had purchased for future renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/micky-dolenz-monkees-to-skip-davy-jones-funeral-pay-tribute-to-him-at-public-memorials/2012/03/06/gIQA7IFbvR_story.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307111214/http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/micky-dolenz-monkees-to-skip-davy-jones-funeral-pay-tribute-to-him-at-public-memorials/2012/03/06/gIQA7IFbvR_story.html|archive-date=7 March 2012|title=Micky Dolenz: Monkees to skip Davy Jones' funeral, pay tribute to him at public memorials |work= [[The Washington Post]]|date=6 March 2012|accessdate=6 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of Jones's death triggered a surge of Internet traffic, causing sales of the Monkees' music to increase dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-beat-goes-on/posts/the-monkees-sales-soar-following-davy-jones-death|title=The Monkees' sales soar following Davy Jones' death |publisher= HitFix.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a lot of people who are grieving pretty hard. The Monkees obviously had a following, and so did (Jones) on his own. So I'm not surprised, but I was flattered and honored to be considered one of his friends and a cohort in Monkee business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url= http://www.billboard.com/news/davy-jones-funeral-surviving-monkees-may-1006365352.story#/news/davy-jones-funeral-surviving-monkees-may-1006365352.story|title=Davy Jones Funeral: Surviving Monkees May Not Attend|magazine= Billboard |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Monkees'' co-creator [[Bob Rafelson]] commented that Jones &quot;deserves a lot of credit, let me tell you. He may not have lived as long as we wanted him to, but he survived about seven lifetimes, including being perhaps the biggest rock star of his time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2012/03/davy-jones-monkees-death-obituary-bob-rafelson.html |title='Davy Jones deserves a lot of credit' - Monkees co-creator Bob Rafelson |date=1 March 2012|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brady Bunch'' co-star [[Maureen McCormick]] commented that &quot;Davy was a beautiful soul,&quot; and that he &quot;spread love and goodness around the world. He filled our lives with happiness, music, and joy. He will live on in our hearts forever. May he rest in peace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/davy-jones-dead-maureen-mccormick-pays-tribute-late-british-singer-a-beautiful-soul-article-1.1031516?localLinksEnabled=false|title=Davy Jones dead: Maureen McCormick pays tribute to late Monkees singer, says he was 'a beautiful soul' |date=1 March 2012|work=Daily News (New York)|accessdate=1 March 2012|first=Cristina|last=Everett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yahoo! Music]] commented that Jones's death &quot;hit so many people so hard&quot; because &quot;Monkees nostalgia cuts across generations: from the people who discovered the band during their original 1960s run; to the kids who came of age watching 1970s reruns; to the 20- and 30-somethings who discovered the Monkees when [[MTV]] (a network that owes much to the Monkees' influence) began airing old episodes in 1986.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kaufman&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=parker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Lyndsey|title= Shades Of Grey: Sadly Remembering Davy Jones's Musical Legacy|journal=Stop the Presses!| date=February 2012 |url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/shades-grey-sadly-remembering-davy-jones-musical-legacy-001317017.html |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' contributor [[James Poniewozik]] praised the Monkees' classic sitcom, and Jones in particular, saying, &quot;even if the show never meant to be more than entertainment and a hit-single generator, we shouldn’t sell ''The Monkees'' short. It was far better television than it had to be; during an era of formulaic domestic sitcoms and wacky comedies, it was a stylistically ambitious show, with a distinctive visual style, absurdist sense of humor and unusual story structure. Whatever Jones and the Monkees were meant to be, they became creative artists in their own right, and Jones's chipper Brit-pop presence was a big reason they were able to produce work that was commercial, wholesome, and yet impressively weird.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title= RIP Davy Jones, The Monkees' Daydreamboat|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=February 2012 |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/29/rip-davy-jones-the-monkees-daydreamboat/?xid=rss-topstories |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mediaite]]'' columnist [[Paul Levinson]] noted, &quot;The Monkees were the first example of something created in a medium&amp;nbsp;– in this case, a rock group on television&amp;nbsp;– that jumped off the screen to have big impact in the real world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Paul|title= Why The Monkees Are Important|journal=[[Mediaite]]| date=February 2012 |url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/why-the-monkees-are-important/ |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
