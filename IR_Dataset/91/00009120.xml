The '''Defense Distinguished Service Medal''' is a [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|United States military award]] which is presented for exceptionally distinguished performance of duty contributing to the national security or defense of the [[United States]]. The medal was created on July 9, 1970, by President [[Richard Nixon]] in {{ExecutiveOrder|11545}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afpc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7727 Air Force Personnel Center Defense Distinguished Service Medal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616150027/http://www.afpc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7727 |date=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The Defense Distinguished Service Medal is the United States's highest non-combat related military award and it is the highest joint service decoration. The Defense Distinguished Service Medal is awarded only while assigned to a joint activity. Normally, such responsibilities deserving of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal are held by the most senior officers such as the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman]] and [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the Chiefs and Vice Chiefs of the Services, and Commanders and Deputy Commanders of the [[Combatant Command]]s, the [[Director of the Joint Staff]] etc., whose duties bring them frequently into direct contact with the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense|Deputy Secretary of Defense]], and other senior government officials. In addition, the medal may also be awarded to other service members whose direct and individual contributions to national security or national defense are recognized as being so exceptional in scope and value as to be equivalent to contributions normally associated with positions encompassing broader responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/defense_distinguished.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518005213/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/defense_distinguished.aspx |archive-date=2013-05-18 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decoration takes precedence over the Distinguished Service Medals of the separate services and is not to be awarded to any individual for a period of service for which an [[Army Distinguished Service Medal|Army]], [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Navy]], [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal|Air Force]] or [[Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal]] is awarded.

==Appearance==
[[File:DSM presented to Guy Phillipe, Haitian commander, 2004.jpg|thumb|right| Medal presented to Haitian Major Guy Phillipe for leading element that forced President Jean-Bertrand Aristide into exile, February, 2004.]]
The medal is gold in color and on the obverse it features a medium blue [[Vitreous enamel|enameled]] pentagon (point up). Superimposed on this is an [[Bald eagle|American bald eagle]] with wings outspread facing left grasping three crossed arrows in its talons and on its breast is a shield of the United States. The pentagon and eagle are enclosed within a gold pieced circle consisting, in the upper half of 13 five-pointed stars and in the lower half, a wreath of [[Bay laurel|laurel]] on the left and [[olive]] on the right. At the top is a suspender of five graduated gold rays. The reverse of the medal has the inscription &quot;''For Distinguished Service''&quot; at the top in raised letters, and within the pentagon the inscription &quot;''From The Secretary of Defense To,''&quot; all in raised letters.

Additional awards of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal are denoted by oak leaf clusters.
