'''Dale Chihuly''' {{IPAc-en|tʃ|ᵻ|ˈ|h|uː|l|i}} (born September 20, 1941) is an [[United States|American]] [[Glass art|glass sculptor]] and entrepreneur.  His works are considered to possess outstanding artistic merit in the field of [[Glassblowing|blown glass]], &quot;moving it into the realm of large-scale sculpture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chihuly:  Through the looking glass|work=[[Museum of Fine Arts Boston]]|url=http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/chihuly|accessdate=23 October 2017|archivedate=24 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224214459/http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/chihuly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical difficulties of working with glass forms are considerable, yet Chihuly uses it as the primary medium for installations and environmental artwork.

== Early life ==
Dale Patrick Chihuly was born on September 20, 1941, in [[Tacoma, Washington]].&lt;ref name=Northwest/&gt; His parents were George and Viola Chihuly.&lt;ref name=Northwest&gt;{{cite web|title=Dale Chihuly – Legendary Master of Glass|url=http://northwestprimetime.com/news/2013/may/01/dale-chihuly-legendary-master-glass/|website=Northwest Prime Time|accessdate=28 March 2018|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, his older brother and only sibling, George, died in a [[United States Navy|Navy]] aviation training accident in [[Pensacola, Florida]].&lt;ref name=kuspit&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuspit|first1=Donald B.|title=Chihuly|date=1998|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|location=Seattle|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1958, Chihuly's father died of a heart attack at the age of 52.&lt;ref name= Williams/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}}

Chihuly had no interest in continuing his formal education after graduating from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in 1959. However, at his mother's urging, he enrolled at the [[University of Puget Sound|College of Puget Sound]].&lt;ref name = Williams&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=David O.|title=Dale Chihuly|url=http://www.dianefarrisgallery.com/dale-chihuly/|website=Diane Farris Gallery|publisher=Diane Farris Gallery|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=March 2018}} A year later, he transferred to the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]] to study [[interior design]]. In 1961, he joined the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity (Kappa Epsilon chapter), and the same year he learned how to melt and fuse glass.&lt;ref name=kuspit /&gt; Chihuly became bored with his studies, and in 1962 he dropped out of the university to study art in [[Florence]]. He later traveled to the Middle East where he met architect Robert Landsman. Their meeting and his time abroad spurred Chihuly to return to his studies. In 1963, he took a weaving class where he incorporated glass shards into tapestries. He received an award for his work from the Seattle Weavers Guild in 1964.&lt;ref name=kuspit /&gt; Chihuly graduated from the [[University of Washington]] in 1965 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in interior design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seattle Post Intellgencer&quot;/&gt;

Chihuly began experimenting with [[glassblowing]] in 1965, and in 1966 he received a full scholarship to attend the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].&lt;ref name=kuspit /&gt; He studied under [[Harvey Littleton]], who had established the first glass program in the United States at the university. In 1967, Chihuly received a [[Master of Science]] degree in [[sculpture]]. After graduating, he enrolled at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], where he met and became close friends with [[Italo Scanga]]. Chihuly earned a [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree in sculpture from the RISD in 1968. That same year, he was awarded a [[The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation|Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation]] grant for his work in glass, as well as a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission|Fulbright Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=kuspit /&gt; He traveled to Venice to work at the [[Paolo Venini|Venini]] factory on the island of [[Murano]], where he first saw the team approach to blowing glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn More|url=http://www.chihuly.com/learn|website=Chihuly|publisher=Chihuly Studio|accessdate=23 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019200939/http://www.chihuly.com/learn|archivedate=19 October 2014}} From his personal website.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the United States, Chihuly spent the first of four consecutive summers teaching at the [[Haystack Mountain School of Crafts]] in [[Deer Isle, Maine]]. In 1969, he traveled to Europe, in part to meet [[Erwin Eisch]] in [[Germany]] and [[Stanislav Libenský and Jaroslava Brychtová]] in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=kuspit /&gt;
Chihuly donated a portion of a large exhibit to his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin, in 1997 and it is on permanent display in the Kohl Center. In 2013 the University awarded him a Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts.

==Career==
[[File:Chihuly at Kew Gardens 043.jpg|thumb|Chihuly at Kew Gardens]]
In 1971, with the support of John Hauberg and Anne Gould Hauberg, Chihuly cofounded the [[Pilchuck Glass School]] near [[Stanwood, Washington]]. Chihuly also founded the HillTop Artists program in Tacoma, Washington at [[Jason Lee Middle School (Tacoma)|Jason Lee Middle School]] and [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Wilson High School]].

In 1976, while Chihuly was in England, he was involved in a head-on car accident during which he was propelled through the windshield.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Stranger&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=30734 |title=Glass Houses: Dale Chihuly Files a Lawsuit That Raises Big Questions...

After recovering, he continued to blow glass until he dislocated his right shoulder in 1979 while [[bodysurfing]]. No longer able to hold the glass blowing pipe, he hired others to do the work. Chihuly explained the change in a 2006 interview, saying &quot;Once I stepped back, I liked the view,&quot; and pointed out that it allowed him to see the work from more perspectives and enabled him to anticipate problems earlier. Chihuly describes his role as &quot;more choreographer than dancer, more supervisor than participant, more director than actor.&quot; ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' reporter Erin Glass wrote that she &quot;wonders at the vision of not just the artist Chihuly, but the very successful entrepreneur Chihuly, whose estimated sales by 2004 was reported by ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' as $29 million.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/apr/22/chihuly-a-site-specific-explosion-of-art-at-salk|title='Chihuly' a site-specific explosion of art at Salk|archivedate=30 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730204709/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2010/apr/22/chihuly-a-site-specific-explosion-of-art-at-salk/|url-status=dead|author=Glass, Erin|work=San Diego Union-Tribune|date=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chihuly and his team of artists were the subjects of the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''{{vanchor|Chihuly Over Venice}}.'' They were also featured in the documentary ''Chihuly in the Hotshop,'' syndicated to public television stations by [[American Public Television]] starting on November 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Chihuly.com|title=Chihuly Over Venice|url=https://www.chihuly.com/exhibitions/chihuly-over-venice|accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 lawsuit ===
In 2006, Chihuly filed a [[lawsuit]] against his former longtime employee, glassblower Bryan Rubino, and businessman Robert Kaindl, claiming copyright and trademark infringement. Kaindl's pieces used titles Chihuly had employed for his own works, such as ''Seaforms'' and ''Ikebana'', and resembled the construction of Chihuly's pieces. Arguments made by legal experts stated that influence on art style does not constitute [[copyright infringement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/11/Floridian/Glass_warfare.shtml |title=Glass warfare |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=2006-06-11 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hagan |first=Maureen |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002686721_chihuly16m.html |title=Glass artist Chihuly's lawsuit tests limits of copyrighting art |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2005-12-20|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chihuly settled the lawsuit with Rubino initially,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Artists Chihuly, Rubino settle claims; suit against entrepreneur unresolved |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003199340_chihuly15m.html |work=The Seattle Times |author=Sheila Farr and Susan Kelleher |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2010-02-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020215352/http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2003199340_chihuly15m.html |archivedate=2012-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later with Kaindl as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelleher |first=Susan |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003484492_chihuly19m.html |title=Chihuly, rival glass artist settle dispute |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regina Hackett, a ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' art critic, provided a chronology of Chihuly's work during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s:

* 1975: Navajo Blanket Series, in which patterns of [[Navajo rug|Navajo blankets]] were painted onto glass
* 1977: Northwest Coast Basket Series, baskets inspired by Northwest coast Indian baskets he had seen as a child
* 1980: Seaform Series, transparent sculptures of thin glass, strengthened by ribbed strands of color
* 1981: Macchia Series, featuring every color available in the studio
* 1986: Persian Series, inspired by Middle East glass from the 12th- to 14th-century, featuring more restrained color and room-sized installations
* 1988: Venetian Series, improvisations based on Italian [[Art Deco]]
* 1989: Ikebana Series, glass flower arrangements inspired by [[ikebana]]
* 1990: Venetian Series returns, this time in a more eccentric form
* 1991: Niijima Floats, six-foot spheres of intricate color inspired by Japanese [[glass fishing float]]s from the island of [[Niijima]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118042814/http://www.chihuly.com/installations/niijima |url=http://www.chihuly.com/installations/niijima|date=18 November 2010 |title=Chihuly - Niijima|archivedate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Chihuly's website
* 1992: [[Chandelier]]s, starting modestly but by the middle of the decade involving a ton of glass orbs and shapes that in some works look like flowers, others like breasts, and still others like snakes. Chihuly has also produced a sizable volume of &quot;Irish cylinders&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakeview-museum.org/photos/Cylinder.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627044517/http://www.lakeview-museum.org/photos/Cylinder.jpg |date=June 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are more modest in conception than his blown glass works.

For his exhibition in Jerusalem, Israel in 2000, in addition to the glass pieces, he had enormous blocks of transparent ice brought in from an Alaskan [[Artesian aquifer|artesian well]] and formed a wall, echoing the stones of the nearby [[Tower of David|Citadel]]. Lights with [[color gel]]s were set up behind them for illumination. Chihuly said the melting wall represented the &quot;dissolution of barriers&quot; between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Cooling a hotbed of unrest in Mideast? | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/721087/Cooling-a-hotbed-of-unrest-in-Mideast.html| work=[[Deseret News]]| author=Cohen, Jay | date=4 October 1999| accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exhibit holds the world record for most visitors to a temporary exhibit with more than 1.3 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tod.org.il/en/exhibition/jerusalem-2000/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Galleries ===
Chihuly's largest permanent exhibit can be found at the [[Oklahoma City Museum of Art]]. Chihuly maintains two retail stores in partnership with [[MGM Resorts International]]. One is located at the [[Bellagio (resort and casino)|Bellagio]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellagio.com/shopping/via-fiore.aspx |title=List of stores |publisher=Bellagio.com |date= |accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the other at the [[MGM Grand Macau|MGM Grand Casino]] in [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trimaran.com.hk/files/MGM_Grand%20Opening_Press%20Release%20(Eng-final).pdf Press release by MGM Macau mentioning Chihuly shop (search for &quot;Chihuly retail&quot;)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319203808/http://www.trimaran.com.hk/files/MGM_Grand%20Opening_Press%20Release%20%28Eng-final%29.pdf |date=March 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other galleries also carry his pieces. He also has a gallery in Las Vegas in the Crystals in the Las Vegas City Center in Gallery Row. In 1983 Chihuly returned to his native Pacific Northwest where he continued to develop his own work at the Pilchuck Glass School, which he had helped to found in 1971. Throughout the 1970s, influenced by the great glassblowing tradition of Murano, Chihuly experimented with the team approach to glassblowing. Working with a team of master glassblowers and assistants has enabled him to produce architectural glass art of a scale and quantity unimaginable working alone or with only one assistant. In 2010 the [[Space Needle]] Corporation submitted a proposal for an exhibition of Chihuly's work at a site in the [[Seattle Center]], in competition with proposals for other uses from several other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011299316_glasshouse09m.html |title=Chihuly glass museum proposed at Seattle Center where Fun Forest stood |first=Emily |last=Heffter |date=10 June 2010 |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312065200/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011299316_glasshouse09m.html |archivedate=12 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012083798_chihuly11m.html |title=In a second attempt to sell the city and the public on a Dale Chihuly glass exhibit at Seattle Center |first=Emily |last=Heffter |date=10 June 2010 |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613232033/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012083798_chihuly11m.html |archivedate=2010-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which sees the new Chihuly exhibition hall occupy the site of the former Fun Forest amusement park in the Seattle Center park and entertainment complex, received the final green light from the Seattle City Council on April 25, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Ben|title=Divisive Dale Chihuly Glass-Art 'Museum' Approved for Former Seattle Amusement Park|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37553/divisive-dale-chihuly-glass-art-museum-approved-for-former-seattle-amusement-park|publisher=ArtInfo|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called [[Chihuly Garden and Glass]], it opened May 21, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chihuly Garden and Glass Opens with Dedication Ceremony on Monday, May 21|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chihuly-garden-and-glass-opens-with-dedication-ceremony-on-monday-may-21-152260115.html|publisher=PRNewswire|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riefe|first=Jordan|title=Dale Chihuly's 'Glass House' Shines in Seattle|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/21/uk-dalechihuly-pix-idUSLNE84K00C20120521|work=Reuters|accessdate=30 November 2012|date=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
