'''Dolly''' (5 July 1996 – 14 February 2003) was a female [[domestic sheep]], and the first [[mammal]] [[cloning|cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]], using the process of [[nuclear transfer]].

== Genesis ==
Dolly was cloned by [[Keith Campbell (biologist)|Keith Campbell]], [[Ian Wilmut]] and colleagues at the [[Roslin Institute]], part of the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland, and the biotechnology company PPL Therapeutics, based near [[Edinburgh]]. The funding for Dolly's cloning was provided by PPL Therapeutics and the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Ministry of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00141844.1999.9981606| title = Why dolly matters: Kinship, culture and cloning| journal = Ethnos| volume = 64| issue = 3–4| pages = 301–324| year = 1999| last1 = Edwards | first1 = J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born on 5 July 1996 and died from a progressive lung disease five months before her seventh birthday (the disease was not considered related to her being a clone) on 14 February 2003.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2764039.stm &quot;Dolly the sheep clone dies young&quot;].

The cell used as the donor for the cloning of Dolly was taken from a [[mammary gland]], and the production of a healthy clone therefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could recreate a whole individual. On Dolly's name, Wilmut stated &quot;Dolly is derived from a mammary gland cell and we couldn't think of a more impressive pair of glands than [[Dolly Parton]]'s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-97&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/22/newsid_4245000/4245877.stm | work=BBC News | title=1997: Dolly the sheep is cloned | date=22 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Birth ==
Dolly was born on 5 July 1996 and had three mothers: one provided the egg, another the DNA, and a third carried the cloned embryo to term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | year = 2003 | first1 = N. | title = Death of Dolly marks cloning milestone | journal = Current Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 209–210 | pmid=12646139 | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00148-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was created using the technique of [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]], where the [[cell nucleus]] from an adult cell is transferred into an unfertilized [[oocyte]] (developing egg cell) that has had its cell nucleus removed. The hybrid cell is then stimulated to divide by an electric shock, and when it develops into a [[blastocyst]] it is implanted in a surrogate mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Campbell KH|author2=McWhir J |author3=Ritchie WA|author4=Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=1996 |pmid=8598906 | doi = 10.1038/380064a0|bibcode = 1996Natur.380...64C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolly was the first clone produced from a cell taken from an adult mammal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McLaren A |title=Cloning: pathways to a pluripotent future |journal=Science |volume=288 |issue=5472 |pages=1775–80 |date=2000 |pmid=10877698 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5472.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilmut&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=4|author=Wilmut I|author2=Schnieke AE|author3=McWhir J|author4=Kind AJ|author5=Campbell KH |title=Viable offspring derived from fetal and adult mammalian cells |journal=Nature |volume=385 |issue=6619 |pages=810–3 |date=1997 |pmid=9039911 | doi=10.1038/385810a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.385..810W}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of Dolly showed that genes in the nucleus of such a mature [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell are still capable of reverting to an embryonic [[Totipotency|totipotent]] state, creating a cell that can then go on to develop into any part of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Niemann H|author2=Tian XC|author3=King WA|author4=Lee RS |title=Epigenetic reprogramming in embryonic and foetal development upon somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning |journal=Reproduction |volume=135 |issue=2 |pages=151–63 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18239046 |doi=10.1530/REP-07-0397|url=http://www.reproduction-online.org/content/135/2/151.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly's existence was announced to the public on 22 February 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-97&quot;/&gt; It gained much attention in the media. A commercial with Scottish scientists playing with sheep was aired on TV, and a special report in ''Time'' magazine featured Dolly the sheep.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; ''Science'' featured Dolly as the breakthrough of the year. Even though Dolly was not the first animal cloned, she received media attention because she was the first cloned from an adult cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=McKinnell, Robert G.| author2= Di Berardino, Marie A. | title=The Biology of Cloning: History and Rationale| journal=BioScience | volume=49 | issue=11 | pages=875–885| date=November 1999 | doi=10.2307/1313647| jstor=1313647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
[[File:Dolly clone.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[cloning]] process that produced Dolly]]
Dolly lived her entire life at the [[Roslin Institute]] in Midlothian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kolata |first=Gina |date=2003-02-14 |title=Dolly, the First Cloned Mammal, Is Dead |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/14/science/life/dolly-the-first-cloned-mammal-is-dead.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There she was bred with a [[Welsh Mountain sheep|Welsh Mountain ram]] and produced six lambs in total.

== Death ==
On 14 February 2003, Dolly was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanised]] because she had a progressive lung disease and severe arthritis.&lt;ref name=final_illness&gt;[http://www.roslin.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyFinalIilness.php Dolly's final illness] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227144956/http://www.roslin.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyFinalIilness.php |date=27 February 2008 }} Roslin Institute, Accessed 21 February 2008 [http://google.com/search?q=cache:ZZqIBPjFuT0J:www.ri.bbsrc.ac.uk/publicInterest/DollyFinalIilness.php+%22Dolly%27s+arthritis%22+Roslin+Institute&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a Cached version]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Finnish Dorset sheep|Finn Dorset]] such as Dolly has a life expectancy of around 11 to 12 years, but Dolly lived 6.5 years.

Some in the press speculated that a contributing factor to Dolly's death was that she could have been born with a genetic age of six years, the same age as the sheep from which she was cloned.&lt;ref name=age/&gt; One basis for this idea was the finding that Dolly's [[telomeres]] were short, which is typically a result of the [[aging]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shiels PG|author2=Kind AJ|author3=Campbell KH|title=Analysis of telomere length in Dolly, a sheep derived by nuclear transfer |journal=Cloning |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=119–25 |date=1999 |pmid=16218837 | doi = 10.1089/15204559950020003|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shiels PG|author2=Kind AJ|author3=Campbell KH|title=Analysis of telomere lengths in cloned sheep |journal=Nature |volume=399 |issue=6734 |pages=316–7 |date=1999 |pmid=10360570 | doi = 10.1038/20580|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..316H |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roslin Institute stated that intensive health screening did not reveal any abnormalities in Dolly that could have come from advanced aging.&lt;ref name=age&gt;[http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/public-interest/dolly-the-sheep/a-life-of-dolly/ Was Dolly already 'old' at birth?] Roslin Institute, Accessed 4 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, scientists reported no defects in thirteen cloned sheep, including four from the same cell line as Dolly. The first study to review the long-term health outcomes of cloning, the authors found no evidence of late-onset, non-communicable diseases other than some minor examples of osteoarthritis and concluded &quot;We could find no evidence, therefore, of a detrimental long-term effect of cloning by SCNT on the health of aged offspring among our cohort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinclair|first1=K.
