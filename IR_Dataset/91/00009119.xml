The '''Distinguished Service Medal''' ('''DSM''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=8962|title=ASSIST-QuickSearch Document Details|website=quicksearch.dla.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military award]] of the [[United States Army]] that is presented to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the [[United States military]], has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility. The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service that is clearly exceptional. Exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/distinguished_srv_medal.aspx|title=Error|website=www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil|access-date=2011-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305074840/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/distinguished_srv_medal.aspx#|archive-date=2010-03-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate Distinguished Service Medals exist for the different branches of the military as well as a fifth version of the medal which is a senior award of the United States Department of Defense.  The army version of the Distinguished Service Medal is typically referred to simply as the &quot;Distinguished Service Medal&quot;, while the other branches of service use the service name as a prefix.

For service not related to actual war, the term &quot;duty of a great responsibility&quot; applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war, and requires evidence of conspicuously significant achievement. However, justification of the award may accrue by virtue of exceptionally meritorious service in a succession of high positions of great importance.

Awards may be made to persons other than members of the [[United States Armed Forces]] for wartime services only, and then only under exceptional circumstances, with the express approval of the president in each case.

==Description==

==Criteria==
The Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the United States Army, has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility.
The performance must be such as to merit recognition for service which is clearly exceptional. Exceptional performance of normal duty will not alone justify an award of this decoration. For service not related to actual war, the term &quot;duty of a great responsibility&quot; applies to a narrower range of positions than in time of war and requires evidence of a conspicuously significant achievement.

==History of the Distinguished Service Medal==
The Distinguished Service Medal was authorized by Presidential Order dated 01-02-1918, and confirmed by Congress on 07-09-1918. It was announced by War Department General Order No. 6, 1918-01-12, with the following information concerning the medal: &quot;A bronze medal of appropriate design and a ribbon to be worn in lieu thereof, to be awarded by the President to any person who, while serving in any capacity with the Army shall hereafter distinguish himself or herself, or who, since 04-06-1917, has distinguished himself or herself by exceptionally meritorious service to the Government in a duty of great responsibility in time of war or in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United States.&quot; The Act of Congress on 07-09-1918, recognized the need for different types and degrees of heroism and meritorious service and included such provisions for award criteria. The current statutory authorization for the Distinguished Service Medal is [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]], [[United States Code]], Section 3743.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|10|3743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipients==
{{see also|Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (United States)}}
*Among the first awards of the Distinguished Service Medal for service in World War I, were those to the Commanding Officers of the Allied Armies:
#Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]]
#Marshal [[Joseph Joffre]],
#General [[Philippe Petain]] of France,
#General [[Louis Franchet d'Espèrey]] of France,
#General Sir [[Arthur Currie]] of Canada,
#General Sir [[John Monash]] of Australia,
#Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig]] of Britain,
#General [[Armando Diaz]] of Italy,
#General [[Cyriaque Gillain]] of Belgium,
#General [[John Joseph Pershing]] – United States
#[[Field marshal (Serbia and Yugoslavia)|Field Marshal]] [[Živojin Mišić]] of Serbia

More than 2,000 awards were made during World War I, and by the time the United States entered World War II, approximately 2,800 awards had been made.  From July 1, 1941, to June 6, 1969, when the army stopped publishing awards of the DSM in Department of the Army General Orders, over 2,800 further awards were made.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Apgar (1995), ''Awards of the US Army Distinguished Service Medal 1942-1969'', Planchet Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to World War II the DSM was the only decoration for non-combat service in the U.S. Army.  As a result, before World War II the DSM was awarded to a wider range of recipients than during and after World War II.  During World War I awards of the DSM to officers below the rank of brigadier general were fairly common but became rare once the [[Legion of Merit]] was established in 1942. 

Until the first award of the [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1965, [[United States Air Force]] personnel received this award as well, as was the case with several other army decorations until the air force fully established its own system of decorations.

===Notable recipients===
Because the Army Distinguished Service Medal is principally awarded to general officers, a list of notable recipients would include nearly every general, and some admirals, since 1918, many of whom received multiple awards, as well as a few civilians and sergeants major prominent for their contributions to national defense.

General [[Martin Dempsey]], former [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], has the record for the greatest number of awards received of the Army Distinguished Service Medal at six.  He also received three awards of the [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]] as well as one award each of the [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]], the [[Air Force Distinguished Service Medal]], and the [[Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal]], for a total of twelve Distinguished Service Medals. 

Generals of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]] are tied with five awards each received of the Army Distinguished Service Medal.  They also each received one award of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, for a total of six DSMs each.

General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] received two awards of the Army DSM and one award each of the Defense DSM, Navy DSM, the Air Force DSM and the Coast Guard DSM, for a total of six DSMs.

General [[Lloyd Austin]] received four awards of the Army DSM and five awards of the Defense DSM for a total of nine DSMs.

Among notable recipients below flag rank are: X-1 test pilot [[Chuck Yeager]] and X-15 test pilot [[Robert M. White]], who both received the DSM as U.S. Air Force majors; Air Force Major [[Rudolf Anderson]], the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] pilot shot down during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]; director [[Frank Capra]], decorated in 1945 as an army colonel; actor [[James Stewart]], decorated in 1945 as an Army Air Forces colonel (later Air Force Brigadier General); Colonel [[Wendell Fertig]], who led Filipino guerrillas behind Japanese lines; Colonel (later Major General) [[John K. Singlaub]], who led partisan forces in the Korean War; and Major Maude C. Davison, who led the &quot;[[Angels of Bataan]] and Corregidor&quot; during their imprisonment by the Japanese, and Colonel William S. Taylor, Program Manager Multiple Launch Rocket System. Among notable civilian recipients are [[Harry L. Hopkins]], [[Robert S. McNamara]] and [[Henry L. Stimson]].
