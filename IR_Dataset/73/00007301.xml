'''Casablanca''' ({{IPA-es|kasaˈβlaŋka}}; {{lang-ar|الدار البيضاء|Ad-dar Al Baidaa'}} {{IPA-ar|adˈdaːru ɫbajdˤaːʔ|}} ''white house'', {{lang-ber|ⴰⵏⴼⴰ|Anfa}} {{IPA-ber|ænfæ|}} ''incline'') is the largest city of [[Morocco]]. Located in the central-western part of Morocco bordering the [[Atlantic Ocean]], it is the largest city in the [[Maghreb]] region and the [[List of largest cities in the Arab world|eighth-largest]] in the [[Arab world]]. Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and one of the largest [[financial center]]s in [[Africa]]. According to the 2014 population estimate, the city has a population of about 3.35 million in the [[urban area]] and over 6.8 million in the [[Casablanca-Settat]] region. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, although the national [[Capital (political)|political capital]] is [[Rabat]].

The leading Moroccan companies and many international corporations doing business in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca holds its recorded position as the primary industrial zone of the nation. The [[Port of Casablanca]] is one of the largest artificial ports in the world,{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} and the second largest port of [[North Africa]], after [[Tanger-Med]] {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Tangier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-ata.org/mc_casablanca.htm |title=''Discovering Casablanca'' |publisher=Africa-ata.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casablanca also hosts the primary [[naval base]] for the [[Royal Moroccan Navy]].

== Etymology ==
The original name of Casablanca was ''[[Anfa]]'' ([[Tifinagh|Neo-Tifinagh]]: ⴰⵏⴼⴰ), in [[Berber language]], by at least the seventh century BC.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After the Portuguese took control of the city in the 15th century AD, they rebuilt it, changing the name to ''Casa Branca'' ({{IPA-pt|kazɐ'bɾɐ̃kɐ|}}). It derives from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word combination meaning &quot;White House&quot; (''{{lang|pt|branca}}'' &quot;white&quot;, ''{{lang|pt|casa}}'' &quot;house&quot;). The present name, which is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version ({{IPA-es|ka̠sa̠ˈβ̞la̠ŋka̠|pron}}), came when the [[Portuguese kingdom]] was integrated in [[Iberian Union|personal union]] to the Spanish kingdom. During the [[French protectorate in Morocco]], the name remained Casablanca ({{IPA-fr|kazablɑ̃ka|pron}}). In 1755 an [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake]] destroyed most of the town. It was rebuilt by Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] who changed the name into the local [[Arabic]] ''Ad-dar Al Baidaa''' (الدار البيضاء), although occasionally &quot;Casablanca&quot; is written in Arabic (كازابلانكا, ''Kāzāblānkā''). The city is still nicknamed ''Casa'' by many locals and outsiders to the city. In many other cities with a different dialect, it is called ''Ad-dar Al-Bida'', instead.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Casablanca|Timeline of Casablanca}}

=== Early history ===
The area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by [[Berber people|Berbers]] by at least the seventh century BC.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Casablanca.html |title='&amp;#39;Casablanca'&amp;#39; |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In his book [[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Description of Africa]], [[Leo Africanus]] refers to ancient Casablanca as &quot;[[Anfa]]&quot;, a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of [[Barghawata]] in 744&amp;nbsp;AD. He believed Anfa was the most &quot;prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/historymuseum/creatingcommunity.shtml |title=Museum of History &amp; Holocaust Education: Creating Community Collaboration |publisher=Kennesaw.edu |accessdate=17 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719222242/https://www.kennesaw.edu/historymuseum/creatingcommunity.shtml |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the [[Almoravid]]s in 1068. Following the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, [[Arab]] tribes of [[Banu Hilal|Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym|Sulaym]] descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Casablanca-Morocco Casablanca], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Levy12&quot;&gt;S. Lévy, ''Pour une histoire linguistique du Maroc'', in ''Peuplement et arabisation au Maghreb occidental: dialectologie et histoire'', 1998, pp.11–26 ({{ISBN|84-86839-85-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14th century, under the [[Merinid]]s, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a [[1465 Moroccan revolt|popular revolt]] in 1465.&lt;ref name=&quot;VauchezDobson2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vauchez|first1=André|last2=Dobson|first2=Richard Barrie|last3=Lapidge|first3=Michael|title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=om4olQhrE84C&amp;pg=PA941|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2000|publisher=Editions du Cerf|isbn=978-1-57958-282-1|page=941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portuguese conquest and Spanish influence ===
[[File:Braun Anfa UBHD.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|Casablanca in 1572, still called &quot;Anfa&quot; in this coloured engraving, although the Portuguese had already renamed it &quot;Casa Branca&quot; – &quot;White House&quot; – later Hispanicised to &quot;Casablanca&quot;.]]
In the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who bombarded the town which led to its destruction in 1468.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britain)1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide to places of the world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQ9dAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=April 1987|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning &quot;white house&quot; in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Between 1580 and 1640, the Crown of Portugal was integrated to the Crown of Spain, so Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with Spain in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edition&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The International City of Tangier, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGqmAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=22 April 2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4351-8|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake]] which destroyed most of the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aldosari&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldosari|first=Ali|title=Middle East, western Asia, and northern Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&amp;pg=PA1254|accessdate=22 April 2012|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=1254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was finally reconstructed by [[Sultan]] [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] (1756–1790), the grandson of [[Moulay Ismail]] and an ally of [[George Washington]], with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called ''ad-Dār al-Bayḍāʼ'' (الدار البيضاء), the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation of the Portuguese ''Casa Branca''.

=== Colonial struggle ===

In the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing [[gunpowder tea]], used in Morocco's national drink, [[Maghrebi mint tea|mint tea]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Srhir2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Srhir|first=Khalid Ben|title=Britain And Morocco During The Embassy Of John Drummond Hay, 1845–1886|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Wf_Av7-hIoC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=19 April 2005|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=978-0-7146-5432-4|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Pennel, CR: ''Morocco from Empire to Independence'', Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 121&lt;/ref&gt; Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of [[French colonial empires|French colonialists]] in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000,&lt;ref&gt;Pennel, CR: ''Morocco from Empire to Independence'', Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 149.&lt;/ref&gt; largely through the development of [[shanty town]]s.

The [[Algeciras Conference|Treaty of Algeciras]] of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company [[Compagnie Marocaine|''La Compagnie Marocaine'']] would develop the [[port of Casablanca]], and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histoire de Casablanca, des origines à 1914|last=Adam|first=André|publisher=Éditions Ophrys|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To build the port's breakwater, [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] track was laid in June 1907 for a small [[Decauville]] locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in [[Roches Noires, Morocco|Roches Noires]], passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the [[Chaouia (Morocco)|Chaouia]] attacked the locomotive, killing 9 [[Compagnie Marocaine]] laborers—3 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histoire de Casablanca, des origines à 1914|last=Adam|first=André|publisher=Éditions Ophrys|year=1968|isbn=|location=|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the French [[Bombardment of Casablanca (1907)|bombarded the city]] with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the ''[[Mellah]]'', or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histoire de Casablanca: des origines à 1914|last=Adam|first=André|publisher=Ophrys|year=1968|isbn=|location=Aix-en-Provence|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombardment and military invasion of the city effectively began the [[French conquest of Morocco|French military conquest of Morocco]], although French control of Casablanca was not formalized until the [[French protectorate in Morocco|French ''Protectorat'']] was established by the [[Treaty of Fez|Treaty of Fes]] March 1912.

General [[Hubert Lyautey]] assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to [[Henri Prost]]. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European ''ville nouvelle'' outside the walls of the [[Medina quarter|medina]]. In Casablanca, he also designed a new &quot;''[[Hubous (Casablanca)|ville indigène]]''&quot; to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodebert|first=Laurent|title=&amp;quot;Laprade et Prost, du Maroc à Génissiat, du sol des villes aux édifices&amp;quot;, journal de l&amp;#39;exposition &amp;quot;De la construction au récit&amp;quot; au CAUE 74|url=https://www.academia.edu/26035381/_Laprade_et_Prost_du_Maroc_%C3%A0_G%C3%A9nissiat_du_sol_des_villes_aux_%C3%A9difices_journal_de_lexposition_De_la_construction_au_r%C3%A9cit_au_CAUE_74|journal=Journal de l&amp;#39;exposition De la construction au récit, être de son temps et de son lieu pour l&amp;#39;architecture du XXe siècle|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Philippe Pétain]] of [[French Third Republic|France]] signed the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|armistice]] with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], he ordered French troops in [[French colonial empire|France's colonial empire]] to defend French territory against any aggressors—[[Allies of World War II|Allied]] or otherwise—applying a policy of &quot;asymmetrical neutrality&quot; in favor of the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.ma/books?id=98JmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22neutralit%C3%A9+dissym%C3%A9trique%22+petain&amp;dq=%22neutralit%C3%A9+dissym%C3%A9trique%22+petain&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ192S6bDjAhXhlFwKHQnuBkMQ6AEIMDAB|title=Relations internationales Paris|last=|first=|date=2001|publisher=Société d'études historiques des relations internationales contemporaines|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=358|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; French colonists in Morocco generally supported Pétain, while politically conscious Moroccans tended to favor [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855022840|title=A history of modern Morocco|last=Miller|first=Susan Gilson|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781139624695|location=New York|pages=142|oclc=855022840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Torch]], which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of [[French North Africa]] during the North African campaign of [[World War II]]. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George S. Patton]] and [[Rear Admiral]] [[Henry Kent Hewitt]], carried out the invasions of [[Kenitra|Mehdia]], [[Mohammedia|Fedhala]], and [[Safi, Morocco|Asfi]]. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered November 11, 1942, but the [[Naval Battle of Casablanca]] continued until American forces sank [[German submarine U-173]] on November 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://public1.nhhcaws.local/content/history/museums/nmusn/explore/photography/wwii/wwii-north-africa-campaign/naval-battle-of-casablanca.html|title=1942: November 8-16: Naval Battle of Casablanca|website=public1.nhhcaws.local|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-13}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casablanca was the site of the [[Nouasseur Air Base]], a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the [[European Theater of Operations]] during World War II. The air field has since become [[Mohammed V International Airport]].

==== Anfa Conference ====
Casablanca hosted the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Anfa Conference]] (also called the [[Casablanca Conference]]) in January 1943. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the [[Free France]] generals [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Henri Giraud]], though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.

It was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of &quot;unconditional surrender,&quot; meaning that the [[Axis powers]] would be fought until their defeat. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] also met privately with Sultan [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Muhammad V]] and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855022840|title=A history of modern Morocco|last=Miller|first=Susan Gilson|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781139624695|location=New York|pages=144|oclc=855022840}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Toward independence ===
During the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.

April 7, 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by [[Senegalese Tirailleurs]] in the service of the [[Troupes coloniales|French colonial army]], was instigated just as Sultan [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Muhammed V]] was due to make a speech in [[Tangier]] appealing for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasinfo.fr/Evenements-du-7-avril-1947-a-Casablanca-un-tournant-decisif-dans-la-lutte-pour-la-liberte-et-l-independance_a70631.html|title=Evènements du 7 avril 1947 à Casablanca, un tournant décisif dans la lutte pour la liberté et l'indépendance|website=Atlasinfo.fr: l'essentiel de l'actualité de la France et du Maghreb|language=fr|access-date=2019-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riots in Casablanca took place from December 7–8, 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist [[Farhat Hached]] by ''[[La Main Rouge]]''—the clandestine militant wing of [[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage|French intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yabiladi.com/articles/details/49006/decembre-1952-quand-casablancais-sont.html|title=7-8 décembre 1952 : Quand les Casablancais se sont soulevés contre l'assassinat de Ferhat Hached|website=www.yabiladi.com|language=fr|access-date=2019-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), [[Muhammad Zarqtuni]] orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's [[Central Market (Casablanca)|Central Market]] in response to the forced exile of Sultan [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Muhammad V]] and the royal family on August 20 ([[Eid al-Adha]]) of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1953/12/25/archives/16-dead-in-casablanca-blast.html?sq=casablanca+bomb&amp;scp=3&amp;st=p|title=16 Dead in Casablanca Blast|author=|date=25 December 1953|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=4 October 2010|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Since independence ===
Morocco gained independence from France in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=William E.|title=Tricolor and Crescent: France and the Islamic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4vrUbMK5eEC&amp;pg=PA210|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97470-1|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Casablanca Group ====
January 4–7, 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the [[Casablanca Group|Casablanca Conference of 1961]]. Among those received by King [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Muhammad V]] were [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Gamal Abd An-Nasser]], [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Modibo Keïta]], and [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]], [[Ferhat Abbas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zamane.ma/fr/la-conference-de-casablanca/|title=La Conférence de Casablanca|date=2012-11-30|website=Zamane|language=fr-FR|access-date=2019-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yabiladi.com/articles/details/49827/janvier-1961-conference-casablanca-prelude.html|title=4 au 7 janvier 1961 : La Conférence de Casablanca, prélude à la création de l’OUA|website=www.yabiladi.com|language=fr|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uia.org/s/or/en/1100002995|title=African States of the Casablanca Charter {{!}} UIA Yearbook Profile {{!}} Union of International Associations|website=uia.org|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jewish emigration ====
Casablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through [[Operation Yachin]], an operation conducted by [[Mossad]] to secretly migrate [[Moroccan Jews]] to [[Israel]] between November 1961 and spring 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Abécassis.

==== 1965 riots ====
The [[1965 Moroccan riots|1965 student protests]] organized by the [[National Union of Popular Forces]]-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on March 22, 1965 in front of [[Lycée Mohammed V]] in Casablanca.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brousky20052&quot;&gt;Par Omar Brouksy, &quot;[http://www.jeuneafrique.com/Article/LIN20035quesesramel0/ Que s'est-il vraiment passé le 23 mars 1965?]&quot;, ''Jeune Afrique'', 21 March 2005.

Je n'avais jamais vu un rassemblement d'adolescents aussi impressionnant&quot; as quoted in Brousky, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker &amp; Boum, ''Historical Dictionary of Morocco'' (2006), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of laborers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller2013&quot;&gt;Miller, ''A History of Modern Morocco'' (2013), pp. 162–[https://books.google.com/books?id=peGyku_eREkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA168 168]–169.&lt;/ref&gt; The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armored vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the [[National Union of Popular Forces|UNFP]] reported more than 1,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brousky20052&quot;/&gt;

King [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]] blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on March 30, 1965: &quot;There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.”&lt;ref&gt;''”Permettez-moi de vous dire qu'il n'y a pas de danger aussi grave pour l'Etat que celui d'un prétendu intellectuel. Il aurait mieux valu que vous soyez tous illettrés.”'' Quoted in Rollinde, ''Le Mouvement marocain des droits de l'Homme'' (2003), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qrst5uqJTKEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 123].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Ossman, ''Picturing Casablanca: Portraits of Power in a Modern City''; University of California Press, 1994; p.

==== 1981 riots ====
On June 6, 1981, the [[Casablanca Bread Riots]] took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt; Hassan II appointed the French-trained lawyer [[Driss Basri]], who would later become a symbol of the [[Years of Lead (Morocco)|Years of Lead]], with quelling the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855022840|title=A history of modern Morocco|last=Miller, Susan Gilson.|first=|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=978-1-139-62469-5|location=New York|pages=185|oclc=855022840}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/08/25/a-black-saturday-shadows-the-future-of-hassans-morocco/8a5cb6ce-39b4-42b9-bb48-f3a196706961/|title=A 'Black Saturday' Shadows the Future Of Hassan's Morocco|last=Cooley|first=John K.|date=25 August 1981|work=The Washington Post|access-date=22 January 2020|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Mudawana'' ====
In March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ParkBoum2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Park|first1=Thomas Kerlin|last2=Boum|first2=Aomar|title=Historical Dictionary of Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KiCl5-MxMMC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5341-6|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on [[polygamy]] and the introduction of [[Talaq (Nikah)|divorce law]] (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed VI]], and he enacted a new ''[[mudawana]]'', or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiliNewark2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Mili|first=Amel|title=Exploring the Relation Between Gender Politics and Representative Government in the Maghreb: Analytical and Empirical Observations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YM1RcocOxugC&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers The State University of New Jersey – Newark.

On 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a [[2003 Casablanca bombings|multiple suicide bomb attack]] carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to [[al-Qaeda]]. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;DakwarWatch2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dakwar|first1=Jamil|last2=Goldstein|first2=Eric|title=Morocco: Human Rights at a Crossroads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OT9bK03HEZkC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2004|publisher=Human Rights Watch|page=25|id=GGKEY:WTWR4502X87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms.

== Geography ==

Casablanca is located on the [[Chaouia (Morocco)|Chaouia]] Plains which has historically been the breadbasket of Morocco.&lt;ref name=&quot;PellowMorsy1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pellow|first1=Thomas|last2=Morsy|first2=Magali|title=La relation de Thomas Pellow: une lecture du Maroc au 18e siècle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDpbAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=1983|publisher=Editions Recherche sur les Civilisations|isbn=978-2-86538-050-3|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Atlantic coast, the [[Bouskoura]] forest is the only natural attraction in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;CohenEleb2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Jean-Louis|last2=Eleb|first2=Monique|title=Casablanca: colonial myths and architectural ventures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyLqAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2002|publisher=Monacelli Press|isbn=978-1-58093-087-1|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of [[eucalyptus]], [[Arecaceae|palm]], and [[pine]] trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;WordellSeiler2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wordell|first1=Malcolm Taber|last2=Seiler|first2=Edwin Norton|last3=Ayling|first3=Keith|title=&quot;Wildcats&quot; Over Casablanca: U.S. Navy Fighters in Operation Torch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YNxtCc6d13kC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=10 July 2007|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57488-722-8|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located halfway to the city's international airport.

The only watercourse in Casablanca is ''oued Bouskoura'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Pierre2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierre|first=Jean-Luc|title=Casablanca et la France: XIXe-XXe siècles : mémoires croisées|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UojVkyplkR0C&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2002|publisher=Eddif|isbn=978-9981-09-086-6|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of [[El-Jadida|El Jadida]] road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is [[Oum Er-Rbia River|Oum Rabia]], {{convert|70|km|2|abbr=on}} to the south-east.

=== Climate ===

Casablanca has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). The cool [[Canary Current]] off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal [[Los Angeles]], with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to {{convert|412|mm|1|abbr=on}} per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are {{convert|40.5|°C|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-2.7|°C|1|abbr=on}}, respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is {{convert|178|mm|1|abbr=on}} on 30 November 2010.

=== Judaism in Casablanca ===
Jews have a [[History of the Jews in Morocco|long history]] in Casablanca. A [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] community was in [[Anfa]] up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah [[Synagogue]] was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].&lt;ref name=JVL/&gt;

Approximately 28,000 [[Moroccan Jews]] [[Migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel|immigrated]] to the [[Israel|State of Israel]] between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=IMMIGRANTS, BY PERIOD OF IMMIGRATION, COUNTRY OF BIRTH AND LAST COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton60/st04_04.pdf|journal=CBS, STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF ISRAEL|publisher=Government of Israel|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casablanca then became a departure point in [[Operation Yachin]], the covert [[Mossad]]-organized migration operation from 1961–1964.

Morocco was expelled and the tournament was held in [[Equatorial Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea to host 2015 Cup|date=14 November 2014|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30059022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Venues ====

*[[Stade Larbi Zaouli]]
*[[Stade Mohamed V]]
*[[Stade Sidi Bernoussi]]
*[[Complexe Al Amal|Complexe Al Amal de Casablanca]]

The [[Grand Stade de Casablanca]] is the proposed title of the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2014, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of [[Raja Casablanca]], [[Wydad Casablanca]], and the [[Morocco national football team]]. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the [[Stade Mohamed V]]. The initial idea of the stadium was for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], for which Morocco lost their bid to [[South Africa]]. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]], for which Morocco lost their bid to [[Canada]], [[Mexico]] and [[United States]]. It is now hoping for the [[2030 FIFA World Cup]] which Morocco is co-bidding with either African neighbors [[Tunisia]] and [[Algeria]] or two European nations [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]

=== Architecture ===

==== Traditional Moroccan ====

The historic [[Medina quarter|Old Medina]], the original walled city of Casablanca rebuilt by Sultan [[Mohammed ben Abdallah]] after the earthquake of 1755, represents ''Ad-Dār Al-Bayḍāʾ'' before French colonization. It was largely destroyed in the [[Bombardment of Casablanca (1907)|French bombardment of 1907]]. Casablanca's medina attracts fewer tourists than those of cities such as [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] and [[Marrakech]]. However, it has undergone some restoration in recent years. Included in this project were the western walls of the medina, its ''sqala'', or [[bastion]], and its [[Casablanca Clock Tower|clock tower]] rebuilt in the image of the one from 1908.[[File:Casa didier55 019.jpg|thumb|200|Architecture of Casablanca, influenced by French styles]]

==== Art Nouveau, Art Deco, and Neo Mauresque ====
The French period ''Ville Nouvelle'' (New Town) of Casablanca was designed by the French architect [[Henri Prost]], and was a model of a [[planned community|new town]] at that time. The main streets radiate south and east from what is now [[United Nations Square (Casablanca)|United Nations Square]], previously the ''souq kbir'' ({{Lang|ar|السوق الكبير}}), the main market forming just outside the ramparts of the medina. [[Henri Prost]], [[Albert Laprade]], [[Marius Boyer]], and [[August Cadet]] were some of the early planners and architects of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;CohenEleb20022&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CyLqAAAAMAAJ|title=Casablanca: colonial myths and architectural ventures|last1=Cohen|first1=Jean-Louis|last2=Eleb|first2=Monique|publisher=Monacelli Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58093-087-1|page=313|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former administrative square, now [[Muhammad V Square]], is surrounded by buildings in a style called ''[[Neo-Mauresque]]'', or Neo-Moorish, which combines [[Moorish architecture|Mauro-Andalusi]] and [[Art Deco]] architecture.

The [[Habous (Casablanca)|Habous]] (or New Medina) is a neighborhood designed by French architects in neo-Moorish style during French protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://morocco.falktime.com/habbous-quarter-or-new-medina/|title=Habbous quarter or New Medina, Casablanca|date=2018-06-21|website=Morocco.FalkTime|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its sights are:

*[[Mahkamat al-Pasha]]
* Moulay Youssef Mosque
* Muhammadi Mosque
* Royal Palace
* Olive souq etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuideBook&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://morocco.falktime.com/destinations/casablanca/|title=Casablanca guide book|date=2018-06-11|website=Morocco.FalkTime|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arab League Park]] (formerly called ''Parc Lyautey'') is the city's largest [[public park]]. On its edge is the [[Casablanca Cathedral|Sacred Heart Church of Casablanca]]. It is no longer in use for religious purposes, but it is open to visitors and is a splendid example of [[Neo-Gothic]] architecture.

The French government described Casablanca as a &quot;laboratory of urbanism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:52&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pagesmagazine.net/en/articles/contact-zones/58cbd1fabf07dc00b19b0b8c|title=Contact Zones|author1=Von Osten, Marion|author2=Müller, Andreas|date=|website=Pages Magazine|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2019-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco's permanent delegation to UNESCO submitted a nomination file to get Casablanca's 20th century architecture classified as a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5848/|title=Casablanca, Ville du XXème siècle, carrefour d’influences|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Casamémoire]] is an organization that has been working to protect and promote this architectural heritage since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/africa/casablanca-architecture-art-deco-buildings-protection-morocco-casamemoire-a8336461.html|title=Casamemoire: Why Casablanca's Art Deco Architecture Needs Urgent Protection|last=Sinclair|first=Mandy|date=May 7, 2018|website=The Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notre-Dame de Lourdes Church is a modernist Catholic church that was built in 1954 by architect Achille Dangleterre and engineer Gaston Zimmer. The main attraction of Notre-Dame de Lourdes church is the glasswork of world-famous stained glass artist [[Gabriel Loire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GuideBook&quot; /&gt;

An iconic site on [[Ain Diab]]'s corniche is the small island [[ribat]] of Sidi Abderrahman. Before 2013, the only way to reach the island was to walk across at low tide. Nowadays there's a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://morocco.falktime.com/sidi-abderrahman-island/|title=Sidi Abderrahman island, Casablanca|date=2018-06-11|website=Morocco.FalkTime|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outcrop contains the tomb of [[Sidi Abder Rahman El Thaelebi|Sidi Abderrhamane Thaalibi]], a [[Sufi]] from [[Baghdad]] and the founder of Algiers.

Some believe that the saint possessed magical powers, so his tomb still possesses these powers. People come and seek this magic to be cured. Non-Muslims may not enter the shrine.

Casablanca is home to the [[Hassan II Mosque]], designed by the French architect [[Michel Pinseau]]. It is situated on a [[promontory]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The mosque has room for 25,000 worshippers inside, and a further 80,000 can be accommodated in the mosque's courtyard. Its [[minaret]] is the world's tallest at {{convert|210|m|abbr=off}}. The mosque is also the largest in North Africa, and the third-largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/sights/religious-spiritual/hassan-ii-mosque|title=Hassan II Mosque in Morocco, Morocco|date=28 August 2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101232/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/sights/religious-spiritual/hassan-ii-mosque|archivedate=14 May 2011|accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the mosque started in 1980, and was intended to be completed for the 60th birthday of the former [[King of Morocco|Moroccan king]], [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]], in 1989. However, the building was not inaugurated until 1993. Authorities spent an estimated $800&amp;nbsp;million in the construction of the building.

=== Air ===
[[File:Royal Air Maroc Boeing 747-400 CN-RGA CMN 2006-6-5.png|left|thumb|[[Mohammed V International Airport]] is the [[Airline hub|hub]] of the [[Flag carrier|national airline]] of Morocco, [[Royal Air Maroc]].]]
Casablanca's main airport is [[Mohammed V International Airport]], Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve [[Marrakech]], [[Rabat]], [[Agadir]], [[Oujda]], [[Tangier]], Al Hoceima, and [[Laayoune]], as well as other cities.

Casablanca is well-served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. [[New York City]], [[Montreal]], [[Paris]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[London]] and [[Dubai]] are important primary destinations.

The older, smaller [[Casablanca-Anfa Airport]] to the west of the city, served certain destinations including [[Damascus]], and [[Tunis]], and was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It has been closed and destroyed to build the &quot;[[Casablanca Finance City]]&quot;, the new heart of the city of Casablanca. [[Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport]] is located in the nearby community of [[Tit Mellil]].

=== Coach buses ===
[[Compagnie de Transports au Maroc|''Compagnie de Transports au Maroc'']] ([[Compagnie de Transports au Maroc|CTM]]) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the [[Central Market (Casablanca)|Central Market]] in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of [[ONCF]], also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supratours.ma/en/|title=Page d'accueil|website=www.supratours.ma|access-date=2020-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the [[Wilad Zian Bus Station]]; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/casablanca/transport/getting-there-away/land|title=Land transport in Casablanca|last=Planet|first=Lonely|website=Lonely Planet|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hespress.com/regions/445016.html|title=مشاكل &quot;محطة أولاد زيان&quot; تشغل جماعة البيضاء|website=Hespress|language=ar|access-date=2020-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxis ===
{{See also|Taxicabs of Morocco}}
[[File:Grand Taxi in Centre Ville Casablanca.jpg|thumb|A grand taxi of Casablanca parked on Rue Chaouia.]]
Registered [[Taxicab|taxis]] in Casablanca are coloured red and known as ''petit taxis'' (small taxis), or coloured white and known as ''grands taxis'' (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, ''petits taxis,'' typically small-four door [[Dacia Logan]], [[Peugeot 207]], or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. ''Grands taxis,'' generally older [[Mercedes-Benz]] sedans, provide shared [[mini-bus]] like service within the city on predefined routes, or shared intercity service. ''Grands taxis'' may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.

=== Trains ===
Casablanca is served by three main railway stations run by the national rail service, the [[ONCF]].

[[File:الطرامواي أمام محطة الدار البيضاء المسافري.jpeg|thumb|left|A tram on Casablanca's T1 line passes in front of [[Casa-Voyageurs railway station]].]]{{stnlnk|Casa-Voyageurs}} is the main intercity station, from which trains run south to [[Marrakech]] or [[El Jadida]] and north to [[Mohammedia]] and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or [[Meknes]], [[Fes]], Taza and [[Oujda]]/[[Nador]]. It also serves as the southern terminus of the [[Al-Boraq]] high speed line from Tangier. A dedicated airport shuttle service to [[Mohammed V International Airport]] also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.
[[File:Plan-global-transport-Casa2022.png|link=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Plan-global-transport-Casa2022.png|right|thumb|300x300px|Projected plan of the Casablanca Tramway network in conjunction with [[commuter rail]] and [[Bus rapid transit|rapid transit buses]] for the period 2022-2030 (presented February 2017).]]
{{stnlnk|Casa-Port}} serves primarily commuter trains such as the [[Train Navette Rapide]] (TNR or Aouita) operating on the Casablanca – [[Kenitra]] rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark [[Casablanca Twin Center]]. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction, the station is still operational. From 2013, it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the [[Casablanca Tramway|city's new tram network]].

[[Oasis railway station|Casa-Oasis]] was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early 21st century, and officially reopened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern intercity train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to intercity standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.

[[File:Casablanca, title.JPG|thumb|''Casablanca'', an American romantic drama film directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]]]
* The 1942 film ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (starring [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]]) is supposed to have been set in Casablanca, although it was filmed entirely in [[Los Angeles]] and doesn't feature a single Arab or North African character with a speaking role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|format=|author1=Epstein, Julius J. |author2=Epstein, Philip G. |author3=Koch, Howard |author4=Burnett, Murray |author5=Alison, Joan |author6=Edeson, Arthur |author7=Steiner, Max |author8=Curtiz, Michael |author9=Bogart, Humphrey |author10=Bergman, Ingrid |author11=Henreid, Paul|title=Casablanca|date=2015|publisher=Menart Records|oclc=922863437|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film depicts Casablanca as the scene of a power struggle between competing European powers, which had much more to do with the Tangier of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://legation.ipower.com/blog/?p=270|title=When Tangier Was Casablanca: Rick’s Café &amp; Dean’s Bar|date=2011-10-21|website=Tangier American Legation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has achieved worldwide popularity since its release. Nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]], it won three, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].
*''[[A Night in Casablanca]]'' (1946) was the 12th [[Marx Brothers]]' movie. The film stars [[Groucho Marx]], [[Chico Marx]], and [[Harpo Marx]]. It was directed by [[Archie Mayo]] and written by [[Joseph Fields]] and Roland Kibbee. The film contains the song &quot;[[Who's Sorry Now?]]&quot;, with music by [[Ted Snyder]] and lyrics by [[Bert Kalmar]] and [[Harry Ruby]]. It is sung in French by [[Lisette Verea]] playing the part of Beatrice Rheiner, and then later sung in English. [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s &quot;[[Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2]]&quot; is played twice, once by Chico on piano as an introduction to the &quot;[[Beer Barrel Polka]]&quot;, and again by Harpo on the harp.
* The city is featured in ''[[The Mysterious Caravan]]'' (1975), volume 54 in the original [[The Hardy Boys|Hardy Boys]] series.
* Casablanca is the setting for several chapters in ''[[Doubleshot]]'', a 2000 [[James Bond]] novel by [[Raymond Benson]]. In the novel, one of the characters mentions that the 1942 film was shot in Hollywood and not on location.
* Casablanca is one of the key locations in the 2006 video game ''[[Dreamfall]]'', as it is where the primary protagonist of the game, [[Zoë Castillo]], lives. Although the city is imagined in the year 2219, much of the present-day architecture is used for inspiration.
* Casablanca is the setting for the first act of the 2016 World War II romantic thriller film ''[[Allied (film)|Allied]]'' starring [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Marion Cotillard]].
