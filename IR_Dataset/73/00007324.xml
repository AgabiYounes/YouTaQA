A '''crucifix''' (from [[Latin]] ''cruci fixus'' meaning &quot;(one) fixed to a cross&quot;) is an image of [[Jesus]] on the [[Christian cross|cross]], as distinct from a bare cross. The representation of Jesus himself on the cross is referred to in English as the ''corpus'' (Latin for &quot;body&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QQAVYr2Lc-YC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=crucifix+corpus&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=crucifix%20corpus&amp;f=false Rufolf Distelberger, ''Western Decorative Arts'' (National Gallery of Art 1993), p. 15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrVDmaXP6HEC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=crucifix+corpus&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=crucifix%20corpus&amp;f=false Paul F.

The crucifix is a principal symbol for many groups of [[Christians]], and one of the most common forms of the [[Crucifixion in the arts]]. It is especially important in the [[Latin Church|Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but is also used in the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian]], and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], as well as by the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oslchibbing.org/?page_id=43 Our Savior's Lutheran Church, &quot;Sanctuary and Chapel&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stjohnlcmstopeka.org/AltarCrucifix.html St. John's Lutheran Church of Topeka, KS, &quot;The Altar Crucifix&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619074528/http://www.stjohnlcmstopeka.org/AltarCrucifix.html |date=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol is less common in churches of other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]], which prefer to use a cross without the figure of Jesus (the ''corpus''). The crucifix emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice—his death by [[crucifixion]], which Christians believe brought about the redemption of mankind. Most crucifixes portray Jesus on a [[Latin cross]], rather than any other shape, such as a [[Cross of Tau|Tau cross]] or a [[Coptic cross]].

Western crucifixes usually have a three-dimensional ''corpus'', but in Eastern Orthodoxy Jesus' body is normally painted on the cross, or in low [[relief]]. Strictly speaking, to be a crucifix, the cross must be three-dimensional, but this distinction is not always observed.  An entire painting of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] including a landscape background and other figures is not a crucifix either.

Large crucifixes high across the central axis of a church are known by the [[Old English]] term [[rood]]. By the late [[Middle Ages]] these were a near-universal feature of Western churches, but are now very rare. Modern Roman Catholic churches often have a crucifix above the [[altar]] on the wall; for the celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], the [[Roman Rite]] of the Catholic Church requires that &quot;on or close to the altar there is to be a cross with a figure of Christ crucified&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Resources/GIRM/Documents/GIRM.pdf General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 117.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Chancel of Trinity Lutheran Church on Holy Saturday.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A crucifix in the [[chancel]] of a [[Lutheran]] church.]]
The standard, four-pointed Latin crucifix consists of an upright post or ''stipes'' and a single crosspiece to which the sufferer's arms were nailed. There may also be a short projecting [[Titulus (inscription)|nameplate]], showing the letters [[INRI]] (Greek: INBI).  The [[Russian Orthodox]] crucifix usually has an additional third crossbar, to which the feet are nailed, and which is angled upward toward the penitent thief [[Saint Dismas]] (to the viewer's left) and downward toward the impenitent thief [[Gestas]] (to the viewer's right).  The corpus of Eastern crucifixes is normally a two-dimensional or [[low relief]] [[icon]] that shows Jesus as already dead, his face peaceful and somber.  They are rarely three-dimensional figures as in the Western tradition, although these may be found where Western influences are strong, but are more typically icons painted on a piece of wood shaped to include the double-barred cross and perhaps the edge of Christ's hips and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and no background.  More sculptural small crucifixes in metal [[relief]] are also used in Orthodoxy (see gallery examples), including as [[pectoral cross]]es and [[blessing cross]]es.

Western crucifixes may show Christ dead or alive, the presence of the spear wound in his ribs traditionally indicating that he is dead.  In either case his face very often shows his suffering.  In Orthodoxy he has normally been shown as dead since around the end of the period of [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gertrud Schiller|Schiller, Gertrud]], ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II'', 1972 (English trans from German) Lund Humphries, London, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern crucifixes have Jesus' two feet nailed side by side, rather than crossed one above the other, as Western crucifixes have shown them since around the 13th century. The [[crown of thorns]] is also generally absent in Eastern crucifixes, since the emphasis is not on Christ's suffering, but on his triumph over sin and death. The &quot;S&quot;-shaped position of Jesus' body on the cross is a [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] innovation of the late 10th century,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; though also found in the German [[Gero Cross]] of the same date.  Probably more from Byzantine influence, it spread elsewhere in the West, especially to [[Italy]], by the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, though it was more usual in painting than sculpted crucifixes. It's in Italy that the emphasis was put on Jesus' suffering and realistic details, during a process of general humanization of Christ favored by the [[Franciscan|Franciscan order]]. During the 13th century the suffering Italian model (''Christus patiens'') triumphed over the traditional Byzantine one (''Christus gloriosus'') anywhere in Europe also due to the works of artists such as [[Giunta Pisano]] and [[Cimabue]]. Since the Renaissance the &quot;S&quot;-shape is generally much less pronounced.  Eastern Christian blessing crosses will often have the Crucifixion depicted on one side, and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] on the other, illustrating the understanding of [[Orthodox theology]] that the Crucifixion and Resurrection are two intimately related aspects of the same act of salvation.

Another, symbolic, depiction shows a triumphant Christ ({{lang-la|Christus triumphans}}), clothed in robes, rather than stripped as for His execution, with arms raised, appearing to rise up from the cross, sometimes accompanied by &quot;rays of light&quot;, or an [[Halo (religious iconography)|aureole]] encircling His Body. He may be robed as a [[prophet]], [[crown (headgear)|crown]]ed as a [[king]], and vested in a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] as [[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament#High Priest .7C Chief Priest|Great High Priest]].

On some crucifixes a skull and crossbones are shown below the corpus, referring to Golgotha ([[Calvary]]), the site at which Jesus was crucified, which the Gospels say means in Hebrew &quot;the place of the skull.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In fact this is clearly [[Aramaic]] rather than Hebrew. 'Gûlgaltâ' is the Aramaic for 'skull'. The name appears in all of the gospels except Luke, which calls the place simply Kranion 'the Skull', with no Aramaic. See [[Aramaic of Jesus]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval tradition held that it was the burial-place of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], and that the cross of Christ was raised directly over Adam's skull, so many crucifixes manufactured in Catholic countries still show the skull and crossbones below the corpus.

Very large crucifixes have been built, the largest being the [[Cross in the Woods]] in Michigan, with a {{convert|31|ft|m}} high statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Worlds Largest Crucifixion|url=http://www.fishweb.com/maps/cheboygan/indianriver/shrine/index.html|work=Michigan Interactive|publisher=Michigan Interactive|accessdate=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Prayer in front of a crucifix, which is seen as a [[Sacramentals|sacramental]], is often part of devotion for Christians, especially those worshipping in a church, also privately. The person may sit, stand, or kneel in front of the crucifix, sometimes looking at it in contemplation, or merely in front of it with head bowed or eyes closed. During the Middle Ages small crucifixes, generally hung on a wall, became normal in the personal cells or living quarters first of monks, then all clergy, followed by the homes of the [[laity]], spreading down from the top of society as these became cheap enough for the average person to afford. Most towns had a large crucifix erected as a monument, or some other shrine at the crossroads of the town.  By the 19th century displaying a crucifix somewhere in the general reception areas of a house became typical of Catholic homes. Richer Catholics could afford a room set aside for a chapel.

[[Roman Catholic]] (both Eastern and Western), Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Anglican and Lutheran Christians generally use the crucifix in public religious services. They believe use of the crucifix is in keeping with the statement by Saint Paul in Scripture, &quot;we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Cor|1:23-24|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West [[altar cross]]es and [[processional cross]]es began to be crucifixes in the 11th century, which became general around the 14th century, as they became cheaper. The [[Roman Rite]] requires that &quot;either on the altar or near it, there is to be a cross, with the figure of Christ crucified upon it, a cross clearly visible to the assembled people. It is desirable that such a cross should remain near the altar even outside of liturgical celebrations, so as to call to mind for the faithful the saving [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] of the Lord.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 308&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement of the altar cross was also mentioned in pre-1970 editions of the [[Roman Missal]],&lt;ref&gt;''Rubricae generales Missalis'', XX&lt;/ref&gt; though not in the original 1570 Roman Missal of [[Pope Pius V]].&lt;ref&gt;Manlio Sodi, Achille Maria Triacca, ''Missale Romanum: Editio Princeps (1570)'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1998 {{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; The Rite of Funerals says that the Gospel Book, the Bible, or a cross (which will generally be in crucifix form) may be placed on the coffin for a [[Requiem Mass]], but a second standing cross is not to be placed near the coffin if the altar cross can be easily seen from the body of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Rite of Funerals, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Christian liturgical processions called [[crucession]]s {{citation needed|date=March 2016}} include a cross or crucifix at their head. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the crucifix is often placed above the [[iconostasis]] in the church. In the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] a large crucifix (&quot;[[Golgotha]]&quot;) is placed behind the [[Holy Table]] (altar). During [[Matins]] of [[Good Friday]], a large crucifix is taken in procession to the centre of the church, where it is venerated by the faithful. Sometimes the ''soma'' (corpus) is removable and is taken off the crucifix at [[Vespers]] that evening during the [[Gospel]] lesson describing the [[Descent from the Cross]]. The empty cross may then remain in the centre of the church until the [[Paschal vigil]] (local practices vary). The [[blessing cross]] which the [[priest]] uses to bless the faithful at the [[benediction|dismissal]] will often have the crucifix on one side and an [[icon]] of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] on the other, the side with the Resurrection being used on Sundays and during [[Paschaltide]], and the crucifix on other days.

[[Exorcist]] [[Gabriele Amorth]] has stated that the crucifix is one of the most effective means of averting or opposing [[demons]]. In folklore, it is believed to ward off [[vampires]], [[incubi]], [[succubi]], and other evils.

Modern [[Iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] have used an inverted (upside-down) crucifix when showing disdain for [[Jesus Christ]] or the [[Catholic Church]] which believes in [[Divinity of Jesus|his divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucifer Rising: A Book of Sin, Devil Worship and Rock n' Roll (Nemesis, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Christian tradition]], [[Saint Peter]] was [[martyr]]ed by being [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]].&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Heinrich and Sprenger, James (1486), Summers, Montague (translator - 1928), ''The Malleus Maleficarum''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:Kirche Oberwiesenthal Kruzifixe.jpg|right|thumb|Unlike many other [[Protestants]], [[Lutheran]]s retained the use of the crucifix, Martin Luther church in [[Oberwiesenthal]], Germany ]]

=== Protestant Reformation ===
The Lutheran Churches retained the use of the crucifix, &quot;justifying &quot;their continued use of medieval crucifixes with the same arguments employed since the Middle Ages, as is evident from the example of the altar of the Holy Cross in the Cistercian church of Doberan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MarquardtJordan2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marquardt|first1=Janet T.|last2=Jordan|first2=Alyce A.|title=Medieval Art and Architecture after the Middle Ages|date=14 January 2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443803984|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] did not object to them, and this was among his differences with [[Andreas Karlstadt]] as early as 1525. At the time of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Luther retained the crucifix in the Lutheran Church and they remain the center of worship in Lutheran parishes across Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;LyonsO'Connor2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Mary Ann|last2=O'Connor|first2=Thomas|title=The Ulster Earls and Baroque Europe: Refashioning Irish Identities, 1600-1800|year=2010|publisher=Four Courts Press|language=English|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, however, Lutheranism came under the influence of Calvinism, and the plain cross came to be used in many churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.trinitycamphill.org/ArtsandMusic/Arts/ChristusRex/ChristusRex.htm |title=HOME |access-date=2 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011650/http://www.trinitycamphill.org/ArtsandMusic/Arts/ChristusRex/ChristusRex.htm |archive-date=1 August 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the practice of the Lutheran Churches, the early [[Reformed Church]]es rejected the use of the crucifix, and indeed the unadorned cross, along with other traditional religious imagery, as idolatrous.&lt;ref name=&quot;ObelkevichRoper2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Obelkevich|first1=James|last2=Roper|first2=Lyndal|title=Disciplines of Faith: Studies in Religion, Politics and Patriarchy|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781136820793|page=548|quote=The Calvinizers sought to remove the crucifix as idolatrous.

These disappeared under her successor, [[James I]], and their brief re-appearance in the early 1620s when James' heir was seeking a Spanish marriage was the subject of rumour and close observation by both Catholics and Protestants; when the match fell through they disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Tyacke, Nicholas in Lake, Peter and Questier, Michael C.; ''Conformity and orthodoxy in the English church, c. 1560-1660'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2000, {{ISBN|0-85115-797-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-85115-797-9}}, pp. 29–32&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a mother accused her daughter's school in [[Derby]], [[England]], of discriminating against Christians after the teenager was suspended for refusing to take off a [[crucifix necklace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504822/School-ban-on-girl-wearing-cross-%27discriminatory%27.html The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

A British [[prison]] ordered a multi-faith chapel to remove all crucifixes &quot;in case it offends Muslims.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/3775702/Prison-chapel-not-to-have-a-crucifix.html Prison chapel not to have a crucifix ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 in [[Spain]], a local judge ordered crucifixes removed from public schools to settle a decades-old dispute over whether crucifixes should be displayed in public buildings in a non-confessional state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120903174347/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/europe/features/article_1446455.php/&amp;quotWar_of_crucifix%22_questions_Catholic_predominance_in_Spain__Feature__ Monster and Critics]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 18 March 2011, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the ''[[Lautsi v. Italy]]'' case, that the requirement in Italian law that crucifixes be displayed in classrooms of state schools does not violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=open&amp;documentId=883171&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Press release of the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/echr/resources/hudoc/lautsi_and_others_v__italy.pdf Full text of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://religionclause.blogspot.com/2011/03/european-courts-grand-chamber-upholds.html Summary of the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; Crucifixes are common in most other Italian official buildings, including [[law court|courts of law]].

On 24 March 2011, the [[Constitutional Court of Peru]] ruled that the presence of crucifixes in courts of law does not violate the secular nature of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/peru-court-upholds-presence-of-crucifix-in-public-places/ Peru court upholds presence of crucifix in public places]&lt;/ref&gt;
