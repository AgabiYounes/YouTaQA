'''Hanukkah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑː|n|ə|k|ə}} {{respell|HAH|nə-kə}}; {{lang-he-n|חֲנֻכָּה}} ''{{transl|he|ḥanuká}}'', [[Tiberian Hebrew|Tiberian]]: ''{{transl|he|ḥanuká}}'', usually spelled {{lang|he|חֲנוּכָּה|rtl=yes}}, pronounced {{IPA-he|χanuˈka|}} in [[Modern Hebrew]], {{IPA-he|ˈχanukə|}} or {{IPA-he|ˈχanikə|}} in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]; a transliteration also [[romanized]] as '''Chanukah''' or '''Ḥanukah''') is a [[Jewish holidays|Jewish festival]] commemorating the rededication of the [[Second Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] at the time of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. It is also known as the '''Festival of Lights''' ({{Lang-he-n|חַג הַאוּרִים}}, ''{{transl|he|ḥag ha'urim}}'').

Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days, starting on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] according to the [[Hebrew calendar]], which may occur at any time from late November to late December in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a [[candelabra|candelabrum]] with nine branches, called a [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] (or hanukkiah). One branch is typically placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the ''[[gabbai|shamash]]'' ({{lang-he|שַׁמָּשׁ}}, &quot;attendant&quot;). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the ''shamash'' until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/103868/jewish/How-to-Light-the-Menorah.htm |title=How to Light the Menorah |website=[[chabad.org]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605032624/http://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/103868/jewish/How-to-Light-the-Menorah.htm |archive-date=5 June 2017 |url-status=live |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Hanukkah festivities include playing the game of [[Hanukkah#Dreidel|dreidel]] and eating oil-based foods, such as [[latke]]s and [[sufganiyot]], and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide [[Chabad]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joi.org/bloglinks/JTA%20NEWS%20Chanuka%20Chabad.htm|title=JTA NEWS|website=Joi.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006034939/http://joi.org/bloglinks/JTA%20NEWS%20Chanuka%20Chabad.htm|archivedate=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere among secular Jews as a Jewish alternative to Christmas, and is often celebrated correspondingly fervently.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChristmasEffect&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moyer |first1=Justin |title=The Christmas effect: How Hanukkah became a big holiday |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-christmas-effect-how-hanukkah-became-a-big-holiday/2011/12/20/gIQAt944BP_story.html |accessdate=30 December 2019 |work=Washington Post |date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Hanukkah&quot; derives from the Hebrew verb &quot;{{lang|he|חנך|rtl=yes}}&quot;, meaning &quot;to dedicate&quot;. On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/religion/judaism/hanukkah.shtml|title=Hanukkah|date=2014-12-17|accessdate=2019-05-12|last=|first=|work=bbc.co.uk|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226134101/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/religion/judaism/hanukkah.shtml|archivedate=2018-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Being Jewish: The Spiritual and Cultural Practice of Judaism Today|last=Goldman|first=Ari L.|year=2000|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82389-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/beingjewishspiri00gold/page/141 141]|url=https://archive.org/details/beingjewishspiri00gold/page/141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many [[Homiletics|homiletical]] explanations have been given for the name:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://torah.org/interest/originchanukah/ |title=Origin of the Name Chanukah |first=Nosson |last=Scherman |publisher=Torah.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207031405/http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/originchanukah.html |archivedate=7 December 2012 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name can be broken down into {{lang|he|חנו כ&quot;ה}}, &quot;[they] rested [on the] twenty-fifth&quot;, referring to the fact that the Jews ceased fighting on the 25th day of [[Kislev]], the day on which the holiday begins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nissim of Gerona|Ran]] Shabbat 9b ({{cite web|url= http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14314&amp;pgnum=542 |title=Hebrew text |accessdate=6 October 2018}})&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{lang|he|חנוכה|rtl=yes}} (Hanukkah) is also the Hebrew [[acronym]] for {{lang|he|'''ח''' '''נ'''רות '''ו'''הלכה '''כ'''בית '''ה'''לל}}&amp;nbsp;– &quot;Eight candles, and the [[halakha]] is like the House of Hillel&quot;. This is a reference to the disagreement between two rabbinical schools of thought – the [[Hillel the Elder|House of Hillel]] and the [[Shammai|House of Shammai]] – on the proper order in which to light the Hanukkah flames. Shammai opined that eight candles should be lit on the first night, seven on the second night, and so on down to one on the last night (because the miracle was greatest on the first day). Hillel argued in favor of starting with one candle and lighting an additional one every night, up to eight on the eighth night (because the miracle grew in greatness each day). [[Jewish law]] adopted the position of Hillel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/holidays/chanukah/laws/|title=The Lights of Chanukah: Laws and Customs|publisher=Orthodox Union|date=9 April 2014|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative spellings ===
[[File:Hanukkah.png|thumb|Spelling variations due to transliteration of Hebrew ''Ḥet Nun Vav Kaf Hey'']]
In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], the word Hanukkah is written {{Hebrew|חֲנֻכָּה}} or {{Hebrew|חֲנוּכָּה}} ({{transl|he|Ḥănukkāh}}). It is most commonly [[transliteration|transliterated]] to English as ''Hanukkah'' or ''{{transl|he|Chanukah}}''. The former spelling (''Hanukkah''), which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the word's correct spelling in Hebrew,&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forward.com/opinion/148856/yes-virginia-hanukkah-has-a-correct-spelling/|title=Yes, Virginia, Hanukkah Has a Correct Spelling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3636698/right-spelling-hanukkah-chanukah-hannukah/|title=Is There a Right Way to Spell Hanukkah? Chanukah? Hannukah?|website=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the preferred choice of [[Merriam–Webster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Hanukkah|title=Definition of HANUKKAH|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'', the ''[[Hart's Rules|Oxford Style Manual]]'', and the style guides of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2012/dec/07/hanukah-chanukah-chutzpah-embrace-yiddish|title=Hanukah or Chanukah? Have the chutzpah to embrace Yiddish|first=Harriet|last=Powney|date=7 December 2012|newspaper=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound represented by ''Ch'' ({{IPAblink|χ}}, similar to the [[Scots language|Scottish]] pronunciation of ''[[loch]]'') is not native to the English language.&lt;ref&gt;Its use in transliteration of Hebrew into English is based on influences of Yiddish and German, particularly since transliteration into German tended to be earlier than transliteration into English.  See {{slink|Romanization of Hebrew|How to transliterate}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the letter ''[[heth|ḥeth]]'' ({{lang|he|ח|rtl=yes}}), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew ([[voiceless uvular fricative]]) from in classical Hebrew ([[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]] {{IPAblink|ħ}}), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. However, its original sound is closer to the English ''H'' than to the Scottish ''Ch'', and ''Hanukkah'' more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet.&lt;ref name=forward/&gt; Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is [[geminate]] in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal {{transl|he|Ḥeth}} can lead to the spelling ''Hanukkah'', while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular {{transl|he|Ḥeth}} leads to the spelling {{transl|he|Chanukah}}.

== Historical sources ==
=== Books of Maccabees===
The story of Hanukkah is preserved in the books of the [[First Maccabees|First]] and [[Second Maccabees]], which describe in detail the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the [[menorah (Temple)|menorah]]. These books are not part of the [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|canonized]] [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible) used by modern Jews, though the Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider them part of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxchristian.info/pages/old_testament.html|title=The Old Testament in the Orthodox Church|website=OrthodoxChristian.info|last=Stergiou|first=Fr. R.|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in {{bibleverse||1 Maccabees|4:36–4:59|NRSVCE}}, though the name of the festival and the miracle of the lights do not appear here. A story similar in character, and older in date, is the one alluded to in {{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:18–1:36|NRSVCE}} according to which the relighting of the altar fire by [[Nehemiah]] was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}  The above account in 1 Maccabees 4, as well as {{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:9|NRSVCE}} portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths ([[Sukkot]])&quot;; similarly {{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|10:6|NRSVCE}} explains the length of the feast as &quot;in the manner of the Feast of Booths&quot;.

=== Early rabbinic sources ===
{{See also|Mishnah#Omissions}}

[[Megillat Taanit]] (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, &quot;On the 25th of [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize&quot; but gives no further details.

The [[Mishna]] (late 2nd century) mentions Hanukkah in several places,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bikkurim.1.6?lang=he Bikkurim 1:6], [https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.1.3?lang=he Rosh HaShanah 1:3], [https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Taanit.2.10 Taanit 2:10], Megillah [https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Megillah.3.4 3:4] and [https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Megillah.3.4 3:6], [https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Moed_Katan.3.9 Moed Katan 3:9], and [https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.6.6? Bava Kama 6:6]&lt;/ref&gt; but never describes its laws in detail and never mentions any aspect of the history behind it. To explain the Mishna's lack of a systematic discussion of Hanukkah, [[Nissim Ben Jacob|Rav Nissim Gaon]] postulated that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it.&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Hakdamah Le'mafteach Hatalmud''&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholar [[Reuvein Margolies]] suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the [[Bar Kochba revolt]], its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;''Yesod Hamishna Va'arichatah'' pp. 25–28 ({{cite web|url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20976&amp;pgnum=24|title=Hebrew text|accessdate=6 October 2018}})&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanukkah2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hanukkah lamp unearthed near Jerusalem about 1900]]

The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is first described in the [[Talmud]], committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dolanksy|first=Shawna|title=The Truth(s) About Hanukkah|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shawna-dolansky/the-truth-about-hanukah_b_1165708.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=23 December 2011|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]] says that after the forces of [[Antiochus IV]] had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still [[seal (device)|sealed]] by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]], with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.21b.10?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en Shabbat 21b]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Talmud presents three options:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.21b|title=Babylonian Talmud: Shabbath 21b|website=sefaria.org|publisher=[[Sefaria]]|accessdate=5 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The law requires only one light each night per household,
# A better practice is to light one light each night for each member of the household
# The most preferred practice is to vary the number of lights each night.

Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the [[mezuza]], or in the window closest to the street. [[Rashi]], in a note to ''Shabbat 21b,'' says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate ''Succah,'' p.&amp;nbsp;46a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.46a.8?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=bi|title=Sukkah 46a:8|website=www.sefaria.org|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Section from Aramaic Scroll of Antiochus, April 2015.jpg|thumb|right|Section from the Aramaic Scroll of Antiochus in [[Babylonian supralinear punctuation]], with an Arabic translation]]

[[Megillat Antiochus]] (probably composed in the 2nd century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Benjamin|last=Zvieli|title=The Scroll of Antiochus|url= http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/miketz/zev.html| access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) concludes with the following words:

{{Quote|...After this, the sons of Israel went up to the Temple and rebuilt its gates and purified the Temple from the dead bodies and from the defilement. And they sought after pure [[olive oil]] to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of Ḥashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=מגלת בני חשמונאי|trans-title=Sefer Ha-Tiklāl (Tiklal Qadmonim)|last=Hubarah|first=Yosef|year=1964|publisher=Jerusalem|pages=75b–79b}} Original Aramaic text:&lt;div lang=&quot;arc&quot; lang=&quot;arc&quot; dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt;בָּתַר דְּנָּא עָלוּ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל לְבֵית מַקְדְּשָׁא וּבְנוֹ תַּרְעַיָּא וְדַכִּיאוּ בֵּית מַקְדְּשָׁא מִן קְטִילַיָּא וּמִן סְאוֹבֲתָא. וּבעוֹ מִשְׁחָא דְּזֵיתָא דָּכְיָא לְאַדְלָקָא בּוֹצִנַיָּא וְלָא אַשְׁכַּחוּ אֵלָא צְלוֹחִית חֲדָא דַּהֲוָת חֲתִימָא בְּעִזְקָת כָּהֲנָא רַבָּא מִיּוֹמֵי שְׁמוּאֵל נְבִיָּא וִיַדְעוּ דְּהִיא דָּכְיָא. בְּאַדְלָקוּת יוֹמָא חֲדָא הֲוָה בַּהּ וַאֲלָה שְׁמַיָּא דִּי שַׁכֵין שְׁמֵיהּ תַּמָּן יְהַב בַּהּ בִּרְכְּתָא וְאַדְלִיקוּ מִנַּהּ תְּמָנְיָא יוֹמִין. עַל כֵּן קַיִּימוּ בְּנֵי חַשְׁמוּנַּאי הָדֵין קְיָימָא וַאֲסַרוּ הָדֵין אֲסָּרָא אִנּוּן וּבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל כּוּלְּהוֹן. לְהוֹדָעָא לִבְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל לְמֶעֲבַד הָדֵין תְּמָנְיָא יוֹמִין חַדְוָא וִיקָר כְּיּוֹמֵי מוֹעֲדַיָּא דִּכְתִיבִין בְּאוֹרָיְתָא לְאַדְלָקָא בְּהוֹן לְהוֹדָעָא לְמַן דְּיֵּיתֵי מִבַּתְרֵיהוֹן אֲרֵי עֲבַד לְהוֹן אֱלָהֲהוֹן פּוּרְקָנָא מִן שְׁמַיָּא. בְּהוֹן לָא לְמִסְפַּד וְלָא לְמִגְזַר צוֹמָא וְכָל דִּיהֵי עֲלוֹהִי נִדְרָא יְשַׁלְּמִנֵּיהּ&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Al HaNissim]] prayer is recited on Hanukkah as an addition to the [[Amidah]] prayer, which was formalized in the late 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Berachot 28a&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al HaNissim'' describes the history of the holiday as follows:

:In the days of [[Mattathias|Mattiyahu]] ben Yohanan, high priest, the [[Hasmoneans|Hasmonean]] and his sons, when the evil Greek kingdom stood up against Your people Israel, to cause them to forget Your Torah and abandon the ways You desire – You, in Your great mercy, stood up for them in their time of trouble; You fought their fight, You judged their judgment, You took their revenge; You delivered the mighty into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of the few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the evil into the hands of the righteous, the sinners into the hands of those who engaged in Your Torah; You made yourself a great and holy name in Your world, and for Your people Israel You made great redemption and salvation as this very day. And then Your sons came to the inner chamber of Your house, and cleared Your Temple, and purified Your sanctuary, and lit candles in Your holy courtyards, and established eight days of Hanukkah for thanksgiving and praise to Your holy name.

=== Narrative of Josephus ===
The Jewish historian [[Josephus|Titus Flavius Josephus]] narrates in his book, [[Antiquities of the Jews|Jewish Antiquities]] XII, how the victorious [[Judas Maccabeus]] ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Josephus|access-date=6 October 2018|title=Jewish Antiquities|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/josephus-jewish_antiquities/1930/pb_LCL365.167.xml?result=2&amp;rskey=cyZg7g |doi=10.4159/DLCL.josephus-jewish_antiquities.1930|year=1930}} {{Subscription needed|via=[[Loeb Classical Library|digital Loeb Classical Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the &quot;Festival of Lights&quot;:

:Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city [[Beth-zur|Bethsura]], that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=J.+AJ+12.287 Perseus.tufts.edu], ''Jewish Antiquities'' xii. 7, § 7, #323&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ancient sources ===

In the [[New Testament]], [[Gospel of John|John]] 10:22–23 says, &quot;Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and [[Jesus]] was in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temple]] courts walking in [[Solomon's Porch|Solomon’s Colonnade]]&quot; (NIV). The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as &quot;the renewals&quot; or &quot;the consecrations&quot; (Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ''ta enkaínia'').&lt;ref&gt;This is the first reference to the Feast of Dedication by this name (ta egkainia, ta enkainia [a typical &quot;festive plural&quot;]) in Jewish literature (Hengel 1999: 317). &quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the [[Septuagint]] to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for &quot;consecration&quot; or &quot;dedication&quot; is &quot;Hanukkah&quot; (חנכה). The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word &quot;Khawdata&quot; (a close synonym), which literally means &quot;renewal&quot; or &quot;to make new.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aramaic English New Testament, 3rd Ed.|last=Roth|first=Andrew Gabriel|year=2008|publisher=Netzari Press LLV|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, [[Judaism]] was outlawed. In 167 BCE, [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus]] ordered an altar to [[Zeus]] erected in the Temple. He banned [[brit milah]] (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0148:book=1:section=34|title=''The Wars of the Jews'' i. 34|last=Josephus|first=Flavius|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiochus's actions provoked a large-scale [[Maccabean Revolt|revolt]]. [[Mattathias]] (Mattityahu), a [[Kohen|Jewish priest]], and his five sons [[Johanan Maccabeus|Jochanan]], [[Simon Maccabaeus|Simeon]], [[Eleazar Maccabeus|Eleazar]], [[Jonathan Maccabaeus|Jonathan]], and [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah]] led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24–25&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/1maccabees.html|title=1 Maccabees|website=EarlyJewishWritings.com|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (&quot;Judah the Hammer&quot;). By 166 BCE Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 165 BCE the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/1MA/1MA4.HTM#59|title=1 Macc. iv. 59|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040627184847/http://www.hope.edu/academic/religion/bandstra/BIBLE/1MA/1MA4.HTM|archive-date=27 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made. According to the Talmud, unadulterated and undefiled pure olive oil with the seal of the [[High Priest (Judaism)|kohen gadol]] (high priest) was needed for the menorah in the Temple, which was required to burn throughout the night every night. The story goes that one flask was found with only enough oil to burn for one day, yet it burned for eight days, the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of [[Kashrut|kosher]] oil for the menorah. An eight-day festival was declared by the Jewish sages to commemorate this miracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/605855/jewish/Alls-Well-When-it-Ends.htm|title=All's Well – When it Ends|last=Epstein|first=Baruch|accessdate=6 October 2018|website=Chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the 8-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Hanukkah|daily prayer service]], and a section is added to the [[Birkat Hamazon|blessing after meals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ou.org/holidays/chanukah/chanukah_with_torah_tidbits/ |title=Chanukah with Torah Tidbits |date=29 June 2006|website=OU.org|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanukkah is not a &quot;Sabbath-like&quot; holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath]], as specified in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 670:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChanukahLaws&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ohr.edu/1304|title=The Laws of Chanukah |last=Becher |first=Rabbi Mordechai |website=Ohr.edu|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall.

[[File:PikiWiki Israel 146 Hanukka חנוכה.Jpg|thumb|Boy in front of a menorah]]
[[File:CandlesInTheDark.jpg|thumb|Hanukkah lights in the dark]]
Each night throughout the 8 day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced &quot;beautification&quot; ([[hiddur mitzvah]]) of the [[mitzvah]], the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 671:2&lt;/ref&gt; An extra light called a ''shamash'', meaning &quot;attendant&quot; or &quot;sexton,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/103868/jewish/How-to-Light-the-Menorah.htm |title=How to Light the Menorah – Light Up Your Environment!|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChanukahLaws&quot; /&gt;

Among [[Ashkenazic|Ashkenazim]] the tendency is for every male member of the household (and in many families, girls as well) to light a full set of lights each night,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ou.org/holidays/chanukah/practical-halacha-chanuka/ |title=Halacha L'Maaseh on Chanuka |publisher=Orthodox Union |last=Aiken |first=Richard B. |access-date=6 October 2018|date=2015-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/792891/jewish/Why-Dont-Women-Work-While-the-Chanukah-Candles-Are-Burning.htm |title=Why Don't Women Work While the Chanukah Candles Are Burning? |publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center |last=Posner |first=Menachem |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while among [[Sephardic|Sephardim]] the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hakirah.org/Vol+7+Ajdler.pdf |title=Hakirah Volume 25, Fall 2018 |website=Hakirah.org|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the ''shamash'' is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud,&lt;ref&gt;Tractate Shabbat 21b–23a&lt;/ref&gt; against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the ''shamash'' candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the ''shamash'' candle first and then use it to light the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;lonorw&quot;&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 673:1&lt;/ref&gt; So altogether, including the ''shamash'', two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the ''shamash''). It is Sephardic custom not to light the shamash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shamash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.midrash.org/halakha/hanukkah-how2.html |title=The following is a response from Hakham Ya'aqob Menashe |website=Midrash.org|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lights can be candles or oil lamps.&lt;ref name=&quot;lonorw&quot;/&gt; Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special [[candelabrum]] referred to as either a ''Chanukiah'' (the modern Israeli term) or a ''menorah'' (the traditional name, simply Hebrew for 'lamp'). Many families use an oil lamp (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah. Like the candle Chanukiah, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional ''shamash'' light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/synagogue-resources/wEru2YXmwx/ous-chanukah-guide/ |title=OU's Chanukah Guide|publisher=Orthodox Union|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the [[public sphere]] from the 1970s when Rabbi [[Menachem M. Schneerson]] called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of [[public menorah]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Kosher Christmas: 'Tis the Season to be Jewish|url=https://archive.org/details/kosherchristmast0000plau|url-access=registration|last=Plaut|first=Joshua Eli|year=2012|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/kosherchristmast0000plau/page/167 167]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forward.com/opinion/120124/how-hanukkah-came-to-the-white-house/ |date=2 December 2009 |title=How Hanukkah Came to the White House |last=Sarna |first=Jonathan D. |publisher=Forward |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M.

The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the &quot;lighting of the house within&quot;, but rather for the &quot;illumination of the house without,&quot; so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. that the sole cruse of pure oil found which held enough oil to burn for one night actually burned for eight nights). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some [[Ashkenazi Jews]] to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most [[Sephardi Jews]] light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of [[Antisemitism|antisemitic persecution]] were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in [[Iran|Persia]] under the rule of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the ''[[mezuzah]]'', so that when one passes through the door s/he is surrounded by the holiness of ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' (the [[613 commandments|commandments]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.22a?lang=bi|title=Shabbat 22a|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles &quot;for they too were involved in the miracle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud: Shabbat 23a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=1692 |title=The Obligation of Women Regarding Chanukah Candles |first=Rabbeinu Ovadia |last=Yosef |website=Halachayomit.co.il |date=11 December 2017 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Candle-lighting time ===
[[File:Bialahanukabp.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Biala (Hasidic dynasty)|Biala]] [[Rebbe#The Ḥasidic Rebbe|Rebbe]] lights the menorah]]
Hanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChabadHowTo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/603798/jewish/Chanukah-Guide.htm |title=How to Celebrate Chanukah |quote=[...] the menorah must contain enough fuel at the time of the lighting to burn until 30 minutes after nightfall. |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom of many is to light at sundown, although most Hasidim light later.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChabadHowTo&quot;/&gt; Many Hasidic [[Rebbes]] light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rabbikaganoff.com/some-light-chanukah-questions/ |title=Some Light Chanukah Questions |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChabadHowTo&quot;/&gt; Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on [[Shabbat]] itself, the candles must be lit before sunset.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChabadHowTo&quot;/&gt; However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual,&lt;ref name=&quot;ChabadHowTo&quot;/&gt; followed by the [[Shabbat candles]]. At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before [[Havdalah]] and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/tiferetisraelorg/our-rabbi/halacha-tidbits/ctilawsandcustomsofchanukah-december16-232014 |title=CTI Laws and Customs of Chanukah |date=5 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101233032/https://sites.google.com/site/tiferetisraelorg/our-rabbi/halacha-tidbits/ctilawsandcustomsofchanukah-december16-232014 |archivedate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If for whatever reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChabadHowTo&quot;/&gt; Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://njop.org/resources/holidays/complete-guide-to-holidays/chanukah/what-to-do-on-chanukah/ |title=What to do on Chanukah |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blessings over the candles ===
{{see also|List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Hanukkah}}
Typically two blessings (''brachot''; singular: ''brachah'') are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night, the [[shehecheyanu]] blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 676:1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The blessings are said before or after the candles are lit depending on tradition. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/holidays/chanukah/laws/ |title=The Lights of Chanukah: Laws and Customs |date=9 April 2014 |publisher=Orthodox Union |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Maoz Tzur'' ===
{{Main|Ma'oz Tzur}}
In the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn [[Ma'oz Tzur]] is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in [[Jewish history]], and praises God for survival despite these tragedies ([[the exodus]] from Egypt, the [[Babylonian captivity]], the miracle of the holiday of [[Purim]], the [[Hasmonean]] victory), and a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/holidays/chanukah/maoz_tzur_translation_etc/ |title=Maoz Tzur: Translation &amp; Explanation – Jewish Holidays|date=29 June 2006|publisher=Orthodox Union|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/maoz-tzur-rock-of-ages/ |title=Maoz Tzur: Rock of Ages|work=My Jewish Learning |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other customs ===
After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] and [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardi]] Jews recite [[Psalms]], such as {{bibleverse||Psalm|30|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Psalm|67|HE}}, and {{bibleverse||Psalm|91|HE}}. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give [[tzedakah]] (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=Hanukkah ushers in 'tzedakah,' a religious obligation to do what is right and just|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/12/07/hanukkah-ushers-in-tzedakah-a-religious-obligation-to-do-what-is-right-and-just/|newspaper=The Mercury News|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kveller.com/the-fifth-night-project-teaching-giving-during-hanukkah/ |title=The Fifth Night Project: Teaching Giving During Hanukkah |date=11 December 2012 |last=Maidenberg |first=Rhiana |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special additions to daily prayers ===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=&quot;We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.&quot;|source=Translation of ''Al ha-Nissim''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=New Era Illustrated Magazine|volume=5|year=1905|page=621|via=[[Google Books]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHwpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA621|title=Chanukkah, or the Feast of Dedication|last=Singer|first=Isidore|author-link=Isidore Singer}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An addition is made to the &quot;''hoda'ah''&quot; (thanksgiving) benediction in the [[Amidah]] (thrice-daily prayers), called ''[[Al HaNissim]]'' (&quot;On/about the Miracles&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' ''[[Orach Chayim]]'' 682:1&lt;/ref&gt; This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.&lt;ref name=&quot;ou.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/holidays/chanukah/chanukah_with_torah_tidbits/ |title=Chanukah with Torah Tidbits |date=29 June 2006 |publisher=Orthodox Union |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/al-hanisim-concerning-the-miracles/ |title=Al Hanisim: Concerning the Miracles |last=Nulman |first=Cantor Macy |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the ''[[Hallel]]'' (praise) Psalms ({{bibleverse||Psalm|113|HE}} – {{bibleverse||Psalm|118|HE}}) are sung during each morning service and the ''[[Tachanun]]'' penitential prayers are omitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;ou.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/hashoneh-halachos/tues_02_07_12/ |title=133. Days on Which Tachanun is Omitted |publisher=Orthodox Union |accessdate=6 October 2018 |last=Abramowitz |first=Rabbi Jack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Torah is read every day in the [[shacharit]] morning services in [[synagogue]], on the first day beginning from {{bibleverse||Numbers|6:22|HE}} (according to some customs, {{bibleverse||Numbers|7:1|HE}}), and the last day ending with {{bibleverse||Numbers|8:4|HE}}. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbaths]] (Saturdays). The weekly [[Parsha|Torah portion]] for the first Sabbath is almost always ''[[Miketz]]'', telling of [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s dream and his enslavement in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. The ''[[Haftarah]]'' reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is {{bibleverse||Zechariah|2:14|HE}} – {{bibleverse||Zechariah|4:7|HE}}. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the ''Haftarah'' reading is from {{bibleverse||1Kings|7:40|HE}} – {{bibleverse||1Kings|7:50|HE}}.

The Hanukkah ''menorah'' is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.torahmusings.com/2010/12/chanuka-lighting-in-shul/ |title=Chanuka – Lighting in Shul |website=www.torahmusings.com |date=7 December 2010 |last=Enkin |first=Rabbi Ari |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day.
During the [[Middle Ages]] &quot;[[Megillat Antiochus]]&quot; was read in the [[Italian rite Jews|Italian]] synagogues on Hanukkah just as the [[Book of Esther]] is read on [[Purim]]. It still forms part of the liturgy of the [[Yemenite Jews]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pvgsyw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://customerservant.com/2006/12/16/the-scroll-of-the-hasmoneans/|title=The Scroll Of The Hasmoneans|author=Rahel| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528035707/http://customerservant.com/2006/12/16/the-scroll-of-the-hasmoneans/|archive-date=28 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Zot Hanukkah'' ===
The last day of Hanukkah is known by some as ''Zot Hanukkah'' and by others as ''Chanukat HaMizbeach'', from the verse read on this day in the synagogue {{bibleverse||Numbers|7:84|HE}}, ''Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach'': &quot;This was the dedication of the altar&quot;. According to the teachings of [[Kabbalah]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]], this day is the final &quot;seal&quot; of the High Holiday season of [[Yom Kippur]] and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other ''Gmar chatimah tovah'' (&quot;may you be sealed totally for good&quot;), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/h/c/t/sg/286646391.html |title=Hanukkah's Last Light |last=Gutfreund |first=Sara Debbie |date=23 December 2014 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other related laws and customs ===
It is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChanukahLaws&quot; /&gt;

Latkes are not popular in Israel, as they are more commonly made at home and are an [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] dish. The Sephardi Jews eat [[fritas de prasa]], a similar fried dish made with mashed potato and leek. As the majority of the population in Israel is of [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jewish]] descent, and these groups have their own Hanukkah dishes such as [[fritas de prasa]], [[sfinj]], [[cassola]], and [[shamlias]], among others. Latkes have also been largely replaced by [[sufganiyot]] due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jeffay, Nathan |title=Why Israel is a latke-free zone |url=http://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/food/25127/why-israel-a-latke-free-zone |work=thejc.com |date=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for ''sufganiyot'' besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gur |first=Jana |year=2008 |title=The Book of New Israeli Food: A Culinary Journey |publisher=Schocken |pages=238–243 |isbn=978-0-8052-1224-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, downsized, &quot;mini&quot; sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Love-me-dough |title=Love Me Dough |last=Minsberg |first=Tali |last2=Lidman |first2=Melanie |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2018 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the [[Judith Beheading Holofernes|beheading of Holofernes by Judith]] has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishna Berurah]] 670:2:10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roast goose]] has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Dreidel ===
{{Main|Dreidel}}
[[File:Colorful dreidels2.JPG|thumb|[[Dreidel]]s / [[Top|Spinning tops]] in a Jerusalem market]]
After lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the [[dreidel]]. The dreidel, or ''sevivon'' in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words {{lang|he|נס גדול היה שם|rtl=yes}} ({{lang|he-Latn|'''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''aya '''S'''ham}}, &quot;A great miracle happened there&quot;), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beit Hamikdash]]. The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter {{lang|he|פ|rtl=yes}} ''([[Pe (Semitic letter)|Pe]])'', rendering the acronym {{lang|he|נס גדול היה פה|rtl=yes}} ({{lang|he-Latn|'''N'''es '''G'''adol '''H'''aya '''P'''o}}, &quot;A great miracle happened here&quot;), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent{{when|date=December 2019}} innovation. Stores in [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] neighborhoods sell the traditional ''Shin'' dreidels as well, because they understand &quot;there&quot; to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-origin-of-the-dreidel/ |title=The Surprising Origin of the Dreidel |last=Golinknin |first=Rabbi David |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-gyration-nation-the-weird-ancient-history-of-the-dreidel-1.5344849 |title=Gyration Nation: The Weird Ancient History of the Dreidel |last=Rosenberg |first=Anat |date=14 December 2014 |accessdate=6 October 2018|newspaper=Haaretz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hanukkah gelt ===
{{Main|Hanukkah gelt}}
[[File:Chocolate-Gold-Coins.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hanukkah gelt|Chocolate gelt]]]]
[[Chanukkah gelt]] ([[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] for &quot;Chanukkah money&quot;) known in Israel by the Hebrew translation ''dmei Hanukkah'', is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah ''gelt'' dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One [[minhag]] favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schechter.edu/why-do-we-give-hanukkah-gelt-and-hanukkah-presents/ |title=Why Do We Give Hanukkah Gelt and Hanukkah Presents? |last=Golinkin |first=Rabbi Prof. David |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate=6 October 2018 |publisher=The Schecter Institutes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the [[Halachic]] injunction against handling money on the [[Shabbat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Lebowitz |first1=Rabbi Aryeh |date=11 December 2005 |title=Chanukah Gelt and Gifts |url=http://download.yutorah.org/2015/1083/846556/d-varim-hayotzim-min-halev-miketz.pdf |format=PDF |magazine=Dvarim Hayotzim Min Halev |type=PDF |volume=17 |issue=6 |page=3 |access-date=6 October 2018 |quote=&quot;In fact, the Orchos Rabeinu in cheilek ג teaches that the Steipler Gaon maintained the minhag of giving out Chanukah gelt davka on the fifth night of Chanukah.

=== Hanukkah in the White House ===
{{Main|White House Hanukkah Party}}
[[File:Truman receives menorah.jpg|thumb|President [[Harry S. Truman]] (left, back turned to camera) in the [[Oval Office]], receiving a Hanukkah Menorah as a gift from the Prime Minister of Israel, [[David Ben-Gurion]] (center). To the right is [[Abba Eban]], the Ambassador of Israel to the United States.]]
The United States has a history of recognizing and celebrating Hanukkah in a number of ways. The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] presented United States President [[Harry Truman]] with a Hanukkah Menorah. In 1979 president [[Jimmy Carter]] took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the [[National Menorah]] held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President [[George H.W. Bush]] displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President [[Bill Clinton]] invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse&quot; /&gt;

The [[United States Postal Service]] has released several [[Hanukkah stamps|Hanukkah-themed]] [[postage stamps]]. In 1996 the [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) issued a 32 [[Cent (currency)|cent]] Hanukkah [[Postage stamp|stamp]] as a [[joint issue]] with [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/mfa-archive/1996/pages/israeli-american%20hanukkah%20stamp.aspx |title=Israeli-American Hanukkah Stamp |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=22 October 1996 |access-date=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 after 8 years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2009/pb22267/html/info1_005.htm |title=Stamp Announcement 09-47: Hanukkah |first=United States Postal |last=Service |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House in conjunction with the candle-lighting ceremony, and since then this ceremony has become an annual tradition attended by Jewish leaders from around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefederalist.com/2017/12/11/5-thoughts-furor-white-houses-hanukkah-party/ |title=5 Thoughts On The Furor Over The White House's Hanukkah Party |date=11 December 2017 |website=TheFederalist.com |last=Braunstein |first=Melissa Langsam |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, George Bush linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/12/05/archives-hanukkah-white-house |title=From the Archives: Hanukkah at the White House |date=5 December 2013 |last=Donius |first=Susan K. |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The [[White House]] commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students' school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these &quot;students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That's what the Hanukkah story teaches us. It's what our young people can teach us – that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/hand-in-hand-schools-menorah-lights-up-white-house-hanukkah-party/ |title=Arab–Jewish school's menorah lights up White House Hanukkah party |date=18 December 2014 |last=Ghert-Zand |first=Renee |website=TimesOfIsrael.com |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Angela Warnick Buchdahl]], in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forward.com/opinion/211168/a-most-inspiring-hanukkah-at-the-white-house/ |title=A Most Inspiring Hanukkah at the White House |website=Forward.com |date=18 December 2014 |last=Eisner |first=Jane |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dates ==

The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the [[Hebrew calendar]]. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of [[Kislev]] and concludes on the 2nd or 3rd day of [[Tevet]] (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming:

In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. The last time was 1899; and due to the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-joel-hoffman/hanukkah-and-thanskgiving_b_4312207.html | title=Why Hanukkah and Thanksgiving Will Never Again Coincide |work=Huffington Post |date=24 November 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2018 |last=Hoffman |first=Joel}}&lt;/ref&gt; This convergence prompted the creation of the [[portmanteau]] [[neologism]] [[Thanksgivukkah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jpost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Thanksgivukka-Please-pass-the-turkey-stuffed-doughnuts-331952 |work=The Jerusalem Post |title=Thanksgivukka: Please pass the turkey-stuffed doughnuts |last=Spiro |first=Amy |date=17 November 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/thanksgivukkah |title=How To Celebrate Thanksgivukkah, The Best Holiday Of All Time |last=Byrne |first=Christine |publisher=Buzzfeed |date=2 October 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stu Bykofsky |url=https://www.philly.com/philly/news/20131011_Thanks_for_Thanukkah_.html |title=Thanks for Thanukkah! |publisher=The Inquirer |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jerusalem Hannukah 021210.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Second night of Hannukah at Jerusalem's [[Western Wall]]]]
Major Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/holidays/chanukah/article_cdo/aid/789857/jewish/Chanukah-FAQs.htm#q6 |title=Chanukah FAQs|website=Chabad.org |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism. First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome's grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, as the [[Bar Kochba revolt]] did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hanukkah in America: A History |last=Ashton |first=Dianne |year=2013 |isbn= 978-0-8147-0739-5 |location=New York |publisher=New York University Press |page=29 |url=https://nyupress.org/books/9780814707395/}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, however, these themes were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haberman2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Haberman |first=Bonna |title=Rereading Israel: The Spirit of the Matter |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAG5BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 |date=1 October 2014 |publisher=Urim Publications |isbn=978-965-524-202-7 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berkowitz2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkowitz |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Berkowitz |title=Nationalism, Zionism and Ethnic Mobilization of the Jews in 1900 and Beyond |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1ueQ2-5siUC&amp;pg=PA244 |year=2004 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-13184-2 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carter Menorah.jpg|thumb|upright|US President [[Jimmy Carter]] attends Menorah Lighting, [[President's Park|Lafayette Park]], [[Washington, D.C.]], 1979]]
In North America especially, Hanukkah gained increased importance with many Jewish families in the latter part of the 20th century, including among large numbers of [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]], who wanted a Jewish alternative to the [[Christmas]] celebrations that often overlap with Hanukkah.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChristmasResponse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abramitzky |first1=Ran |last2=Einav |first2=Liran |last3=Rigbi |first3=Oren |title=Is Hanukkah Responsive to Christmas? |journal=The Economic Journal |date=1 June 2010 |volume=120 |issue=545 |pages=612–630 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0297.2009.02305.x |url=https://web.stanford.edu/~leinav/pubs/EJ2010.pdf |accessdate=30 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was traditional among Ashkenazi Jews to give &quot;gelt&quot; or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families this has been supplemented with other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy gifts just as their Christmas-celebrating peers do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hanukkah-gifts/ |title=Hanukkah Gifts |publisher=My Jewish Learning |last=Rosenstock |first=Natasha |date=1 October 2016 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Hanukkah is a relatively minor Jewish holiday, as indicated by the lack of religious restrictions on work other than a few minutes after lighting the candles, in North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to [[Passover]] as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hartman.org.il/Blogs_View.asp?Article_Id=1047 |title=Reinventing Hanukkah: The Israeli Politics of the Maccabean Holiday |last=Zion |first=Noah |publisher=Shalom Hartman Institute |date=4 December 2012 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ChristmasEffect&quot;/&gt;

Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's &quot;miracle of the oil&quot;, emphasizing reflection on [[energy conservation]] and [[North American energy independence|energy independence]]. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theshalomcenter.org/node/1315 |title=The Eight Days of Hanukkah: Eight Actions to Heal the Earth through the Green Menorah Covenant |last=Waskow |first=Rabbi Arthur |publisher=The Shalom Center |date=16 November 2007 |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Gil |url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel/Green-Hanukkia-campaign-sparks-ire |title='Green Hanukkia' Campaign Sparks Ire |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=4 December 2007 |access-date=6 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dobb |first=Rabbi Fred Scherlinder |url=http://coejl.org/advocacy-and-policy-issues/pastcampaigns/cfl-installation-hanukkah/ |title=CFL Hannukah Installation Ceremony |publisher=Coalition on Environment and Jewish Life (COEJL) |date=6 July 2011 |access-date=6 October 2018 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131128174911/http://coejl.org/advocacy-and-policy-issues/pastcampaigns/cfl-installation-hanukkah/ |archivedate=28 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
