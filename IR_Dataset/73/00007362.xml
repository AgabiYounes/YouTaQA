'''Casimir III Piast, the Great''' ({{lang-pl|Kazimierz III Wielki}}; 30 April 1310 – 5 November 1370) reigned as the [[King of Poland]] from 1333 to 1370. He was the third&lt;ref&gt;English, Edward D. (2005). &quot;Casimir III the Great&quot;. ''Encyclopedia of the medieval world.'' Facts On File, New York. p. 156. {{ISBN|0-8160-4690-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|King Władysław I]] (&quot;the Ell-long&quot;) and Duchess [[Jadwiga of Kalisz]], and the last Polish king from the [[Piast dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lerski&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=luRry4Y5NIYC&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;ots=jQWOYd3L6Z&amp;dq=Casimir%20III%20the%20Great&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q=Casimir%20III%20the%20Great&amp;f=false|title=Casimir III the Great|publisher=ABC-CLIO Press|work=Historical Dictionary of Poland, 966–1945|year=1996|accessdate=8 September 2012|author=Halina Lerski|pages=249–250|isbn=0313034567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazimierz inherited a kingdom weakened by war and made it prosperous and wealthy. He reformed the Polish army and doubled the size of the kingdom. He reformed the judicial system and introduced a legal code, gaining the title &quot;the Polish [[Justinian]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fallpolandconta00saxtgoog|title=Fall of Poland; containing an analytical and a philosophical account of the causes which conspired in the ruin of that nation; together with a history of the country from its origin, in two volumes.|last=Saxton|first=L.

He also confirmed privileges and protections previously granted to [[Jews]] and encouraged them to settle in Poland in great numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aharoni|first=Yohanan|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=WC7UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=In+1334+Casimir+III+the+Great+conferred+privileges+upon+the+Jews+of+Poland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz3O-r8O_nAhXWtp4KHWGnB-EQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201334%20Casimir%20III%20the%20Great%20conferred%20privileges%20upon%20the%20Jews%20of%20Poland&amp;f=false|title=The Jewish People: An Illustrated History|date=2006-09-15|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=|isbn=978-0-8264-1886-9|location=|pages=220|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kazimierz left no lawful male heir to his throne, producing only daughters. When Kazimierz died in 1370 from an injury received while hunting, his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], succeeded him as king of Poland in [[Union of Hungary and Poland|personal union with Hungary]].

==The Great King==
[[File:Polska 1333 - 1370.png|250px|thumb|Poland (red) at the end of the reign of Kazimierz III (1370); [[Silesia]] (yellow) had been lost, but the Kingdom was expanding to the east]]

When Kazimierz attained the throne in 1333, his position was in danger, as his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him &quot;king of [[Kraków]]&quot;. The kingdom was depopulated and exhausted by war, and the economy was ruined. In 1335, in the [[Treaty of Trentschin]], Casimir was forced to relinquish his claims to [[Silesia]] &quot;in perpetuity&quot;.

Kazimierz rebuilt and his kingdom became prosperous and wealthy, with great prospects for the future. He waged many victorious wars and doubled the size of the kingdom, mostly through addition of lands in modern-day [[Ukraine]] (then called the Duchy of [[Halych]]). Kazimierz built extensively during his reign, ordering the construction of over 40 castles, including many castles along the [[Trail of the Eagle's Nests]], and he reformed the Polish [[army]].

At the [[Sejm]] in [[Wiślica]], on 11 March 1347, Kazimierz introduced reforms to the Polish judicial system and sanctioned [[Civil law (private law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] codes for Great and Lesser Poland, earning the title &quot;the Polish Justinian&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton&quot; /&gt; He founded the [[University of Kraków]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Saxton535&quot;/&gt; the oldest Polish University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_FnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA569|title=International Education: An Encyclopedia of Contemporary Issues and Systems|last=Ness|first=Daniel|last2=Lin|first2=Chia-Ling|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317467519|location=|pages=569|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he organized a [[Congress of Kraków|meeting of kings in Kraków]] in 1364 at which he exhibited the wealth of the Polish kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pU0SSK4fTIC&amp;pg=PA13|title=Church, State and Dynasty in Renaissance Poland: The Career of Cardinal Fryderyk Jagiellon (1468-1503)|last=Nowakowska|first=Natalia|date=2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9780754656449|location=|pages=13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kazimierz is the only king in Polish history to both receive and retain the title of &quot;Great&quot; ([[Bolesław I Chrobry]] is also called &quot;Great&quot;, but more commonly &quot;Valiant&quot;).

===Succession===
In 1355, in [[Buda]], Kazimierz designated his nephew [[Louis I of Hungary]] as his successor should he produce no male heir, as his father had with [[Charles I of Hungary]] to gain his help against Bohemia. In exchange Kazimierz gained a favourable Hungarian attitude, needed in disputes with the hostile Teutonic Order and [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. Kazimierz at the time was still in his early years and having a son did not seem to be a problem (he already had a few children).

[[File:Subdue of Ruthenia in 1366.png|thumb|left|''[[The Second Taking of Ruthenia. Wealth and Education]]'', [[Jan Matejko]]]]

Kazimierz left no legal son, however, begetting five daughters instead. He tried to adopt his grandson, [[Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania]], in his last will. The child had been born to his second daughter, [[Elisabeth of Poland (1326–1361)|Elisabeth, Duchess of Pomerania]], in 1351. This part of the testament was invalidated by Louis I of Hungary, however, who had traveled to [[Kraków]] quickly after Kazimierz died and bribed the nobles with future privileges. Kazimierz III had a son-in-law, [[Louis VI the Roman|Louis VI]] of Bavaria, [[Margrave]] and [[Prince-elector]] of [[Brandenburg]], who was considered a possible successor, but he was deemed ineligible as his wife, Kazimierz's daughter Cunigunde, had died in 1357 without issue. 
 
Thus King Louis I of Hungary became successor in Poland. Louis was proclaimed king upon Kazimierz's death in 1370, though Kazimierz's sister Elisabeth (Louis's mother) held much of the real power until her death in 1380.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00luko|title=A concise history of Poland|last=Lukowski|first=Jerzy|last2=Zawadzki|first2=Hubert|date=2016|orig-year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521853323|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society under the reign of Casimir==
[[Image:Wiec Kazimierz Wielki.jpg|thumb|''[[Veche#Poland|Wiec]]'' in reign of Casimir the Great]]

Casimir was facetiously named &quot;the Peasants' King&quot;. He introduced the codes of law of Greater and Lesser Poland as an attempt to end the overwhelming superiority of the nobility. During his reign all three major classes — the nobility, priesthood, and bourgeoisie — were more or less counterbalanced, allowing Casimir to strengthen his monarchic position. He was known for siding with the weak when the law did not protect them from nobles and clergymen. He reportedly even supported a peasant whose house had been demolished by his own mistress, after she had ordered it to be pulled down because it disturbed her enjoyment of the beautiful landscape.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Relationship with Polish Jews==
[[File:Wojciech Gerson, Przyjęcie Żydów.jpg|thumb|[[Wojciech Gerson]], ''Casimir the Great and the Jews'']]
On 9 October 1334, he confirmed the privileges granted to Jews in 1264 by [[Bolesław V the Chaste]]. Under [[penalty of death]], he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced [[Christianity|Christian]] [[baptism]], and he inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. While Jews had lived in Poland since before his reign, Casimir allowed them to settle in Poland in great numbers and protected them as ''people of the king''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Poland, a Jewish Revival Thrives—Minus Jews|quote=Probably about 70 percent of the world's European Jews, or [[Ashkenazi]], can trace their ancestry to Poland — thanks to a 14th-century king, Casimir III, the Great, who drew Jewish settlers from across Europe with his vow to protect them as &quot;people of the king&quot;,|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships and children==
{{More citations needed|date=September 2018}}
Casimir III was born in [[Kowal (town)|Kowal]], and he married four times. Casimir first married Anna, or [[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona Ona]], the daughter of Grand Duke [[Gediminas]] of [[Lithuania]]. The marriage produced two daughters, Cunigunde (d. 1357), who was married to [[Louis VI the Roman]], the son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Elisabeth, who was married to Duke [[Bogislaw V|Bogislaus V of Pomerania]]. Aldona died in 1339, and Casimir then married [[Adelaide of Hesse]]. He divorced Adelaide in 1356, married Christina, divorced her, and while Adelaide and possibly Christina were still alive (ca. 1365), he married Hedwig of Głogów and Sagan. He had three daughters by his fourth wife, and they were still very young when he died, and regarded as of dubious legitimacy because of Casimir's bigamy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Aldona of Lithuania===
On 30 April or 16 October 1325, Casimir married [[Aldona of Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Frost, ''The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania:Vol I, The Making of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, 1385-1569'', (Oxford University Press, 2015), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a daughter of [[Gediminas of Lithuania]] and [[Jewna]]. They had two children:
*[[Elisabeth of Poland (1326-1361)|Elisabeth of Poland]] (ca. 1326–1361); married [[Bogusław V, Duke of Pomerania]]
*Cunigunde of Poland (1334–1357); married [[Louis VI the Roman]]

Aldona died on 26 May 1339. Casimir remained a widower for two years.

===Adelheid of Hesse===
On 29 September 1341, Casimir married his second wife, [[Adelaide of Hesse]]. She was a daughter of [[Henry II, Landgrave of Hesse]], and Elizabeth of Meissen. They had no children. Casimir started living separately from Adelaide soon thereafter. Their loveless marriage lasted until 1356.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rhode|first1=Gotthold K.S.|title=Casimir III|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Casimir-III|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christina===
Casimir effectively divorced Adelaide and married his mistress [[Christina Rokiczana]], the widow of Miklusz Rokiczani, a wealthy merchant. Her own origins are unknown. Following the death of her first husband she had entered the court of [[Bohemia]] in [[Prague]] as a [[lady-in-waiting]]. Casimir brought her with him from Prague and convinced the abbot of the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] of [[Tyniec]] to marry them. The marriage was held in a secret ceremony but soon became known. Queen Adelaide renounced it as [[Polygamy|bigamous]] and returned to Hesse without permission. Casimir continued living with Christine despite complaints by [[Pope Innocent VI]] on behalf of Queen Adelaide. The marriage lasted until 1363–64 when Casimir again declared himself divorced. They had no children. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Hedwig of Żagań===
In about 1365, Casimir married his fourth wife [[Hedwig of Sagan|Hedwig of Żagań]]. She was a daughter of [[Henry V of Iron]], Duke of [[Żagań]] and Anna of Mazovia. They had three children:
*[[Anna of Poland, Countess of Celje]] (1366 – 9 June 1422); married firstly William of Celje; their only daughter was [[Anne of Cilli|Anne]], who married [[Jogaila|Jogaila of Lithuania]] (who at the time was King of Poland). Anne married, secondly, Ulrich, [[Duke of Teck]]; they had no children.
*Kunigunde of Poland (1367 – 1370)
*Jadwiga of Poland (1368 – ca. 1382)

With Adelheid still alive and Christina possibly surviving, the marriage to Hedwig was also considered bigamous. The legitimacy of the three last daughters was disputed. Casimir managed to have Anne and Cunigunde legitimated by [[Pope Urban V]] on 5 December 1369. Jadwiga the younger was legitimated by [[Pope Gregory XI]] on 11 October 1371.&lt;ref&gt;''Pope Gregory XI: the Failure of Tradition'' {{ISBN|978-0-819-15463-7}} p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;
