[[File:Cross2.svg|thumb|150px|A ''Greek cross'' (all arms of equal length) above a ''[[saltire]]'', a cross whose limbs are slanted]]
A '''cross''' is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally. 
A cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter [[X]], is also termed a [[saltire]] in heraldic terminology.

Throughout centuries the cross in its various shapes and forms was a symbol of various beliefs. In pre-Christian times it was a pagan religious symbol throughout Europe and western Asia. In ancient times, the effigy of a man hanging on a cross was set up in the fields to protect the crops. The cross was even considered a male symbol of the phallic Tree of Life; thus it often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital circle or oval, to signify the sacred marriage, as in Egyptian amulet Nefer&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/571948 Nefer]&lt;/ref&gt; with male cross and female orb, considered as an amulet of blessedness, a charm of sexual harmony. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets|last=Walker|first=Barbara G.|publisher=Harper &amp; Row, Publishers|year=1983|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==  
The word ''[[:wikt:cross|cross]]'' is recorded in 10th-century [[Old English]] as ''cros'', exclusively for the instrument of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Christ's crucifixion]], replacing the native Old English word ''[[rood]]''. The word's history is complicated; it appears to have entered English from [[Old Irish]], possibly via [[Old Norse]], ultimately from the Latin ''[[:wikt:crux|crux]]'' (or its accusative ''crucem'' and its genitive ''crucis''), &quot;stake, cross&quot;. The English verb ''to cross'' arises from the noun c. 1200, first in the sense &quot;to make the sign of the cross&quot;; the generic meaning &quot;to intersect&quot; develops in the 15th century.
The Latin word was, however, influenced by [[popular etymology]] by a native Germanic word reconstructed as ''*krukjo'' (English ''[[:wikt:crook|crook]]'', Old English ''crycce'', Old Norse ''krokr'', Old High German ''krucka''). This word, by conflation with Latin ''crux'', gave rise to Old French ''crocier'' (modern French ''crosse''), the term for a [[shepherd's crook]], adopted in English as [[crosier]].

Latin ''crux'' referred to the [[gibbet]] where criminals were executed, a stake or pole, with or without transom, on which the condemned were impaled or hanged, but more particularly a cross or the pole of a carriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D117%3Aentry%3Dcrux Lewish and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'': crux]&lt;/ref&gt; From this word was derived the Latin verb ''crucio'' &quot;to put to death on the cross&quot; or (more frequently) &quot;to put to the rack, to torture, torment&quot; especially in reference to mental troubles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DC%3Aentry+group%3D116%3Aentry%3Dcrucio Lewis and Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]: crucio]&lt;/ref&gt; The field of etymology is of no help in any effort to trace a supposed original meaning of ''crux''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/crux002.pdf Gunnar Samuelsson, ''Crucifixion in Antiquity'' (Mohr Siebeck 2011), p. 203]&lt;/ref&gt; A ''crux'' can be of various shapes: from a single beam used for impaling or suspending (''[[crux simplex]]'') to the various composite kinds of cross (''crux compacta'') made from more beams than one. The latter shapes include not only the traditional ‚Ä†-shaped cross (the ''crux immissa''), but also the T-shaped cross (the ''crux commissa'' or [[Tau Cross]]), which the [[descriptions in antiquity of the execution cross]] indicate as the normal form in use at that time, and the X-shaped cross (the ''crux decussata'' or [[saltire]]).

The Greek equivalent of Latin ''crux'' &quot;stake, gibbet&quot; is [[stauros|œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ ''stauros'']], found in texts of four centuries or more before the gospels and always in the plural number to indicate a stake or pole. From the first century BC it is used to indicate an instrument used in executions. The Greek word is used in [[descriptions in antiquity of the execution cross]], which indicate that its normal shape was similar to the Greek letter [[tau]] ([[Œ§]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.vi.ii.ix.html The Epistle of Barnabas, IX]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://logoslibrary.org/clement/stromata/611.html Clement of Alexandria, ''The Stromata'', book VI, chapter 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/tertullian/tertullian.marcionem3.shtml Adversus Marcionem, liber III, cap.

== History ==

===Pre-Christian===
[[File:Radanhaenger-edited.jpg|thumb|Bronze Age &quot;wheel pendants&quot; in the shape of the &quot;[[sun cross]]&quot; ([[Urnfield culture]], 2nd millennium BC).]]
Due to the simplicity of the design (two intersecting lines), cross-shaped incisions make their appearance from deep prehistory; as [[petroglyph]]s in European [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] caves, dating back to the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]], and throughout prehistory to the [[Iron Age]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
Also of prehistoric age are numerous variants of the simple cross mark, including the ''[[swastika|crux gammata]]'' with curving or angular lines, and the Egyptian ''[[ankh|crux ansata]]'' with a loop.

Speculation has associated the cross symbol ‚Äì even in the prehistoric period ‚Äì with astronomical or cosmological [[symbology]] involving 
&quot;[[classical element|four elements]]&quot; (Chevalier, 1997) or the [[cardinal directions|cardinal points]], or the unity of a vertical [[axis mundi]] or celestial pole with the horizontal [[world]] (Koch, 1955). Speculation of this kind became especially popular in the mid- to late-19th century in the context of [[comparative mythology]] seeking to tie [[Christian mythology]] to ancient [[Religious cosmology|cosmological myths]]. Influential works in this vein included 
G. de Mortillet (1866),&lt;ref&gt;G. de Mortillet, &quot;Le signe de la croix avant le christianisme&quot;, Paris, 1866&lt;/ref&gt; L. M√ºller (1865),&lt;ref&gt;L. M√ºller, &quot;Ueber Sterne, Kreuze und Kr√§nze als religi√∂se Symbole der alten Kulturv√∂lker&quot;, Copenhagen, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; W. W. Blake (1888),&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Blake, [https://archive.org/details/crossancientmode00blak &quot;The Cross, Ancient and Modern&quot;] New York, 1888&lt;/ref&gt; Ansault (1891),&lt;ref&gt;Ansault, &quot;M√©moire sur le culte de la croix avant J√©sus-Christ&quot;, Paris, 1891.)&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

[[File:LAK-617.png|thumb|[[Archaic cuneiform]] character LAK-617 (íîÅ): a cruciform arrangement of five boxes; scribes could use the central, larger box as container for other characters.]]

In the [[European Bronze Age]] the cross symbol appeared to carry a [[Prehistoric religion|religious meaning]], perhaps as a symbol of consecration, especially pertaining to burial.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the bronze age we meet in different parts of Europe a more accurate representation of the cross, as conceived in Christian art, and in this shape it was soon widely diffused. This more precise characterization coincides with a corresponding general change in customs and beliefs. The cross is now met with, in various forms, on many objects: fibulas, cinctures, earthenware fragments, and on the bottom of drinking vessels. De Mortillet is of opinion that such use of the sign was not merely ornamental, but rather a symbol of consecration, especially in the case of objects pertaining to burial. In the proto-Etruscan cemetery of Golasecca every tomb has a vase with a cross engraved on it. True crosses of more or less artistic design have been found in Tiryns, at Mycen√¶, in Crete, and on a fibula from Vulci.&quot; O. Marucchi, &quot;Arch√¶ology of the Cross and Crucifix&quot;, ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1908).&lt;/ref&gt;

The cross sign occurs trivially in [[tally marks]], and develops into a [[number symbol]] independently in the [[Roman numerals]] ({{rn|X}} &quot;ten&quot;), the Chinese [[Counting rods|rod numerals]] ([[:wikt:ÂçÅ|ÂçÅ]] &quot;ten&quot;) and the [[Brahmi numerals]] (&quot;four&quot;, whence the numeral [[4 (number)|4]]).

In the [[Phoenician alphabet]] and [[Semitic abjad|derived scripts]], the cross symbol represented the phoneme /t/, i.e. the letter [[taw]], which is the historical predecessor of Latin [[T]]. The letter name ''taw'' means &quot;mark&quot;, presumably continuing the [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]  &quot;two crossed sticks&quot; ([[List of hieroglyphs/Z|Gardiner Z9]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/3_taw.html |title= Archived copy |accessdate= 17 June 2015 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150617143555/http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/3_taw.html |archivedate= 17 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to [[William Edwy Vine|W. E. Vine]]'s ''[[Vine's Expository Dictionary|Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words]]'', worshippers of [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] in [[Chaldea]] and thereabouts used the cross as symbol of that god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The shape of the cross (''crux'', ''[[stauros]]'' &quot;stake, gibbet&quot;), as represented by the letter [[Tau (letter)|T]], came to be used as a &quot;seal&quot; or symbol of [[Early Christianity]] by the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The cross as a Christian symbol or 'seal' came into use at least as early as the second century (see &quot;Apost. Const.&quot; iii. 17; Epistle of Barnabas, xi.-xii.; Justin, &quot;Apologia,&quot; i. 55-60; &quot;Dial. cum Tryph.&quot; 85-97); and the marking of a cross upon the forehead and the chest was regarded as a talisman against the powers of demons (Tertullian, &quot;De Corona,&quot; iii.; Cyprian, &quot;Testimonies,&quot; xi. 21-22; Lactantius, &quot;Divin√¶ Institutiones,&quot; iv. 27, and elsewhere). Accordingly the Christian Fathers had to defend themselves, as early as the second century, against the charge of being worshipers of the cross, as may be learned from Tertullian, &quot;Apologia,&quot; xii., xvii., and Minucius Felix, &quot;Octavius,&quot; xxix. Christians used to swear by the power of the cross. [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=899&amp;letter=C  CROSS:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;],  [[Jewish Encyclopaedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clement of Alexandria]] in the early 3rd century calls it {{lang|grc|œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫·Ω∏ŒΩ œÉŒ∑ŒºŒµ·øñŒøŒΩ}} (&quot;the Lord's sign&quot;)  he repeats the idea, current as early as the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], that the number 318 (in [[Greek numerals]], Œ§ŒôŒó) in Genesis 14:14 was a foreshadowing (a &quot;type&quot;) of the cross (the letter Tau) and of Jesus (the letters [[Iota Eta]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book6.html |title=Clement of Alexandria: Stromata, Book 6 |website=Earlychristianwritings.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clement's contemporary [[Tertullian]]  rejects the accusation that Christians are  ''crucis religiosi'' (i.e. &quot;adorers of the gibbet&quot;), and returns the  accusation by likening the worship of pagan idols to the worship of poles or stakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0301.htm ''Apology''., chapter xvi.]  
&quot;Then, if any of you think we render superstitious adoration to the cross, in that adoration he is sharer with us. If you offer homage to a piece of wood at all, it matters little what it is like when the substance is the same: it is of no consequence the form, if you have the very body of the god. And yet how far does the Athenian Pallas differ from the stock of the cross, or the Pharian Ceres as she is put up uncarved to sale, a mere rough stake and piece of shapeless wood? Every stake fixed in an upright position is a portion of the cross; we render our adoration, if you will have it so, to a god entire and complete. We have shown before that your deities are derived from shapes modelled from the cross.&quot;
''Sed et qui crucis nos religiosos putat, consecraneus noster erit. Cum lignum aliquod propitiatur, viderit habitus, dum materiae qualitas eadem sit; viderit forma, dum id ipsum dei corpus sit. Et tamen quanto distinguitur a crucis stipite Pallas Attica, et Ceres Pharia, quae sine effigie rudi palo et informi ligno prostat? Pars crucis est omne robur, quod erecta statione defigitur; nos, si forte, integrum et totum deum colimus. Diximus originem deorum vestrorum a plastis de cruce induci.''&lt;/ref&gt; 
In his book ''De Corona'', written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the [[sign of the cross]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign&quot; ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html ''De Corona'', chapter 3])&lt;/ref&gt;

While early Christians used the T-shape to represent the cross in writing and gesture, the use of the [[Greek cross]] and [[Latin cross]], i.e. crosses with intersecting beams, appears in Christian art towards the end of [[Late Antiquity]]. An early example of the [[cruciform halo]], used to identify Christ in paintings, is found in the ''Miracles of the Loaves and Fishes'' mosaic of [[Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]], Ravenna (6th century). 
The [[Patriarchal cross]], a Latin cross with an additional horizontal bar, first appears in the 10th century.
A wide variation of cross symbols is introduced for the purposes of [[Crosses in heraldry|heraldry]] beginning in the age of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;William Wood Seymour, [https://archive.org/stream/crossintraditi00seym#page/360/mode/2up &quot;The Cross in Heraldry&quot;],  ''The Cross in Tradition, History, and Art'' (1898).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cross-like marks and graphemes ==
{{further|X mark}}

The [[cross mark]] is used to mark a position, or as a [[check mark]], but also to mark [[:wikt:deletion|deletion]].
Derived from Greek [[Chi (letter)|Chi]] are the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letter [[X]], Cyrillic [[Kha (Cyrillic)|Kha]] and possibly runic [[Gyfu]].

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] involving cross shapes include  ''[[ankh]]'' &quot;life&quot;,  ''[[Cross-ndj (hieroglyph)|ndj]]'' &quot;protect&quot; and ''[[Nefer|nfr]]'' &quot;good; pleasant, beautiful&quot;.

[[Sumerian cuneiform]] had a simple cross-shaped character, consisting of a horizontal and a vertical wedge ([[:wikt:íà¶|íà¶]]), read as ''ma≈°'' &quot;tax, yield, interest&quot;; the superposition of two diagonal wedges results in a decussate cross ([[:wikt:íâΩ|íâΩ]]), read as ''pap'' &quot;first, pre-eminent&quot; (the superposition of these two types of crosses results in the eight-pointed star used as the sign for &quot;sky&quot; or &quot;deity&quot; ([[:wikt:íÄ≠|íÄ≠]]), [[DINGIR]]).
The cuneiform script has other, more complex, cruciform characters, consisting of an arrangement of boxes or the fourfold arrangement of other characters, including the [[archaic cuneiform]] characters [[Liste der archaischen Keilschriftzeichen|LAK]]-210, LAK-276, LAK-278, LAK-617 and the classical sign EZEN (íÇ°).&lt;ref&gt;An example of a cruciform arrangement of a character that is itself cruciform is the ligature &quot;EZEN x KASKAL squared&quot;, encoded by [[Unicode cuneiform|Unicode]] at U+120AD (íÇ≠).&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenician ''tƒÅw'' is still cross-shaped in  [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] and in some [[Old Italic scripts]] ([[Raetic]] and [[Lepontic]]), and its descendant [[T]] becomes again cross-shaped in the Latin  [[Lower case|minuscule]]  [[t]]. 
The [[Plus and minus signs|plus sign]]   (+) is derived from Latin [[t]] via a simplification of a ligature for ''et'' &quot;and&quot; (introduced by [[Johannes Widmann]] in the late 15th century).

The letter [[Aleph]] is cross-shaped in [[Aramaic script|Aramaic]] and [[paleo-Hebrew]].

[[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s with cross-shapes include [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner]] [[List of hieroglyphs/Z|Z9 &amp;ndash; Z11]] (&quot;crossed sticks&quot;, &quot;crossed planks&quot;).

Other, unrelated cross-shaped letters include [[Brahmi]] ''ka'' (predecessor of the [[Devanagari]] letter ‡§ï) and [[Old Turkic script|Old Turkic (Orkhon)]] ''d¬≤'' and [[Old Hungarian alphabet|Old Hungarian]] ''b'', and [[Katakana]] „Éä ''[[Na (kana)|na]]'' and  „É°''[[Me (kana)|me]]''.

The   [[multiplication sign]]   (√ó), often attributed to  [[William Oughtred]] (who first used it in an appendix to the 1618 edition of John Napier's ''Descriptio'') apparently had been in occasional use since the mid 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Cajori, ''A History of Mathematical Notations
Dover Books on Mathematics'' (1929), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251  251f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other typographical symbols resembling crosses include the [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] or ''obelus'' (‚Ä†), 
the  [[Chinese numerals|Chinese]] ([[wikt:ÂçÅ|ÂçÅ]], [[Radical 24|Kangxi radical 24]]) and [[Roman numerals|Roman]] ({{rn|X}}) ten.

The [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block (U+2626 to U+262F) adds three specific [[Christian cross variants]], viz. the [[Patriarchal cross]] (‚ò¶),

== Physical gestures ==
Cross shapes are made by a variety of physical [[gesture]]s. [[Crossed fingers|Crossing the fingers of one hand]] is a common invocation of the symbol. The [[sign of the cross]] associated with Christian [[genuflection]] is made with one hand: in Eastern Orthodox tradition the sequence is head-heart-right shoulder-left shoulder, while in Oriental Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican tradition the sequence is head-heart-left-right.

Crossing the index fingers of both hands represents and a charm against evil in European folklore. Other gestures involving more than one hand include the &quot;cross my heart&quot; movement associated with making a promise and the [[Tau]] shape of the [[referee]]'s &quot;time out&quot; hand signal.

In Chinese-speaking cultures, crossed index fingers represent the number 10.
