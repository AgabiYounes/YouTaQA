From the earliest days of the [[Christianity|Christian faith]], Christians have honored [[marriage]], or ''holy matrimony'', as a divinely blessed, lifelong, [[monogamy|monogamous]] union, between a man and a woman.  According to the Episcopal [[Book of Common Prayer]] (1979), reflecting the traditional view, &quot;Christian marriage is a solemn and public covenant between a man and a woman in the presence of God,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage: Concerning the Service |url=https://www.bcponline.org/ |website=The Online Book of Common Prayer |publisher=Church Hymnal Corporation, New York City (The Episcopal Church) |accessdate=16 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;intended by God for their mutual joy; for the help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity; and, when it is God's will, for the procreation of children and their nurture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage |url=https://www.bcponline.org/PastoralOffices/marriage.html |website=Book of Common Prayer Online |publisher=Church Hymnal Corporation, New York City (The Episcopal Church) |accessdate=17 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while many Christians might agree with the traditional definition, the terminology and theological views of marriage have varied through time in different countries, and among Christian denominations.

Many [[Protestantism|Protestants]] consider marriage to be a sacred institution or &quot;holy ordinance&quot; of God. [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] consider marriage a [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|holy sacrament]] or [[Sacred_mysteries#Eastern_Christianity|sacred mystery]].  However, there have been and are differing attitudes among denominations and individual Christians towards not only the concept of [[Christian marriage]], but also concerning [[divorce]], [[remarriage]], [[Women in Christianity|gender roles]], family authority (the &quot;[[Biblical patriarchy|headship]]&quot; of the husband), the [[coverture|legal status of married women]], [[birth control]], [[marriageable age]], [[cousin marriage]], [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|marriage of in-laws]], [[Interfaith marriage in Christianity|interfaith marriage]], [[same-sex marriage]], and [[Polygamy in Christianity|polygamy]], among other topics, so that in the 21st century there cannot be said to be a single, uniform, worldwide view of marriage among all who profess to be Christians.  

Christian teaching has never held that marriage is necessary for everyone; for many centuries in [[Western Europe]], priestly or monastic [[celibacy]] was valued as highly as, if not higher than, marriage.  Christians who did not marry were expected to refrain from all [[fornication|sexual activity]], as were those who took [[holy orders]] or [[monastic vows]] .

In [[Civil_marriage#In_other_European_countries|some Western countries]], a separate and [[secularity|secular]] civil wedding ceremony is required for recognition by the state, while in other Western countries, couples must merely obtain a [[marriage license]] from a local government authority and can be married by Christian or other [[clergy]] if they are authorized by law to conduct weddings.  In this case, the state recognizes the religious marriage as a [[civil marriage]] as well; and Christian couples married in this way have all the rights of civil marriage, including, for example, [[divorce]], even if their [[Christian views on divorce|church forbids divorce]]. 

Since the beginning of the 21st century, same-sex couples have been allowed to [[Same-sex marriage|marry civilly]] in many countries, and some Christian churches in those countries allow [[Religious_views_on_same-sex_marriage#Christianity|religious marriage of same-sex couples]], though others forbid it, along with [[Homosexuality and religion|all other same-sex relationships]].

==Biblical foundations and history==

Christians believe that marriage is considered in its ideal according to the purpose of [[God in Christianity|God]]. At the heart of God's design for marriage is companionship and intimacy.

The biblical picture of marriage expands into something much broader, with the husband and wife relationship illustrating the relationship between [[Bride of Christ|Christ and the church]].

It is also considered in its actual occurrence, sometimes involving failure. Therefore, the Bible speaks on the subject of [[divorce]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot; /&gt; The New Testament recognizes a place for singleness. [[Salvation]] within Christianity is not dependent on the continuation of a biological lineage.&lt;ref name=&quot;EOC&quot; /&gt;

=== Old Testament ===

{{See also|Polygamy#Judaism|Pilegesh}}
[[Polygyny]], or men having multiple wives at once, is one of the most common marital arrangements represented in the Old Testament,&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot;&gt;{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=marriage|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=M&amp;artid=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet scholars doubt that it was common among average Israelites because of the wealth needed to practice it.&lt;ref&gt;Gene McAfee [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t120.e0669 &quot;Sex&quot;] The Oxford Companion to the Bible. Bruce M. Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, eds. Oxford University Press Inc. 1993. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 19 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[biblical patriarchs]] and [[kings of Israel]] are described as engaged in polygamous relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dale Martin]] [https://vimeo.com/8581466 lecture].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Betrothal]] (''[[erusin]]''), which is merely a binding promise to get married, is distinct from marriage itself (''[[nissuin|nissu'in]]''), with the time between these events varying substantially.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot;&gt;{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=Marriage|section=Manius-Mash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a wife was regarded as property in biblical times, the betrothal (''erusin'') was effected simply by purchasing her from her father (or [[parental guardian|guardian]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; the girl's consent is not explicitly required by any biblical law.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt;

Like the adjacent Arabic culture ([[Pre-Islamic Arabia|in the pre-Islamic period]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[William Robertson Smith]], ''Kinship and Marriage in early Arabia'', (1885), 81&lt;/ref&gt; the act of marriage appears mainly to have consisted of the groom fetching the bride, although among the [[Israelites]]  the procession was a festive occasion, accompanied by music, dancing, and lights.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; To celebrate the marriage, week-long feasts were sometimes held.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt;

In Old Testament times, a wife was regarded as [[Personal property|chattel]], belonging to her husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;JewEncMar&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; The descriptions of the Bible suggest that she would be expected to perform tasks such as spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Genesis|29:9}}; {{bibleref2|Exodus|2:16}};{{Bibleref2|1|Samuel|2:19||1 Samuel 2:19}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Sam|8:13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wives were usually looked after with care, and [[bigamy|bigamous]] men were expected to ensure that they give their first wife food, clothing, and sexual activity.{{bibleref2c|Ex|21:10}}

Since a wife was regarded as property, her husband was originally free to divorce her with little restriction, at any time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheyneAndBlackMar&quot; /&gt; A divorced couple could get back together unless the wife had married someone else after her divorce.{{bibleref2c|Deut|24:2–4}}

=== Jesus on marriage, divorce, and remarriage ===
[[File:Christian-Marriage-Symbol.svg|thumb|150px|Sometimes used as a [[symbol]] for Christian marriage: Two gold wedding rings interlinked with the Greek letters ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'' (X) and ''[[Rho (letter)|rho]]'' (P)—the first two letters in the Greek word for &quot;Christ&quot; (see [[Labarum]])]]

The Bible clearly addresses marriage and divorce. Those in troubled marriages are encouraged to seek counseling and restoration because most divorces are neither necessary nor unavoidable.&lt;ref name=Desai/&gt;

{{Quotation|&quot;Have you not read that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female, and said, &quot;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh&quot;? So they ''are'' no longer two, but one. Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.&quot;|{{Bibleref2|Matt.|19:4–6}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:7–9}}}}

In both Matthew and Mark, Jesus appealed to God's will in creation. He builds upon the narratives in where male and female are created together{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27}} and for one another.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Genesis|2:24}} Thus Jesus takes a firm stand on the permanence of marriage in the original will of God. This corresponds closely with the position of the Pharisee school of thought led by [[Shammai]], at the start of the first millennium,&lt;ref name=&quot;Git910&quot;&gt;''[[Gittin]]'' 9:10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sotah]]'' ([[Jerusalem Talmud]] only), 1:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sotah'' (Jerusalem Talmud only), 1:16b&lt;/ref&gt; with which Jesus would have been familiar. By contrast, [[Rabbinic Judaism]] subsequently took the opposite view, espoused by [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], the leader of the other major Pharisee school of thought at the time; in Hillel's view, men were allowed to divorce their wives for any reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;Git910&quot; /&gt;

Some hold that marriage vows are unbreakable, so that even in the distressing circumstances in which a couple separates, they are still married from God's point of view. This is the Roman Catholic church's position, although occasionally the church will declare a marriage to be “null” (in other words, it never really was a marriage).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sacrament of Matrimony&quot;. [www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; William Barclay (1907-1978) has written:
{{Quotation|There is no time in history when the marriage bond stood in greater peril of destruction than in the days when Christianity first came into this world. At that time the world was in danger of witnessing the almost total break-up of marriage and the collapse of the home…. Theoretically no nation ever had a higher ideal of marriage than the Jews had. The voice of God had said, &quot;I hate divorce&quot; (in {{Bibleref2|Malachi|2:16}})|William Barclay&lt;ref&gt;Barclay, William. ''The Gospel of Matthew''. Westminster John Knox Press, Rev Upd edition (December 1, 2001). {{ISBN|978-0664224912}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jesus brought together two passages from Genesis, reinforcing the basic position on marriage found in Jewish scripture. Thus, he implicitly emphasized that it is God-made (&quot;God has joined together&quot;), &quot;male and female,&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Genesis|1:27}} lifelong (&quot;let no one separate&quot;), and monogamous (&quot;a man…his wife&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stagg NT&quot;&gt;Stagg, Frank.''New Testament Theology''. Broadman, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesus]] used the image of marriage and the family to teach the basics about the [[Kingdom of God]]. He inaugurated his ministry by blessing the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast at Cana]]. In the [[Sermon on the Mount]] he set forth a new commandment concerning marriage, teaching that lustful looking constitutes [[adultery]].{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|5:28}} He also [[Supersessionism|superseded a Mosaic Law]] allowing divorce with his teaching that &quot;…anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality (Gk. ''porneia''),&lt;ref&gt;Thayer and Smith. &quot;Greek Lexicon entry for Porneia&quot;. ''The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt; causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|Mt|5:32||cf. Mt. 5:32}} {{Bibleref2c|Mt|19:19}} {{Bibleref2c|Mk|10:11}} {{Bibleref2c|Lk|16:18}} Similar Pauline teachings are found in {{Bibleref2|1cor|7:10–11|ESV|1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians 7:10–11}}. The exception clause—&quot;except for…&quot;—uses the Greek word ''porneia'' which is variously translated &quot;fornication&quot; (KJV), &quot;marital unfaithfulness&quot; (NIV 1984), &quot;sexual immorality&quot; (NIV 2011), &quot;unchastity&quot; (RSV), ''et&amp;nbsp;al''. ''The KJV New Testament Greek Lexicon, KJV'' says ''porneia'' includes a variety of sexual &quot;deviations&quot; to include &quot;illicit sexual intercourse, adultery, fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, intercourse with animals, etc., sexual intercourse with close relatives….&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Lev.|18}}

[[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]] says that manuscripts disagree as to the presence in the original text of the phrase &quot;except for fornication&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stagg NT&quot;/&gt;{{rp|pp.300–301}} Stagg writes: &quot;Divorce always represents failure…a deviation from God's will…. There is grace and redemption where there is contrition and repentance…. There is no clear authorization in the New Testament for remarriage after divorce.&quot; Stagg interprets the chief concern of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|5:32}} as being &quot;to condemn the criminal act of the man who divorces an innocent wife…. Jesus was rebuking the husband who victimizes an innocent wife and thinks that he makes it right with her by giving her a divorce&quot;. He points out that Jesus refused to be trapped by the [[Pharisees]] into choosing between the strict and liberal positions on divorce as held at the time in Judaism. When they asked him, &quot;Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|19:3}} he answered by reaffirming God's will as stated in Genesis {{Bibleref2-nb|Gen.|1:27}} and {{Bibleref2-nb|Gen.|2:24}}, that in marriage husband and wife are made &quot;one flesh&quot;, and what God has united man must not separate.{{Bibleref2c|Mt.|19:4-6}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Stagg NT&quot;/&gt;{{rp|pp.300–301}}

There is no evidence that Jesus himself ever married, and considerable evidence that he remained single. In contrast to Judaism and many other traditions,&lt;ref name=&quot;EOC&quot;&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey Bromiley. ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity.'' Brill Academic Publishers (November 2000). {{ISBN|90-04-11695-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.283}} he taught that there is a place for voluntary singleness in Christian service. He believed marriage could be a distraction from an urgent mission,&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''The Gospel according to women: Christianity's creation of the sex war in the west,'' Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-385-24079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he was living in a time of crisis and urgency where the [[Kingdom of God]] would be established where there would be no marriage nor giving in marriage:

{{Quotation|
&quot;I tell you the truth,&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the [[World to Come|age to come]], [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]].&quot;|{{bibleref2|Luke|18:29–30}}
}}

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|22:28-30|NIV}} Jesus is asked about the continuing state of marriage after death and he affirms that at the resurrection &quot;people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.&quot;

=== New Testament beyond the Gospels ===

The [[Saint Paul|Apostle Paul]] quoted passages from Genesis almost verbatim in two of his New Testament books. He used marriage not only to describe the kingdom of God, as Jesus had done, but to define also the nature of the 1st-century Christian church. His [[theology|theological view]] was a Christian development of the [[Old Testament]] parallel between marriage and the relationship between God and [[Israel]]. He analogized the church as a bride and Christ as the bridegroom─drawing parallels between Christian marriage and the relationship between Christ and the [[Christian Church|Church]].

[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 16th century.]]

There is no hint in the New Testament that Jesus was ever married, and no clear evidence that Paul was ever married. However, both Jesus and Paul seem to view marriage as a legitimate calling from God for Christians. Paul elevates singleness to that of the preferable position, but does offer a caveat suggesting this is &quot;because of the impending crisis&quot;—which could itself extend to present times (see also [[Pauline privilege]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1Corinthians|7:1,7-9,17,26-28,38,40|NET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul's primary issue was that marriage adds concerns to one's life that detract from their ability to serve God without distraction.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family.'' Paulist Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8091-4118-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|1Corinthians|7:32-35|NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have speculated that Paul may have been a widower since prior to his conversion to Christianity he was a [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] and member of the [[Sanhedrin]], positions in which the social norm of the day required the men to be married. But it is just as likely that he never married at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&quot;&gt;Adams, Jay E. ''Marriage, Divorce, and Remarriage in the Bible,'' Zondervan, 1986, {{ISBN|0-310-51111-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, Paul acknowledges the mutuality of marital relations, and recognizes that his own singleness is &quot;a particular gift from God&quot; that others may not necessarily have. He writes: &quot;Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|1Co|7:8||1&amp;nbsp;Cor 7:8}}

[[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] indicates that [[bishop]]s, [[deacon]]s, and [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]s must be &quot;husbands of one wife&quot;, and that women must have one husband. This is usually understood to legislate against polygamy rather than to require marriage:

{{quotation|Now the overseer (bishop) is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.|{{Bibleref2|1tim|3:2||1&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;3:2}}}}

{{quotation|A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well.|{{Bibleref2|1tim|3:12||1&amp;nbsp;Timothy&amp;nbsp;3:12}}}}

{{quotation|The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint (or ordain) elders in every town, as I directed you. An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.|{{Bibleref2|Titus|1:5-6}}}}

In the Roman Age, female widows who did not remarry were considered more pure than those who did.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walcot: On Widows and their Reputation in Antiquity. In: Symbolae Osloenses, Volume 66, Issue 1. 1991: pp.5-26&lt;/ref&gt; Such widows were known as ''one man woman'' (''enos andros gune'') in the epistles of Paul.{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:9||1&amp;nbsp;Tim.&amp;nbsp;5:9}} Paul writes:
{{Quotation|No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband, and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the Lord’s people, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds&quot;.|{{Bibleref2|1Tim|5:9-10||1&amp;nbsp;Tim.&amp;nbsp;5:9-10}}}}

Paul allowed widows to remarry.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|7:39-40||1&amp;nbsp;Cor.&amp;nbsp;7:39-40}} {{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:11-16||1&amp;nbsp;Tim.&amp;nbsp;5:11-16}} Paul says that only ''one-man women'' older than 60 years{{Bibleref2c|1Tim|5:9-10||1&amp;nbsp;Tim.&amp;nbsp;5:9-10}} can make the list of Christian widows who did special tasks in the community, but that younger widows should remarry to hinder sin.

=== Marriage and early Church Fathers ===

Building on what they saw the example of Jesus and Paul advocating, some early [[Church Fathers]] placed less value on the family and saw [[celibacy]] and freedom from family ties as a preferable state.

[[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers|Nicene Fathers]] such as [[Augustine]] believed that marriage was a sacrament because it was a symbol used by Paul to express Christ's love of the Church. However, there was also an apocalyptic dimension in his teaching, and he was clear that if everybody stopped marrying and having children that would be an admirable thing; it would mean that the [[Kingdom of God]] would return all the sooner and the [[End times|world would come to an end]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot;&gt;Armstrong, Karen. ''Gospel According to Women.'' Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-385-24079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a view reflects the [[Manichaean]] past of Augustine.

While upholding the New Testament teaching that marriage is &quot;honourable in all and the bed undefiled,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hebrews 13:4&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine believed that &quot;yet, whenever it comes to the actual process of generation, the very embrace which is lawful and honourable cannot be effected without the ardour of lust...This is the carnal concupiscence, which, while it is no longer accounted sin in the regenerate, yet in no case happens to nature except from sin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/15071.htm Augustine, &quot;On Marriage and Concupiscence,&quot; Book I], cp. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Tertullian]] and Gregory of Nyssa were church fathers who were married. They each stressed that the happiness of marriage was ultimately rooted in misery. They saw marriage as a state of bondage that could only be cured by celibacy. They wrote that at the very least, the virgin woman could expect release from the &quot;governance of a husband and the chains of children.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Scholer, David M.''Women in early Christianity.'' Garland Publishing, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-1074-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.151}}

[[Tertullian]] argued that second marriage, having been freed from the first by death,&quot;will have to be termed no other than a species of fornication,&quot; partly based on the reasoning that this involves desiring to marry a woman out of sexual ardor, which a Christian convert is to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.vi.ix.html &quot;Chapter IX.—Second Marriage a Species of Adultery&quot;] ANF04. Tertullian, Part Fourth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also advocating celibacy and virginity as preferable alternatives to marriage, [[Jerome]] wrote: &quot;It is not disparaging wedlock to prefer virginity. No one can make a comparison between two things if one is good and the other evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Classical library from 'Select Letters of St. Jerome,''&amp;nbsp;' Letter 22. tr. by F. A. Wright. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[First Corinthians]] 7:1 he reasons, &quot;It is good, he says, for a man not to touch a woman. If it is good not to touch a woman, it is bad to touch one: for there is no opposite to goodness but badness. But if it be bad and the evil is pardoned, the reason for the concession is to prevent worse evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.vi.vi.I.html &quot;Against Jovinianus,&quot; Book 1], Cps. 7,13,16,33&lt;/ref&gt;

St. [[John Chrysostom]] wrote: &quot;...virginity is better than marriage, however good.... Celibacy is...an imitation of the angels. Therefore, virginity is as much more honorable than marriage, as the angel is higher than man. But why do I say angel? Christ, Himself, is the glory of virginity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;St. John Chrysostom, Homily 19 on First Corinthians, NPNF, s. 1, v. 12, pp. 248–262&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyprian]], Bishop of Carthage, said that the first commandment given to men was to increase and multiply, but now that the earth was full there was no need to continue this process of multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;St. Cyprian, &quot;Of the Discipline and Advantage of Chastity,&quot; ''ANF,'' v. 5, p.1251.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of marriage was reflected in the lack of any formal [[liturgy]] formulated for marriage in the [[Early Christianity|early Church]]. No special ceremonial was devised to celebrate Christian marriage—despite the fact that the Church had produced liturgies to celebrate the [[Eucharist]], [[Baptism]] and [[Confirmation]]. It was not important for a couple to have their nuptials blessed by a [[priest]]. People could marry by mutual agreement in the presence of witnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot; /&gt;

At first, the old Roman pagan rite was used by Christians, although modified superficially. The first detailed account of a Christian wedding in the West dates from the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]]. This system, known as Spousals, persisted after the [[Reformation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot; /&gt;

The Catholic Church allowed marriages to take place inside churches only starting with the 16th century, beforehand religious marriages happened on the porch of the church.&lt;ref name=monger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monger|first1=George P.|year=2004|chapter=Christian Weddings|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8JlWxBYs40C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=marriage+ceremony+%22early+christianity%22&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OQX7VNjyPMKsUaGlgfAM&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBzgK|title=Marriage Customs of the World: From Henna to Honeymoons|location=Santa Barbara, CA|publisher=ABC CLIO|pages=[https://archive.org/details/marriagecustomso0000mong/page/70 70–71]|isbn=9781576079874|oclc=469368346|url=https://archive.org/details/marriagecustomso0000mong/page/70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] teaches that God himself is the author of the sacred institution of marriage, which is His way of showing love for those He created. Marriage is a divine institution that can never be broken, even if the husband or wife legally divorce in the civil courts; as long as they are both alive, the Church considers them bound together by God. Holy Matrimony is another name for sacramental marriage. Marriage is intended to be a faithful, exclusive, lifelong union of a man and a woman. Committing themselves completely to each other, a Catholic husband and wife strive to sanctify each other, bring children into the world, and educate them in the Catholic way of life. Man and woman, although created differently from each other, complement each other. This complementarity draws them together in a mutually loving union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1602–1605|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P51.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The valid marriage of baptized Christians is one of the seven [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|Roman Catholic sacraments]]. The sacrament of marriage is the only sacrament that a priest does not administer directly; a priest, however, is the chief witness of the husband and wife's administration of the sacrament to each other at the wedding ceremony in a Catholic church.

The Roman Catholic Church views that Christ himself established the sacrament of marriage at the [[Marriage at Cana|wedding feast of Cana]]; therefore, since it is a divine institution, neither the Church nor state can alter the basic meaning and structure of marriage. Husband and wife give themselves totally to each other in a union that lasts until death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|page=1643|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P55.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Priest]]s are instructed that marriage is part of God's natural law and to support the couple if they do choose to marry. Today it is common for Roman Catholics to enter into a &quot;mixed marriage&quot; between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic. Couples entering into a mixed marriage are usually allowed to marry in a Catholic church provided their decision is of their own accord and they intend to remain together for life, to be faithful to each other, and to have children which are brought up in the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|editor=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|editor-link=Vatican Publishing House|accessdate=2009-07-22|pages=1633–1637|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P53.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Roman Catholic teaching, marriage has two objectives: 
•the good of the spouses themselves
•and the procreation and education of children (1983 code of canon law, c.1055; 1994 catechism, par.2363). Hence &quot;entering marriage with the intention of never having children is a grave wrong and more than likely grounds for an [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, P. &quot;Sacrament of Holy Matrimony.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal procedure for a priest to ask the prospective bride and groom about their plans to have children before officiating at their wedding. The Roman Catholic Church may refuse to marry anyone unwilling to have children, since procreation by &quot;the marriage act&quot; is a fundamental part of marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;humanae_vitae&quot;&gt;[[Pope Paul VI]].&quot;Humanæ Vitæ.&quot; 1968-7-25. Accessed: 2009-7-22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus usage of any form of [[contraception]], [[in vitro fertilization]], or [[birth control]] besides [[Natural Family Planning]] is a grave offense against the sanctity of marriage and ultimately against God.&lt;ref name=&quot;humanae_vitae&quot; /&gt;

=== Protestantism ===

==== Purposes ====

Essentially all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations hold marriage to be ordained by God for the union between a man and a woman. They see the primary purposes of this union as intimate companionship, rearing children and mutual support for both husband and wife to fulfill their life callings.&lt;ref&gt;UMC&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants generally approve of [[birth control]] and consider marital sexual pleasure to be a gift of God. While condoning [[divorce]] only under limited circumstances, most Protestant churches allow for divorce and remarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Rubio, Julie Hanlon. ''A Christian Theology of Marriage and Family,'' Paulist Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8091-4118-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian fundamentalism|Conservative]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]] take a stricter view of the nature of marriage. They consider marriage a solemn [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] between wife, husband and [[God]]. Most view sexual relations as appropriate only within a marriage. Divorce is permissible, if at all, only in very specific circumstances (for example, sexual immorality or abandonment by the non-believer).

The [[United Methodist Church]], the second largest Protestant denomination in the United States, specifically holds that &quot;the covenant of marriage was established by God who created us male and female for each other&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Karen B. Westerfield|title=American Methodist Worship|date=27 April 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English |isbn=9780190454203|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methodists further teach that marriage is &quot;God's gift and covenant intended to imitate [[New Covenant|God's covenant with humankind]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker2011&quot;/&gt; that &quot;Christians enter in their [[baptism]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Church2016&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church 2016|date=16 December 2016|publisher=United Methodist Publishing House|language=English|isbn=9781501833250|page=623|quote=For the church, the marriage covenant is gounded in the covenant between God and God's people into which Christians enter in their baptism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rite]] used in the [[Free Methodist Church]] proclaims that marriage is &quot;more than a legal contract, being a bond of union made in heaven, into which you enter discreetly and reverently.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker2011&quot;/&gt;

==== Roles and responsibilities ====

Roles and responsibilities of husband and wives now vary considerably on a continuum between the long-held male dominant/female submission view and a shift toward equality (without sameness)&lt;ref&gt;Steil, Janice M. ''Marital Equality: Its Relationship to the Well-Being of Husbands and Wives.'' Sage. 1997. {{ISBN|0-8039-5251-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the woman and the man.&lt;ref&gt;Throckmorton, Anne.

Accessed 11 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable debate among many Christians today—not just Protestants—whether equality of husband and wife or male headship is the biblically ordained view, and even if it is biblically permissible. The divergent opinions fall into two main groups: [[Complementarianism|Complementarians]] (who call for husband-headship and wife-submission) and [[Christian Egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] (who believe in full partnership equality in which couples can discover and negotiate roles and responsibilities in marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2004/august/8.55.html |title=Editor's Bookshelf: Creating Husbands and Fathers |accessdate=2007-02-11 |last=Neff |first=David |date=2004-08-01 |work=Christianity Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no debate that {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:12-32|NIV}} presents a historically benevolent husband-headship/wife-submission model for marriage. The questions are (a)&amp;nbsp;how these [[New Testament household codes]] are to be reconciled with the calls earlier in Chapter 5 (cf. verses 1, 18, 21) for mutual submission among all believers, and (b)&amp;nbsp;the meaning of &quot;head&quot; in v.23. It is important to note that verse 22 contains no verb in the original manuscripts, which were also not divided into verses:&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5}} (NIV)
::&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children 2 and walk in the way of love....
::&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; be filled with the Spirit....
::&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
::&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; Wives, ''[submit yourselves]'' to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
::&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt; After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; for we are members of his body. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; &quot;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.&quot; &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.

=== Eastern Orthodoxy ===
{{main|Marriage in the Eastern Orthodox Church}}

[[File:Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna by Ilja Repin (1894, Russian museum).jpg|thumb|''The Wedding of [[Nicholas II]] and [[Grand duke|Grand Duchess]] [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]]'', by [[Ilya Repin|Ilya Yefimovich Repin]], 1894 ([[Russian Museum|Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]]).]]

In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], marriage is treated as a [[Sacred Mysteries|Sacred Mystery]] (sacrament), and as an [[ordination]]. It serves to unite a woman and a man in eternal union before God.&lt;ref name=Fitzgerald&gt;[http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7105 Fitzgerald, Thomas. &quot;The Sacraments&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=31112 Catholics and Orthodox: On Marriage and Family (Pt.

Retrieved on 2011-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;John Meyendorff, ''Marriage, an Orthodox Perspective'', YMCA Press, 1986; chapter: Old and New Testaments&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the 1st centuries of the church, where spiritual union of spouses in the first sacramental marriage was eternal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/buildyourfaith/everydaytheology/17.18.html Is Marriage Eternal? | Kyria]. Christianitytoday.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is considered a [[martyr]]dom as each spouse learns to die to self for the sake of the other. Like all Mysteries, Orthodox marriage is more than just a celebration of something which already exists: it is the creation of something new, the imparting to the couple of the [[Divine grace|grace]] which transforms them from a 'couple' into husband and wife within the [[Body of Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Wedding ring Louvre AC924.jpg|left|thumb|Byzantine [[wedding ring]], depicting Christ uniting the bride and groom, 7th century, [[niello]]ed gold ([[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]]).]]

Marriage is an [[icon]] (image) of the relationship between Jesus and the Church. This is somewhat akin to the Old Testament [[prophet]]s' use of marriage as an analogy to describe the relationship between God and Israel. Marriage is the simplest, most basic unity of the church: a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] where &quot;two or three are gathered together in Jesus' name.&quot;{{bibleref2c|Mt|18:20|KJV}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot; /&gt; The home is considered a consecrated space (the ritual for the Blessing of a House is based upon that of the Consecration of a Church), and the husband and wife are considered the [[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]] of that congregation. However, they do not &quot;perform&quot; the Sacraments in the [[house church]]; they &quot;live&quot; the Sacrament of Marriage. Because marriage is considered to be a [[pilgrimage]] wherein the couple walk side by side toward the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]], marriage to a non-Orthodox partner is discouraged, though it may be permitted.

Unlike Western Christianity, Eastern Christians do not consider the sacramental aspect of the marriage to be conferred by the couple themselves. Rather, the marriage is conferred by the action of the [[Holy Spirit]] acting through the priest. Furthermore, no one besides a bishop or priest—not even a [[deacon]]—may perform the Sacred Mystery.

The external sign of the marriage is the placing of wedding [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] upon the heads of the couple, and their sharing in a &quot;Common Cup&quot; of wine. Once crowned, the couple walk a circle three times in a ceremonial &quot;dance&quot; in the middle of the church, while the choir intones a joyous three-part antiphonal hymn, &quot;Dance, [[Isaiah]]&quot;

The sharing of the Common Cup symbolizes the transformation of their union from a common marriage into a sacred union. The wedding is usually performed after the [[Divine Liturgy]] at which the couple receives [[Holy Communion]]. Traditionally, the wedding couple would wear their wedding crowns for eight days, and there is a special prayer said by the priest at the removal of the crowns.

Divorce is discouraged. Sometimes out of ''[[economia]]'' (mercy) a marriage may be dissolved if there is no hope whatever for a marriage to fulfill even a semblance of its intended sacramental character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot; /&gt; The standard formula for remarriage is that the Orthodox Church joyfully blesses the first marriage, merely performs the second, barely tolerates the third, and invariably forbids the fourth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hapgood&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last =Hapgoood|first =Isabel F.|year =1922|publicationdate=1975|title =Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church|edition=2nd|pages =291–305, 604–605|place =Englewood, N.J.|publisher =Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;On the basis of the ideal of the first marriage as an image of the glory of God the question is which significance such a second marriage has and whether it can be regarded as Mysterion. Even though there are opinions (particularly in the west) which deny the sacramental character to the second marriage, in the orthodox literature almost consistently either a reduced or even a full sacramentality is attributed to it. The investigation of the second marriage rite shows that both positions affirming the sacramentality to a second marriage can be justified.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, M. (2013): Die orthodoxe Theologie der Ehe: Von der Ehe als Mysterion und der Ermöglichung sowie Bewertung einer zweiten Ehe.

[[File:07Thessaloniki Agia Sophia09.jpg|thumb|Orthodox Church prepared for a wedding ([[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia]], [[Thessaloniki]].)]]

[[Early church]] texts forbid marriage between an Orthodox Christian and a [[Heresy|heretic]] or [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] (which would include all non-Orthodox Christians). Traditional Orthodox Christians forbid [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s with other denominations. More liberal ones perform them, provided that the couple formally commit themselves to rearing their children in the Orthodox faith.

All people are called to celibacy—human beings are all born into [[virginity]], and Orthodox Christians are expected by [[Sacred Tradition]] to remain in that state unless they are called into marriage and that call is sanctified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot;&gt;Gregory (Grabbe), Bishop. ''The Sacramental Life: An Orthodox Christian Perspective.'' Liberty, Tenn: St. John of Kronstadt Press, 1986
&lt;/ref&gt; The church blesses two paths on the journey to salvation: [[monasticism]] and marriage. Mere celibacy, without the sanctification of monasticism, can fall into selfishness and tends to be regarded with disfavour by the Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grabbe&quot; /&gt;

Orthodox priests who serve in [[parish]]es are usually married. They must marry prior to their ordination. If they marry after they are ordained they are not permitted to continue performing sacraments. If their wife dies, they are forbidden to remarry; if they do, they may no longer serve as a priest. A married man may be ordained as a priest or deacon. However, a priest or deacon is not permitted to enter into matrimony after ordination. Bishops must always be monks and are thus celibate. However, if a married priest is widowed, he may receive monastic tonsure and thus become eligible for the episcopate.

The Eastern Orthodox Church believes that marriage is an eternal union of spouses, but in Heaven there will not be a procreative bond of marriage.

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
The [[miaphysitism|Non-Chalcedonian]] Churches of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] hold views almost identical to those of the ([[Chalcedonian Christianity|Chalcedonian]]) [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] allows second marriages only in cases of adultery or death of spouse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/coptic-pope-resists-court-ruling-divorce-remarriage Coptic Pope resists court ruling on divorce, remarriage | Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt].

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
{{See also|Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormonism and polygamy}}
In the teachings of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[celestial marriage|celestial (or eternal) marriage]] is a [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] between a man, a woman, and [[God in Mormonism|God]] performed by a [[priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] authority in a [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] of the church.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt; Celestial marriage is intended to continue forever into the [[afterlife]] if the man and woman do not break their covenants.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-38-eternal-marriage &quot;Chapter 38: Eternal Marriage&quot;], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, eternally married couples are often referred to as being &quot;[[Sealing (Mormonism)|sealed]]&quot; to each other. Sealed couples who keep their covenants are also promised to have their posterity sealed to them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt; (Thus, &quot;families are forever&quot; is a common phrase in the LDS Church.) A celestial marriage is considered a requirement for [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]].&lt;ref name = gospelprinciples/&gt;

In some countries, celestial marriages can be recognized as civil marriages; in other cases, couples are civilly married outside of the temple and are later sealed in a celestial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 3.5.&lt;/ref&gt; (The church will no longer perform a celestial marriage for a couple unless they are first or simultaneously legally married.) The church encourages its members to be in good standing with it so that they may marry or be sealed in the temple. A celestial marriage is not annulled by a civil divorce: a &quot;cancellation of a sealing&quot; may be granted, but only by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the highest authority in the church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple carries somewhat of a stigma in the Mormon culture; the church teaches that the &quot;gospel of Jesus Christ—including repentance, forgiveness, integrity, and love—provides the remedy for conflict in marriage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/divorce &quot;Gospel Topics: Divorce&quot;], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding marriage and divorce, the church instructs its leaders: &quot;No priesthood officer is to counsel a person whom to marry. Nor should he counsel a person to divorce his or her spouse. Those decisions must originate and remain with the individual. When a marriage ends in divorce, or if a husband and wife separate, they should always receive counseling from Church leaders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 7.2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In church temples, members of the LDS Church perform vicarious celestial marriages for deceased couples who were legally married.

==== Jehovah's Witnesses ====
The [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] view marriage to be a permanent arrangement with the only possible exception being adultery. Divorce is strongly discouraged even when adultery is committed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/world-view/things-jehovah-s-witnesses-believe-marriage-efe80a14d1d56e08|title=What Are Some Things That Jehovah's Witnesses Believe About Marriage?}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the wronged spouse is free to forgive the unfaithful one. There are provisions for a domestic separation in the event of &quot;failure to provide for one's household&quot; and domestic violence, or spiritual resistance on the part of a partner. Even in such situations though divorce would be considered grounds for loss of privileges in the congregation. Remarrying after death or a proper divorce is permitted. Marriage is the only situation where any type of sexual interaction is acceptable, and even then certain restrictions apply to acts such as oral and anal sex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Married persons who are known to commit such acts may in fact lose privileges in the congregation as they are supposed to be setting a good example to the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Watchtower]] September 15, 2006, March 15, 1983, November 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theological views==
Christians seek to uphold the seriousness of wedding vows. Yet, they respond with compassion to deep hurts by recognizing that [[divorce]], though less than the ideal, is sometimes necessary to relieve one partner of intolerable hardship, unfaithfulness or desertion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot;&gt;{{citation|last1=Stagg|first1=Evelyn|title=Woman in the World of Jesus|year=1978|place=Philadelphia|publisher=Westminster|isbn=0-664-24195-6|last2=Stagg|first2=Frank|author1-link=Evelyn Stagg|author2-link=Frank Stagg (theologian)|title-link=Woman in the World of Jesus}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the voice of God had said, &quot;I hate divorce&quot;,{{Bibleref2c|Malachi|2:16}} some authorities believe the divorce rate in the church is nearly comparable to that of the culture at large.&lt;ref name=Desai&gt;Amy Desai, J.D.

Christians today hold three competing views as to what is the biblically-ordained relationship between husband and wife. These views range from [[Christian egalitarianism]] that interprets the New Testament as teaching complete equality of authority and responsibility between the man and woman in marriage, all the way to [[Patriarchy]] that calls for a “return to complete patriarchy” in which relationships are based on male-dominant power and authority in marriage:&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

1. [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian Egalitarians]] believe in an equal partnership of the wife and husband with neither being designated as the leader in the marriage or family. Instead, the wife and husband share a fully equal partnership in both their marriage and in the family. Its proponents teach &quot;the fundamental biblical principle of the equality of all human beings before God&quot;.

&quot;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}

According to this principle, there can be no moral or theological justification for permanently granting or denying status, privilege, or prerogative solely on the basis of a person's race, class, or gender.&lt;ref name=Groothuis&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca M. &quot;Sexuality, Spirituality and Feminist Religion&quot;.

2. [[Complementarianism|Christian Complementarians]] prescribe husband-headship—a male-led hierarchy. This view's core beliefs call for a husband's “loving, humble headship&quot; and the wife's &quot;intelligent, willing submission&quot; to his headship. Without necessarily using the term &quot;obey&quot;, they believe women have &quot;different but complementary roles and responsibilities in marriage&quot;.&lt;ref name=Comp&gt;Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW).

3. [[Biblical patriarchy]], though not at all popular among mainstream Christians, prescribes a strict male-dominant hierarchy. This view makes the husband the ruler over his wife and his household.&lt;ref&gt;https://cbmw.org/uncategorized/summaries-of-the-egalitarian-and-complementarian-positions; 1/15/2018/&lt;/ref&gt; Their organization's first tenet is that &quot;God reveals Himself as masculine, not feminine. God is the eternal Father and the eternal Son, the Holy Spirit is also addressed as He, and Jesus Christ is a male&quot;. They consider the husband-father to be sovereign over his household—the family leader, provider, and protector. They call for a wife to be obedient to her head (her husband).&lt;ref name=Patriarchy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070626134919/http://www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/biblical_patriarchy.aspx &quot;The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy&quot;.

Some [[Polygamy in Christianity|Christian authorities used to permit]] [[polygamy]] (specifically [[polygyny]]) in the past, but this practice, besides being illegal in Western cultures, is now considered to be out of the Christian mainstream and continues to be practiced only by fringe fundamentalist sects.

===Family authority and responsibilities===

[[File:Pukirev ner brak.jpg|thumb|Orthodox betrothal depicted by [[Vasily Vladimirovich Pukirev]], 1862.]]

Much of the dispute hinges on how one interprets the [[New Testament household code]] ''(Haustafel)'', a term coined by [[Martin Luther]],  which has as its main focus hierarchical relationships between three pairs of social classes that were controlled by Roman law: husbands/wives, parents/children, and masters/slaves. The apostolic teachings, with variations, that constitute what has been termed the &quot;household code&quot; occurs in four epistles (letters) by the [[Apostle Paul]] and in 1&amp;nbsp; Peter. 

In the early [[Roman Republic]], long before the time of Christ, the law of ''[[Manus marriage|manus]]'' along with the concept of ''[[Pater familias|patria potestas]]'' (rule of the fathers), gave the husband nearly absolute autocratic power over his wife, children, and slaves, including the power of life and death. In practice, the extreme form of this right was seldom exercised, and it was eventually limited by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Severy |first1=Beth |title=Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Roman Empire |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-30959-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book37.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious study of the [[New Testament Household Code]] ''(Haustafel)'' began with Martin Dilbelius in 1913, with a wide range of studies since then. In a [[Tübingen]] dissertation,&lt;ref&gt;Crouch. James E. ''The Origin and Intention of the Colossian Haustafel.'' Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; by James E. Crouch concludes that the early Christians found in Hellenistic Judaism a code which they adapted and Christianized.

The Staggs believe the several occurrences of the [[New Testament household code]] in the Bible were intended to meet the needs for ''order'' within the churches and in the society of the day. They maintain that the New Testament household code is an attempt by Paul and Peter to Christianize the concept of family relationships for Roman citizens who had become followers of Christ. The Staggs write that there is some suggestion in scripture that because Paul had taught that they had newly found freedom &quot;in Christ&quot;, wives, children, and slaves were taking improper advantage of the ''Haustafel'' both in the home and the church. 
&quot;The form of the code stressing reciprocal social duties is traced to Judaism's own Oriental background, with its strong moral/ethical demand but also with a low view of woman.... At bottom is probably to be seen the perennial tension between freedom and order.... What mattered to (Paul) was 'a new creation'{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|6:15}} and 'in Christ' there is 'not any Jew not Greek, not any slave nor free, not any male and female'.{{Bibleref2c|Gal.|3:28}}&lt;ref name=Staggs/&gt;

Two of these Christianized codes are found in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21-33}} (which contains the phrases &quot;husband is the head of the wife&quot; and &quot;wives, submit to your husband&quot;) and in {{Bibleref2|Colossians|3:18-4:1}}, which instructs wives to subordinate themselves to their husbands.

The importance of the meaning of &quot;head&quot; as used by the [[Apostle Paul]] is pivotal in the conflict between the Complementarian position and the Egalitarian view. The word Paul used for &quot;head&quot;, transliterated from Greek, is ''kephalē''. Today's English word &quot;cephalic&quot; ({{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|f|æ|l|ᵻ|k}} {{Respell|sə|FAL|ik}}) stems from the Greek ''kephalē'' and means &quot;of or relating to the head; or located on, in, or near the head.&quot; A thorough concordance search by [[Catherine Kroeger]] shows that the most frequent use of &quot;head&quot; ''(kephalē)'' in the New Testament is to refer to &quot;the anatomical head of a body&quot;. She found that its second most frequent use in the New Testament was to convey the metaphorical sense of &quot;source&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Catherine Clark. &quot;Toward an Understanding of Ancient Conceptions of 'Head'&quot;. ''Priscilla Papers,'' Volume 20:3, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Alan F. &quot;A Meta-Study of the Debate over the Meaning of 'Head' (Kephale) in Paul's Writings. ''Priscilla Papers, '' Volume 20:4, Autumn 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Other Egalitarian authors such as Margaret Howe agree with Kroeger, writing that &quot;The word 'head' (in {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&amp;nbsp; Corinthians&amp;nbsp;11:3}} and other similar passages) must be understood not as 'ruler' but as 'source{{' &quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Howe, Women and Church Leadership (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1982), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wayne Grudem criticizes commonly rendering ''kephalē'' in those same passages only to mean &quot;source&quot;, and argues that it denotes &quot;authoritative head&quot; in such texts as {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:3||1&amp;nbsp;Corinthians&amp;nbsp;11:3}}. They interpret that verse to mean that [[God the father]] is the authoritative head over the [[Jesus Christ|Son]], and in turn Jesus is the authoritative head over the church, not simply its source. By extension, they then conclude that in marriage and in the church, the man is the authoritative head over the woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/tj/kephale_grudem.pdf Wayne Grudem, &quot;Does Kefale (&quot;Head&quot;) Mean &quot;Source&quot; Or &quot;Authority Over&quot; in Greek Literature? A Survey of 2,336 Examples&quot;] Trinity Journal ns 6.1 (Spring 1985): 38-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential way to define the word &quot;head&quot;, and hence the relationship between husband and wife as found in the Bible, is through the example given in the surrounding context in which the word is found.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:20-33}} In that context the husband and wife are compared to Christ and his church. The context seems to imply an authority structure based on a man sacrificing himself for his wife, as Christ did for the church; a love-based authority structure, where submission is not required but freely given based on the care given to the wife.&lt;ref&gt;Wickstrom, Mark. ''The Gospel of Grace.'' Beaver Pond Press, 2008.{{ISBN|978-1-59298-232-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some biblical references on this subject are debated depending on one's school of theology. The [[Historical-grammatical method|historical grammatical method]] is a [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] technique that strives to uncover the meaning of the text by taking into account not just the grammatical words, but also the syntactical aspects, the cultural and historical background, and the literary genre. Thus references to a patriarchal Biblical culture may or may not be relevant to other societies. What is believed to be a timeless truth to one person or denomination may be considered a cultural norm or minor opinion to another.

=== {{anchor|Egalitarian view}} Egalitarian view ===
{{See also|Christian egalitarianism}}

Christian Egalitarians (from the French word &quot;égal&quot; meaning &quot;equal&quot;) believe that Christian marriage is intended to be a marriage without any hierarchy—a full and equal partnership between the wife and husband. They emphasize that nowhere in the New Testament is there a requirement for a wife to ''obey'' her husband. While &quot;obey&quot; was introduced into marriage vows for much of the church during the Middle Ages, its only New Testament support is found in {{Bibleref2|1pet|3:6||1&amp;nbsp;Peter&amp;nbsp;3:6}}, with that only being by implication from Sarah's obedience to Abraham.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|p.190}} Scriptures such as {{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}} state that in Christ, right relationships are restored and in him, &quot;there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female.&quot;&lt;ref name=CBE&gt;Christians for Biblical Equality. &quot;Men, Women and Biblical Equality&quot;. Ltd. CBE on the Web at &quot;Biblical Equality&quot;, 1989. [www.cbeinternational.org/?q=content/men-women-and-biblical-equality.] Accessed 5 Mar 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Egalitarians interpret scripture to mean that God intended spouses to practice ''mutual submission'', each in equality with the other. The phrase &quot;mutual submission&quot; comes from a verse in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:21}} which precedes advice for the three domestic relationships of the day, including slavery. It reads, &quot;Submit to one another ('mutual submission') out of reverence for Christ&quot;, wives to husbands, children to parents, and slaves to their master. Christian Egalitarians believe that full partnership in marriage is the most biblical view, producing the most intimate, wholesome, and reciprocally fulfilling marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Aída Besançon, William Spencer. ''Marriage at the Crossroads''. InterVarsity Press, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-8308-2890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian Egalitarian view&lt;ref&gt;Christian Egalitarian view as differentiated from humanistic egalitarianism&lt;/ref&gt; of marriage asserts that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that [[women]] and [[men]] are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.&lt;ref name=Groothuis2&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. &quot;The Bible and Gender Equality.&quot; [www.cbeinternational.org Christians for Biblical Equality Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; A foundational belief of Christian Egalitarians is that the husband and wife are created equally and are ordained of God to &quot;become one&quot;, a biblical principle first ordained by God in {{Bibleref2|Genesis|2:24}}, reaffirmed by Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew|19:4-6}} and {{Bibleref2|Mark|10:6-8}}, and by the [[Apostle Paul]] in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:30-32}}. Therefore, they see that &quot;oneness&quot; as pointing to [[gender equality]] in marriage. They believe the biblical model for Christian marriages is therefore for the spouses to share equal responsibility within the family—not one over the other nor one under the other.

David Dykes, theologian, author, and pastor of a 15,000-member Baptist church, sermonized that &quot;When you are in Christ, you have full equality with all other believers&quot;. In a sermon he entitled &quot;The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross&quot;, he said that some theologians have called one particular Bible verse the Christian ''[[Magna Carta]]''. The Bible verse reads: &quot;There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&quot; ({{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28|NIV}}). Acknowledging the differences between men and women, Dykes writes that &quot;in Christ, these differences don't define who we are. The only category that really matters in the world is whether you are '''in Christ'''. At the cross, Jesus destroyed all the made-made{{Clarify|date=August 2018}} barriers of hostility:&quot; ethnicity, social status, and gender.&lt;ref&gt;Dykes, David O. &quot;[http://www.preaching.com/sermons/11682921/page-3/ The Ground Is Level at the Foot of the Cross]&quot;.

Those of the egalitarian persuasion point to the biblical instruction that all Christian believers, irrespective of gender, are to submit or be subject &quot;to one another in the fear of God&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21|KJV|Eph.&amp;nbsp;5:21&amp;nbsp;KJV}} or &quot;out of reverence for Christ&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21|NIV|NIV}} [[Gilbert Bilezikian]] writes that in the highly debated Ephesians&amp;nbsp;5 passage, the verb &quot;to be subject&quot; or &quot;to be submitted&quot; appears in verse&amp;nbsp;21 which he describes as serving as a &quot;hinge&quot; between two different sections. The first section consists of verses 18-20, verse 21 is the connection between the two, and the second section consists of verses 22-33.&lt;ref name=Bilezikian&gt;Bilezikian, Gilbert.

Advocates of [[Christian egalitarianism]] believe that this model has firm biblical support:
*The word translated &quot;help&quot; or &quot;helper&quot; in {{bibleref2|Genesis|2:18}} until quite recently was generally understood to subordinate a wife to her husband. The KJV translates it as God saying, &quot;I will make a help meet for him&quot;. The first distortion was extrabiblical: the noun &quot;help&quot; and the adjective &quot;meet&quot; traditionally have been combined into a new noun, &quot;helpmate&quot;. Thus, wives were often referred to as her husband's &quot;helpmate&quot;. Next, from the word &quot;help&quot; were drawn inferences of authority/subjection distinctions between men and women. &quot;Helper&quot; was taken to mean that husband was boss and wife his domestic. It is now realized that of the 21 times the Hebrew word 'ezer is used in the Old Testament, in eight of those instances the term clearly means &quot;savior&quot;—another word for Jehovah God. For example, {{Bibleref2|Psalm|33:20}} says &quot;the Lord…is our help ('ezer) and shield&quot;. {{Bibleref2|Psalm|121:1-2}} reads &quot;I lift up my eyes to the mountains—where does my help ('ezer) come from? My help ('ezer) comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.&quot; That Hebrew word is not used in the Bible with reference to any subordinate person such a servant.&lt;ref name=Bilezikian/&gt;{{rp|p.28}} Thus, forms of 'ezer in the Hebrew Bible can mean either &quot;to save&quot; or &quot;to be strong&quot; or have the idea of power and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, R. David. ''Biblical Archaeology Review''. Jan/Feb 1983, pp. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;
*The &quot;two becoming one&quot; concept, first cited in {{bibleref2|Gen.|2:24}}, was quoted by Jesus in his teachings on marriage and recorded almost identically in the gospels of both Matthew and Mark.{{bibleref2c|Matt.|19:4–6}} {{bibleref2c|Mk.|10:7–9}} In those passages Jesus reemphasized the concept by adding a divine postscript to the Genesis passage: &quot;So, they are no longer two, but one&quot; (NIV).
*The Apostle Paul also quoted the Genesis 2:24 passage in {{bibleref2|Ephesians|5:1}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot;/&gt; Describing it as a &quot;profound mystery&quot;, he analogizes it to &quot;Christ and the church&quot;.{{Bibleref2c|Eph.|5:32}} Then Paul states that every husband must love his wife as he loves himself.{{Bibleref2c-nb|Eph.|5:33}}
*Jesus actually ''forbids'' any hierarchy of relationships in Christian relationships. All three [[synoptic gospels]] record virtually the same teaching of Jesus, adding to its apparent significance:&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. ''Jesus and the Gospels.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. {{ISBN|0-567-04073-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bibleref2c|Matt.|20:25–26||Matt.&amp;nbsp;20:25–26a}} {{bibleref2c|Mark|10:42-45}} {{bibleref2c|Luke|22:25-27}}
*The [[Apostle Paul]] calls on husbands and wives to be subject ''to each other'' out of reverence for Christ—mutual submission.{{bibleref2c|Eph.|5:21}}
*As persons, husband and wife are of equal value. There is no priority of one spouse over the other. In truth, they are one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Staggs&quot; /&gt; Bible scholar [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]] and Classicist [[Evelyn Stagg]] write that husband-wife equality produces the most intimate, wholesome and mutually fulfilling marriages. They conclude that the Apostle Paul's statement, sometimes called the &quot;Magna Carta of Humanity&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jewett, Paul K. ''Man as Male and Female: A Study in Sexual Relationships from a Theological Point of View.'' Eerdmans, 1990, p. 142. {{ISBN|978-0-8028-1597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recorded in {{bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}, applies to all Christian relationships, including Christian marriage: &quot;There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is ''neither male nor female'': for you are all ''one'' in Christ Jesus.&quot;
*The Apostle Peter calls husbands and wives &quot;joint heirs of the grace of life&quot; and cautions a husband who is not considerate to his wife and does not treat her with respect that his prayers will be hindered.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|3:7||1&amp;nbsp;Peter&amp;nbsp;3:7}}
*Each of the six times [[Aquila and Priscilla|Aquila and his wife Priscilla]] are mentioned by name in the New Testament, they are listed together. Their order of appearance alternates, with Aquila mentioned first in the first, third and fifth mentions, and Priscilla (Prisca) first in the other three.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|18:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:18|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:26|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|16:3|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|16:19|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:19|KJV}} King James Version&lt;/ref&gt; Some revisions of the Bible put Priscilla first, instead of Aquila, in Acts 18:26, following the Vulgate and a few Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Acts%2018:26 Acts 18:26 multi-version]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest that Priscilla was the head of the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*Among spouses, it is possible to submit without love, but it is impossible to love without submitting mutually to each other.{{Bibleref2c|Col.|3:8-9}}

The egalitarian paradigm leaves it up to the couple to decide who is responsible for what task or function in the home. Such decisions should be made rationally and wisely,{{Bibleref2c|Eph|5:15}} not based on gender or tradition. Examples of a couple's decision logic might include:
*which spouse is ''more competent'' for a particular task or function;
*which has ''better access'' to it;
*or if they decide both are similarly competent and have comparable access, they might make the decision based on who ''prefers'' that function or task, or conversely, which of them ''dislikes it less'' than the other. The egalitarian view holds that decisions about managing family responsibilities are made rationally through cooperation and negotiation, not on the basis of tradition (e.g., &quot;man's work&quot; or &quot;woman's&quot; work), nor any other irrelevant or irrational basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMC&quot;&gt;{{cite web

=== Complementarian view ===
{{See also|Complementarianism}}

Complementarians hold to a hierarchical structure between husband and wife. They believe men and women have different gender-specific roles that allow each to ''complement'' the other, hence the designation &quot;Complementarians&quot;. The Complementarian view of marriage holds that while the husband and wife are of equal worth before God, husbands and wives are given different functions and responsibilities by God that are based on gender, and that male leadership is biblically ordained so that the husband is always the senior authority figure. They state they &quot;observe with deep concern&quot; &quot;accompanying distortions or neglect of the glad harmony portrayed in Scripture between the intelligent, humble leadership of redeemed husbands and the loving, willing support of that leadership by redeemed wives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ Core Beliefs{{snd}} the &quot;Danvers Statement&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626082957/http://cbmw.org/core-beliefs/ |date=2014-06-26 }}.

According to Complementarian authors [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]], [[Wayne Grudem]], and others, historically, but to a significantly lesser extent in most of Christianity today, the predominant position in both Catholicism and conservative Protestantism places the male as the &quot;head&quot; in the home and in the church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Recovering_Biblical_Manhood_Womanhood.html?id=NHPxcYNV0BwC John Piper, Wayne Grudem, ''Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism]'', p. 165; Crossway, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mr. David Blankenhorn, (ed.), Mr. Don S.

[[Roman Catholic Church]] teaching on the role of women includes that of Pope Leo XIII in his 1880 encyclical ''Arcanum'' which states:
{{Quotation|The husband is the chief of the family and the head of the wife. The woman, because she is flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, must be subject to her husband and obey him; not, indeed, as a servant, but as a companion, so that her obedience shall be wanting in neither honor nor dignity. Since the husband represents Christ, and since the wife represents the Church, let there always be, both in him who commands and in her who obeys, a heaven-born love guiding both in their respective duties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pope Leo XIII Encyclical 1880 Arcanum {{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum_en.html |title=Arcanum Divinae (February 10, 1880) &amp;#124; LEO XIII |accessdate=2009-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622095840/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_10021880_arcanum_en.html |archivedate=2009-06-22 }} 1880 Arcanum]&lt;/ref&gt; This position was affirmed in the 1930 encyclical ''Casti Connubii,'' which invokes {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|5:22}}, &quot;Let women be subject to their husbands as to the Lord, because the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ is the head of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121930_casti-connubii_en.html, Pope Pius XI, Casti Connubii]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Biblical patriarchy===
{{see also|Biblical patriarchy|Pater familias}}

The patriarchal model of marriage is clearly the oldest one.{{According to whom|date=September 2019}} It characterized the theological understanding of most Old Testament writers. It mandates the supremacy, at times the ultimate domination, of the husband-father in the family. In the first century Roman Empire, in the time of Jesus, Paul, and Peter, it was the law of the land and gave the husband absolute authority over his wife, children, and slaves—even the power of life or death. It subordinates all women.

Biblical patriarchy is similar to [[Complementarianism]] but with differences of degree and emphasis. Biblical patriarchists carry the husband-headship model considerably further and with more militancy. While Complementarians also hold to exclusively male leadership in both the home and the church, Biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not be civil leaders&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/ballot_box/should_christians_support_a_wo.aspx Should Christians Support a Woman for the Office of Civil Magistrate?].&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed should not have careers outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/called_to_the_home_called_to_r.aspx Called to the Home — Called to Rule].&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriarchy is based on authoritarianism—complete obedience or subjection to male authority as opposed to individual freedom. Patriarchy gives preeminence to the male in essentially all matters of religion and culture. It explicitly deprives all women of social, political, and economic rights. The marriage relationship simply reinforced this dominance of women by men, providing religious, cultural, and legal structures that clearly favor patriarchy to the exclusion of even basic human dignity for wives.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Are “The Tenets of Biblical Patriarchy” Biblical? Part 1&quot;. {{cite web |url=http://rethinkingvisionforum.org/2011/08/11/are-%E2%80%9Cthe-biblical-tenets-of-patriarchy%E2%80%9D-biblical-part-1/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114657/http://rethinkingvisionforum.org/2011/08/11/are-%E2%80%9Cthe-biblical-tenets-of-patriarchy%E2%80%9D-biblical-part-1/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 }} 16 Mar 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically in classical patriarchy, the wives and children were always legally dependent upon the father, as were the slaves and other servants. It was the way of life throughout most of the Old Testament, religiously, legally, and culturally. However, it was not unique to Hebrew thought. With only minor variations, it characterized virtually every pagan culture of that day—including all Pre-Christian doctrine and practice.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

While Scripture allowed this approach in Old Testament times, nowhere does the Bible ordain it. In the Hebrew nation, patriarchy seems to have evolved as an expression of male dominance and supremacy, and of a double standard that prevailed throughout much of the Old Testament. Its contemporary advocates insist that it is the only biblically valid model for marriage today. They argue that it was established at Creation, and thus is a firm, unalterable decree of God about the relative positions of men and women.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/446579/patria-potestas | title=Patria potestas &amp;#124; Roman law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biblical patriarchists see what they describe as a crisis of this era being what they term to be a systematic attack on the &quot;timeless truths of biblical patriarchy&quot;. They believe such an attack includes the movement to &quot;subvert the biblical model of the family, and redefine the very meaning of fatherhood and motherhood, masculinity, femininity, and the parent and child relationship.&quot;&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt; Arguing from the biblical presentation of God revealing himself &quot;as masculine, not feminine&quot;, they believe God ordained distinct gender roles for man and woman as part of the created order. They say &quot;Adam’s headship over Eve was established at the beginning, before sin entered the world&quot;. Their view is that the male has God-given authority and mandate to direct &quot;his&quot; household in paths of obedience to God. They refer to man's &quot;dominion&quot; beginning within the home, and a man's qualification to lead and ability to lead well in the public square is based upon his prior success in ''ruling his household''.&lt;ref name=Patriarchy/&gt;

Thus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as &quot;two-point Complementarianism&quot; (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as &quot;three-point&quot; or &quot;full&quot; complementarianism (male leadership in family, church ''and society'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionforumministries.org/issues/family/men_and_women_and_the_creation.aspx Men and Women and the Creation Order, Part 1 - Vision Forum Ministries]&lt;/ref&gt;

The patriarchists teach that &quot;the woman was created as a helper to her husband, as the bearer of children, and as a &quot;keeper at home&quot;, concluding that the God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household. Biblical patriarchists consider that &quot;faithfulness to Christ requires that (Biblical patriarchy) be believed, taught, and lived&quot;. They claim that the &quot;man is...the image and glory of God in terms of authority, while the woman is the glory of man&quot;. They teach that a wife is to be ''obedient'' to her &quot;head&quot; (husband), based upon [[Old Testament]] teachings and models.
