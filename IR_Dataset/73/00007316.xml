The possibility of life-forms being based on &quot;alternative&quot; biochemistries is the topic of an ongoing scientific discussion, informed by what is known about extraterrestrial environments and about the chemical behaviour of various elements and compounds. It is of interest in [[synthetic biology]] and is also a [[science fiction theme|common subject in science fiction]].

The element [[silicon]] has been much discussed as a hypothetical alternative to carbon. Silicon is in the same group as carbon on the [[periodic table]] and, like carbon, it is [[tetravalent]]. Hypothetical alternatives to water include [[ammonia]], which, like water, is a [[chemical polarity|polar]] molecule, and cosmically abundant; and non-polar [[hydrocarbon]] solvents such as [[methane]] and [[ethane]], which are known to exist in liquid form on the surface of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

===Alternative-chirality biomolecules===
Perhaps the least unusual alternative biochemistry would be one with differing [[Left-handed protein|chirality]] of its biomolecules. In known Earth-based life, [[amino acid]]s are almost universally of the {{small|L}} form and [[sugar]]s are of the {{small|D}} form. Molecules using {{small|D}} amino acids or {{small|L}} sugars may be possible; molecules of such a chirality, however, would be incompatible with organisms using the opposing chirality molecules. Amino acids whose chirality is opposite to the norm are found on Earth, and these substances are generally thought to result from decay of organisms of normal chirality.  However, physicist [[Paul Davies]] speculates that some of them might be products of &quot;anti-chiral&quot; life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P.C.W. Davies |author2=Charles H. Lineweaver |title=Hypothesis Paper: Finding a Second Sample of Life on Earth|date=2005|journal=Astrobiology|volume= 5|issue= 2|pages=154–63 |url= http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~charley/papers/DaviesLineweaverOnline05.pdf |doi= 10.1089/ast.2005.5.154 |pmid=15815166 | bibcode= 2005AsBio...5..154D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is questionable, however, whether such a biochemistry would be truly alien. Although it would certainly be an alternative [[stereochemistry]], molecules that are overwhelmingly found in one [[enantiomer]] throughout the vast majority of organisms can nonetheless often be found in another enantiomer in different (often [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]) organisms such as in comparisons between members of [[Archaea]] and other [[Domain (biology)|domains]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} making it an open topic whether an alternative stereochemistry is truly novel.

=== Shadow biosphere ===
{{main|Shadow biosphere}}
[[Image:Arecibo message.svg|upright|thumb|The [[Arecibo message]] (1974) sent information into space about basic chemistry of Earth life.]]
A shadow biosphere is a hypothetical [[microbe|microbial]] [[biosphere]] of Earth that uses radically different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] processes than currently known life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = P.

===Carbon-based alternate biochemistries===
====Arsenic as an alternative to phosphorus====
{{see also|GFAJ-1}}
[[Arsenic]], which is chemically similar to [[phosphorus]], while poisonous for most [[organism|life forms]] on Earth, is incorporated into the biochemistry of some organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umbbd.ethz.ch/periodic/elements/as.html |title=Biochemical Periodic Table – Arsenic |publisher=UMBBD |date=2007-06-08 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[marine algae]] incorporate arsenic into complex organic molecules such as [[arsenosugar]]s and [[arsenobetaine]]s. [[Fungi]] and [[bacteria]] can produce volatile methylated arsenic compounds. Arsenate reduction and arsenite oxidation have been observed in [[microbes]] (''[[Chrysiogenes arsenatis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Appl Environ Microbiol|date=December 2001| volume=67| issue=12| pages=5568–80| title= Isolation and characterization of a novel As(V)-reducing bacterium: implications for arsenic mobilization and the genus Desulfitobacterium| last= Niggemyer| first= A|author2=Spring S |author3=Stackebrandt E |author4=Rosenzweig RF | doi=10.1128/AEM.67.12.5568-5580.2001| pmid= 11722908| pmc= 93345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some [[prokaryote]]s can use arsenate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic growth and some can utilize arsenite as an electron donor to generate energy.

It has been speculated that the earliest life forms on Earth may have used [[Arsenic biochemistry]] in place of phosphorus in the structure of their DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/mg19826533.600-early-life-could-have-relied-on-arsenic-dna.html| journal=New Scientist| title= Early life could have relied on 'arsenic DNA'| date= 26 April 2008| first= Michael| last= Reilly| issue= 2653| doi= 10.1016/S0262-4079(08)61007-6| volume= 198| page= 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common objection to this scenario is that arsenate esters are so much less stable to [[hydrolysis]] than corresponding [[Organophosphate|phosphate esters]] that arsenic is poorly suited for this function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Westheimer&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Westheimer  |first=F.

The authors of a 2010 [[geomicrobiology]] study, supported in part by NASA, have postulated that a bacterium, named [[GFAJ-1]], collected in the sediments of [[Mono Lake]] in eastern [[California]], can employ such 'arsenic DNA' when cultured without phosphorus.&lt;ref name=&quot;nasafund&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA-Funded Research Discovers Life Built With Toxic Chemical |publisher=NASA.gov |date=2 December 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-02 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/astrobiology_toxic_chemical.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolfe-Simon&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolfe-Simon |first=Felisa |last2=Blum |first2=Jodi Switzer |last3=Kulp |first3=Thomas R. |last4=Gordon |first4=Shelley E. |last5=Hoeft |last6=Pett-Ridge |first6=Jennifer |last7=Stolz |first7=John F. |last8=Webb |first8=Samuel M. |last9=Weber |first9=Peter K. |last10=Davies |first10=Paul C.

Other authors were unable to reproduce their results and showed that the study had issues with phosphate contamination, suggesting that the low amounts present could sustain extremophile lifeforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/news/Arsenic-Life-Claim-Refuted/biotechniques-332691.html#.UQBYhx3O3zk | title = &quot;Arsenic Life&quot; Claim Refuted | accessdate = 23 January 2013 | last = Williams | first = Sarah | date = 7 November 2012 | work = BioTechniques | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054417/http://www.biotechniques.com/news/Arsenic-Life-Claim-Refuted/biotechniques-332691.html#.UQBYhx3O3zk | archive-date = 4 March 2016 | url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, it was suggested that GFAJ-1 cells grow by recycling phosphate from degraded ribosomes, rather than by replacing it with arsenate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Harris TK and Deutscher MP | last=Basturea GN | title= Growth of a bacterium that apparently uses arsenic instead of phosphorus is a consequence of massive ribosome breakdown | date=17 August 2012 | pmid=22798070 | doi=10.1074/jbc.C112.394403 | volume=287 | issue=34 | journal=J Biol Chem | pages=28816–9 | pmc=3436571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-carbon-based biochemistries===
On Earth, all known living things have a carbon-based structure and system. Scientists have speculated about the pros and cons of using [[atom]]s other than carbon to form the molecular structures necessary for life, but no one has proposed a theory employing such atoms to form all the necessary structures. However, as [[Carl Sagan]] argued, it is very difficult to be certain whether a statement that applies to all life on Earth will turn out to apply to all life throughout the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|first2=Jerome|last2=Agel|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| date=2000|isbn= 9780521783033|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan used the term &quot;[[carbon chauvinism]]&quot; for such an assumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagan 2000page=46 46&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| date=2000 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded [[silicon]] and [[germanium]] as conceivable alternatives to carbon;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagan 2000page=46 46&quot;/&gt; (other plausible elements include but aren't limited to palladium and titanium) but, on the other hand, he noted that carbon does seem more chemically versatile and is more abundant in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection: an Extraterrestrial Perspective| first=Carl| last= Sagan|edition=2nd|publisher=Cambridge U.P.| date=2000|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silicon biochemistry====
{{see also|Organosilicon}}
[[File:Silane.png|thumb|right|120px|Structure of [[silane]], analog of [[methane]]]]
[[File:PDMS.svg|thumb|right|Structure of the silicone [[polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS)]]
[[File:Diatom2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Marine [[diatoms]]—carbon-based organisms that extract silicon from sea water, in the form of its oxide (silica) and incorporate it into their cell walls]]
The silicon atom has been much discussed as the basis for an alternative biochemical system, because silicon has many [[chemical property|chemical properties]] similar to those of carbon and is in the same [[group (periodic table)|group of the periodic table]], the [[carbon group]]. Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Pace|first1 = N.&amp;nbsp;R. |title = The universal nature of biochemistry |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume = 98 |issue = 3 |pages = 805–808 |date = 2001 |pmid = 11158550 |pmc = 33372 |doi = 10.1073/pnas.98.3.805 |bibcode=2001PNAS...98..805P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, silicon has several drawbacks as an alternative to carbon. Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;/&gt; Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as &quot;monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace&quot;/&gt; This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).

[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;world-building&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Gillette |title=World-Building |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |isbn=978-0-89879-707-7|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the varieties of molecules identified in the [[interstellar medium]] {{As of|1998|lc=on}}, 84 are based on carbon, while only 8 are based on silicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html |title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon? Why couldn't organisms be based on other substances? |work=[sci.astro] ET Life (Astronomy Frequently Asked Questions) |accessdate=2006-07-21 |first=Joseph |last=Lazio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, of those 8 compounds, 4 also include carbon within them. The [[Abundance of the chemical elements|cosmic abundance]] of carbon to silicon is roughly 10 to 1. This may suggest a greater variety of complex carbon compounds throughout the cosmos, providing less of a foundation on which to build silicon-based biologies, at least under the conditions prevalent on the surface of planets. Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. Reasons for which may be that silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds, that the compounds formed by silicon are unstable, and that it blocks the flow of heat.&lt;ref name=BC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the [[silicate]] skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s. According to the [[Abiogenesis#Clay hypothesis|clay hypothesis]] of [[Graham Cairns-Smith|A. G. Cairns-Smith]], silicate minerals in water played a crucial role in [[abiogenesis]]: they replicated their crystal structures, interacted with carbon compounds, and were the precursors of carbon-based life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cairns-Smith |first=A.

Although not observed in nature, carbon–silicon bonds have been added to biochemistry by using directed evolution (artificial selection).

Silicon compounds may possibly be biologically useful under temperatures or pressures different from the surface of a terrestrial planet, either in conjunction with or in a role less directly analogous to carbon. Polysilanols, the silicon compounds corresponding to [[sugar]]s, are soluble in liquid nitrogen, suggesting that they could play a role in very-low-temperature biochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Astrobiology—the nature of life |publisher=WilliamBains.co.uk |author=William Bains |accessdate=2015-03-20 |url=http://www.williambains.co.uk/astrobiology/life2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=William Bains |title=Many Chemistries Could Be Used to Build Living Systems |date=June 2004 |journal=[[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=137–167 |doi=10.1089/153110704323175124 |pmid=15253836 |bibcode=2004AsBio...4..137B|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/321cabdb19e7debb78613ef38b925475b9f4580d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cinematic and literary science fiction, at a moment when man-made machines cross from nonliving to living, it is often posited,{{by whom|date=December 2018}} this new form would be the first example of non-carbon-based life. Since the advent of the [[microprocessor]] in the late 1960s, these machines are often classed as [[computer]]s (or computer-guided [[robot]]s) and filed under &quot;silicon-based life&quot;, even though the silicon backing matrix of these processors is not nearly as fundamental to their operation as carbon is for &quot;wet life&quot;.

====Other exotic element-based biochemistries====
{{see also|Organoboron chemistry}}
* [[Boranes]] are dangerously explosive in Earth's atmosphere, but would be more stable in a reducing environment. However, boron's low cosmic abundance makes it less likely as a base for life than carbon.
* Various metals, together with oxygen, can form very complex and thermally stable structures rivaling those of organic compounds;{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} the [[heteropoly acid]]s are one such family. Some metal oxides are also similar to carbon in their ability to form both nanotube structures and diamond-like crystals (such as [[cubic zirconia]]). [[Titanium]], [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], and [[iron]] are all more abundant in the Earth's crust than carbon. Metal-oxide-based life could therefore be a possibility under certain conditions, including those (such as high temperatures) at which carbon-based life would be unlikely. The Cronin group at Glasgow University reported self-assembly of tungsten [[polyoxometalate]]s into cell-like spheres.&lt;ref name='Cronin'&gt;{{cite magazine | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20906-lifelike-cells-are-made-of-metal.html | title = Life-like cells are made of metal | accessdate = 2014-05-25 | date = September 14, 2011 | magazine = New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; By modifying their metal oxide content, the spheres can acquire holes that act as porous membrane, selectively allowing chemicals in and out of the sphere according to size.&lt;ref name='Cronin'/&gt;
* [[Sulfur]] is also able to form long-chain molecules, but suffers from the same high-reactivity problems as phosphorus and silanes. The biological use of sulfur as an alternative to carbon is purely hypothetical, especially because sulfur usually forms only linear chains rather than branched ones. (The biological use of sulfur as an electron acceptor is widespread and can be traced back 3.5&amp;nbsp;billion years on Earth, thus predating the use of molecular oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/5844/1534 Early Archaean Microorganisms Preferred Elemental Sulfur, Not Sulfate] Science AAAS, by Philippot, et al., (14 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulfur-reducing bacteria]] can utilize elemental sulfur instead of oxygen, reducing sulfur to [[hydrogen sulfide]].)

===Non-water solvents===
[[File:Carl Sagan Viking.JPG|upright|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] speculated that alien life might use ammonia, hydrocarbons or hydrogen fluoride instead of water.]]
In addition to carbon compounds, all currently known terrestrial life also requires water as a solvent. This has led to discussions about whether water is the only liquid capable of filling that role. The idea that an extraterrestrial life-form might be based on a solvent other than water has been taken seriously in recent scientific literature by the biochemist [[Steven Benner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benner |first=Steven A. |last2=Ricardo | first2=Alonso |last3=Carrigan |first3=Matthew A |title=Is there a common chemical model for life in the universe? |date=2004 |journal=[[Current Opinion in Chemical Biology]] |volume=8|pages=676–680 |doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2004.10.003 |issue=6 |pmid=15556414}}[http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf Text as pdf from www.sciencedirect.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214063212/http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf |date=2010-12-14 }} (accessed 13 July 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; and by the astrobiological committee chaired by John A.

Carl Sagan once described himself as both a [[carbon chauvinist]] and a water chauvinist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sagan, Carl |title=Cosmos |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-375-50832-5 |publisher=Random House |pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, on another occasion he said that he was a carbon chauvinist but &quot;not that much of a water chauvinist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;conversations&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sagan, Carl |author2=Head, Tom |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00saga |url-access=registration |date=2006 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=978-1-57806-736-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00saga/page/10 10]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He speculated on hydrocarbons,&lt;ref name=&quot;conversations&quot;/&gt;{{rp|11}} [[hydrofluoric acid]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagan, Carl 2002 128&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sagan, Carl |title=Cosmos |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-375-50832-5 |publisher=Random House |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ammonia&lt;ref name=&quot;conversations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagan, Carl 2002 128&quot;/&gt;  as possible alternatives to water.

Some of the properties of water that are important for life processes include: 
* A complexity which leads to a large number of permutations of possible reaction paths including acid-base chemistry, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; anions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals bonding, dipole–dipole and other polar interactions, aqueous solvent cages, and hydrolysis. This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.
* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (−237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.
* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it is highly unlikely that those liquids could support aerobic life.
* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]].
* High solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life.
* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability).
* Water is a room-temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}
* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.
* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.
* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.
* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.

Water as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.

Not all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;barosswater&quot;&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;barosswater&quot;/&gt; meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;barosswater&quot;/&gt;

There are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&amp;nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.

====Ammonia====
[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]
The [[ammonia]] molecule (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;asimov&quot;/&gt; The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&amp;nbsp;B.&amp;nbsp;S. Haldane]] raised the topic at a symposium about life's origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;haldane&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=J. B. S. Haldane |date=1954 |title=The Origins of Life |journal=New Biology |volume=16 |pages=12–27}} cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ |title=Ammonia-based life |last=Darling |first=David |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html |archivedate=2012-10-18 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2012-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous chemical reactions are possible in an ammonia solution, and liquid ammonia has chemical similarities with water.&lt;ref name=&quot;asimov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ddammonia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia can dissolve most organic molecules at least as well as water does and, in addition, it is capable of dissolving many elemental metals. Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (−OH).&lt;ref name=&quot;ddammonia&quot;/&gt;

Ammonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. When ammonia accepts an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). When it donates an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;barossammonia&quot;/&gt; Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;barossammonia&quot;/&gt; Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.&lt;ref name=&quot;ddammonia&quot;/&gt; The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;barossammonia&quot;/&gt;

However, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect. Gerald Feinberg and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life Beyond Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/lifebeyondearthi0000fein |url-access=registration |first=Gerald |last= Feinberg |author2=Robert Shapiro |publisher=Morrow |date=1980 |isbn=9780688036423}} cited in {{cite web | url = http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html/ | title = ammonia-based life | accessdate = 2012-10-01 | last = Darling | first = David | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095038/http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/ammonialife.html | archivedate = 2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for [[aerobic metabolism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dsmammonia&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |first=Dirk |last= Schulze-Makuch |first2=Louis Neal |last2=Irwin |publisher=Springer |edition=2 |date=2008 |isbn= 9783540768166 |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Layers of titan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Titan's theorized internal structure, subsurface ocean shown in blue]]
A [[biosphere]] based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth. Life on Earth usually exists within the melting point and [[boiling point]] of water at [[normal pressure]], between 0&amp;nbsp;°C (273&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) and 100&amp;nbsp;°C (373&amp;nbsp;K); at normal pressure ammonia's melting and boiling points are between −78&amp;nbsp;°C (195&amp;nbsp;K) and −33&amp;nbsp;°C (240&amp;nbsp;K). Chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at a lower temperature. Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsmammonia&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.&lt;ref name=&quot;asimov&quot;/&gt;

Ammonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at −77&amp;nbsp;°C (196&amp;nbsp;K) and boils at 98&amp;nbsp;°C (371&amp;nbsp;K).&lt;ref name=&quot;barossammonia&quot;/&gt;

Ammonia and ammonia–water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]]. Such conditions could exist, for example, under the surface of [[Saturn]]'s largest moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/research/planetary/undergraduate/dom/titan/titan.htm |title=Exobiological Implications of a Possible Ammonia-Water Ocean Inside Titan |last=Fortes |first=A.

====Methane and other hydrocarbons====
[[Methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a simple hydrocarbon: that is, a compound of two of the most common elements in the cosmos: hydrogen and carbon. It has a cosmic abundance comparable with ammonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;asimov&quot;/&gt; Hydrocarbons could act as a solvent over a wide range of temperatures, but would lack [[chemical polarity|polarity]]. Isaac Asimov, the [[biochemist]] and science fiction writer, suggested in 1981 that poly-[[lipids]] could form a substitute for proteins in a non-polar solvent such as methane.&lt;ref name=&quot;asimov&quot;/&gt; Lakes composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons, including methane and [[ethane]], have been detected on the surface of Titan by the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' spacecraft]].

There is debate about the effectiveness of methane and other hydrocarbons as a solvent for life compared to water or ammonia.&lt;ref name=&quot;methanesolvent&quot;&gt;Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&amp;page=74 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polyesters&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solubility of Polyethers in Hydrocarbons at Low Temperatures.

Astrobiologist [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Chris McKay]] has argued, on thermodynamic grounds, that if life does exist on Titan's surface, using hydrocarbons as a solvent, it is likely also to use the more complex hydrocarbons as an energy source by reacting them with hydrogen, [[redox|reducing]] ethane and [[acetylene]] to methane.&lt;ref name=&quot;mckay&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Icarus |volume= 178 |issue = 1 |pages = 274–276 |date= 2005 |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018 |title = Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan |author1=McKay, C.

====Azotosome====
A hypothetical [[cell membrane]] termed an ''azotosome'' capable of functioning in liquid [[methane]] in Titan conditions was computer-modeled in an article published in February 2015. Composed of [[acrylonitrile]], a small molecule containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, it is predicted to have stability and flexibility in liquid methane comparable to that of a [[phospholipid bilayer]] (the type of cell membrane possessed by all life on Earth) in liquid water.&lt;ref name=azotosomepaper&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevenson |first1=James |last2=Lunine |first2=Jonathan |last3=Clancy |first3=Paulette |title=Membrane alternatives in worlds without oxygen: Creation of an azotosome |journal=Science Advances |date=27 Feb 2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1400067 |pmid=26601130 |pmc=4644080 |pages=e1400067 |bibcode=2015SciA....1E0067S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=azotosomemodel&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2015-02-life-saturn-moon-titan.html Life 'not as we know it' possible on Saturn's moon Titan].&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of data obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA), completed in 2017, confirmed substantial amounts of acrylonitrile in Titan's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP-20170728&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Wall |first=Mike |title=Saturn Moon Titan Has Molecules That Could Help Make Cell Membranes |url=https://www.space.com/37653-saturn-moon-titan-cell-membrane-molecules.html |date=28 July 2017 |work=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SA-20170728&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Palmer, Maureen Y.|display-authors=etal |title=ALMA detection and astrobiological potential of vinyl cyanide on Titan |date=28 July 2017 |journal=[[Science Advances]] |volume =3 |number=7 |doi= 10.1126/sciadv.1700022 |pmc=5533535 |bibcode=2017SciA....3E0022P |pmid=28782019 |page=e1700022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hydrogen fluoride====
[[Hydrogen fluoride]] (HF), like water, is a polar molecule, and due to its polarity it can dissolve many ionic compounds. Its melting point is −84&amp;nbsp;°C, and its boiling point is 19.54&amp;nbsp;°C (at [[atmospheric pressure]]); the difference between the two is a little more than 100&amp;nbsp;K. HF also makes hydrogen bonds with its neighbor molecules, as do water and ammonia. It has been considered as a possible solvent for life by scientists such as Peter Sneath&lt;ref name=&quot;sneath&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Planets and Life |last=Sneath |first=P.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;A. |date=1970 |publisher=Thames and Hudson}} cited in {{cite book |title=Extraterrestrial Encounter |last=Boyce |first=Chris |date=1981 |publisher=New English Library |pages=125, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carl Sagan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagan, Carl 2002 128&quot;/&gt;

HF is dangerous to the systems of molecules that Earth-life is made of, but certain other organic compounds, such as [[paraffin wax]]es, are stable with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sagan, Carl 2002 128&quot;/&gt; Like water and ammonia, liquid hydrogen fluoride supports an acid-base chemistry. Using a solvent system definition of acidity and basicity, [[nitric acid]] functions as a base when it is added to liquid HF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemistry in Nonaqueous Ionizing solvents: Inorganic Chemistry in Liquid Hydrogen Cyanide and Liquid hydrogen Fluoride |first=Gerhart |last= Jander |first2=Hans |last2= Spandau |first3=C.&amp;nbsp;C. |last3=Addison |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=N.Y. |date=1971 |volume=II}} cited in {{cite book |title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization |first=Robert A. |last= Freitas |publisher=Xenology Research Institute |location=Sacramento, CA |date=1979 |chapter=8.2.2 |chapter-url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/8.2.2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, hydrogen fluoride is cosmically rare, unlike water, ammonia, and methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization |first=Robert A. |last= Freitas |publisher=Xenology Research Institute |location=Sacramento, CA |date=1979 |chapter=8.2.2 |chapter-url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/8.2.2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hydrogen sulfide====
[[Hydrogen sulfide]] is the closest [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|chemical analog to water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/solvent.html | title = solvent | accessdate = 2012-10-12 | last = Darling | first = David}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is less polar and a weaker inorganic solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Ionizing Solvents| first=J.| last= Jander| first2=C.| last2=Lafrenz | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., Verlag Chemie| location=Weinheim/Bergstr.| date=1970|volume=I}} cited in {{cite book| title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization| first=Robert A.| last= Freitas| publisher=Xenology Research Institute| location=Sacramento, CA| date=1979 |chapter=8.2.2 |chapter-url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/8.2.2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen sulfide is quite plentiful on Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] and may be in liquid form a short distance below the surface; astrobiologist [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] has suggested it as a possible solvent for life there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/3518/the-chance-for-life-on-io | title = The Chance for Life on Io | accessdate = 2013-05-25 | last = Choi | first = Charles Q.| date = 2010-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a planet with hydrogen-sulfide oceans the source of the hydrogen sulfide could come from volcanos, in which case it could be mixed in with a bit of [[hydrogen fluoride]], which could help dissolve minerals. Hydrogen-sulfide life might use a mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as their carbon source. They might produce and live on [[sulfur monoxide]], which is analogous to oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Hydrogen sulfide, like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, suffers from the small temperature range where it is liquid, though that, like that of hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, increases with increasing pressure.

====Silicon dioxide and silicates====
[[Silicon dioxide]], also known as silica and quartz, is very abundant in the universe and has a large temperature range where it is liquid. However, its melting point is {{convert|1,600|to|1,725|C|F}}, so it would be impossible to make organic compounds in that temperature, because all of them would decompose. Silicates are similar to silicon dioxide and some could have lower boiling points than silica. [[Gerald Feinberg]] and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have suggested that molten silicate rock could serve as a liquid medium for organisms with a chemistry based on silicon, oxygen, and other elements such as [[aluminium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David W. Koerner |author2=Simon LeVay |title=Here Be Dragons : The Scientific Quest for Extraterrestrial Life |date=2000 |isbn=9780198033370 |publisher=Oxford U.P. |pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other solvents or cosolvents====
[[File:Sulfuric-acid-Givan-et-al-1999-3D-balls.png|thumb|Sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]]
Other solvents sometimes proposed:
* [[Supercritical fluid]]s: [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] and supercritical hydrogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Supercritical Carbon Dioxide&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budisa |first1=Nediljko |last2=Schulze-Makuch |first2=Dirk |title=Supercritical Carbon Dioxide and Its Potential as a Life-Sustaining Solvent in a Planetary Environment |journal=Life |date=8 August 2014 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=331–340 |doi=10.3390/life4030331 |pmc=4206850 |pmid=25370376}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simple hydrogen compounds: [[hydrogen chloride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wardsolvents&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ward | first = Peter D. | last2 = Benner | first2 = Steven A. | contribution = Alien biochemistries | date = 2007 | title = Planets and Life | editor-last = Sullivan | editor-first = Woodruff T. | editor2-last = Baross | editor2-first = John A. | page = 540 | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge | isbn = 978-0521531023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More complex compounds: [[sulfuric acid]],&lt;ref name=&quot;barosssulfuric&quot;/&gt; [[formamide]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Planetary Systems p 74&quot;/&gt; [[methanol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wardsolvents&quot;/&gt;
* Very-low-temperature fluids: [[liquid nitrogen]]&lt;ref name=&quot;barosscryo&quot;/&gt; and [[liquid hydrogen|hydrogen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;barosscryo&quot;/&gt;
* High-temperature liquids: [[sodium chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/the-methane-habitable-zone/ The methane habitable zone].&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulfuric acid in liquid form is strongly polar. It remains liquid at higher temperatures than water, its liquid range being 10&amp;nbsp;°C to 337&amp;nbsp;°C at a pressure of 1&amp;nbsp;atm, although above 300&amp;nbsp;°C it slowly decomposes. Sulfuric acid is known to be abundant in the [[atmosphere of Venus|clouds of Venus]], in the form of [[aerosol]] droplets. In a biochemistry that used sulfuric acid as a solvent, the [[alkene]] group (C=C), with two carbon atoms joined by a double bond, could function analogously to the carbonyl group (C=O) in water-based biochemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;barosssulfuric&quot;/&gt;

A proposal has been made that life on Mars may exist and be using a mixture of water and [[hydrogen peroxide]] as its solvent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Possible Biogenic Origin for Hydrogen Peroxide on Mars | journal = International Journal of Astrobiology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 147 | date = 2007-05-22 | first = Joop M. | last = Houtkooper |author2=Dirk Schulze-Makuch | doi = 10.1017/S1473550407003746 | arxiv = physics/0610093 |bibcode = 2007IJAsB...6..147H }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 61.2% (by mass) mix of water and hydrogen peroxide has a freezing point of −56.5&amp;nbsp;°C and tends to [[super-cool]] rather than crystallize. It is also [[hygroscopic]], an advantage in a water-scarce environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EPSC2007/00439/EPSC2007-J-00439.pdf |journal=EPSC Abstracts |volume= 2 |id= EPSC2007-A-00439 |date=2007 |title=The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Hypothesis: Extremophiles Adapted to Conditions on Mars? |first=Joop M. |last= Houtkooper |author2=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |bibcode=2007epsc.conf..558H |pages=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001109/ |title=Europlanet : Life's a bleach |date=2007-08-24 |first=Doug |last= Ellison |publisher=Planetary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercritical carbon dioxide has been proposed as a candidate for alternative biochemistry due to its ability to selectively dissolve organic compounds and assist the functioning of enzymes and because &quot;super-Earth&quot;- or &quot;super-Venus&quot;-type planets with dense high-pressure atmospheres may be common.&lt;ref name=&quot;Supercritical Carbon Dioxide&quot;/&gt;

===Other speculations===
====Non-green photosynthesizers====
Physicists have noted that, although photosynthesis on Earth generally involves green plants, a variety of other-colored plants could also support photosynthesis, essential for most life on Earth, and that other colors might be preferred in places that receive a different mix of stellar radiation than Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2007/spectrum_plants.html |title=NASA – NASA Predicts Non-Green Plants on Other Planets |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2008-02-23 |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Kiang&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Kiang | first = Nancy Y. |author2=Segura, Antígona |author2-link=Antígona Segura |author3=Tinetti, Giovanna |author4=Jee, Govind |author5=Blankenship, Robert E. |author6=Cohen, Martin |author7=Siefert, Janet |author8=Crisp, David |author9= Meadows, Victoria S.  | title = Spectral signatures of photosynthesis.

These studies indicate that blue plants would be unlikely, however yellow or red plants may be relatively common.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kiang&quot;/&gt;

====Variable environments====
Many Earth plants and animals undergo major biochemical changes during their life cycles as a response to changing environmental conditions, for example, by having a [[spore]] or [[hibernation]] state that can be sustained for years or even millennia between more active life stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christmas in Yellowstone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/yellowstone/hibernate.html |title=Christmas in Yellowstone |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, it would be biochemically possible to sustain life in environments that are only periodically consistent with life as we know it.

For example, frogs in cold climates can survive for extended periods of time with most of their body water in a frozen state,&lt;ref name=&quot;Christmas in Yellowstone&quot;/&gt; whereas desert frogs in Australia can become inactive and dehydrate in dry periods, losing up to 75% of their fluids, yet return to life by rapidly rehydrating in wet periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Main and Bentley, Ecology, &quot;Water Relations of Australian Burrowing Frogs and Tree Frogs&quot; (1964)|journal = Ecology|volume = 45|issue = 2|pages = 379–382|jstor = 1933854|last1 = Main|first1 = A. R.|last2 = Bentley|first2 = P. J.|year = 1964|doi = 10.2307/1933854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either type of frog would appear biochemically inactive (i.e. not living) during dormant periods to anyone lacking a sensitive means of detecting low levels of metabolism.

===Nonplanetary life===
====Dust and plasma-based====
In 2007, Vadim N. Tsytovich and colleagues proposed that lifelike behaviors could be exhibited by dust particles suspended in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], under conditions that might exist in space.&lt;ref name=&quot;dust1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070814150630.htm| date=2007-08-15| website=Science Daily| title=Physicists Discover Inorganic Dust With Lifelike Qualities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dust2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| title=From plasma crystals and helical structures towards inorganic living matter| journal= New J.
