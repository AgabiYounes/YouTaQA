{{nihongo|'''''Cowboy Bebop'''''|カウボーイビバップ|Kaubōi Bibappu}} is a [[Anime|Japanese animated]] [[science-fiction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/how-sci-fi-anime-like-cowboy-bebop-bridges-the-gap-between-science-and-fiction|title=HOW SCI-FI ANIME LIKE COWBOY BEBOP BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN SCIENCE AND FICTION|author=Mahon, Christopher|date=September 10, 2018|publisher=SyFy|accessdate=March 31, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; television series animated by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] featuring a production team led by director [[Shinichirō Watanabe]], screenwriter [[Keiko Nobumoto]], character designer [[Toshihiro Kawamoto]], mechanical designer [[Kimitoshi Yamane]], and composer [[Yoko Kanno]]. The twenty-six episodes (&quot;sessions&quot;) of the series are set in the year 2071, and follow the lives of a [[bounty hunter]] crew traveling in their spaceship called the ''Bebop''. Although it covers a wide range of genres throughout its run, ''Cowboy Bebop'' draws most heavily from science fiction, [[western film|western]] and [[Film noir|noir]] films, and its most recurring thematic focal points include [[adult]] [[boredom|existential ennui]], [[loneliness]] and the difficulties of trying to escape one's [[past]].

The series premiered in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] from April 3 until June 26, 1998, broadcasting only twelve episodes and a special due to its controversial adult-themed content. The entire twenty-six episodes of the series were later broadcast on [[Wowow]] from October 24 until April 24, 1999. The anime was adapted into two [[manga]] series which were serialized in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s ''[[Asuka Fantasy DX]]''. A [[Cowboy Bebop: The Movie|film]] was later released to theaters worldwide.

The anime series was dubbed in the [[English language]] by [[Animaze]] and ZRO Limit Productions, and was licensed by [[Bandai Entertainment]] in North America and is now licensed by [[Funimation]]. In Britain, it was licensed by [[Beez Entertainment]] and is currently licensed by [[Anime Limited]]. [[Madman Entertainment]] has licensed it for releases in Australia and New Zealand. In 2001, ''Cowboy Bebop'' became the first anime title to be broadcast on [[Adult Swim]] in the United States.

''Cowboy Bebop'' became a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets (most notably in the United States), garnered several major anime and [[science fiction awards]] upon its release, and received wide acclaim for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation, and soundtrack. In the years since its release, critics have hailed ''Cowboy Bebop'' as a masterpiece and frequently cite it as one of the greatest anime titles of all time. Credited with helping to introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, ''Cowboy Bebop'' has also been labelled a gateway series for the medium as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=Tasha |title=Gateways To Geekery: Anime |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/gateways-to-geekery-anime,24653/ |newspaper= [[The A.V.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Cowboy Bebop episodes}}
In 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway made the Earth almost uninhabitable, humanity has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as &quot;Cowboys&quot;) chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward.&lt;ref name=&quot;CowboyBackground&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop - Original Sessions - Background |url=http://cowboybebop.org/english/session/world/index.html |publisher=CowboyBebop.Org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030107060711/http://cowboybebop.org/english/session/world/index.html |archivedate= January 7, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' protagonists are bounty hunters working from the spaceship ''Bebop''. The original crew are [[Spike Spiegel]], an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and his partner [[Jet Black (Cowboy Bebop)|Jet Black]], a former ISSP officer. They are later joined by [[Faye Valentine]], an amnesiac [[con artist]]; [[Edward (Cowboy Bebop)|Edward Wong]], an eccentric girl skilled in hacking; and [[Eine bebop|Ein]], a [[Genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] [[Pembroke Welsh Corgi]] with human-like intelligence. Over the course of the series, the team get involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them without money, while often confronting faces and events from their past:&lt;ref name=&quot;VaultThemes&quot;/&gt; these include Jet's reasons for leaving the ISSP, and Faye's past as a young woman from Earth injured in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her life.

The main story arc focuses on Spike and his deadly rivalry with Vicious, an ambitious criminal affiliated with the Red Dragon Syndicate. Spike and Vicious were once partners and friends, but when Spike began an affair with Vicious's girlfriend [[Julia (Cowboy Bebop)|Julia]] and resolved to leave the Syndicate with her, Vicious sought to eliminate Spike by blackmailing Julia into killing him. Julia goes into hiding to protect herself and Spike fakes his death to escape the Syndicate. In the present, Julia comes out of hiding and reunites with Spike, intending to complete their plan. Vicious, having staged a ''[[coup d'état]]'' and taken over the Syndicate, sends hitmen after the pair. Julia is killed, leaving Spike alone. Spike leaves the ''Bebop'' after saying a final goodbye to Faye and Jet. Upon infiltrating the syndicate, he finds Vicious on the top floor of the building and confronts him after dispatching the remaining Red Dragon members. The final battle ends with Spike killing Vicious, only to be seriously wounded himself in the ensuing confrontation. The series concludes as Spike descends the main staircase of the building into the rising sun. He eventually falls to the ground.

==Genre and themes==
Watanabe created a special tagline for the series to promote it during its original presentation, calling it &quot;a new genre unto itself&quot;. The line was inserted before and after commercial breaks during its Japanese and US broadcasts. Later, Watanabe called the phrase an &quot;exaggeration&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CowboyMag&quot;/&gt; The show is a hybrid of multiple [[genre]]s, including the [[Western (genre)|Western]] and [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AnimeBebop&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917|author=Clements, Jonathan|author2=McCarthy, Helen|date=November 1, 2006|publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]]|isbn=978-1933330105|chapter=Déjà Vu All Over Again?: Cowboy Bebop's Transformation to the Big Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|113}} One reviewer described it as &quot;[[space opera]] meets noir, meets comedy, meets [[cyberpunk]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scifiaddicts.com/cowboy-bebop-genre-blending-sci-fi/|title=Cowboy Bebop: Space Opera Meets Noir, Comedy, and Cyberpunk|date=2016-10-20|website=Sci-Fi Addicts|language=en|access-date=2019-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been called a &quot;genre-bursting [[Space Western|space western]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/20-years-later-cowboy-bebop-remains-the-undisputed-greatest-coolest-anime-series-ever-made|title=20 Years Later, ‘Cowboy Bebop’ Remains the (Undisputed) Greatest, Coolest Anime Series Ever Made|date=2018-04-16|website=MEL Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/cowboy-bebop-live-action/|title=Cowboy Bebop to Return in Live-Action|date=2018-12-05|website=Film School Rejects|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characters were created by Watanabe and character designer [[Toshihiro Kawamoto]]. Watanabe envisioned each character as an extension of his own personality, or as an opposite person to himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;WataDirty&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/30/entertainment/ca-solomon30|title=Dirty Harry in outer space?|author=Charles Solomon|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 30, 2003|accessdate=March 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each character, from the main cast to supporting characters, were designed to be outlaws unable to fit into society.&lt;ref name=&quot;AODinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animeondvd.com/press/conventions/axny2002/axnybeboppanel.php|title=Cowboy Bebop Panel|date=February 14, 2006|publisher=Anime on DVD.com|accessdate=January 6, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030605011254/http://animeondvd.com/press/conventions/axny2002/axnybeboppanel.php|archivedate=June 5, 2003|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kawamoto designed the characters so they were easily distinguished from one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;CowboyMag&quot;/&gt; All the main cast are characterized by a deep sense of loneliness or resignation to their fate and past.&lt;ref name=&quot;CowboyMag&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Bricken, Robert | date=January 2003 | title=Behind the Bebop - Murder, Mars and All That Jazz| journal=[[Anime Insider|Anime Invasion]] | issue=#5 | publisher=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of Brian Camp and Julie Davis, the main characters resemble the main characters of the anime series ''[[Lupin III]]'', if only superficially, given their more troubled pasts and more complex personalities.&lt;!--THE RESEMBLANCE IS SOMETHING THESE TWO WRITERS MAY CLAIM; IF OTHERS DO ALSO, CITE THEM—BUT UNTIL OTHERS CLEARLY SAY THIS, IT IS THE OPINION OF JUST ONE SOURCE, NOT A GENERAL PERSPECTIVE AMONG ANIME EXPERTS OR FOLLOWERS OF THIS WRITER-DIRECTOR TEAM'S WORK.--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ACbebop&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Anime Classics Zettai!|Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces]]|author1=Camp, Brian |author2=Davis, Julie |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |date=September 15, 2007 |isbn=978-1-933330-22-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|81}}

The show focuses on the character of [[Spike Spiegel]], with the overall theme of the series being Spike's past and its karmic effect on him.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDcommentary&quot;/&gt; Spike was portrayed as someone who had lost his expectations for the future, having lost the woman he loved, and so was in a near-constant lethargy.&lt;ref name=&quot;CowboyMag&quot;/&gt; Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to give Spike an eye patch, but the producers vetoed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;AODinterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabeInterview3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/life-arts/cowboy-bebop-director-watanabe-talks-anime-1.971462|title='Cowboy Bebop' director Watanabe talks anime|newspaper=[[The Daily Texan]]|date=February 14, 2006|accessdate=January 6, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715113817/http://www.dailytexanonline.com/life-arts/cowboy-bebop-director-watanabe-talks-anime-1.971462 |archivedate=July 15, 2009 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Shinichiro Watanabe 20090703 Japan Expo 01.jpg|thumb|right|Series director [[Shinichirō Watanabe]] at the 2009 [[Japan Expo]]]]
''Cowboy Bebop'' was developed by animation studio [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] and created by [[Hajime Yatate]], the well-known pseudonym for the collective contributions of Sunrise's animation staff. The leader of the series' creative team was director [[Shinichirō Watanabe]], most notable at the time for directing ''[[Macross Plus]]'' and ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory]]''. Other leading members of Sunrise's creative team were screenwriter [[Keiko Nobumoto]], character designer [[Toshihiro Kawamoto]], mechanical art designer [[Kimitoshi Yamane]], composer [[Yoko Kanno]], and producers Masahiko Minami and Yoshiyuki Takei. Most of them had previously worked together, in addition to having credits on other popular anime titles. Nobumoto had scripted ''Macross Plus'', Kawamoto had designed the characters for ''Gundam'', and Kanno had composed the music for ''Macross Plus'' and ''[[The Vision of Escaflowne]]''. Yamane had not worked with Watanabe yet, but his credits in anime included ''[[Bubblegum Crisis]]'' and ''The Vision of Escaflowne''.

===Concept===
''Cowboy Bebop'' was Watanabe's first project as solo director, as he had been co-director in his previous works.&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabePanel&quot;/&gt; His original concept was for a movie, and during production he treated each episode as a miniature movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabeInterview2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intothematrix.com/rl_cmp/rl_interview_watanabe.html|title=Animatrix Director: Kid's Story and A Detective's Story|publisher=The Animatrix official website|accessdate=January 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102061952/http://www.intothematrix.com/rl_cmp/rl_interview_watanabe.html |archivedate=January 2, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDfeatures&quot;&gt;&quot;From the Small Screen to the Big Screen&quot;. {{cite video |date=2003 | title=Cowboy Bebop: The Movie | medium=DVD | publisher=[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment]] | location=[[Culver City, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His main inspiration for ''Cowboy Bebop'' was ''Lupin III'', a crime anime series focusing on the exploits of the [[Arsène Lupin III|series' titular character]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWNcowboy&quot;/&gt; When developing the series' story, Watanabe began by creating the characters first. He explained, &quot;the first image that occurred to me was one of Spike, and from there I tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabePanel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Sevakis |first=Justin |title=Shinichiro Watanabe focus panel - Otakon 2013 |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2013/otakon/7 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=August 15, 2013 |accessdate=April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the original dialogue of the series was kept clean to avoid any profanities, its level of sophistication was made appropriate to adults in a criminal environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWNcowboy&quot;/&gt; Watanabe described ''Cowboy Bebop'' as &quot;80% serious story and 20% humorous touch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WataToon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Todd|last=DuBois|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2013/08/otakon-2013-with-shinichiro-watanabe/|title=Otakon 2013: Press Conference and Public Q&amp;A With Director Shinichiro Watanabe|publisher=Toon Zone |date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=April 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The comical episodes were harder for the team to write than the serious ones, but though several events in them seemed random, they were carefully planned in advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;AODinterview&quot;/&gt; Watanabe conceived the series' ending early on, and each episode involving Spike and Vicious was meant to foreshadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabeInterview3&quot;/&gt; The reason for creating the ending was that Watanabe did not want the series to become like ''[[Star Trek]]'', with him being tied to doing it for years.&lt;ref name=&quot;AODinterview&quot;/&gt;

===Development===
The project had initially originated with [[Bandai]]'s toy division as a sponsor, with the goal of selling spacecraft toys. Watanabe recalled his only instruction was &quot;So long as there's a spaceship in it, you can do whatever you want.&quot; But upon viewing early footage, it became clear that Watanabe's vision for the series didn't match with that of Bandai's. Believing the series would never sell toy merchandise, Bandai pulled out of the project, leaving it in [[development hell]] until sister company [[Bandai Visual]] stepped in to sponsor it. Since there was no need to merchandise toys with the property any more, Watanabe had free rein in the development of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabePanel&quot;/&gt; Watanabe wanted to design not just a space adventure series for adolescent boys but a program that would also appeal to sophisticated adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWNcowboy&quot;/&gt; During the making of ''Bebop'', Watanabe often attempted to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable up to three decades later. While some of them were doubtful of that at the time, Watanabe many years later expressed his happiness to have been proven right in retrospect. He joked that if Bandai Visual hadn't intervened then &quot;you might be seeing me working the supermarket checkout counter right now.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabePanel&quot;/&gt;

The city locations were generally inspired by the cities of [[New York City|New York]] and [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabeInterview1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/interview/index.html|title=The Director's Voice: Shinichiro Watanabe Interview|publisher=Cowboy Bebop: The Movie website (English)|accessdate=January 6, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030307023145/http://www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/interview/index.html|archivedate=March 7, 2003|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The atmospheres of the planets and the ethnic groups in ''Cowboy Bebop'' mostly originated from Watanabe's ideas, with some collaboration from set designers [[Isamu Imakake]], [[Shoji Kawamori]], and [[Dai Satō]]. The animation staff established the particular planet atmospheres early in the production of the series before working on the ethnic groups. It was Watanabe who wanted to have several groups of ethnic diversity appear in the series. [[Mars]] was the planet most often used in ''Cowboy Bebop''{{'}}s storylines, with Satoshi Toba, the cultural and setting producer, explaining that the other planets &quot;were unexpectedly difficult to use.&quot; He stated that each planet in the series had unique features, and the producers had to take into account the characteristics of each planet in the story. For the final episode, Toba explained that it was not possible for the staff to have the dramatic rooftop scene occur on [[Venus]], so the staff &quot;ended up normally falling back to Mars.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AnimeGuide4p64&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Newtype]]|title=Cowboy Bebop Anime Guide Volume 4|date=May 21, 2002|page=64|publisher=[[Tokyopop]]|isbn=1-931514-08-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In creating the backstory, Watanabe envisioned a world that was &quot;multinational rather than stateless&quot;. In spite of certain American influences in the series, he stipulated that the country had been destroyed decades prior to the story, later saying the notion of the United States as the center of the world repelled him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=カウボーイビバップ Extra Session [Cowboy Bebop Extra Session] (in Japanese)|publisher=Bandai Visual|date=January 28, 2005|isbn=|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
[[File:Yoko Kanno.jpg|thumb|left|Series composer [[Yoko Kanno]], photographed in 1999]]
{{Main|Music of Cowboy Bebop}}
The music for ''Cowboy Bebop'' was composed by [[Yoko Kanno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-15/composer-yoko-kanno-to-perform-concert-at-otakon|title=Composer Yoko Kanno to Perform Concert at Otakon|work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 16, 2013|accessdate=April 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kanno formed the [[blues]] and [[jazz]] band [[Seatbelts (band)|Seatbelts]] to perform the music of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-12-16/seatbelts-reunite|title=Seatbelts Reunite|work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=December 16, 2002|accessdate=April 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kanno, the music was one of the first aspects of the series to begin production, before most of the characters, story or animation had been finalized. The genres she used for its composition were western, opera and jazz.&lt;ref name=&quot;AODinterview&quot;/&gt; Watanabe noted that Kanno did not score the music exactly the way he told her to. He stated, &quot;She gets inspired on her own, follows up on her own imagery and comes to me saying 'this is the song we need for ''Cowboy Bebop'',' and composes something completely on her own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WataToon&quot;/&gt; Kanno herself was sometimes surprised at how pieces of her music were used in scenes, sometimes wishing it had been used elsewhere, though she also felt that none of their uses were &quot;inappropriate&quot;. She was pleased with the working environment, finding the team very relaxed in comparison with other teams she had worked with.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDcommentary&quot;/&gt;

Watanabe further explained that he would take inspiration from Kanno's music after listening to it and create new scenes for the story from it. These new scenes in turn would inspire Kanno and give her new ideas for the music and she would come to Watanabe with even more music. Watanabe cited as an example, &quot;some songs in the second half of the series, we didn't even ask her for those songs, she just made them and brought them to us.&quot; He commented that while Kanno's method was normally &quot;unforgivable and unacceptable,&quot; it was ultimately a &quot;big hit&quot; with ''Cowboy Bebop''. Watanabe described his collaboration with Kanno as &quot;a game of catch between the two of us in developing the music and creating the TV series ''Cowboy Bebop''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WataToon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowboy Bebop music book&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bridges |first=Rose |date=2017 |title=Yoko Kanno's Cowboy Bebop Soundtrack |url= https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/yoko-kannos-cowboy-bebop-soundtrack-9781501325854/|location= New York|publisher= Bloomsbury|isbn= 9781501325854}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the series' broadcast, Kanno and the Seatbelts have released seven original soundtrack albums, two singles and extended plays, and two compilations through label [[Victor Entertainment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CowboyCrunchy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/11/13/out-of-print-cowboy-bebop-soundtracks-reissued|title=Out of Print &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; Soundtracks Reissued|author=Green, Scott|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=November 13, 2012|accessdate=January 8, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116051742/http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2012/11/13/out-of-print-cowboy-bebop-soundtracks-reissued |archivedate=November 16, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cowboy Bebop'' has been released in four separate editions in North America.

The first release was sold in VHS format either as a box set or as seven individual tapes. The tapes were sold through Anime Village, a division of Bandai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/releases.php?id=23122|title=Cowboy Bebop - Collector's Box 1 (Dub.VHS 1-7) - Anime News Network|website=www.animenewsnetwork.com|access-date=2019-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second release was sold in 2000 individually, and featured uncut versions of the original 26 episodes. In 2001, these DVDs were collected in the special edition ''Perfect Sessions'' which included the first 6 DVDs, the first ''Cowboy Bebop'' soundtrack, and a collector's box. At the time of release, the art box from the Perfect Sessions was made available for purchase on The Right Stuff International as a solo item for collectors who already owned the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cowboy Bebop box set &quot;box&quot; available separately |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2001-11-07/cowboy-bebop-box-set-box-available-seperately |work= [[Anime News Network]] |date=2001-11-07 |accessdate= 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third release, ''The Best Sessions'', was sold in 2002 and featured what Bandai considered to be the best 6 episodes of the series remastered in [[Dolby Digital]] 5.1 and [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] surround sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Otakon 2002: Bandai Panel |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-07-29/otakon-2002-bandai-panel |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2002-07-29 |accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth release, ''Cowboy Bebop Remix'', was also distributed on 6 discs and included the original 26 uncut episodes, with sound remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and video remastered under the supervision of Shinichiro Watanabe. This release also included various extras that were not present in the original release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= New Cowboy Bebop Special Edition |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-02-16/new-cowboy-bebop-special-edition |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2005-02-16 |accessdate= 2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowboy Bebop Remix was itself collected as the Cowboy Bebop Remix DVD Collection in 2008.

A fourth release in [[Blu-Ray]] format was released on December 21, 2012 exclusively in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Cowboy Bebop BD Box to Include Novel, Ein Picture Drama |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-08-03/cowboy-bebop-bd-box-to-include-novel-ein-picture-drama |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowboy Bebop Official Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cowboy-bebop.net/ |publisher=Sunrise |title=カウボーイビバップ |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part 1 of the Blu-Ray collection was released on July 29, 2013, while Part 2 was released on October 14. The standard DVD Complete Collection was originally meant to be released on September 23, 2013 with Part 2 of the Blu-Ray release but due to mastering and manufacturing errors, the Complete Collection was delayed until November 27.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment in 2012, [[Funimation]] and [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] had announced that they rescued ''Cowboy Bebop'', along with a handful of other former Bandai Entertainment properties, for home video and digital release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Funimation Adds Cowboy Bebop, Escaflowne, Outlaw Star and More|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-08-10/funimation-adds-cowboy-bebop-escaflowne-outlaw-star-more|work=Anime News Network|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funimation released the series on Blu-ray and DVD on December 16, 2014.&lt;ref name=&quot;narelease&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Release Date for Cowboy Bebop|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2014/08/09/release-date-for-cowboy-bebop/|publisher=Funimation|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ANN 2014-12-16&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-12-16/north-american-anime-manga-releases-december-14-20/.82255|title=North American Anime, Manga Releases, December 14–20|work=Anime News Network|date=16 December 2014|accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was released in four separate editions: standard DVD, standard Blu-ray, an Amazon.com exclusive Blu-ray/DVD combo, and a Funimation.com exclusive Blu-ray/DVD combo.&lt;ref name=&quot;narelease&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cowboy Bebop Blu-ray Slated for N.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Cowboy Bebop'' received widespread critical acclaim, beginning at the time of its initial broadcast. Beginning in 1998, Japanese critic Keith Rhee highlighted the series as a standout in an otherwise &quot;run-of-the-mill&quot; season, praising its overall production values, and singling out Kanno's soundtrack as &quot;a much-welcome change from all the sugary [[J-pop]] tunes of most anime features&quot;. Rhee also highlighted the show's Japanese &quot;all-star cast&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EX-1998&quot;/&gt; which his colleague Mark L. Johnson described as being filled with &quot;veteran voice talent&quot;, turning in even greater performances than those of their &quot;above average&quot; US counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Mark |title=Cowboy Bebop 1st Session DVD Review |url=http://www.ex.org/5.3/31-anime_bebopdvd.html |website=Ex.org |accessdate=2019-03-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015075114/http://www.ex.org/5.3/31-anime_bebopdvd.html |archivedate=2009-10-15 |date=2000 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anime News Network]]'s Mike Crandol gave the series an 'A+' rating for the dubbed version, and an 'A' rating for the subbed version. He claimed the series was &quot;one of the most popular and respected anime titles in history,&quot; before adding that it was &quot;a unique television show which skillfully transcends all kinds of genres.&quot; Crandol praised its characters as &quot;some of the most endearing characters to ever grace an anime,&quot; and commended the voice acting, especially the &quot;flawless English cast.&quot; He also complimented the series' &quot;movie-quality&quot; animation, &quot;sophisticated&quot; writing, and its &quot;incredible&quot; musical score. Crandol hailed ''Cowboy Bebop'' as a &quot;landmark&quot; anime &quot;that will be remembered long after many others have been forgotten&quot;, and went on to call it &quot;one of the greatest anime titles ever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ANN Cowboy Bebop: The Perfect Sessions Review&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/cowboy-bebop-box-set-dvd | title = Cowboy Bebop: The Perfect Sessions DVD Box Set - Review |date= February 21, 2002 | accessdate = September 8, 2013 | last = Crandol | first = Mike | work = [[Anime News Network]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Michael Toole of [[Anime News Network]] named ''Cowboy Bebop'' as one of the most important anime of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toole|first1=Mike|title=Evangel-a-like - The Mike Toole Show|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2011-06-05|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=20 November 2015|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the entire series a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Christina Carpenter believing ''Cowboy Bebop'' as &quot;one of the best [anime]&quot; and touting it as a masterpiece that &quot;puts most anime...and [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], to shame.&quot; She described it as a &quot;very stylish, beautifully crafted series that deserves much more attention than it gets.&quot; Carpenter praised the animation as &quot;a rarity and a marvel to behold&quot; and that it was &quot;beyond superb,&quot; and the plot and characterization as having &quot;a sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind.&quot; She also praised the soundtrack, and hailed the opening theme as one of the best intro pieces she had ever heard. Carpenter went to say that ''Bebop'' was a &quot;must-have for any serious collector of Japanese animation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;THEM Cowboy Bebop Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=413 | title = Cowboy Bebop Review |date= | accessdate = September 8, 2013 | last = Carpenter | first = Christina | publisher = T.H.E.M.

In his article &quot;Asteroid Blues: The Lasting Legacy of ''Cowboy Bebop''&quot;, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' writer Alex Suskind states, &quot;On paper, ''Cowboy Bebop'', the legendary cult anime series from Shinichirō Watanabe, reads like something John Wayne, Elmore Leonard, and Philip K. Dick came up with during a wild, all-night whiskey bender.&quot; He goes on to write, &quot;The response from critics and fans may have sounded hyperbolic—the word 'masterpiece' was thrown around a great deal—but the praise was justified. First-time solo director Watanabe had created a gorgeous tale of morality, romance, and violence–a dark look at the lives of outlaws that's shot like an independent film.&quot;&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/asteroid-blues-the-lasting-legacy-of-cowboy-bebop/383817/ | title=Asteroid Blues: The Lasting Legacy of Cowboy Bebop | author=Suskind, Alex | date=December 17, 2014 | work=[[The Atlantic]] | publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] | accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, television writer Kyle Mills of [[DVD Talk]] awarded the series five stars upon review. He stated, &quot;Regardless of the medium, be it live action television, film, or animation, ''Cowboy Bebop'' is simply one of the finest examples of storytelling ever created.&quot; In his review, he describes the finale as &quot;one of the best in television history,&quot; referring to it as a &quot;widely revered&quot; ending that &quot;still sparks fan conversation, resonating with viewers 15 years on.&quot; He closes by writing, &quot;''Cowboy Bebop'' ends with a bang.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/65491/cowboy-bebop-the-complete-series-premium-edition-amazon-exclusive/|title=Cowboy Bebop: The Complete Series (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2018 review of the series, [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'']] critic John Maher wrote, “It feels like a magnum opus produced at the pinnacle of a long career despite being, almost unbelievably, Watanabe’s first series as a director. It is a masterwork that should justly rank among the best works of television of all time.” It was also placed at #1 on the publication's list of the ‘’50 Best Anime Series of All Time’’.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/10/the-50-best-anime-series-of-all-time.html?p=6 Paste Magazine: The 50 Best Anime of All Time]&lt;/ref&gt;

The series holds a 100% “Certified Fresh” approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with the site's critical consensus stating, “Blending a head-spinning array of genres and references, ''Cowboy Bebop'' is an anime television classic that must be experienced.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/cowboy_bebop/s01|title=Cowboy Bebop: Series 1 - Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
The series has been subject to study and analysis since its debut, with the main focus being on its style and mixture of genres. Miguel Douglas, describing the series style in a review, said that &quot;the series distinctly establishes itself outside the realm of conventional [[Anime|Japanese animation]] and instead chooses to forge its own path. With a setting within the realm of [[science fiction]], the series wisely offers a world that seems entirely realistic considering our present time. Free from many of the elements that accompany science fiction in general — whether that be [[Extraterrestrial life|space aliens]], giant [[robot]]s, or [[laser gun]]s — the series delegates itself towards presenting a world that is quite similar to our own albeit showcasing some technological advances. Certainly not as pristine a future we would see in other series or films, ''Cowboy Bebop'' decides to deliver a future that closely reflects that of our own time. This aspect of familiarity does wonders in terms of relating to the viewer, and it presents a world that certainly resembles our very own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;iSreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Anime Review: Cowboy Bebop - カウボーイビバップ - Kaubōi Bibappu|date=September 1, 2010|last=Douglas|first=Miguel|publisher=iSugoi|url=http://www.isugoi.com/cowboy-bebop-review/|accessdate=May 15, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113081241/http://www.isugoi.com/cowboy-bebop-review/|archivedate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daryl Surat of ''[[Otaku USA]]'', commenting on the series' appeal, said that it was &quot;that rare breed of science-fiction: &quot;accessible&quot;. Unlike many anime titles, viewers weren't expected to have knowledge of [[Culture of Asia|Asian culture]] — character names, signs, and the like were primarily in English to begin with — or have seen any other anime series prior.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReflectBebop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cowboy Bebop: Reflections on a Modern-Day Anime Relic|date=December 16, 2010|last=Surat|first=Daryl|publisher=[[Otaku USA]]|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/SearchAudience/News1/Cowboy_Bebop_3984.aspx|accessdate=May 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelle Onley Pirkle, in her book ''Science Fiction Film, Television, and Adaptation: Across the Screens'', said that &quot;''Cowboy Bebop'' is taking a new take on genre, not by creating unique images and sounds, but by playing &quot;freely&quot; with, &quot;remixing&quot;, or adapting the images and sounds of other familiar genres in a dynamic way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFbebop&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Pirkle, Michelle Onley|editor=Jay Telotte|editor2=Gerald Duchovnay|title=Science Fiction Film, Television, and Adaptation: Across the Screens|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=2011|isbn=978-1-136-65009-3|chapter=Déjà Vu All Over Again?: Cowboy Bebop's Transformation to the Big Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|164}} Robert Baigent, writing for the ''Graduate Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies'', said that the series' appeal likely stemmed from the trend in anime to emulate Western fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;BAIGENT&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy==
In March 2009, the print and web editions of ''[[The Onion]]'''s ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' called ''Cowboy Bebop'' &quot;rightly a huge hit&quot;, and listed it as a gateway series to understanding the medium of anime as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub-2009&quot;/&gt; Suskind said: &quot;It was unlike anything the genre had seen before. It even approached its music differently. The show kicked off with a wormhole of a theme song, and the soundtrack moves so seamlessly through genres, from rock to country to pop to jazz to funk, it's shocking to learn that one set of musicians is behind it all&quot;. In an interview, producer Sean Akins also states that the series &quot;created a whole new world&quot;. &quot;It's hard for me to quantify the impact that I think it has had. It changed anime. I think people began to think about what shows would be cool. I think it redefined cool within animation, not only in Japan but in the States&quot;.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;

American film director, screenwriter, and producer [[Rian Johnson]] has cited ''Cowboy Bebop'' as a visual influence on his films, most notably ''[[Brick (film)|Brick]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;visuals&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ender's Game]]'' writer, novelist, critic, playwright, and poet [[Orson Scott Card]] also praised the series. He states that the series is &quot;better than most sci-fi films out there&quot;. He goes on to say that he &quot;found this series brilliant, but what held me was a combination of strong relationship-based storytelling, a moody visual style that never got old and really smart dialogue&quot;.&lt;ref name=atlantic/&gt;

After the creation of the series, an interviewer asked Watanabe if he had any plans to create more ''Cowboy Bebop'' material. Watanabe responded by saying that he does not believe that he &quot;should just keep on making ''Cowboy Bebop'' sequels for the sake of it&quot;. Watanabe added that ending production and &quot;to quit while we're ahead when people still want more&quot; is more &quot;in keeping with the ''Bebop'' spirit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WatanabeInterviewCBMovie&quot;&gt;&quot;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030307023145/http://www.cowboybebop.org/english/door/interview/index.html The Director's Voice Shinichiro Watanabe Interview].&quot; ''CowboyBebop.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more recent interview from 2006 with ''[[The Daily Texan]]'', Watanabe was asked if there would ever be more ''Cowboy Bebop''. Watanabe's answer was &quot;someday...maybe, someday&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leathers|first=Kevin|title=Classics of Anime – Cowboy Bebop|work=[[Anime Network#Anime Network (UK)|UK Anime Network]]|page=2|date=10 June 2009|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/articles/Classics_of_Anime_-_Cowboy_Bebop/2|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
