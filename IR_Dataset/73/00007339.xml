The '''General Conference on Weights and Measures''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures'', abbreviated '''CGPM''' and sometimes referred to as the '''GCWM''') is the supreme authority of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]], the [[Inter-governmental organizations|inter-governmental organization]] established in 1875 under the terms of the [[Metre Convention]] through which Member States act together on matters related to measurement science and measurement standards. The CGPM is made up of delegates of the governments of the [[Member state|Member States]] and observers from the Associates of the CGPM. Under its authority, the '''International Committee for Weights and Measures (ICWM)''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Comité international des poids et mesures'' ('''CIPM''') executes an exclusive direction and supervision of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]].

The General Conference receives the report of the CIPM on work accomplished; it discusses and examines the arrangements required to ensure the propagation and improvement of the [[International System of Units|International System of Units (SI)]]; it endorses the results of new fundamental metrological determinations and various scientific resolutions of international scope; and it decides all major issues concerning the organization and development of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|BIPM]], including the dotation of the BIPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/publications-cipm.html#no|title=BIPM - official reports|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGPM meets in Paris, usually once every four years. The 25th meeting of the CGPM took place from 18 to 20 November 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2014/|title=BIPM - 25th meeting of the CGPM: 18-20 November 2014|website=www.bipm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 26th meeting of the CGPM took place in Versailles from 13 to 16 November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/cgpm-2018/|title=BIPM - 26th CGPM (2018)|website=www.bipm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the [[Metre Convention]] was only concerned with the [[kilogram]] and the [[metre]], but in 1921 the scope of the treaty was extended to accommodate all physical measurements and hence all aspects of the [[metric system]]. In 1960 the 11th CGPM approved the [[International System of Units]], usually known as &quot;SI&quot;.

==Establishment==
On 20 May 1875 an international treaty known as the ''Convention du Mètre'' ([[Metre Convention]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/metre_convention.pdf
|title = Convention du mètre
|language = French
|publisher = [[Bureau international des poids et mesures]] (BIPM)
|postscript = 1875 text plus 1907 and 1921 amendments
|accessdate = 22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed by 17 states. This treaty established an international organisation, the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures|Bureau international des poids et mesures]] (BIPM), consisting of:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/convention/
|title = The metre convention
|publisher = [[Bureau international des poids et mesures]] (BIPM)
|accessdate = 22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Conférence générale des poids et mesures (CGPM), an intergovernmental conference of official delegates of member nations and the supreme authority for all actions;
*Comité international des poids et mesures (CIPM), consisting of selected scientists and [[metrologist]]s, which prepares and executes the decisions of the CGPM and is responsible for the supervision of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures;
*a permanent laboratory and secretariat function, the activities of which include the establishment of the basic standards and scales of the principal physical quantities and maintenance of the international prototype standards.

The CGPM acts on behalf of the governments of its members.  In so doing, it appoints members to the CIPM, receives reports from the CIPM which it passes on to the governments and national laboratories on member states, examines and where appropriate approves proposals from the CIPM in respect of changes to the International System of Units (SI), approves the budget for the BIPM (over €13 million in 2018) and it decides all major issues concerning the organization and development of the BIPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The structure is analogous to that of a [[stock corporation]]. The BIPM is the organisation, the CGPM is the [[general meeting]] of the shareholders, the CIPM is the [[board of directors]] appointed by the CGPM, and the  staff at the site in Saint-Cloud perform the day-to-day work.

===Membership criteria===
The CGPM recognises two classes of membership – full membership for those states that wish to participate in the activities of the BIPM and associate membership for those countries or economies&lt;ref group = Note&gt;As of 2012, the only &quot;economy&quot; that was an associate member was CARICOM (Caribbean Community)  – its membership comprising [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Barbados]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Belize]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Dominica]], [[Suriname]], [[Grenada]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Guyana]].  [[Jamaica]], although also a member of CARICOM, is an associate of the CGPM in its own right.&lt;/ref&gt; that only wish to participate in the CIPM [[Mutual recognition agreement|MRA]] program. Associate members have observer status at the CGPM. Since all formal liaison between the convention organisations and national governments is handled by the member state's ambassador to France,&lt;ref group = Note&gt;In the case of France, the French Foreign Minister&lt;/ref&gt; it is implicit that member states must have diplomatic relations with France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; though during both world wars, nations that were at war with France retained their membership of the CGPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Of the twenty countries that attended the Conference of the Metre in 1875, representatives of seventeen signed the convention on 20 May 1875.&lt;ref group = Note&gt;[[Argentina]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Belgium]], [[Empire of Brazil|Brazil]], Denmark, [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Peru]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], [[Sweden and Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ottoman Empire]], United States and [[Venezuela]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 1884 HJ Chaney, Warden of Standards in London unofficially contacted the BIPM inquiring whether the BIPM would calibrate some metre standards that had been manufactured in the United Kingdom. [[Ole Jacob Broch|Broch]], director of the BIPM replied that he was not authorised to perform any such calibrations for non-member states. On 17 September 1884, the British Government signed the convention on behalf of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The International Committee for Weights and Measures consists of eighteen persons, each of a different nationality{{cn|date=December 2018}} elected by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) whose principal task is to promote worldwide uniformity in [[units of measurement]] by taking direct action or by submitting proposals to the CGPM.

The CIPM meets every year (since 2011 in two sessions per year) at the [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] where, among other matters, it discusses reports presented to it by its Consultative Committees. Reports of the meetings of the CGPM, the CIPM, and all the Consultative Committees, are published by the BIPM. 

===Mission===
The [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]] is based in [[Saint-Cloud]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]], [[France]].

In 1999 the CIPM has established the CIPM ''Arrangement de reconnaissance mutuelle'' (Mutual Recognition Arrangement, MRA) which serves as the framework for the mutual acceptance of national measurement standards and for recognition of the validity of calibration and measurement certificates issued by national metrology institutes.

A recent focus area of the CIPM has been the revision&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/|title=BIPM - measurement units|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223053741/https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units/|archive-date=2018-12-23|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International System of Units|SI]].

==={{anchor|CC|CCAUV|CCEM|CCL|CCM|CCPR|CCQM|CCRI|CCT|CCTF|CCU}}Consultative committees===
The CIPM has set up a number of consultative committees (CC) to assist it in its work. These committees are under the authority of the CIPM.  The president of each committee, who is expected to take the chair at CC meetings, is usually a member of the CIPM. Apart from the CCU, membership of a CC is open to National Metrology Institutes ([[National Metrology Institute|NMIs]]) of Member States that are recognized internationally as most expert in the field.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Metrology Institute|NMIs]] from Member States that are active in the field, but lack the expertise to become Members, are able to attend CC meetings as observers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/categorie/CCs_and_WGs.html|title=BIPM - CIPM Outcomes|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2018-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These committees are:&lt;ref name = CC/&gt; 
*CCAUV: Consultative Committee for [[Acoustics]], [[Ultrasound]] and [[Vibration]] 
*CCEM: Consultative Committee for [[Electricity]] and [[Magnetism]] 
*CCL: Consultative Committee for [[Length]] 
*CCM: Consultative Committee for [[Mass]] and Related Quantities 
*CCPR: Consultative Committee for [[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]] and [[Radiometry]] 
*CCQM: Consultative Committee for [[Amount of substance|Amount of Substance]] - Metrology in [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]] 
*CCRI: Consultative Committee for [[Ionizing Radiation]] 
*CCT: Consultative Committee for [[Thermometry]] 
*CCTF: Consultative Committee for [[Time]] and [[Frequency]] 
*CCU: Consultative Committee for Units

The CCU's role is to advise on matters related to the development of the SI and the preparation of the SI brochure.&lt;ref name = CC/&gt; It has liaison with other international bodies such as [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]], [[International Astronomical Union|International Astronomical Union (IAU)]], [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)]] and [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics|International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP)]].&lt;ref group = Note&gt;This is an incomplete list.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major reports===
Official reports of the CIPM include&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cipm/publications-cipm.html|title=BIPM - official reports|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Reports of CIPM meetings (''Procès-Verbaux'') (CIPM Minutes)
* Annual Report to Governments on the financial and administrative situation of the BIPM
* Notification of the contributive parts of the Contracting States
* Convocation to meetings of the CGPM
* Report of the President of the CIPM to the CGPM

From time to time the CIPM has been charged by the CGPM to undertake major investigations related to activities affecting the CGPM or the BIPM.  Reports produced include:&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Blevin Report====
The '''Blevin Report''', published in 1998, examined the state of worldwide metrology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/en/zip/blevin1998.zip
|title =National and international needs relating to metrology : International collaborations and the role of the BIPM 
|date = March 1998
|first1 = J
|last1 = Kovalevsky 
|first2 = WR
|last2 = Blevin
|publisher = Intergovernmental Organization of the Convention of the Metre
|location = [[Saint-Cloud]], France
|isbn =  92-822-2152-0
|accessdate = 14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report originated from a resolution passed at the 20th CGPM (October 1995) which committed the CIPM to {{quote|to study and report on the long-term national and international needs relating to metrology, the appropriate international collaborations and the unique role of the BIPM to meet these needs, and the financial and other commitments that will be required from the Member States in the coming decades.}}
The report identified, amongst other things, a need for closer cooperation between the BIPM and other organisations such as [[International Organization of Legal Metrology]] (OIML) and [[International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation]] (ILAC) with clearly defined boundaries and interfaces between the organisations.  Another major finding was the need for cooperation between accreditation laboratories and the need to involve [[Developing country|developing countries]] in the world of metrology.

====The Kaarls Report====
The Kaarls Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|publisher = Intergovernmental Organization of the Convention of the Metre
|location = [[Saint-Cloud]], France
|isbn =  92-822-2212-8
|accessdate = 14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2003 examined the role of the BIPM in the evolving needs for metrology in trade, industry and society.

====SI Brochure====
The CIPM has responsibility for commissioning the SI brochure, which is the formal definition of the [[International system of units]].  The brochure is produced by the CCU in conjunction with a number of other international organisations. Initially the brochure was only in French – the official language of the metre convention, but recent versions have been published simultaneously in both English and French, with the French text being the official text. The 6th edition was published in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|url = http://www.fisica.net/unidades/si-gov-usa.pdf
|title = The International System of Units (SI): Approved translation of the sixth edition (1991) of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures publication ''Le Système International d’Unités (SI)''
|publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]
|editor-first = Barry N. 
|editor-last = Taylor
|date = February 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 7th edition was published in 1998, and the 8th in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent edition is the 9th edition, published in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/ BIPM - SI brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;
