'''Alfonso Jordan''', also spelled '''Alfons Jordan''' or '''Alphonse Jourdain''' (1103–1148), was the [[Count of Tripoli]] (1105–09), [[Count of Rouergue]] (1109–48) and [[Count of Toulouse]], [[Margrave of Provence]] and [[Duke of Narbonne]] (1112–48).

He was the son of [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] by his third wife, [[Elvira of Castile, Countess of Toulouse|Elvira of Castile]]. He was born in the castle of Mont Pèlerin in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] while his father was on the [[First Crusade]]. He was given the name &quot;Jourdain&quot; after being baptised in the [[Jordan River]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Alfonso's father died when he was two years old and he remained under the guardianship of his cousin, [[Guillaume Jourdain|William Jordan]], [[Count of Cerdagne]], until he was five. He was then taken to Europe, where his half-brother [[Bertrand of Toulouse|Bertrand]] had given him the county of Rouergue. Upon Bertrand's death in 1112, Alfonso succeeded to the county of Toulouse and marquisate of Provence. 

In 1114, Duke [[William IX of Aquitaine]], who claimed Toulouse by right of his wife Philippa, daughter of Count [[William IV of Toulouse|William IV]], invaded the county and conquered it. Alfonso recovered a part in 1119, but he was not in full control until 1123. When at last successful, he was [[excommunicated]] by [[Pope Callixtus II]] for having expelled the monks of [[Saint-Gilles, Gard|Saint-Gilles]], who had aided his enemies.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Alfonso next had to fight for his rights in Provence against Count [[Raymond Berengar III of Barcelona]]. Not until September 1125 did their war end in &quot;peace and concord&quot; (''pax et concordia'').&lt;ref&gt;Adam Kosto, ''Making Agreements in Medieval Catalonia: Power, Order, and the Written Word, 1000–1200'' (Cambridge, 2001), 256–58.&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, Alfonso was master of the regions lying between the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]], the [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and the sea. His ascendancy was, according to one commentator, an unmixed good to the country, for during a period of fourteen years art and industry flourished.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
In March 1126, Alfonso was at the court of [[Alfonso VII of León]] when he acceded to the throne. 
According to the ''[[Chronica Adefonsi imperatoris]]'', Alfonso and [[Suero Vermúdez]] took the city of [[León, León|León]] from opposition magnates and handed it over to Alfonso VII.{{sfn|Barton|1997|pp=126–28|ps=. According to the ''Chronica'', &quot;count Alfonso of Toulouse ... was in all things obedient to him [Alfonso VII]&quot; (''comes Adefonsus Tolosanus ... in omnibus essent obedientes ei'').}} Among those who may have accompanied Alfonso on one of his many extended stays in Spain was the troubadour [[Marcabru]].{{sfn|Barton|1997|p=147}}{{sfn|Boissonade|1922}}

[[File:Denier Narbonne Alphonse Jourdain.jpg|thumb|A ''[[French denier|denier]]'' minted at Narbonne during the minority of Ermengard (1134–43) bearing the obverse inscription DUX ANFOS and on the reverse CIVI NARBON]]

About 1134 Alfonso seized the [[Viscount of Narbonne|viscounty of Narbonne]] and ruled it during the minority of the Viscountess [[Ermengarde of Narbonne|Ermengarde]], only restoring it to her in 1143. 
In 1141 King [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] pressed the claim of Philippa on behalf of his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], even besieging Toulouse, but without result.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
That same year Alfonso Jordan was again in Spain, making a [[Way of Saint James|pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostela]], when he proposed a peace between the king of León and [[García Ramírez of Navarre|García VI of Navarre]], which became the basis for subsequent negotiations.{{sfn|Barton|1997|pp=140, 211}}

In 1144, Alfonso again incurred the displeasure of the church by siding with the citizens of [[Montpellier]] against [[Lord of Montpellier|their lord]]. 
In 1145, [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] addressed a letter to him full of concern about a heretic named Henry in the diocese of Toulouse. 
Bernard even went there to preach against the heresy, an early expression of [[Catharism]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Leggett Wakefield and Austin Patterson Evans, ''Heresies of the High Middle Ages'' (Columbia University Press, 1991), 122.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A second time he was excommunicated; but in 1146 he took the cross (i.e., vowed to go on crusade) at a meeting in [[Vézelay]] called by Louis VII. 
In August 1147, he embarked for the near east on the [[Second Crusade]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
He lingered on the way in Italy and probably in [[Constantinople]], where he may have met the Emperor [[Manuel I Comnenus|Manuel I]].

Alfonso finally arrived at [[Acre, Palestine|Acre]] in 1148. 
Among his companions he had made enemies and he was destined to take no share in the crusade he had joined.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
He died at [[Caesarea]],{{sfn|Richard|1999|p=165}} and there were accusations of poisoning, usually levelled either against Eleanor of Aquitaine, wife of Louis, or [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Melisende]],{{sfn|Richard|1999|p=165}} the mother of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], who may have wanted to eliminate him as a rival to her brother-in-law [[Raymond II, Count of Tripoli|Raymond II]]. 
By his wife since 1125, Faydiva d'Uzès, he left two sons and three daughters : [[Raymond V of Toulouse|Raymond]], who succeeded him, Alphonse, [[Faidiva of Toulouse|Faydiva]] (died 1154) married to Count [[Humbert III of Savoy]], Agnes (died 1187) and Laurentia, who married Count [[Bernard III of Comminges]].
