Bachchan was initially named ''Inquilaab'', inspired by the phrase ''[[Inquilab Zindabad]]'' (which translates into English as &quot;Long live the revolution&quot;) popularly used during the [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] struggle. However, at the suggestion of fellow poet [[Sumitranandan Pant]], Harivansh Rai changed the boy's name to Amitabh, which, according to a ''[[The Times of India]]'' article, means &quot;the light that will never die&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/did-you-know-/Amitabh-was-initially-named-Inquilaab/articleshow/15889267.cms|title=Amitabh was initially named Inquilaab|work=The Times of India|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The Times of India is incorrect: अमिताभ (cf. the name of the Buddha [[Amitābha]]) means &quot;(one) whose light is infinite (literally: immeasurable)&quot; while &quot;(one) whose light will never die (i.e. is immortal)&quot; would be: अमृताभ; &quot;immeasurable light&quot; and &quot;immortal light&quot; would be अमिताभा and अमृताभा respectively which could not be used as masculine names since they are feminine compound nouns.}}

''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'' (1971) followed, in which Bachchan starred alongside [[Rajesh Khanna]]. His role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered Bachchan his first Filmfare ''[[List of awards for supporting actor|Best Supporting Actor]]'' award. He then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in ''[[Parwana (1971 film)|Parwana]]'' (1971). Following Parwana were several films including ''[[Reshma Aur Shera]]'' (1971).

Bachchan was struggling, seen as a &quot;failed newcomer&quot; who, by the age of 30, had twelve flops and only two hits (as a lead in ''Bombay to Goa'' and supporting role in ''Anand''). Bachchan was soon discovered by screenwriter duo [[Salim-Javed]], consisting of [[Salim Khan]] and [[Javed Akhtar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indianexpress2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Revisiting Prakash Mehra's Zanjeer: The film that made Amitabh Bachchan|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/revisiting-prakash-mehra-zanjeer-the-film-that-made-amitabh-bachchan-4714064/|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salim Khan wrote the story, screenplay and script of ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), and conceived the &quot;angry young man&quot; persona of the lead role.

However, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead &quot;angry young man&quot; role; it was turned down by a number of actors, owing to it going against the &quot;romantic hero&quot; image dominant in the industry at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;indianexpress2&quot;/&gt; Salim-Javed soon discovered Bachchan and &quot;saw his talent, which most makers didn't.

''Zanjeer'' was a [[crime film]] with violent action,&lt;ref name=&quot;indianexpress2&quot;/&gt; in sharp contrast to the [[Romance film|romantically themed films]] that had generally preceded it, and it established Amitabh in a new persona—the &quot;angry young man&quot; of Bollywood cinema.&lt;ref name=angryyoungman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1945451.stm |title=Film legend promotes Bollywood |publisher=BBC News |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his first [[Filmfare Award]] nomination for [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], with ''[[Filmfare]]'' later considering this one of the most iconic performances of Bollywood history.&lt;ref name=iconic1/&gt; The film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking Bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=179&amp;catName=MTk3Mw== |title=Box Office 1973 |publisher=Box Office India |accessdate=12 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020131818/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=179&amp;catName=MTk3Mw%3D%3D |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first of many collaborations between Salim-Javed and Amitabh Bachchan; Salim-Javed wrote many of their subsequent scripts with Bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975) and ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975).&lt;ref name=&quot;hindustantimes&quot;/&gt; Salim Khan also introduced Bachchan to director [[Manmohan Desai]] with whom he formed a long and successful association, alongside Prakash Mehra and [[Yash Chopra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia&quot;/&gt; Eventually, Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. Bachchan's portrayal of the wronged hero fighting a crooked system and circumstances of deprivation in films like ''Zanjeer'', ''Deeewar'', [[Trishul (film)|''Trishul'']], ''[[Kaala Patthar]]'' and ''[[Shakti (1982 film)|Shakti]]'' resonated with the masses of the time, especially the youth who harboured a simmering discontent owing to social ills such as poverty, [[hunger]], unemployment, corruption, [[social inequality]] and the brutal excesses of [[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]]. This led to Bachchan being dubbed as &quot;angry young man&quot;, a journalistic catchphrase which became a metaphor for the dormant rage, frustration, restlessness, sense of [[rebellion]] and [[anti-establishment]] disposition of an entire generation, prevalent in 1970s India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vinaylal.wordpress.com/tag/the-angry-young-man-in-hindi-cinema|title=the angry young man in Hindi cinema – Lal Salaam: A Blog by Vinay Lal|website=vinaylal.wordpress.com|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/10614647|title=The 'Angry Young Man' of 'Zanjeer': From Osborne to Bachchan|first=Maanvi |last=Narcisa|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19893525|title=Why Amitabh Bachchan is more than a superstar|date=11 October 2012|accessdate=21 July 2018|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281116060|title=Writing the Angry Young Man: Salim-Javed's screenplays for Amitabh Bachchan|first=Claus|last=Tieber|date=21 August 2015|accessdate=21 July 2018|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 1973 was also when he married Jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together: not only ''Zanjeer'' but also subsequent films such as ''[[Abhimaan (1973 film)|Abhimaan]]'', which was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office. Later, Bachchan played the role of Vikram, once again along with Rajesh Khanna, in the film ''[[Namak Haraam]]'', a social drama directed by [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]] and scripted by Biresh Chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. His supporting role won him his second Filmfare ''[[List of awards for supporting actor|Best Supporting Actor]]'' award.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

In 1974, Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as ''[[Kunwara Baap (1974 film)|Kunwara Baap]]'' and ''[[Dost (1974 film)|Dost]]'', before playing a supporting role in ''[[Roti Kapda Aur Makaan]]''. The film, directed and written by [[Manoj Kumar]], addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship and was the top-earning film of 1974. Bachchan then played the leading role in the film ''[[Majboor (1974 film)|Majboor]]''. The film was a success at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=180&amp;catName=MTk3NA== Box Office India].{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020121213/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=180&amp;catName=MTk3NA%3D%3D |date=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid Career (1975–1988)===
In 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres, from the comedy ''[[Chupke Chupke]]'' and the crime drama ''[[Faraar]]'' to the romantic drama ''[[Mili (1975 film)|Mili]]''. This was also the year in which Bachchan starred in two films regarded as important in [[Hindi cinema]] history, both written by Salim-Javed, who again insisted on casting Bachchan.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindustantimes&quot;/&gt; The first was ''Deewaar'', directed by Yash Chopra, where he worked with [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Nirupa Roy]], [[Parveen Babi]], and [[Neetu Singh]], and earned another Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=181&amp;catName=MTk3NQ== |title=Box Office 1975 |work=BoxOffice India.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020122136/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=181&amp;catName=MTk3NQ%3D%3D |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Indiatimes Movies'' ranks ''Deewaar'' amongst the ''Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films''.&lt;ref name=&quot;mustsee&quot;/&gt; The other, released on 15 August 1975, was ''[[Sholay]]'', which became the [[List of highest-grossing films in India|highest-grossing film ever in India]] at the time,&lt;ref name=boxoffice&gt;{{cite web|title=Sholay |url=http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/filmbodetails.asp?id=Sholay |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630155123/http://www.ibosnetwork.com/asp/filmbodetails.asp?id=Sholay |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 June 2012 |publisher=International Business Overview Standard |accessdate=6 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Bachchan played the role of Jaidev.

In 1976, he was cast by Yash Chopra in the romantic family drama ''[[Kabhie Kabhie (1976 film)|Kabhie Kabhie]]''. Bachchan starred as a young poet, Amit Malhotra, who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named Pooja ([[Rakhee Gulzar]]) who ends up marrying someone else ([[Shashi Kapoor]]). The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his &quot;angry young man&quot; roles like ''Zanjeer'' and ''Deewar''. The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike. Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film. That same year he played a double role in the hit ''[[Adalat (1976 film)|Adalat]]'' as father and son. In 1977, he won his first [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Filmfare Best Actor Award]] for his performance in ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'', in which he played the third lead opposite [[Vinod Khanna]] and [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Anthony Gonsalves. The film was the highest-grossing film of that year. His other successes that year include ''[[Parvarish (1977 film)|Parvarish]]'' and ''[[Khoon Pasina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=183&amp;catName=MTk3Nw== |title=Box Office 1977 |publisher=Box Office India |accessdate=11 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012163829/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=183&amp;catName=MTk3Nw%3D%3D |archivedate=12 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He once again resumed double roles in films such as ''[[Kasme Vaade]]'' (1978) as Amit and Shankar and ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978) playing the characters of [[Don (character)|Don]], a leader of an underworld gang and his look-alike Vijay. His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award. He also gave towering performances in Yash Chopra's [[Trishul (film)|'' Trishul'']] and Prakash Mehra's ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'' both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations. 1978 is arguably considered his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases the same year, namely ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'', ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'', ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'', ''[[Kasme Vaade]]'', ''[[Ganga Ki Saugandh]]'' and ''[[Besharam]]'' were massive successes, the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, remarkably releasing within a couple of months of each other, a rare feat in Indian cinema.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibosnetwork.com/asp/topgrossersbyyear.asp?year=1978 ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Bollywood films of 1978#Top-grossing films]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.rediff.com/movies/2000/oct/11box.htm|title=rediff.com, Movies: The Towering Inferno: Amitabh Bachchan|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Bachchan starred in ''[[Suhaag (1979 film)|Suhaag]]'' which was the highest earning film of that year. In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like ''[[Mr. Natwarlal]]'', ''[[Kaala Patthar]]'', ''[[The Great Gambler]]'' and ''[[Manzil (1979 film)|Manzil]]''. Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film ''Mr. Natwarlal'' in which he starred with [[Rekha]]. Bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the Filmfare Best Actor Award and the ''[[Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer]]''. He also received Best Actor nomination for ''Kaala Patthar'' and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the [[Raj Khosla]] directed film ''[[Dostana (1980 film)|Dostana]]'', in which he starred opposite [[Shatrughan Sinha]] and [[Zeenat Aman]]. ''Dostana'' proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=186&amp;catName=MTk4MA== |title=BoxOffice India.com |publisher=BoxOffice India.com |accessdate=15 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102005754/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=186&amp;catName=MTk4MA%3D%3D |archivedate=2 January 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, he starred in Yash Chopra's melodrama film ''[[Silsila (1981 film)|Silsila]]'', where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and also Rekha. Other successful films of this period include ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980), ''[[Ram Balram]]'' (1980), ''[[Naseeb (1981 film)|Naseeb]]'' (1981), ''[[Laawaris (1981 film)|Lawaaris]]'' (1981), ''[[Kaalia]]'' (1981), ''[[Yaarana (1981 film)|Yaarana]]'' (1981), ''[[Barsaat Ki Ek Raat]]'' (1981) and ''[[Shakti (1982 film)|Shakti]]'' (1982), also starring [[Dilip Kumar]].

In 1982, he played double roles in the musical ''[[Satte Pe Satta]]'' and action [[drama film|drama]]'' [[Desh Premee]]'' which succeeded at the box office along with mega hits like action [[comedy film|comedy]] ''[[Namak Halaal]]'', action [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Khud-Daar]]'' and the critically acclaimed [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Bemisal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=187&amp;catName=MTk4MQ== |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072451/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=187&amp;catName=MTk4MQ%3D%3D |title=Boxofficeindia.com |archivedate=28 September 2013 |publisher=Box Office India |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, he played a triple role in ''[[Mahaan]]'' which was not as successful as his previous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=189&amp;catName=MTk4Mw== |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928072533/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=189&amp;catName=MTk4Mw%3D%3D |title=Boxofficeindia.com |archivedate=28 September 2013 |publisher=Box Office India |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other releases during that year included ''[[Nastik (1983 film)|Nastik]]'', ''[[Andha Kanoon]]'' (in which he had an extended guest appearance) which were hits and ''[[Pukar (1983 film)|Pukar]]'' was an average grosser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000029494/|title=Highest Grossing Hindi Movies of 1983|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, his completed films [[Mard (1985 film)|''Mard'']] (1985) and ''[[Aakhree Raasta]]'' (1986) were released and were major hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realityviews.in/2012/10/list-of-40-all-time-super-hit-movies-of.html|title=List of 40 All Time Super hit movies of Amitabh Bachchan|last=SM|first=Mitesh Shah aka|website=realityviews.in|access-date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coolie'' injury'''

On 26 July 1982, while filming ''[[Coolie (1983 Hindi film)|Coolie]]'', in the University Campus in Bangalore, Bachchan suffered a near-fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor [[Puneet Issar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolie fight scene&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Rediff.com |title=Bachchan injured whilst shooting scene |url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/oct/11amit.htm |accessdate=11 March 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070304103635/http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/oct/11amit.htm| archivedate= 4 March 2007 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. However, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a [[Splenic injury|splenic rupture]] from which he lost a significant amount of blood. He required an emergency [[splenectomy]] and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. The overwhelming public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Amitabh-Bachchan-no-longer-excited-about-birthdays/Article1-463669.aspx |title=Amitabh Bachchan no longer excited about birthdays |work=Hindustan Times |date=10 October 2009 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. The film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of Bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top-grossing film of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coolie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Box Office India |title=Coolie a success |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=125&amp;catName=MTk4MC0xOTg5 |accessdate=11 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112040659/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=125 |archivedate=12 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The director, [[Manmohan Desai]], altered the ending of ''Coolie'' after Bachchan's accident. Bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. It would have been inappropriate, said Desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. Also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&amp;ID=250266&amp;subcatg=&amp;keyword=Bollywood&amp;nid=250266 |title=30 years after the Coolie accident: Big B's &quot;second birthday&quot; |publisher=Movies.ndtv.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130129170555/http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&amp;ID=250266&amp;subcatg=&amp;keyword=Bollywood&amp;nid=250266 |archivedate=29 January 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he was diagnosed with [[Myasthenia gravis]]. His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. At this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and stating before every release, &quot;Yeh film to flop hogi!&quot; (&quot;This film will flop&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Myasthenia Gravis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=mouthshut.com|title=Reviews on: To Be or Not To Be Amitabh Bachchan |author =Mohamed, Khalid|url=http://www.mouthshut.com/review/To_Be_or_Not_To_Be_Amitabh_Bachchan_-_Khalid_Mohamed-72513-1.html |accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amitabhbachchan28529.jpg|right|thumb|Bachchan during the shoot of 1990 Hindi film ''[[Agneepath (1990 film)|Agneepath]]]]
After a three-year stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, Bachchan returned to films in 1988, playing the title role in ''[[Shahenshah (1988 film)|Shahenshah]]'', which was a box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actors&amp;PHPSESSID=cfa06e3b5a051913d58987e99cd292ae |work=boxofficeindia.com/topactors.htm |title=Top Actor |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191201/http://boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actors |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like ''[[Jaadugar]]'', ''[[Toofan (1989 film)|Toofan]]'' and ''[[Main Azaad Hoon]]'' (all released in 1989) failed at the box office. Successes during this period like the [[crime drama|crime]] [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Aaj Ka Arjun]]'' (1990) and [[action drama|action]] [[crime drama|crime]] [[drama film|drama]] ''[[Hum (film)|Hum]]'' (1991), for which he won his third Filmfare Best Actor Award, looked like they might reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=196&amp;catName=MTk5MA==|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921115954/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=196&amp;catName=MTk5MA==|archivedate=21 September 2013|title=Boxofficeindia.com|date=21 September 2013|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=197&amp;catName=MTk5MQ==|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921103709/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=197&amp;catName=MTk5MQ==|archivedate=21 September 2013|title=Boxofficeindia.com|date=21 September 2013|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that Bachchan won his first [[National Film Award for Best Actor]] for his performance as a Mafia don in the 1990 [[cult following|cult]] film ''[[Agneepath (1990 film)|Agneepath]].'' These years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. After the release of the critically acclaimed epic ''[[Khuda Gawah]]'' in 1992, Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. With the exception of the delayed release of ''[[Insaniyat (1994 film)|Insaniyat]]'' (1994), which was also a box office failure, Bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxoffice1994&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=200&amp;catName=MTk5NA== |publisher=Box Office India |title=Box Office 1994 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107074858/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=200 |archivedate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Productions and acting comeback (1996–1999)===
Bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up [[Amitabh Bachchan Corporation]], Ltd. (ABCL) in 1996. ABCL's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of India's entertainment industry.

In 1997, Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film ''[[Mrityudata]]'', produced by ABCL. Though ''Mrityudaata'' attempted to reprise Bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/collapse-of-mrityudaata-diminishes-amitabh-bachchans-godlike-status/1/275854.html|title=Collapse of Mrityudaata diminishes Amitabh Bachchan's godlike status|website=India Today|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABCL was the main sponsor of the ''[[Miss World 1996|1996 Miss World beauty pageant]]'', [[Bangalore]], but lost millions. The fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding ABCL and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that ABCL was reported to have overpaid most of its top-level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/after-dream-venture-abcl-go-bankrupt-amitabh-bachchan-faces-legal-battle-with-creditors/1/253830.html|title=After dream venture ABCL go bankrupt, Amitabh Bachchan faces legal battle with creditors|website=India Today|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.rediff.com/money/1999/apr/26abcl.htm|title=Rediff on the NeT Business News: Businessman Bachchan braves a bad patch as ABCL falls sick|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by the Indian Industries board. The Bombay high court, in April 1999, restrained Bachchan from selling off his Bombay [[bungalow]] 'Prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of [[Canara Bank]] were disposed of.

Bachchan attempted to revive his acting career, and eventually had commercial success with ''[[Bade Miyan Chote Miyan]]'' (1998) and ''[[Major Saab]]'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=2556|title=Major Saab – Movie|publisher=Box Office India|access-date=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received positive reviews for ''[[Sooryavansham]]'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/movies/1999/may/22soo.htm |author =Taliculam, Sharmila |title=He's back!}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other films such as ''[[Lal Baadshah]]'' (1999) and ''[[Hindustan Ki Kasam (1999 film)|Hindustan Ki Kasam]]'' (1999) were box office failures.{{cn|date=October 2019}}

===Return to prominence (2000–present)===

In 2000, Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra's box-office hit, ''[[Mohabbatein]]'', directed by [[Aditya Chopra]]. He played a stern, elder figure who rivalled the character of [[Shah Rukh Khan|Shahrukh Khan]]. His role won him his third [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award]]. Other hits followed, with Bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in ''[[Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love]]'' (2001), ''[[Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...]]'' (2001) and ''[[Baghban (2003 film)|Baghban]]'' (2003). As an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in ''[[Aks (2001 film)|Aks]]'' (2001), ''[[Aankhen (2002 film)|Aankhen]]'' (2002), ''[[Kaante]]'' (2002), ''[[Khakee]]'' (2004) and ''[[Dev (2004 film)|Dev]]'' (2004).
His performance in ''Aks'' won him his first [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor]].

One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]]'s ''[[Black (2005 film)|Black]]'' (2005). The film starred Bachchan as an ageing teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor, his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award and his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor. Taking advantage of this resurgence, Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. In 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son Abhishek in the films ''[[Bunty Aur Babli]]'' (2005), the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' tribute ''[[Sarkar (2005 film)|Sarkar]]'' (2005), and ''[[Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna]]'' (2006). All of them were successful at the box office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starring with son&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Box Office India |title=Amitabh and Abhishek rule the box office |url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=211&amp;catName=MjAwNQ== |accessdate=11 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708085904/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=211&amp;catName=MjAwNQ== |archivedate=8 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=212&amp;catName=MjAwNg== |title=Box Office 2006 |publisher=Box Office India |accessdate=11 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217062452/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=212 |archivedate=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were ''[[Baabul (2006 film)|Baabul]]'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=212&amp;catName=MjAwNg== |title=Films fail at the BO |publisher=Box Office India |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818140640/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=212 |archivedate=18 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ekalavya]]'' and ''[[Nishabd]]'' (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bachchan's films fail at the box office&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=Bollywood Hungma |author=Adarsh, Taran |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/trade/top5/326.html |title=Top 5: 'Nishabd', 'N.P.D.' are disasters |accessdate=26 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114110548/http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/trade/top5/326.html |archivedate=14 January 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, two of his films: the romantic comedy ''[[Cheeni Kum]]'' and the multi-starrer action drama ''[[Shootout at Lokhandwala]]'' were released. ''Shootout at Lokhandwala'' did well at the box office and was declared a hit in India, while ''Cheeni Kum'' picked up after a slow start and was a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=225|title=Shootout at Lokhandwala – Movie|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=214&amp;catName=MjAwNw==|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115223235/http://boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=214&amp;catName=MjAwNw==|archivedate=15 January 2013|title=Boxofficeindia.com|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficeindia.com/circuit_collection.php?movieid=347&amp;cityid=1&amp;area=domestic|title=Cheeni Kum – Movie –|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;udxlrh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=214 |title=Box Office 2007 |publisher=Box Office India |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109040918/http://www.boxofficeindia.com/showProd.php?itemCat=214 |archivedate=9 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A remake of his biggest hit, ''Sholay'' (1975), entitled ''[[Aag (2007 film)|Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag]]'', released in August of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception.&lt;ref name = &quot;udxlrh&quot;/&gt; The year also marked Bachchan's first appearance in an English-language film, [[Rituparno Ghosh]]'s ''[[The Last Lear]]'', co-starring [[Arjun Rampal]] and [[Preity Zinta]]. The film premiered at the [[2007 Toronto International Film Festival]] on 9 September 2007. He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best ever since ''Black''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldbh.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/09/11/3020|title=This is Amitabh's best performance after Black}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film, ''[[Shantaram (film)|Shantaram]]'', directed by [[Mira Nair]] and starring Hollywood actor [[Johnny Depp]] in the lead. The film was due to begin filming in February 2008 but due to the writer's strike, was pushed to September 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollywood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ourbollywood.com |title=Amitabh Bachchan to star with Johnny Depp |url=http://www.ourbollywood.com/2007/02/amitabh_bachchan_will_star_opp.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070401195932/http://www.ourbollywood.com/2007/02/amitabh_bachchan_will_star_opp.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 April 2007 | accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is currently &quot;shelved&quot; indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/the-diary-shantaram-film--lumiere-festival-tom-atkinson-hans-holbein-harold-evans-1819450.html | title=Underworld tale won't see light of day | date=13 November 2009 | accessdate=23 May 2010 | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Arifa | last=Akbar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vivek Sharma]]'s ''[[Bhoothnath]]'', in which he plays the title role as a ghost, was released on 9 May 2008. ''[[Sarkar Raj]]'', the sequel of the 2005 film ''Sarkar'', released in June 2008 and received a positive response at the box office.  ''[[Paa (film)|Paa]]'', which released at the end of 2009 was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son Abhishek's Progeria-affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards Bachchan's performance and was one of the top-grossing films of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficeindia.com/years.php?year=2009&amp;pageId=4|title=Top India Total Nett Gross 2009 –|publisher=Box Office India|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award.

In 2013 he made his Hollywood debut in ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' making a special appearance opposite [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Tobey Maguire]]. In 2014, he played the role of the friendly ghost in the sequel ''[[Bhoothnath Returns]]''. The next year, he played the role of a grumpy father suffering from chronic constipation in the critically acclaimed ''[[Piku]]'' which was also one of the biggest hits of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficehits.in/collection/piku-total-collection-lifetime-business-total-worldwide-collection.html|title=Piku Total Collection – Lifetime Business – Total Worldwide Collection – Box Office Hits|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722011611/http://www.boxofficehits.in/collection/piku-total-collection-lifetime-business-total-worldwide-collection.html|archive-date=22 July 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/photos/business-gallery/71357/piku-box-office-collections-amitabh-bachchan-starrer-steady-at-rs-21-18-cr-by-day-2/|title=Amitabh Bachchan boosts Piku box office collections to over Rs 100 cr, slowly, steadily|date=11 May 2015|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/piku-13-days-box-office-collection-deepika-amitabh-starrer-grosses-100-crore-worldwide-633076|title='Piku' 13 Days Box Office Collection: Deepika-Amitabh Starrer Grosses ₹100 Crore Worldwide|first=Ankita|last=Mehta|accessdate=21 July 2018|date=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''[[Daily News and Analysis]]'' (DNA) summarised Bachchan's performance as &quot;The heart and soul of Piku clearly belong to Amitabh Bachchan who is in his elements.

Bhashkor's life and conversation may revolve around his constipation and fussy hypochondria, but there's no mistaking the scene-stealing energy that Mr. Bachchan, India's erstwhile Angry Young Man, musters for his new role of Cranky Old Man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/movies/review-in-piku-amitabh-bachchan-plays-a-dad-to-deepika-padukone.html|title=Review: In 'Piku,' Amitabh Bachchan Plays a Dad to Deepika Padukone|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well known Indian critic Rajeev Masand wrote on his website, &quot;Bachchan is pretty terrific as Bhashkor, who reminds you of that oddball uncle that you nevertheless have a soft spot for. He bickers with the maids, harrows his hapless helper, and expects that Piku stay unmarried so she can attend to him. At one point, to ward off a possible suitor, he casually mentions that his daughter isn't a virgin; that she's financially independent and sexually independent too. Bachchan embraces the character's many idiosyncrasies, never once slipping into caricature while all along delivering big laughs thanks to his spot-on comic timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rajeevmasand.com/reviews/our-films/poop-dreams/|title=Poop dreams – Rajeev Masand – movies that matter : from bollywood, hollywood and everywhere else|author=Rockstah Media |website=rajeevmasand.com|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' summed up, &quot;Bachchan seizes upon his cranky character part, making Bashkor as garrulously funny in his theories on caste and marriage as his system is backed-up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/piku-review-amitabh-bachchan-lets-it-all-out-in-constipation-comedy|title=Piku review: Amitabh Bachchan lets it all out in constipation comedy|first=Mike|last=McCahill|date=18 May 2015|website=The Guardian|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance won Bachchan his fourth National Film Award for Best Actor and his third Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.

According to Raja Sen of Rediff.com, &quot;Amitabh Bachchan, a retired lawyer suffering from bipolar disorder, takes up cudgels on behalf of the girls, delivering courtroom blows with pugilistic grace. Like we know from Prakash Mehra movies, into each life some Bachchan must fall. The girls hang on to him with incredulous desperation, and he bats for them with all he has. At one point Meenal hangs by Bachchan's elbow, words entirely unnecessary. Bachchan towers through Pink – the way he bellows &quot;et cetera&quot; is alone worth having the heavy-hitter at play—but there are softer moments like one where he appears to have dozed off in court, or where he lays his head by his convalescent wife's bedside and needs his hair ruffled and his conviction validated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/review-pink-a-film-that-must-be-championed/20160916.htm|title=Review: Pink, a film that must be championed|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[Hindustan Times]], noted film critic and author [[Anupama Chopra]] said of Bachchan's performance, &quot;A special salute to Amitabh Bachchan, who imbues his character with a tragic majesty.

===Politics===
In 1984, Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of a long-time family friend, [[Rajiv Gandhi]]. He contested [[Allahabad (Lok Sabha constituency)|Allahabad]]'s seat for the [[8th Lok Sabha]] against [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna|H. N. Bahuguna]], former [[List of Chief Ministers of Uttar Pradesh|Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh]] and won by one of the highest victory margins in [[General elections in India|general election history]] (68.2% of the vote).&lt;ref name=election&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/amitabh/politics.htm |title=Amitabh Bachchan: Stint in Politics |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=5 December 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060109123607/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/specials/amitabh/politics.htm| archivedate= 9 January 2006 | url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a [[Cesspit|cesspool]]. The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the &quot;[[Bofors scandal]]&quot; by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathnam.com/Features/17/interview-with-amitabh-bachchan |title=Interview with Amitabh Bachchan |publisher=sathnam.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531142512/http://www.sathnam.com/Features/17/interview-with-amitabh-bachchan |archivedate=31 May 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal. He was framed in the scam and falsely alleged. This was cleared by Swedish police chief Sten Lindstrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bofors-scam-amitabh-jaya-bachchan-react-to-whistle-blowers-revelations-478497|date=25 April 2012|title=Bofors scam: Amitabh, Jaya Bachchan react to whistle-blower's revelations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His old friend, [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]], helped him during the financial crisis caused by the failure of his company, [[Amitabh Bachchan Corporation|ABCL]]. Thereafter Bachchan started supporting the [[Samajwadi Party]], the political party to which Amar Singh belonged. Furthermore, Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi Party and represented the party as an MP in the [[Rajya Sabha]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/02/18/stories/2007021804271000.htm &quot;Bachchan has no plans for the election.&quot;] ''The Hindu''.&lt;/ref&gt; Bachchan has continued to do favours for the Samajwadi Party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns. These activities have recently got him into trouble in the Indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJuYOasTF-bsTo0AQjW96aD2Kr2w |title=Bollywood's Bachchan in trouble over crime claim |agency=Agence France-Presse |date=4 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116120716/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJuYOasTF-bsTo0AQjW96aD2Kr2w |archivedate=16 January 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by ''[[Stardust (magazine)|Stardust]]'' and some of the other film magazines.

Bachchan has been accused of using the slogan &quot;blood for blood&quot; in the context of the [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]].
