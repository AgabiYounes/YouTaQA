''' Alberta's economy''' is the sum of all [[economic activity]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canadian provinces by population|Canada's fourth largest province by population]]. Alberta's GDP in 2018 was CDN$338.2 billion. Although Alberta has a presence in many industries such as agriculture, forestry, education, tourism, finance, and manufacturing, the politics and culture of the province have been closely tied to the production of [[fossil energy]] since the 1940s. Alberta—with an estimated 1.4 billion cubic metres of [[unconventional oil]] resource in the bituminous [[oil sands]]—leads Canada as an oil producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan_2003&quot; /&gt; Revenue from oil and natural gas extraction has fueled a series of economic booms in the province's recent history, and [[economic spin-off]]s have included petrochemical and pipelines. In 1985, the energy industry accounted for 36.1% of Alberta's GDP;&lt;ref name=&quot;GovAB_2017407&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Highlights of the Alberta Economy |url=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/10989a51-f3c2-4dcb-ac0f-f07ad88f9b3b/resource/a4037953-4c78-4550-b71f-cde59f7f1422/download/6864680-2014-07-highlights-alberta-economy-presentation.pdf |date=July 2017 |access-date=September 7, 2019 |pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} In 2006, it was 29.1%;&lt;ref name=&quot;GovAB_2018&quot;/&gt;{{rp|3}} by 2012 it was 23.3%;&lt;ref name=&quot;occinfo_alis_alberta_2016&quot; /&gt; in 2013, it was 24.6%,&lt;ref name=&quot;GovAB_2017407&quot;/&gt;{{rp|6}} and in 2016, 27.9%.&lt;ref name=&quot;GovAB_2018&quot;/&gt;{{rp|3}} Alberta's GDP was $66.8 billion in 1985,&lt;ref name=&quot;GovAB_2017407&quot;/&gt; and $335 billion in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economicdashboard.alberta.ca/grossdomesticproduct|title=Economic Dashboard - Gross Domestic Product|website=economicdashboard.alberta.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By comparison, &quot;In 2017, the federal, provincial and territorial governments spent some $724 billion on programs and more than $58 billion on interest payments on their public debt, which, combined, amounted to about 36 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP).

Tombes said that relative to Alberta's &quot;growth path prior to the recession&quot; Alberta's economy is &quot;down $100 billion per year&quot;, compared to what was anticipated.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Tombe_20190731&quot;/&gt; Tombes said that the &quot;boom years that ended in 2014 were the outliers&quot; and the lower earnings in 2019 reflect a &quot;natural adjustment that's moving Alberta to a more normal and balanced labour market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Tombe_20190731&quot;/&gt; While earnings are lower, because of inflation, prices have increased in Alberta by 18% since 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Tombe_20190731&quot;/&gt; &quot;The $1,183 per week a typical worker earns today goes about as far as $1,000 did nearly a decade ago.&quot;, according to Tombe.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Tombe_20190731&quot;/&gt; In spite of the typical worker in Alberta earns $1,183 per week compared to Saskatchewan, where the typical worker earns $1,070 per week. The weekly income a typical worker in all the other Canadian provinces and territories is less than that.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Tombe_20190731&quot;/&gt;

==Economic geography==
[[File:Alberta, Canada.svg|thumb|left|Alberta's location within Canada]]
{{see also|Geography of Alberta|List of regions of Alberta}}

Alberta has a small internal market, and it is relatively distant from major [[World economy|world market]]s, despite good [[transportation in Canada|transportation links to the rest of Canada]] and [[transportation in the United States|to the United States to the south]]. Alberta is located in the [[Geography of North America|northwestern quadrant]] of [[North America]], in a region of low [[population density]] called the [[Interior Plains]]. Alberta is [[landlocked]], and separated by [[Western Cordillera (North America)|a series of mountain ranges]] from the nearest [[List of North American ports#Canada 5|outlets]] to the [[British Columbia Coast|Pacific Ocean]], and by the [[Canadian Shield]] from ports on [[Thunder Bay|the Lakehead]] or [[Hudson Bay]]. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston&amp;nbsp;– Washington]], [[California megapolitan areas|San Francisco - San Diego]], [[Great Lakes Megalopolis|Chicago&amp;nbsp;– Pittsburgh]], and [[Quebec City&amp;nbsp;– Windsor Corridor]]s) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started [[industrialization]] in other places (notably the original [[Industrial Revolution]] in Great Britain) but which require large [[labour force]]s, and large internal markets or easy transportation to export markets, namely [[Textile manufacturing|textiles]], [[metallurgy]], or transportation-related manufacturing ([[automotive manufacturing|automotives]], [[ship building|ships]], or [[List of locomotive builders|train cars]]).

[[Agriculture in Canada|Agriculture]] has been a key industry since the 1870s. The climate is dry, [[temperate]], and [[continental climate|continental]], with extreme variations between seasons. Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province (excluding the mountains), and in certain parts of the north. Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta than anywhere else in North America, extending into the [[Peace River country]] above the [[55th parallel north]]. Generally, however, [[northern Alberta]] (and areas along the [[Alberta Rockies]]) is forested land and [[logging]] is more important than agriculture there. Agriculture is divided into primarily [[field crops]] in the east, [[livestock]] in the west, and a mixture in between and in the [[Aspen parkland|parkland belt]] in the near north.

Conventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast. Oil sands are found in the northeast, especially around [[Fort McMurray]] (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).

Because of its (relatively) economically isolated location, Alberta relies heavily on [[transportation in Alberta|transportation links]] with the rest of the world. Alberta's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new [[transportation infrastructure]], (see &quot;trends&quot; below). Alberta is now served by two major [[transcontinental railways]] ([[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), by three major highway connections to the Pacific (the [[Trans-Canada (highway)|Trans-Canada]] via [[Kicking Horse Pass]], the [[Yellowhead (highway)|Yellowhead]] via [[Yellowhead Pass]] and the [[Crowsnest (highway)|Crowsnest]] via [[Crowsnest Pass]]), and one to the United States ([[Interstate 15]]), as well as two international airports ([[Calgary International Airport|Calgary]] and [[Edmonton International Airport|Edmonton]]).  Also, Alberta is connected to the [[TransCanada pipeline|TransCanada pipeline system]] (natural gas) to Eastern Canada, the [[Northern Border Pipeline]] (gas), [[Alliance Pipeline]] (gas)  and [[Enbridge Pipeline System]] (oil) to the Eastern United States, the [[Gas Transmission Northwest]] and [[Northwest Pipeline]] (gas) to the Western United States, and the [[McNeill HVDC Back-to-back station]] (electric power) to Saskatchewan.

{{Economy of Canada}}

=== Economic regions and cities ===
Since the days of early agricultural settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the [[parkland belt]] (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the [[North Saskatchewan River]] from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the [[Rocky Mountain foothills]] south to Calgary.  This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier [[prairie]] (grassland) region called [[Palliser's Triangle]] to its south, and large areas of the south (the &quot;[[Special Areas, Alberta|Special Areas]]&quot;) were [[depopulated]] during the [[drought]]s of the 1920s and 30s.  The [[chernozem]] (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south.  Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt.  Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe.  Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities.  Grande Prairie lies in the [[Peace River Country]] a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated from the rest of the parkland by the forested [[Swan Hills]].  [[Fort McMurray]] is the only urbanized population centre in the [[boreal forest of Canada|boreal forest]] which covers much of the northern half of the province.

==== Calgary and Edmonton ====
The Calgary and Edmonton regions, by far the province's two largest metropolitan regions, account for the majority of the province's population.  They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg.  This has produced a history of political and economic rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities.

The economic profile of the two regions is slightly different.  Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands.  However, Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies.  Edmonton skews much more towards governments, universities and hospitals as large employers, while Edmonton's suburban fringes (e.g. [[Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]], [[Strathcona County]] ([[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]]), [[Leduc, Alberta|Leduc]], [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Acheson, Alberta|Acheson]]) are home to most of the province's manufacturing (much of it related to oil and gas).&lt;ref name=&quot;edmontonjournal_Lamphier_20161210&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lamphier| first = Gary| newspaper = Edmonton Journal |title=It's a wrap, folks: thanks for a great run | access-date = September 5, 2019| date = December 10, 2016| url = https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/gary-lamphier-its-a-wrap-folks-thanks-for-a-great-run}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Calgary-Edmonton Corridor =====
The [[Calgary-Edmonton Corridor]] is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada. Measured from north to south, the region covers a distance of roughly {{convert|400|km}}. In 2001, the population of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor was 2.15 million (72% of Alberta's population).&lt;ref name=&quot;CECorridor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton corridor|work=[[Statistics Canada]], 2001 Census of Population|date=2003-01-20|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. A 2003 study by [[TD Bank Financial Group]] found the corridor was the only Canadian urban centre to amass a U.S. level of wealth while maintaining a Canadian-style quality of life, offering universal health care benefits. The study found GDP per capita in the corridor was 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

===== Calgary–Edmonton rivalry =====
{{See also|Battle of Alberta}}
Seeing Calgary and Edmonton as part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel. The more traditional view had been to see the two cities as economic rivals. For example, in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the &quot;Oil Capital of Canada&quot;.

==Background==
[[File:Leduc oil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Leduc No. 1]] well, which blew in 1947, marked the beginning of series of petroleum-related [[economic booms]].]]
{{See also|History of Alberta|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}

Alberta has always been an [[export-oriented economy]]. In line with [[Harold Innis]]' &quot;[[Staples Thesis]]&quot;, the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance. In sequence, the most important products have been: fur, wheat and beef, and oil and gas.

The development of [[transportation in Alberta]] has been crucial to its historical economic development. The [[North American fur trade]] relied on [[birch-bark canoes]], [[York boats]], and [[Red River carts]] on [[buffalo trails]] to move furs out of, and European trade goods into, the region. Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s [[transcontinental line]] in 1880s. Commercial farming became viable in the area once the [[grain trade]] had developed technologies to handle the [[bulk cargo|bulk]] export of grain, especially [[hopper car]]s and [[grain elevator]]s. Oil and gas exports have been possible because of increasing [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] technology.

Prior to the 1950s, Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy, based on the export of [[grain trade|wheat]], [[beef]], and a few other [[Commodity|commodities]]. The health of economy was closely bound up with the [[price of wheat]].

In 1947 a major [[oil field]] was discovered near Edmonton. It was not the first petroleum find in Alberta, but it was large enough to significantly alter the economy of the province (and coincided with growing American demand for energy). Since that time, Alberta's economic fortunes have largely tracked the [[price of oil]], and increasingly [[natural gas prices]]. When oil prices spiked during the [[1967 Oil Embargo]], [[1973 oil crisis]], and [[1979 energy crisis]], Alberta's economy boomed. However, during the [[1980s oil glut]] Alberta's economy suffered. Alberta boomed once again during the [[2003 to 2008 world oil market chronology|2003-2008 oil price spike]]. In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta's economy soon followed suit, with unemployment doubling within a year.  By 2009 with natural gas prices at a long-term low, Alberta's economy was in poor health compared to before, although still relatively better than many other comparable jurisdictions.  By 2012 natural gas prices were at a ten-year low, the Canadian dollar was high, and oil prices recovered until June 2014.

The spin-offs from petroleum allowed Alberta to develop many other industries. Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example, but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money.

A comparison of the development of Alberta's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, reveals the role petroleum has played. Alberta was once the smallest of the three [[Prairie Provinces]] by population in the early 20th century, but by 2009, Alberta's population was 3,632,483 or approximately three times as much as either Saskatchewan (1,023,810) or Manitoba (1,213,815).

==Employment==

In 2018, Alberta's energy sector contributed over $71.5 billion to Canada's nominal gross domestic product.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRCAN_20190907&quot;/&gt; According to [[Statistics Canada]], in May 2018, the oil and gas extraction industry reached its highest proportion of Canada's national GDP since 1985, exceeding 7% and &quot;surpass[ing] banking and insurance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Fletcher_20180731&quot;/&gt; with extraction of non-conventional oil from the oilsands reaching an &quot;impressive&quot;, all-time high in May 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Fletcher_20180731&quot;/&gt; With conventional oil extraction &quot;climbed up to the highs from 2007&quot;, the demand for Canadian oil was strong in May.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_Fletcher_20180731&quot;/&gt;

Alberta is the largest producer of [[petroleum|conventional crude oil]], [[synthetic crude]], [[natural gas]] and gas products in the country. Alberta is the world's 2nd largest exporter of natural gas and the 4th largest producer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm State of Alaska - Trade Report on Alberta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215031033/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/trade/2003/tad/canada/canadaalberta.htm |date=December 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the largest producers of [[petrochemicals]] in North America are located in central and north central Alberta. In both [[Red Deer, Alberta|Red Deer]] and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], world class [[polyethylene]] and [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] manufacturers produce products shipped all over the world, and Edmonton's [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] provide the raw materials for a large [[petrochemical industry]] to the east of Edmonton. Since the early 1940s, Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the [[United States]]. The [[Athabasca River]] region produces oil for internal and external use. The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside [[Saudi Arabia]].

The [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] (sometimes known as the Athabasca [[Tar sands]]) have estimated [[unconventional oil]] reserves approximately equal to the [[conventional oil]] reserves of the rest of the world, estimated to be {{convert|1.6|Toilbbl}}. With the development of new extraction methods such as [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD), which was developed in Alberta, bitumen and synthetic crude oil can be produced at costs close to those of conventional crude. Many companies employ both conventional [[surface mining|strip mining]] and non-conventional [[in situ]] methods to extract the [[bitumen]] from the oil sands. With current technology and at current prices, about {{convert|315|Goilbbl}} of bitumen are recoverable. [[Fort McMurray]], one of Canada's fastest growing cities, has grown enormously in recent years because of the large corporations which have taken on the task of oil production. As of late 2006 there were over $100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern Alberta.

Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands was the price of oil. The [[oil price increases since 2003]] made it more than profitable to extract this oil, which in the past would give little profit or even a loss.

Alberta's economy was negatively impacted by the [[2016 oil glut|2015-2016 oil glut]] with a record high volume of worldwide oil [[inventory|inventories]] in storage,&lt;ref name=&quot;Firzli&quot;/&gt; with global crude oil collapsing at near ten-year low prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;M_Deloitte_2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_2016_Feb16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune_2016&quot;/&gt; The United States doubled its 2008 production levels mainly due to substantial improvements in [[tight oil|shale]] &quot;[[fracking]]&quot; technology, OPEC members consistently exceeded their production ceiling, and China experienced a marked slowdown in economic growth and crude oil imports.&lt;ref name=&quot;G&amp;M_Deloitte_2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_2016_Feb16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune_2016&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_2014&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Oil Prices Fall Below $80 a Barrel |first=Clifford |last=Krassnov |date=November 3, 2014 |accessdate=December 13, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/04/business/energy-environment/us-oil-prices-fall-below-80-a-barrel.html |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glut&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/opec-maintains-crude-production-as-group-defers-output-target-ihryzilb |title=OPEC Won't Cut Production to Stop Oil's Slump |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coal===
[[File:Atlas coal mine.jpg|thumb|Remains of the former Atlas Coal Mine, near Drumheller, now a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].]]
{{See also|Coal in Canada}}
Coal has been mined in Alberta since the late 19th century. Over 1800 mines have operated in Alberta since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

The coal industry was vital to the early development of several communities, especially those in the foothills and along deep river valleys where coal was close to the surface.

Alberta is still a major coal producer, every two weeks Alberta produces enough coal to fill the [[Sky Dome]] in Toronto.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

Much of that coal is burned in Alberta for electricity generation. Alberta uses over 25 million tonnes of coal annually to generate electricity.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

Alberta has vast coal resources and 70 per cent of Canada's coal reserves are located in Alberta. This amounts to 33.6 [[Gigatonnes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

Vast beds of coal are found extending for hundreds of miles, a short distance below the surface of the plains. The coal belongs to the [[Cretaceous]] beds, and while not so heavy as that of the [[Coal Measures]] in England is of excellent quality{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}. In the valley of the [[Bow River]], alongside the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], valuable beds of [[anthracite]] coal are still worked. The usual coal deposits of the area of [[bituminous]] or semi-bituminous coal. These are largely worked at [[Lethbridge]] in southern Alberta and [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] in the centre of the province. Many other parts of the province have pits for private use.

===Electricity===
{{See also|Electricity policy in Alberta}}

{{As of|2016|6}}, Alberta's generating capacity was 16,261&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]],&lt;ref name=&quot;energy.alberta.ca&quot;&gt;http://www.energy.alberta.ca/electricity/682.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and Alberta has about {{convert|26000|km|-2}} of transmission lines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aeso.ca/grid/about-the-grid/&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta has 1491 megawatts of [[wind power]] capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy.alberta.ca&quot;/&gt;

Alberta has added 9,000 MW of new supply since 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy.alberta.ca&quot;/&gt;

Peak for power use in one day was set on July 9, 2015&amp;nbsp;– 10,520&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/power-consumption-record-set-as-temperature-soars-in-alberta-1.3145637&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mineral mining====

Building stones mined in Alberta include [[Rundle stone]], and [[Paskapoo sandstone]].

Diamonds were first found in Alberta in 1958, and many stones have been found since, although to date no large-scale mines have been developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;energy&quot; /&gt;

====Manufacturing====
The Edmonton area, and in particular [[Nisku, Alberta|Nisku]] is a major centre for manufacturing oil and gas related equipment. As well Edmonton's [[Refinery Row (Edmonton)|Refinery Row]] is home to a petrochemical industry.

According to a Statistics Canada report Alberta's manufacturing sales year-over-year sales fell 13.2 per cent, with a loss of almost four per cent from December to January. Alberta's economy continued to shrink because of the collapse of the oil and gas sector. The petroleum and coal product manufacturing industry is now third— behind food and chemicals.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_manufacturing_2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/alberta-manufacturing-sales-1.3493988 | title=Alberta manufacturing sales plunge 13% in year as most provinces see upswing StatsCan says sales rose in 16 of 21 industries across Canada while Alberta saw 4% drop last month | publisher=CBC | date=March 16, 2016 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | author=Gibson, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biotechnology====
Several companies and services in the biotech sector are clustered around the University of Alberta, for example [[ColdFX]].

====Food processing====
Owing to the strength of agriculture, food processing was once a major part of the economies of Edmonton and Calgary, but this sector has increasingly moved to smaller centres such as [[Brooks, Alberta|Brooks]], the home of [[XL Foods]], responsible for one third of Canada's beef processing in 2011.

====Transportation====
[[File:WestJetHQ.jpg|thumb|400px|Headquarters of the airline [[WestJet]], in Calgary.]]
Edmonton is a major distribution centre for northern communities, hence the nickname &quot;Gateway to the North&quot;. Edmonton is one [[CN Rail]]'s most important hubs. Since 1996, [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] has its headquarters in downtown Calgary.

[[WestJet]], Canada's second largest air carrier, is headquartered in Calgary, by [[Calgary International Airport]], which serves as the airline's primary hub.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20120707101103/http://c3dsp.westjet.com/guest/contacts/contactUs.jsp;jsessionid=g7RhKJ4H9Rvpn1VJBLFv4GZpJFpLFY1THj2vRHZJPSdwKyRB1mPG!-1091378010 Contact Us].

===Agriculture and forestry===
[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Grain elevator in [[southern Alberta]]]]

==== Agriculture ====
{{See also|Agriculture in Canada}}
In the past, [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, and [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were reared in the southern prairie region on ranches or smaller holdings. Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $3.3 billion, as well as other livestock in lesser quantities. In this region [[irrigation]] is widely used.  [[Wheat]], accounting for almost half of the $2 billion agricultural economy, is supplemented by [[canola]], [[barley]], [[rye]], [[sugar beets]], and other [[mixed farming]]. In 2011, Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of {{convert|17900000000|acres}} to [[spring wheat]], [[durum]], barley, oats, [[mixed grains]], [[triticale]], canola and [[dry peas]].  Of the total seeded area, 94 per cent was harvested as grains and [[oilseeds]] and six per cent as [[greenfeed]] and [[silage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/sdd14009 |title=Alberta 2011 Greenfeed and Silage Production Survey Results |date=2011 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agriculture]] has a significant position in the province's economy. Over three million [[cattle]] are residents of the province at one time or another,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |title=Alberta Livestock Inspections |date=August 2006 |work=Department of Agriculture, Government of Alberta |access-date=2007-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815131438/http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/rsb11006 |archive-date=2011-08-15 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market. Nearly one half of all Canadian beef is produced in Alberta. Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]] for the consumer market. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] for [[wool]] and [[Lamb (food)|lamb]] are also [[sheep farm|raised]].

[[Wheat]] and [[canola]] are primary farm crops, with Alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production, with other [[cereal|grains]] also prominent. Much of the farming is dryland farming, often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation. Continuous cropping (in which there is no fallow season) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion. Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points.

Alberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]]. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrid]] [[canola]] also requires [[bee]] [[pollination]], and some beekeepers service this need.

==== Forestry ====
{{see also|Pulp and paper industry in Canada|Alberta Forest Products Association}}

The vast northern [[forest]] reserves of [[softwood]] allow Alberta to produce large quantities of [[lumber]], [[Oriented strand board|oriented strand board (OSB)]] and [[plywood]], and several plants in northern Alberta supply North America and the [[Pacific Rim]] [[nation]]s with bleached [[wood pulp]] and [[newsprint]].

In 1999, [[lumber]] products from Alberta were valued at $4.1 billion of which 72% were exported around the world. Since forests cover approximately 59% of the province's land area, the government allows about {{convert|23.3|e6m3}} to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands.

===Services===
Despite the high profile of the extractive industries, Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services. In 2014 there were 1,635.8 thousand people employed in the services-producing sector. Since then, the number has steadily increased to 1754.8 thousand jobs by August 2019, which is an increase of 16.7 thousand jobs from August 2018&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan_2016_services&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410035501|title=Employment by industry, monthly, seasonally adjusted (x 1,000)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=September 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; finance, insurance, real estate, rental and leasing; professional, scientific and technical services; business, building and other support services; educational services; health care and social assistance; information, culture and recreation; accommodation and food services; other services (except public administration) and public administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;statcan_2016_services&quot; /&gt;

====Finance====
The [[TSX Venture Exchange]] is headquartered in Calgary, and Calgary also has a robust service industry relating to the [[Security (finance)|securities]] market. The city has the second highest number of corporate head offices in Canada after Toronto, and the financial services industry in Calgary has developed to support them.

Edmonton hosts the headquarters of the only major Canadian banks west of Toronto: [[Canadian Western Bank]], and [[ATB Financial]], as well as the only province-wide [[credit union]], [[Servus]].

====Government====
Despite Alberta's reputation as a &quot;small government&quot; province, many health care and education professionals are lured to Alberta from other provinces by the higher wages the Alberta government is able to offer because of oil revenues. In 2014 the median household income in Alberta was $100,000 with the average weekly wage at $1,163—23 per cent higher than the Canadian national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC_2015_wages&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/alberta-wages-almost-25-higher-than-canadian-average-1.2981768 | title=Alberta wages almost 25% higher than Canadian average: Economists, politicians and business leaders seek ways to bring wages down | publisher=CBC | date=March 5, 2015 | accessdate=March 16, 2016 | author=Johnson, Tracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their May 2018 report co-authored by [[C. D. Howe Institute]]'s President and CEO, [[William B.P. Robson]], evaluating &quot;the budgets, estimates and public accounts&quot; of 2017/18 fiscal year that were tabled by senior governments in the Canadian provinces and the federal government in terms of reporting financial information, appropriately, with transparency, and in a timely fashion, Alberta and New Brunswick ranked highest.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdhowe_20180501&quot;&gt;{{cite report |url=https://www.cdhowe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/research_papers/mixed/Commentary_511.pdf |format=PDF |date=May 1, 2018 |title=The Numbers Game: Rating the Fiscal Accountability of Canada’s Senior Governments|publisher=[[C.

==Alberta Advantage==

The historical Alberta Tax Advantage was based on its &quot;three main pillars&quot;—lower &quot;personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, and sales taxes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fraserinstitute_Eisen_20170105&quot;&gt;{{cite |url=https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/end-of-the-alberta-tax-advantage.pdf |format=PDF |title=The End of the Alberta Tax Advantage |date=January 5, 2017 |access-date=December 5, 2019 |work=The [[Fraser Institute]] |first1=Ben |last1=Eisen |first2=Steve |last2=Lafleur |first3=Milagros |last3=Palacios |pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Fraser Institute]], in &quot;2014, Alberta had the lowest top combined federal-provincial/state tax rate out of 60 Canadian provinces and American states.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fraserinstitute_Eisen_20170105&quot;/&gt;

A January 5, 2017 [[Fraser Institute]] article entitled &quot;The End of the Alberta Tax Advantage&quot;, said that the 2015 tax policy changes were introduced in Alberta placed the province in the &quot;middle of the pack&quot;.

A report by University of Calgary's School of Public Policy's economics professor, Ken McKenzie, entitled &quot;Altering the Tax Min in Alberta&quot;, said that a 5% provincial sales tax (PST) —which would still be the lowest sales tax in Canada—&quot;could generate $5 billion in revenue&quot; for Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalnews_MacVicar_20190905&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sales tax needed to help balance Alberta's budget |work= Global News via Canadian Press| access-date = September 7, 2019| date = September 5, 2019| url = https://globalnews.ca/news/5863090/sales-tax-balance-alberta-budget-report/ |first= Adam  |last=MacVicar }}&lt;/ref&gt; The McKinnon report said that &quot;implementing or raising taxes isn’t the solution&quot;—the problem with Alberta's finances is that the provincial &quot;government is overspending&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalnews_MacVicar_20190905&quot;/&gt; McKenzie's report, which was released on September 5, also recommends keeping corporate tax cuts and the &quot;progressive tax rate instead of going back to the flat rate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;citynews&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title = Alberta should bring in a PST: report| work = City News |location=Calgary| access-date = September 7, 2019| date = September 5, 2019| url = https://edmonton.citynews.ca/2019/09/05/alberta-should-bring-in-a-pst-report/ |first=Kenny |last=Mason}}&lt;/ref&gt;
