'''''Alarums and Excursions''''' ('''''A&amp;E''''') is an [[amateur press association]] (APA) started in June 1975 by [[Lee Gold]]; publication continues to the present day. It was one of the first publications to focus solely on [[role-playing game]]s. 
==History==
In 1964, [[Bruce Pelz]] of the [[Los Angeles Science Fiction Society]] (LASFS) began a monthly amateur press association known as ''APA-L''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.lasfsinc.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=136 | title =APA-L | last = | first = | date =2019-01-14 | website =LASFS | publisher =Los Angeles Science Fiction Society | access-date =2019-07-15 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, with the publication of ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' by [[TSR, Inc.]], articles and comments about the new roleplaying game began to fill the pages of ''APA-L''. Pelz felt the discussion was taking up too much space,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html Bretts RPG Magazine and Zine Index] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024220743/http://www.arielarchives.com/Brett/magazines/alarumsandexcursions.html |date=October 24, 2006 }}, entry on Alarums &amp; Excursions, retrieved September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and he asked Lee Gold to start a new APA that would take this material and focus entirely on roleplaying games. The first issue of ''Alarums and Excursions'' appeared in June 1975, the title taken from an [[Elizabethan drama]] stage direction that moved soldiers across a stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/alarums+and+excursions|title=alarums and excursions|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to removing roleplaying games discussion out of ''APA-L'', the initial aim of the publication was to prevent roleplaying games from becoming so divergent that people couldn't participate in games together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Mason| first= Paul| date= 2012| title= A history of RPGs: Made by fans; played by fans| url = http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/444/350| work         = Transformative Works and Cultures| volume= 11| access-date  = 2016-06-19| issn= 1941-2258| doi= 10.3983/twc.2012.0444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Mason| first1= Paul| date = 2004| title= In Search of the Self: A Survey of the First 25 Years of Anglo-American Role-Playing Game Theory| page= 2| editor1-last = Montola| editor1-first= Markus| editor2-last = Stenros| editor2-first= Jaakko| contribution  = Beyond Role and Play| location= Helsinki| publisher= Ropecon ry| url = https://nordiclarp.org/w/images/8/84/2004-Beyond.Role.and.Play.pdf| access-date  = 2016-06-19| isbn = 952-91-6842-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The June 2017 collation of ''Alarums and Excursions'' was #500, with a color cover drawn by [[Lee Moyer]] and printed by [[Rob Heinsoo]].

==Contents==
Each issue is a collection of contributions from different authors, often featuring game design discussions, rules variants, write-ups of game sessions, reviews, and comments on others contributions. 

Although game reports and social reactions are common parts of many ''A&amp;E'' contributions, it has also, over the years, become a testing ground for new ideas on the development of the RPG as a genre and an art form. The idea that role-playing games ''are'' an art form took strong root in this [[zine]], and left a lasting impression on many of the RPG professionals who contributed. The 1992 role-playing game ''[[Over the Edge (role-playing game)|Over the Edge]]'' was inspired by discussions in ''A&amp;E''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons: The '90s|publisher=Evil Hat Productions|year=2014|edition=2|volume=3|ISBN=978-1-61317-084-7|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the February 1976 issue of ''[[Strategic Review]]'' (Issue 6), [[Gary Gygax]] complimented the new APA, calling it &quot;an excellent source of ideas, inspirations and fun.&quot; Although Gygax felt some of the contributors were &quot;woefully lacking in background&quot;, and the quality of printing varied dramatically from issue to issue, he concluded, &quot;For all of its faults, it is far and away the best ''D&amp;D'' '[[zine]], and well worth reading. See for yourself why it rates a Major Triumph.&quot;&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gygax|first=Gary|authorlink=Gary Gygax| date=February 1976 |title=Triumphs and Tragedies|journal=[[Strategic Review]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=6|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the June 1981 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue #50), [[Dave Nalle]] reviewed ''Alarums and Excursions'' after its 63rd issue (November 1980), and although he found the writing style &quot;a bit stuffy&quot;, with a &quot;tendency for the writers to pat each other on the back&quot;, he still called it &quot;the top APA publication... This is a very well run APA and features many of the leading thinkers in fantasy gaming.&quot;&lt;ref name=dragon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nalle|first=Dave|authorlink=Dave Nalle| date=June 1981 |title=The 'Zines!|journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]|publisher=[[TSR (company)|TSR, Inc.]]|issue=50|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
