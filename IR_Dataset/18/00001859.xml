ASU's charter, approved by the [[Higher education governing board|board of regents]] in 2014, is based on the &quot;New American University&quot; model created by ASU President [[Michael M. Crow]] upon his appointment as the institution's 16th president in 2002. It defines ASU as &quot;a comprehensive public research university, measured not by whom it excludes, but rather by whom it includes and how they succeed; advancing research and discovery of public value; and assuming fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves.&quot;

Since 2005, ASU has been ranked among the top research universities in the U.S., public and private, based on research output, innovation, development, research expenditures, number of awarded patents and awarded research grant proposals.  The 2019 university ratings by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' rank ASU No. 1 among the Most Innovative Schools in America for the fourth year in a row. ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' shows 83% of the student applications get accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;USN-INNOVATION&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/innovative |title=2019 Most Innovative Colleges|access-date=January 25, 2019|website=U.S. News &amp; World Report|publisher='U.S. News &amp; World Report'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Arizona State University}}
[[File:Pres. Theodore Roosevelt at Old Main of Arizona State University.jpg|thumb|President Theodore Roosevelt addresses a crowd of students on the steps of the Old Main at Tempe Normal School (future Arizona State University), March 20, 1911.]]

===1885–1929===
[[File:Arizona State University Old Main circa 1890.jpg|thumb|Old Main on the Arizona Territorial Normal School (future Arizona State University) campus, circa 1890]]

Arizona State University was established as the '''Territorial Normal School''' at Tempe on March 12, 1885, when the [[13th Arizona Territorial Legislature]] passed an act to create a [[normal school]] to train teachers for the [[Arizona Territory]]. The campus consisted of a single, four-room schoolhouse on a 20-acre plot largely donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson. Classes began with 33 students on February 8, 1886. The curriculum evolved over the years and the name was changed several times; the institution was also known as '''Tempe Normal School of Arizona''' (1889–1903), '''Tempe Normal School ''' (1903–1925), '''Tempe State Teachers College''' (1925–1929), '''Arizona State Teachers College''' (1929–1945), '''Arizona State College''' (1945–1958) and, by a 2–1 margin of the state's voters, '''Arizona State University''' in 1958.

In 1923, the school stopped offering high school courses and added a high school diploma to the admissions requirements. In 1925, the school became the '''Tempe State Teachers College''' and offered four-year Bachelor of Education degrees as well as two-year teaching certificates. In 1929, the [[9th Arizona State Legislature]] authorized Bachelor of Arts in Education degrees as well, and the school was renamed the '''Arizona State Teachers College'''.&lt;ref name=TNS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/asu/tnsrec.xml |title= Tempe Normal School Records, 1885–1930 MSS-149 |year=2014 |publisher=Arizona Archives Online |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Academicprograms&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/acpro.htm |title= The New ASU Story: Academic Programs |year=2001 |publisher= Arizona State University |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 30-year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews (1900–1930), the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision in 1902. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still in use. Matthews envisioned an &quot;evergreen campus,&quot; with many shrubs brought to the campus, and implemented the planting of 110 Mexican Fan Palms on what is now known as [[Palm Walk]], a century-old landmark of the Tempe campus.

During the [[Great Depression]], [[Ralph Waldo Swetman]] was hired to succeed President Matthews, coming to Arizona State Teachers College in 1930 from Humboldt State Teachers College where he had served as president. He served a three-year term, during which he focused on improving teacher-training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/preslist.htm|title=Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University - ASU Library|website=Asu.edu|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, enrollment at the college doubled, topping the 1,000 mark for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/11lead.htm|title=ASU Library: The New ASU Story: Landmarks |website=Asu.edu |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthews also conceived of a self-supported summer session at the school at Arizona State Teachers College, a first for the school.

===1930–1989===
[[File:FLW Gammage Auditorium ASU PHX AZ 20186.JPG|thumb|ASU's [[Gammage Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]]]

In 1933, [[Grady Gammage]], then president of [[Northern Arizona University|Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff]], became president of Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe, beginning a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years, second only to Swetman's 30 years at the college's helm. Like President Arthur John Matthews before him, Gammage oversaw the construction of several buildings on the Tempe campus. He also guided the development of the university's graduate programs; the first Master of Arts in Education was awarded in 1938, the first Doctor of Education degree in 1954 and 10 non-teaching master's degrees were approved by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] in 1956. During his presidency, the school's name was changed to '''Arizona State College''' in 1945, and finally to '''Arizona State University''' in 1958. At the time, two other names were considered: '''Tempe University''' and '''State University at Tempe'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASU50th&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ASU's 50th Anniversary|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/asus-50th-anniversary|publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Gammage's greatest achievements in Tempe was the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed construction of what is Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium/ASU Gammage. One of the university's hallmark buildings, [[ASU Gammage]] was completed in 1964, five years after the president's (and Wright's) death.

Gammage was succeeded by [[Harold D. Richardson]], who had served the school earlier in a variety of roles beginning in 1939, including director of graduate studies, college registrar, dean of instruction, dean of the College of Education and academic vice president. Although filling the role of acting president of the university for just nine months (Dec. 1959 to Sept. 1960), Richardson laid the groundwork for the future recruitment and appointment of well-credentialed research science faculty.

By the 1960s, under [[G. Homer Durham]], the university's 11th president, ASU began to expand its curriculum by establishing several new colleges and, in 1961, the Arizona Board of Regents authorized doctoral degree programs in six fields, including Doctor of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/16lead.htm|title=ASU Library: The New ASU Story: Leadership|website=Asu.edu |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of his nine-year tenure, ASU had more than doubled enrollment, reporting 23,000 in 1969.

The next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn (1969–71), John W. Schwada (1971–81) and J. Russell Nelson (1981–89), including and Interim President Richard Peck (1989), led the university to increased academic stature, the establishment of the [[Arizona State University West campus|ASU West campus]] in 1984 and its subsequent construction in 1986, a focus on computer-assisted learning and research, and rising enrollment.

===1990–present===
Under the leadership of [[Lattie F. Coor]], president from 1990 to 2002, ASU grew through the creation of the [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic campus]] and extended education sites. Increased commitment to diversity, quality in [[undergraduate education]], research, and economic development occurred over his 12-year tenure. Part of Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fundraising campaign: through private donations, more than $500&amp;nbsp;million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of [[Barrett, The Honors College]], and the [[Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts]]; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/21lead.htm|title=ASU Library: The New ASU Story: Leadership|website=Asu.edu|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Asubiodesign.jpg|thumb|ASU's [[Biodesign Institute]] on Tempe campus]]

In 2002, [[Michael M. Crow]] became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, he outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a &quot;New American University&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newamericanuniversity.asu.edu/|title=Home - New American University |website=Newamericanuniversity.asu.edu|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;—one that would be open and inclusive, and set a goal for the university to meet [[Association of American Universities]] criteria and to become a member.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASU&quot;/&gt; Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into &quot;One university in many places&quot;—a single institution comprising several campuses, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Subsequent reorganizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asunews.asu.edu/20090121_reorg |title=Academic Reorganization |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=January 21, 2009 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced staff and administration as the university expanded its [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West]] and [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic]] campuses. ASU's [[Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix campus]] was also expanded, with several colleges and schools relocating there. The university established learning centers throughout the state, including the [[Colleges@ASU|ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City]] and programs in Thatcher, Yuma, and Tucson. Students at these centers can choose from several ASU degree and certificate programs.

During Crow's tenure, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU began a years-long research facility capital building effort that led to the establishment of the [[Biodesign Institute]] at Arizona State University, the [[ASU School of Sustainability|Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability]], and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of five [[Nobel Laureates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asunews.asu.edu/20091012_ostrom_nobel|title=ASU's Ostrom wins Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences|date=October 12, 2009 |website=Asunews.asu.edu|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/20160506-asu-news-nobel-laureate-frank-wilczek-joins-asu|title=Nobel laureate Frank Wilczek joins ASU|date=May 9, 2016|first=Scott|last=Seckel|website=ASU Now |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, the university's research expenditures have tripled and more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million square feet of space has been added to the university's research facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20121115_naustory |title=ASU's 'golden decade' and the rise of a New American University &amp;#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=November 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Recession|economic downturn]] that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget. In response to these cuts, ASU capped enrollment, closed some four dozen academic programs, combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced university faculty, staff and administrators;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asu.edu/budgetcuts |title=Fiscal Year 2009 state budget cuts force ASU to cap enrollment, freshman applications close March 1, five months early|publisher=Arizona State University Office of Public Affairs |accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, with an economic recovery underway in 2011, the university continued its campaign to expand the West and Polytechnic Campuses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Lesley |url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2011/06/19/20110619asu-academic-villages.html |title=ASU Building Academic Villages |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=June 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establish a low-cost, teaching-focused extension campus in [[Lake Havasu City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://havasu.asu.edu|title=Colleges at Lake Havasu |publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate = July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, an article in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' reported that, &quot;the bottom line looks good,&quot; noting that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joseph|first=Mark |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/top_right/2011/08/michael_crow_president_arizona_state_university.html |title=Michael Crow, the university president who is trying to remake the American public university|work=Slate Magazine|date=August 16, 2011 |accessdate=February 16, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Since Crow's arrival, ASU's research funding has almost tripled to nearly $350 million. Degree production has increased by 45 percent. And thanks to an ambitious aid program, enrollment of students from Arizona families below poverty is up 647 percent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2015, the [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]] became the fifth ASU campus, as the Thunderbird School of Global Management at ASU. Partnerships for education and research with [[Mayo Clinic]] established collaborative degree programs in health care and law, and shared administrator positions, laboratories and classes at the Mayo Clinic Arizona campus.

The Beus Center for Law and Society, the new home of ASU's [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]], opened in fall 2016 on the Downtown Phoenix campus, relocating faculty and students from the Tempe campus to the state capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;beus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Terrill |first=Marshall |url=https://asunow.asu.edu/20160816-arizona-impact-center-law-and-society-stands-inclusion|title=Center for Law and Society stands for inclusion|publisher=Arizona State University|date=August 15, 2016 |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arizona Board of Regents governs Arizona State University as well as the state's other public universities; [[University of Arizona]] and [[Northern Arizona University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azregents.edu/universities/arizonastateuniversity/default.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716002711/http://www.azregents.edu/universities/arizonastateuniversity/default.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 16, 2010 |title=Arizona State University |publisher=Azregents.edu |accessdate=July 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Regents is composed of 12 members including 11 who are voting members, and one non-voting member. Members of the board include the state governor and superintendent of public instruction acting as ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regents members with eight-year terms who are appointed by the Governor, and two student regents, each with two-year terms, and each serving a one-year term as non-voting apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azregents.edu/about/board-members|title=Board Members|last=|first=|date=|website=Arizona Board of Regents |access-date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arizona Board of Regents|ABOR]] provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has four campuses in metropolitan [[Phoenix, Arizona]] including the Tempe campus in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]; the West campus in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]]; the Downtown Phoenix campus; and the Polytechnic campus in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]]. ASU also offers courses and degrees through ASU Online and at the ASU Colleges at [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona|Lake Havasu City]] in western Arizona, and offers regional learning programs in Thatcher, Yuma and Tucson.

The Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university, who is considered the institution's chief executive officer and the chief budget officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd102.html |title=Arizona State University |publisher=Asu.edu |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president executes measures enacted by the Board of Regents, controls the university's property, and acts as the university's official representative to the Board of Regents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azregents.edu/board-committees/policy-manual|title=Policy Manual|publisher=Azregents.edu |accessdate=June 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief executive officer is assisted through the administration of the institution by the provost, vice presidents, deans, faculty, directors, department chairs, and other officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/admin/ |title=ASU Leadership |publisher=Asu.edu|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels.

==Campuses and locations==
Academic programs are spread across four distinct campuses in the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area]]; however, unlike most multi-campus institutions, ASU describes itself as &quot;one university in many places,&quot; inferring there is &quot;not a system with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Campuses&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.asu.edu|title=ASU Campuses and Locations|website=campus.asu.edu|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university considers each campus &quot;distinctive&quot; and academically focused on certain aspects of the overall university mission. The Tempe campus is the university's research and graduate school center. Undergraduate studies on the Tempe campus are research-based programs that prepare students for graduate school, professional school, or employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tempe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.asu.edu/tempe |title=ASU Tempe Campus |publisher=Arizona State University |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polytechnic campus is designed with an emphasis on professional and technological programs for direct workforce preparation. The Polytechnic campus is the site of many of the university's simulators and laboratories dedicated for project-based learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;campus.asu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://catalog.asu.edu/files/shared/archives/1998-1999/graduate/GC98-99.pdf/1998-1999-GC-370-385.pdf|title=ASU East |publisher=Campus.asu.edu|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West campus is focused on interdisciplinary degrees and the liberal arts, while maintaining professional programs with a direct impact on the community and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://campus.asu.edu/west/ |title=ASU West Campus |publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Downtown Phoenix campus focuses on direct urban and public programs such as nursing, public policy, criminal justice, mass communication, and journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campus.asu.edu/downtown |title=ASU Downtown Phoenix Campus |publisher=Campus.asu.edu|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASU recently relocated some nursing and health related programs to its new ASU-Mayo Medical School campus. Inter-campus shuttles and [[light rail]] allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses. In addition to the physical campuses, ASU's &quot;virtual campus&quot; at the university's [[Skysong, the ASU Scottsdale Innovation Center|SkySong Innovation Center]], provides [[online education|online]] and extended education.

The Arizona Board of Regents reports the ASU facilities inventory totals more than 23 million gross square feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azregents.edu/universtiy-system-quick-facts|title=University System Quick Facts|publisher=azregents.edu|accessdate=September 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Arizona State University Tempe campus}}

ASU's Tempe campus is in downtown [[Tempe, Arizona]], about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} east of downtown Phoenix. The campus is considered urban, and is approximately {{convert|660|acre|km2|1}} in size. It is arranged around broad pedestrian malls and is completely encompassed by an arboretum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cfo.asu.edu/arboretum|title=Arboretum—Tempe campus |publisher=Arizona State University|date= |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tempe campus is also the largest of ASU's campuses, with more than 70,000{{efn|Campus enrollment figures at ASU are defined by the number of students taking at least one course offered by a department housed on a particular campus. Students enrolled in classes on more than one campus (estimated to be 27,484) are counted within each campus's total}} students enrolled in at least one class on campus in fall 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;enrollment&quot; /&gt; The campus is considered to range from the streets Rural Road on the east to Mill Avenue on the west, and Apache Boulevard on the south to Rio Salado Parkway on the north.

The Tempe campus is ASU's original campus, and [[Old Main (Arizona State University)|Old Main]], the first building constructed, still stands. Today's university and the Tempe campus were founded as the Territorial Normal School when first constructed, and was originally a teachers college. There are many notable landmarks on campus, including [[Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]; Palm Walk, which is lined by 111 palm trees;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tours.asu.edu/tempe/palm-walk|title=Virtual Tour: Palm Walk|date=|website=Arizona State University|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Trumbull Hayden Library; the University Club building; Margaret Gisolo Dance Theatre; and University Bridge. In addition, the campus has an extensive public art collection; It was named &quot;the single most impressive venue for contemporary art in Arizona&quot; by ''Art in America'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asuartmuseum.asu.edu/about|title=About ASU Art Museum|date=|website=Arizona State University |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against the northwest edge of campus is the Mill Avenue district (part of [[Tempe, Arizona|downtown Tempe]]), which has a college atmosphere that attracts many students to its restaurants and bars. Students also have Tempe Marketplace, a shopping, dining and entertainment center with an outdoor setting near the northeast border of the campus. The Tempe campus is also home to all of the university's athletic facilities.

===ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City===
{{Main|ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City}}

==Traditions==

===Maroon and gold===

Gold is the oldest color associated with Arizona State University and dates back to 1896 when the school was named the Tempe Normal School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alumni.asu.edu/remember/traditions |title=Sun Devil Traditions &amp;#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=April 26, 2014 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maroon and white were later added to the color scheme in 1898. Gold signifies the &quot;golden promise&quot; of ASU. The promise includes every student receiving a valuable educational experience. Gold also signifies the sunshine Arizona is famous for; including the power of the sun and its influence on the climate and the economy. The first uniforms worn by athletes associated with the university were black and white when the &quot;Normals&quot; were the name of the athletic teams. The student section, known as The Inferno, wears gold on game days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eoss.asu.edu/getinvolved/traditions|title=ASU Dean of Students: Traditions|publisher=Arizona State University|date= |accessdate=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maroon signifies sacrifice and bravery while white represents the balance of negativity and positivity.

===Lantern Walk and Homecoming===
The Lantern Walk is one of the oldest traditions at ASU and dates back to 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://homecoming.asu.edu/lantern-walk|title=Lantern Walk|publisher=Arizona State University|date=|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered one of ASU's &quot;most cherished&quot; traditions and is an occasion used to mark the work of those associated with ASU throughout history. Anyone associated with ASU is free to participate in the event, including students, alumni, faculty, employees, and friends. This differs slightly from the original tradition in which the seniors would carry lanterns up &quot;A&quot; Mountain followed by the freshman. The senior class president would describe ASU's traditions and the freshman would repeat an oath of allegiance to the university. It was described as a tradition of &quot;good will between the classes&quot; and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university's traditions with honor. In modern times, the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to &quot;A&quot; Mountain to &quot;light up&quot; Tempe. Keynote speakers, performances, and other events are used to mark the occasion. The night is culminated with a fireworks display. The Lantern Walk was held after the Spring Semester (June) but is now held the week before [[Homecoming]], a tradition that dates to 1924 at ASU. It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homecoming.asu.edu/ |title=ASU homecoming &amp;#124; ASU Homecoming |publisher=Homecoming.asu.edu |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victory Bell===
In 2012, Arizona State University reintroduced the tradition of ringing a bell after each win for the football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20121119_victorybell |title=Sun Devil Athletics brings back Victory Bell in return to tradition &amp;#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=November 19, 2012 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROTC cadets associated with the university transport the bell to various events and ring it after Sun Devil victories. The first Victory Bell, in various forms, was used in the 1930s but the tradition faded in the 1970s when the bell was removed from Memorial Union for renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/30casc.htm |title=ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Campus Lives – Campus Scenes |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bell cracked and was no longer capable of ringing. That bell is on the southeast corner of Sun Devil Stadium, near the entrance to the student section. That bell, given to the university in the late 1960s, is painted gold and is a campus landmark.

===Sun Devil Marching Band, Devil Walk and Songs of the University===
{{Main|Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band}}
[[Sun devil marching band|The Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band]], created in 1915 and known as the &quot;Pride of the Southwest&quot;, was the first of only two [[marching band]]s in the Pac-12 to receive the prestigious [[Sudler trophy#The Sudler Trophy|Sudler Trophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sundevilband.asu.edu/history|title=Sun Devil Marching Band: History|publisher=Arizona State University|date= |accessdate=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The John Philip Sousa Foundation awarded the band the trophy in 1991. The Sun Devil Marching Band remains one of only 28 bands in the nation to have earned the designation. The band performs at every football game played in Sun Devil Stadium. In addition, the Sun Devil Marching Band has made appearances in the Fiesta Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Holiday Bowl, and the [[Super Bowl XLII]], in addition to many others.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; Smaller ensembles of band members perform at other sport venues including basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena and baseball games. The Devil Walk is held in Wells Fargo Arena by the football team and involves a more formal introduction of the players to the community; a new approach to the tradition added in 2012 with the arrival of [[head coach]] Todd Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thesundevils.com/news/2013/4/17/208257004.aspx|title=Arizona State University Official Athletic Site - Gameday |publisher=Arizona State University|date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the game and allows the players to establish rapport with the fans. The walk ends as the team passes the band and fans lined along the path to Sun Devil Stadium. The most recognizable songs played by the band are &quot;Alma Mater&quot; and ASU's [[fight songs]] titled &quot;[[Maroon and gold|Maroon and Gold]]&quot; and the &quot;Al Davis Fight Song&quot;. &quot;Alma Mater&quot; was composed by former Music Professor and Director of Sun Devil Marching Band (then known as Bulldog Marching Band), Miles A. Dresskell, in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alumni.asu.edu/remember/traditions-arizona-state-university/songs |title=Songs &amp;#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=April 26, 2014 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Maroon and Gold&quot; was authored by former Director of Sun Devil Marching Band, Felix E. McKernan, in 1948. The &quot;Al Davis Fight Song&quot; (also known as &quot;Go, Go Sun Devils&quot; and &quot;Arizona State University Fight Song&quot;) was composed by ASU alumnus Albert Oliver Davis in the 1940s without any lyrics. Recently lyrics were added to the song.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;

Each ASU campus has a specific USG; USG Tempe (Tempe), USGD (Downtown), USG Polytechnic (Polytechnic) and USG West (West). Members and officers of ASASU are elected annually by the student body.

The [[Residence Hall Association]] (RHA) of Arizona State University is the student government for every ASU student living on-campus. Each ASU campus has an RHA that operates independently. RHA's purpose is to improve the quality of residence hall life and provide a cohesive voice for the residents by addressing the concerns of the on-campus populations to university administrators and other campus organizations; providing cultural, diversity, educational, and social programming; establishing and working with individual community councils.

===On-campus living===
Arizona State University offers undergraduate student housing on four metropolitan Phoenix campuses ([[Arizona State University Tempe campus|Tempe]], [[Arizona State University Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic]], [[Arizona State University Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix]], and [[Arizona State University West campus|West]]), plus the [[ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City]].

Each dormitory is identified with a specific college, institute, major, or sport, and are relatively close to all the classes the student would be taking according to their major (excluding the Sonora Center which is meant to house 'overflow' students that do not fit in the other dormitory complexes, as well as students who have declared their major as 'exploratory'). For example, Tooker House is strictly freshmen engineering students. Aside from the on-campus dorms, ASU also offers residential halls for upper-division housing and Greek life housing. Greek housing is only available for sororities that are members of ASU Panhellenic. There are 12 sororities residing in Greek life housing. Sororities are housed in a gated complex called Adelphi Commons and it is only accessible to members of the sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adelphi Commons I {{!}} University Housing|url=https://housing.asu.edu/residence/adelphi-commons-i|website=housing.asu.edu|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, criticism over the seven-figure salaries earned by various coaches at Arizona's public universities (including ASU) prompted the Arizona Board of Regents to re-evaluate the salary and benefit policy for athletic staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/ua/articles/2009/09/20/20090920athleticsalaries0919-CP.html|title=ASU, UA coaching salaries reviewed|website=Azcentral.com|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the 2011 expansion of the [[Pac-12 Conference]], a new $3&amp;nbsp;billion contract for revenue sharing among all the schools in the conference was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/04/sports/la-sp-pac-12-tv-20110505|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Diane|last=Pucin |title=New Pac-12 TV deal shows the value of sports|date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the infusion of funds, the salary issue and various athletic department budgeting issues at ASU were addressed.

==Presidential visits==
Arizona State University has been visited by nine United States presidents. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was the first president to visit campus, speaking on the steps of Old Main on March 20, 1911, while in Arizona to dedicate the Roosevelt Dam.&lt;ref name=&quot;repository.asu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/194426/content/Presidents%20at%20ASU.pdf |format=PDF|title=U.S. Presidential Visits to Arizona State University|website=Repository.asu.edu|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] spoke at ASU's [[Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium]] on January 29, 1972, at a memorial service for ASU alumnus Senator [[Carl T. Hayden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;repository.asu.edu&quot;/&gt; Future president [[Gerald R. Ford]] debated Senator [[Albert Gore, Sr.]] at [[Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium]] on April 28, 1968, and Ford returned to the same building as a former president to give a lecture on February 24, 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;repository.asu.edu&quot;/&gt; President [[Jimmy Carter]] visited Arizona PBS at ASU's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication on July 31, 2015, to promote a memoir.&lt;ref name=&quot;asu2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/jimmy-carter-visits-asu-discuss-presidency-new-memoir|title=Jimmy Carter visits ASU to discuss presidency, new memoir &amp;#124; ASU Now: Access, Excellence, Impact|publisher=asunow.asu.edu|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Future president [[Ronald Reagan]] gave a political speech at the school's Memorial Union in 1957, and returned to campus as a former president on March 20, 1989, delivering his first ever post-presidential speech at ASU's [[Wells Fargo Arena (Tempe)|Wells Fargo Arena]].&lt;ref name=&quot;repository.asu.edu&quot;/&gt;  President [[George H. W. Bush]] gave a lecture at Wells Fargo Arena on May 5, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;repository.asu.edu&quot;/&gt;

President [[Bill Clinton]] became the first sitting president to visit ASU on October 31, 1996, speaking on the [[Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium]] lawn. He returned to ASU in 2006, and in 2014, President Clinton, [[Hillary Clinton]], and [[Chelsea Clinton]] came to campus to host the Clinton Global Initiative University.&lt;ref name=&quot;repository.asu.edu&quot;/&gt;  President [[George W. Bush]] became the second sitting president to visit the school's campus when he debated Senator [[John Kerry]] at the university's [[Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium]] on October 13, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;prnewswire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arizona-state-university-to-host-presidential-debate-in-2004-72901472.html|title=Arizona State University to Host Presidential Debate in 2004 |publisher=prnewswire.com|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  President [[Barack Obama]] visited ASU as sitting president on May 13, 2009. President Obama delivered the commencement speech for the Spring 2009 Commencement Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obama challenges ASU grads in Wed. commencement speech |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/05/13/20090513commence-obama.html|website=www.azcentral.com|accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama had previously visited the school as a United States senator.&lt;ref name=&quot;repository.asu.edu&quot;/&gt; President [[Richard Nixon]] did not visit ASU as president, but visited Phoenix as president on October 31, 1970, at an event that included a performance by the Arizona State University Band, which President Nixon acknowledged.

==Controversies==

===Sexual assault investigation===
On May 1, 2014, ASU was listed as one of [[U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations|fifty five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights]] &quot;for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints&quot; by Barack Obama's White House Task Force To Protect Students from Sexual Assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ASU among schools in US federal sex assault probe |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/1/asu-among-schools-in-us-federal-sex-assault-probe/|accessdate=September 18, 2014 |work=The Washington Times|agency=Associated Press|date=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations |url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i |website=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publicly announced investigation followed two Title IX suits.&lt;ref name=&quot;two previous suits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryman|first1=Anne|title=ASU settled at least two previous sexual-violence suits |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2014/05/01/arizona-state-universities-sex-assault-inquiry/8565811/ |website=Arizona Central|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, a group of at least nine current and former students who alleged they were harassed or assaulted asked the federal investigation be expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ryman|first1=Anne |title=Feds: ASU sex-assault probe ongoing|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2014/07/10/asu-students-ask-feds-broaden-sexual-assault-probe/12491247/ |accessdate=September 18, 2014|work=The Arizona Republic|publisher=Gannett|date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2014 ASU President Michael Crow appointed a task force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASU wants campus 'free from threat of sexual violence' |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2014/08/22/asu-wants-campus-free-threat-sexual-violence/14445703 |website=azcentral.com|publisher=Gannett|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising faculty and staff, students, and members of the university police force to review the university's efforts to address sexual violence. Crow accepted the recommendations of the task force in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASU president approves sexual violence task force recommendations |url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20141121-sexual-violence-task-force |website=ASU News|publisher=Arizona State University |accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faculty plagiarism===
In 2011, Professor Matthew Whitaker was accused of plagiarizing material in six books he had written, as well as in a speech he made to local high school students. After watching a video of the speech, a plagiarism analyst said he could pretty much read along from a newspaper article as Whitaker spoke. To the intense consternation of ASU faculty members (the chairman of the tenure committee resigned in protest) an investigating committee concluded there was no pattern of deceit and the copying had been inadvertent. It all popped up again in 2014 with another Whitaker book, &quot;Peace Be Still: Modern Black America From World War II to Barack Obama.&quot; A blogger writing under an apparent pseudonym set out side-by-side excerpts from Whitaker's book and material available on the Web at sites like infoplease.com and the Archive of American Television. They are more than just similar in tone. Whitaker has also been accused of appropriating training materials produced by the Chicago Police Department which he used as the basis for a lucrative contract with the Phoenix Police Department. Whitaker was to receive $268,800 to provide &quot;cultural-consciousness training&quot; to Phoenix police. The Phoenix Police Department wants back the $21,900 it has paid thus far. He was placed on administrative leave on September 17, 2015, while the university investigated allegations &quot;his behavior has fallen short of expectations as a faculty member and a scholar.&quot;&lt;ref name=PlacedonLeave&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ryman|first1=Anne|title=Controversial ASU professor Whitaker placed on leave |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2015/09/17/asu-professor-whitaker-placed-leave/32541923/|accessdate=September 30, 2015|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit by Arizona Attorney General===
The [[Arizona Attorney General]], [[Mark Brnovich]] filed a lawsuit in late 2017 against ABOR due to tuition practices and DACA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Attorney General lawsuit against ABOR persists|first1=Andrew|last1=Nicla|first2=Tina|last2=Giuliano |date=March 29, 2018|url= http://www.statepress.com/article/2018/03/sppolitics-attorney-generals-lawsuit-against-abor-continues |accessdate=July 10, 2018|publisher=The State Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney general's lawsuit succeeded, and in a decision by the court, led to the discontinuation of the in-state tuition rate for [[undocumented immigrants]] in the state based on Arizona Prop 300,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uleadnet.org/map/arizona-policy|title=Arizona Policy - uLEADNet.org|website=uleadnet.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which passed in 2006.

===Sale/leaseback of public land===
Private corporations leasing public land from the university in furtherance of their corporate mission (which in the case of private employers includes making profit) are revealed to pay no taxes to the state because the land is owned by a state public entity. Taxpayers were never given a vote to permit profit-seeking ventures on state lands which have historically existed to serve the public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/get-access/?return=https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/laurieroberts/2017/12/18/marina-heights-tempe-arizona-pays-no-property-taxes-but-you-and-sure-do/956262001/|title=Get Access|website=azcentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state universities later lobby the Arizona legislature to keep the loophole open for future use by the universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arizonatax.org/news-article/roberts-universities-stop-bill-end-arizonas-sweetest-tax-dodge|title=Roberts: Universities stop bill to end Arizona's sweetest tax dodge - Arizona Tax Research Association|website=www.arizonatax.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme, called a &quot;tax dodge&quot; by its detractors, avoids the private businesses from &quot;paying $90 million to $120 million in property taxes&quot; to the state of Arizona.

===Required sports fees and new stadium===
Arizona State, one of the in-state colleges requires its students to pay a mandatory sports and athletic fee, regardless of if the students participate in such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.azcentral.com/get-access/?return=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2018/04/05/tuition-increases-arizonas-universities-get-ok-board-regents/488139002/|title=Get Access|website=azcentral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fees are a part of a total $10.6 million in fees collected from students. The fees go to non-academic programs including &quot;Game day operations, marketing, game-day giveaways and maintenance.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statepress.com/article/2018/04/spsports-in-depth-look-into-asu-athletic-fee|title=ASU athletic fee breakdown: Where the $75 goes|website=The Arizona State Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may not opt-out of the fees.

While ASU has increased tuition over 100% over the 2007-2018 timeframe, the university found the money to demolish and rebuild a stadium with smaller capacity than before at a cost to taxpayers and students of approximately $307 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASUStadium&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ryman |first1=Anne |title=ASU Sun Devil Stadium renovation costs expected to top $307 million |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-education/2017/09/26/asu-sun-devil-stadium-renovation-costs-expected-top-307-million/701003001/ |work=The Republic |agency=azcentral.com |date=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics argue ASU was offering private corporations tax-advantaged deals to develop on state property in exchange for funding the new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tucson.com/business/local/asu-seeks-to-develop-land-to-raise-stadium-cash/article_d8685e88-0ab3-5e04-bacb-700a00855aa6.html|title=ASU seeks to develop land to raise stadium cash|first= |last=|work=Arizona Daily Star|agency= The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael M. Crow]], ASU president counters the tax-advantaged deal is &quot;no scheme&quot; to hurt schools which might have otherwise benefited from the tax receipts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2017/12/27/michael-crow-tax-free-asu-office-complex-not-scheme-hurt-schools/981177001/|title=ASU president: Tax-free office complex is not a 'scheme' to hurt schools|work=azcentral.com| date=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative-leaning freedom schools===
The [[Arizona legislature]] appropriated $5 million for the development of [[Koch brothers]]-affiliated conservative think tanks at ASU dubbed &quot;School of Civic and Economic Thought Leadership.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/04/22/professor-a-disturbing-story-about-the-influence-of-the-koch-network-in-higher-education/ |title=Professor: A disturbing story about the influence of the Koch network in higher education |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2018-04-22 |accessdate=2019-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/5-million-is-going-to-koch-backed-think-tanks-in-arizona-universities-professors-are-angry-a71de4fcbe00/|title=$5 Million Is Going To Koch-Backed Think Tanks In Arizona Universities. Professors Are Angry.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[ThinkProgress]], a progressive-leaning publication, &quot;Koch-funded professors and advisers have suggested that educational initiatives that are disguised as being more neutral in their approach but that support a libertarian ideology.&quot; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', &quot;Republican legislatures have been taking a greater interest in the affairs of their state universities to counteract what they see as excessive liberalism on campus.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/arizona-state-conservatives.html|title=Arizona Republicans Inject Schools of Conservative Thought Into State Universities|first=Stephanie|last=Saul|date=February 26, 2018|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time as the legislature funded the think tank, &quot;steady cuts left state universities with $390 million less in taxpayer support in 2017 than they had before the 2008 recession, requiring steep tuition increases&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;
