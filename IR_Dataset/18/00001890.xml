The use of English in the United States is a result of [[British colonization of the Americas]]. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 17th century, dialects from many different regions of England existed in every American colony, allowing a process of [[koineization|extensive dialect mixture]] and [[dialect levelling|levelling]] in which English varieties across the colonies became more homogeneous compared with varieties in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kretzchmar|2004|pp=258–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Longmore|2007|pp=517, 520}}&lt;/ref&gt; English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century's first massive immigrations of non-English speakers from Europe and Africa, and firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English became common after the mid-18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Longmore|2007|p=537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, American English has developed into some new varieties, including regional dialects that, in some cases, show minor influences in the last two centuries from successive waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages,&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, R. (2014). ''Dictionary of varieties of English''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; primarily European languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

American English varieties include many patterns of pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and particularly spelling that are unified nationwide but distinct from other English dialects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC|title= A Handbook of Varieties of English|author-first=William A.|author-last=Kretzchmar|editor-first=Bernd|editor-last=Kortmann|editor2-first=Edgar W.|editor2-last=Schneider|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|year=2004|pages=262–263|isbn= 9783110175325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any [[North American English|American or Canadian]] [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural [[markedness|markers]] is popularly called [[General American|&quot;General&quot; or &quot;Standard&quot; American]], a fairly uniform [[dialect continuum|accent continuum]] native to certain regions of the U.S. and associated nationally with broadcast mass media and highly educated speech. However, historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single &quot;mainstream&quot; American accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2012|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC|title= A Handbook of Varieties of English|author-first=William A.|author-last=Kretzchmar|editor-first=Bernd|editor-last=Kortmann|editor2-first=Edgar W.|editor2-last=Schneider|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|year=2004|page=262|isbn= 9783110175325}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents having emerged in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/ahead/|title=''Do You Speak American?'': What Lies Ahead?|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared with [[British English|English as spoken in the United Kingdom]], North American English&lt;ref&gt;''[[North American English]]'' {{harv|Trudgill|2004|p=2}} is a collective term used for the varieties of the English language that are spoken in both the United States and [[Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; is more homogeneous and any phonologically [[markedness|unremarkable]] North American accent is known as &quot;[[General American]]&quot;. This section mostly refers to such General American features.

===Conservative phonology===
Studies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but is [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]] in some ways, preserving certain features contemporary [[British English]] has since lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-difference-between-theater-and-theatre.htm |title=What Is the Difference between Theater and Theatre? |publisher=Wisegeek.org |date=2015-05-15 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full [[Rhoticity in English|rhoticity]] (or R-fulness) is typical of American accents, pronouncing the phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} (corresponding to the letter {{Angbr|r}}) in all environments, including after vowels, such as in ''pearl'', ''car'', and ''court''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plag&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plag|first1=Ingo|last2=Braun|first2=Maria|last3=Lappe|first3=Sabine|last4=Schramm |first4=Mareile |title=Introduction to English Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLvZHmGA8q4C|accessdate=4 July 2013|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=53|isbn=978-3-11-021550-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2002|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-rhotic American accents, those that do not pronounce {{angbr|r}} except before a vowel, such as some [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]], [[New York City English|New York]], a specific few (often [[older Southern American English|older]]) [[Southern American English|Southern]], and [[African American Vernacular English|African American vernacular accents]], are often quickly noticed by General American listeners and perceived to sound especially ethnic, regional, or &quot;old-fashioned&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plag&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2002|pp=181, 306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolchover, Natalie (2012). &quot;[http://www.livescience.com/33652-americans-brits-accents.html Why Do Americans and Brits Have Different Accents?]&quot; ''LiveScience''. Purch.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhoticity is common in most American accents (yet nowadays rare in England), because, during the 17th-century British colonization, nearly all dialects of English were rhotic, and most North American English simply remained that way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25484343 |title=Early Mainland Residues in Southern Hiberno-English |journal=Irish University Review |volume=20|issue=1 |pages=137–148 |last1=Lass |first1=Roger |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This preservation of rhoticity in North America was also supported by continuing waves of rhotic-accented [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] immigrants, most intensely during the 18th century (and moderately during the following two centuries), when the Scots-Irish eventually made up one-seventh of the colonial population. Scots-Irish settlers spread from Delaware and Pennsylvania throughout the larger Mid-Atlantic region, the inland regions of both the South and North, and throughout the West, all American dialect areas that consistently resisted upper-class non-rhotic influences and that consequently remain rhotic today.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt; Schilling, Natalie (2015). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fOPLCgAAQBAJ&amp;q=scots-irish+one+in+seven American English: Dialects and Variation]''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; The pronunciation of {{Angbr|r}} is a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPAblink|ɹ̠|audio=y}} or [[retroflex approximant]] {{IPAblink|ɻ|audio=y}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hallé|Best|Levitt|1999|p=283}} citing {{Harvcoltxt|Delattre|Freeman|1968}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Zawadzki|Kuehn|1980}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Boyce|Espy-Wilson|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a unique &quot;bunched tongue&quot; variant of the approximant ''r'' sound is also associated with the United States, and perhaps mostly in the Midwest and the South.&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

For those American accents that have not undergone the ''cot–caught'' merger (the [[lexical set]]s {{sc2|LOT}} and {{sc2|THOUGHT}}), they have instead retained a {{sc2|LOT}}–{{sc2|CLOTH}} split: a 17th-century split in which certain words (labeled as the {{sc2|CLOTH}} [[lexical set]]) separated away from the {{sc2|LOT}} set. This split, which has now reversed in most British English, simultaneously shifts this relatively recent {{sc2|CLOTH}} set into a merger with the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} (''caught'') set. Having taken place prior to the unrounding of the ''cot'' vowel, this results in lengthening and perhaps raising, merging the more recently separated vowel into the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel in the following environments: before many instances of {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/θ/}}, and particularly {{IPA|/s/}} (as in ''Austria, cloth, cost, loss, off, often,'' etc.), a few instances before {{IPA|/ŋ/}} (as in ''strong, long, wrong''), and variably by region or speaker in ''gone'', ''on'', and certain other words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136–7, 203–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard accent of southern England, [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), has evolved in other ways too, compared to which [[General American English]] has remained relatively more conservative, for example, regarding today's RP features of a [[trap–bath split|''trap–bath'' split]] and the fronting of {{IPA|/oʊ/}}, neither of which is typical of General American accents. Moreover, American dialects also do not participate in widespread [[H-dropping]], an innovative feature characterizing perhaps a majority of regional dialects of England.

===Innovative phonology===
On the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:
* [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father–bother merger|Unrounded {{Sc2|LOT}}]]: The American phenomenon of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel (often spelled {{angbr|o}} in words like ''box, don, clock, notch, pot,'' etc.) being produced without [[rounded vowel|rounded lips]], like the {{Sc2|PALM}} vowel, allows ''father'' and ''bother'' to rhyme, the two vowels now unified as the single [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/ɑ/}}. This ''father–bother'' vowel merger&lt;!--Link already present two sentences prior.--&gt; is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in North American English. Exceptions are in northeastern [[New England English]], such as the [[Boston accent]], as well as variably in some [[New York accent]]s.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=136–37, 203–6, 234, 245–47, 339–40, 400, 419, 443, 576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Wells 1982: 245–47 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[cot–caught merger|''Cot–caught'' merger]] in transition: There is no single American way to pronounce the vowels in words like ''cot'' {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (the ''ah'' vowel) versus ''caught'' {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (the ''aw'' vowel), largely due to a merger occurring between the two sounds in some parts of North America, but not others. American speakers with a completed merger pronounce the two historically separate vowels with the [[Homophone|exact same sound]] (especially in the [[American West|West]], northern [[New England]], [[West Virginia]], [[western Pennsylvania]], and the [[Upper Midwest]]), but other speakers have no trace of a merger at all (especially in the [[American South|South]], the [[Great Lakes region]], southern [[New England]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New York metropolitan area]]s) and so pronounce each vowel with distinct sounds {{Pronunciation|Cot-caught distinction.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}.{{sfnp|Labov|2006|p=61}} Among speakers who distinguish between the two, the vowel of ''cot'' (usually transcribed in American English as {{IPA|/ɑ/}}), is often a [[central vowel|central]] {{IPAblink|ä|audio=y}} or advanced [[back vowel|back]] {{IPA|[ɑ̟]}}, while {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is pronounced with more rounded lips and/or phonetically higher in the mouth, close to {{IPAblink|ɒ|audio=y}} or {{IPAblink|ɔ|audio=y}}, but with only slight rounding.{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}} Among speakers who do not distinguish between the two, thus producing a ''cot–caught'' merger, {{IPA|/ɑ/}} usually remains a back vowel, {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, sometimes showing lip rounding as {{IPA|[ɒ]}}. Therefore, even mainstream Americans vary greatly with this speech feature, with possibilities ranging from a full merger to no merger at all. A transitional stage of the merger is also common in scatterings throughout the U.S., most consistently in the [[Midland American English|American Midland]]s lying between the historical dialect regions of the North and South, while younger Americans in general tend to be transitioning toward the merger. According to a 2003 dialect survey carried out across the United States, about 61% of participants perceive themselves as keeping the two vowels distinct and 39% do not.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert; Golder, Scott (2003). &quot;[http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_28.html Do you pronounce 'cot' and 'çaught' the same?]&quot; The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 followup survey put the percentages at 58% non-merging speakers and 41% merging.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert; Jøhndal, Marius L.

Cambridge: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Sc2|STRUT}} in special words: The {{Sc2|STRUT}} vowel, rather than the one in {{sc2|LOT}} or {{Sc2|THOUGHT}} (as in Britain), is used in [[function words]] and certain other words like ''was, of, from, what, everybody, nobody, somebody, anybody'', and, for many speakers ''because'' and rarely even ''want'', when stressed.&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/want |title=Want: meaning and definitions|publisher=Dictionary.infoplease.com |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/55/W0025500.html |title=want.

* [[English-language vowel changes before historic r|Vowel mergers]] before intervocalic {{IPA|/r/}}: The mergers of certain vowels before {{IPA|/r/}} are typical throughout North America; the only exceptions exist primarily along the east coast. Such mergers include:
** [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Mary–marry–merry merger|''Mary–marry–merry'' merger]] in transition: According to the 2003 dialect survey, nearly 57% of participants from around the country self-identified as merging the sounds {{IPA|/ær/}} (as in the first syllable of ''parish''), {{IPA|/ɛr/}} (as in the first syllable of ''perish''), and {{IPA|/ɛər/}} (as in ''pear'' or ''pair'').&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder (2003). &quot;[http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_15.html How do you pronounce Mary / merry / marry?]&quot; The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt; The merger is already complete everywhere except along some areas of the Atlantic Coast.{{sfnp|Kortmann|Schneider|2004|p=295}}
** [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Hurry–furry merger|''Hurry–furry'' merger]]: The pre-{{IPA|/r/}} vowels in words like ''hurry'' {{IPA|/ʌ/}} and ''furry'' {{IPA|/ɜ/}} are merged in most American accents to {{IPA|[ə~ɚ]}}. Only 10% of English speakers across the U.S. acknowledge the distinct ''hurry'' vowel before {{IPA|/r/}}, according to the same dialect survey aforementioned.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder (2003). &quot;[http://dialect.redlog.net/staticmaps/q_12.html fl''ou''rish] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711123931/http://dialect.redlog.net/staticmaps/q_12.html |date=2015-07-11 }}&quot;. The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Mirror–nearer merger|''Mirror–nearer'' merger]] in transition: The pre-{{IPA|/r/}} vowels in words like ''mirror'' {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and ''nearer'' {{IPA|/i/}} are merged or at least very close in most American accents. The quality of the historic ''mirror'' vowel in the word ''miracle'' is quite variable.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder (2003). &quot;[http://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_17.html the first vowel in &quot;m''i''racle&quot;]&quot;. The Harvard Dialect Survey. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Americans vary slightly in their pronunciations of [[R-colored vowel#Rhotacization|R-colored vowels]]—such as those in {{IPA|/ɛər/}} and {{IPA|/ɪər/}}—sometimes monophthongizing towards {{IPA|[ɛɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ɪɹ]}} or [[tenseness|tensing]] towards {{IPA|[eɪɹ]}} and {{IPA|[i(ə)ɹ]}} respectively, causing pronunciations like {{IPA|[pʰeɪɹ]}} for ''pair''/''pear'' and {{IPA|[pʰiəɹ]}} for ''peer''/''pier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|pp=481–482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, {{IPA|/jʊər/}} is often reduced to {{IPA|[jɚ]}}, so that ''cure'', ''pure'', and ''mature'' may all end with the sound {{IPA|[ɚ]}}, thus rhyming with ''blur'' and ''sir''. The word ''sure'' is also part of this rhyming set as it is commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ʃɚ]}}.
* [[Yod-dropping]]: Dropping of {{IPA|/j/}} after a consonant is much more extensive than in most of England. In most North American accents, {{IPA|/j/}} is &quot;dropped&quot; or &quot;deleted&quot; after all [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and interdental consonants (i.e. everywhere except after /p/, /b/, /f/, /h/, /k/, and /m/) so that ''new, duke, Tuesday, assume'' are pronounced {{IPA|[nu]}}, {{IPA|[duk]}}, {{IPA|[ˈtʰuzdeɪ]}}, {{IPA|[əˈsum]}} (compare with standard British {{IPA|/nju/}}, {{IPA|/djuk/}}, {{IPA|/ˈtjuzdeɪ/}}, {{IPA|/əˈsjum/}}).{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=247}}

* [[T-glottalization]]: {{IPA|/t/}} is normally pronounced as [[No audible release|unreleased]] or as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}} when occurring both (1) after a vowel or {{IPA|/r/}} and (2) before a consonant or [[syllabic consonant|syllabic]] {{IPA|[n̩]}}, as in ''button'' {{IPA-all|ˈbʌʔn̩||en-us-button.ogg}}. Following a vowel, {{IPA|/t/}} is also glottalized when before a significant pause or when in absolute final position: thus,  ''what'' {{IPA|[wʌʔ]}} or ''sit'' {{IPA|[sɪʔ]}}. (This innovation of [[T-glottalization|/t/ glottal stopping]] also may occur in British English, as well as variably between vowels.)
* [[Flapping]]: {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} becomes a [[alveolar flap|flap]] {{IPAblink|ɾ|audio=y}} when occurring both (1) after a vowel or {{IPA|/r/}} and (2) before an unstressed vowel or a syllabic consonant other than {{IPA|[n̩]}}, including ''water'' {{IPA-all|ˈwɔɾɚ||En-us-water.ogg}}, ''party'' {{IPA|[ˈpʰɑɹɾi]}} and ''model'' {{IPA|[ˈmɑɾɫ̩]}}. This results in pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' being pronounced the same. Flapping of {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}} before a full stressed vowel is also possible, but only when that vowel begins a new word or morpheme, as in ''what is it?'' {{IPA|[wʌɾˈɪzɪʔ]}} and twice in ''not at all'' {{IPA|[nɑɾəɾˈɔɫ]}}. Other rules apply to flapping too, to such a complex degree in fact that flapping has been analyzed as being required in certain contexts, prohibited in others, and optional in still others.&lt;ref&gt;Vaux, Bert (2000_. &quot;Flapping in English.&quot; ''Linguistic Society of America'', Chicago, IL. p .6.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, flapping is prohibited in words like ''seduce'' {{IPA|[səˈdus]}}, ''retail'' {{IPA|[ˈɹitʰeɪɫ]}}, and ''monotone'' {{IPA|[ˈmɑnətʰoʊn]}}, yet optional in ''impotence'' {{IPA|[ˈɪmpəɾɪns]}}.
**Both intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} may commonly be realized as {{IPAblink|ɾ̃}} (a nasalized [[alveolar flap]]) or simply {{IPA|[n]}}, making ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones in fast or non-careful speech.
* L-velarization: England's typical distinction between a &quot;clear L&quot; (i.e. {{IPAblink|l|audio=y}}) and a &quot;dark L&quot; (i.e. {{IPAblink|ɫ|audio=y}}) is much less noticeable in nearly all dialects of American English;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|editor=Grzegorz Dogil |editor2=Susanne Maria Reiterer |editor3=Walter de Gruyter|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|page=299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC&amp;pg=PA299|isbn=978-3-11-021549-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is often altogether absent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=&quot;General+American&quot;+&quot;velarized&quot;|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|last=|first=|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|year=2009|isbn=9783110215496 |editor=Grzegorz Dogil |editor2=Susanne Maria Reiterer |editor3=Walter de Gruyter|location=|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; with all &quot;L&quot; sounds tending to be &quot;dark,&quot; meaning having some degree of [[velarization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps even as dark as {{IPAblink|ʟ|audio=y}} (though in initial position, perhaps less dark than elsewhere among some speakers).{{sfnp|Jones|Roach|Hartman|2006|p=xi}} The only notable exceptions to this velarization are in some Spanish-influenced U.S. English varieties (such as [[New York Latino English|East Coast Latino English]], which typically shows a clear &quot;L&quot; in [[syllable onset]]s) and in [[Older Southern American English|older, moribund Southern speech]] of the U.S., where &quot;L&quot; is clear in an [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]] environment between [[front vowel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger|Weak-vowel merger]]: The vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} in unstressed syllables generally merges with {{IPA|/ə/}}, so ''effect'' is pronounced like ''affect'' and ''abbot'' and ''rabbit'' rhyme. The quality of the merged vowels varies considerably, though it is typically closer to {{IPA|[ɪ]}} when before a consonant; otherwise it is closer to {{IPA|[ə]}}.{{sfnp|Wells|2008|p=xxi}}
* Raising of pre-voiceless {{IPA|/aɪ/}}: Many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/aɪ/}} based on whether it occurs before a voiceless consonant or not, so that in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[äɪ]}} but in ''writer'' it is raised to {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} (because {{IPA|[t]}} is a voiceless consonant while {{IPA|[d]}} is not). Thus, words like ''bright, hike, price, wipe,'' etc. with a following voiceless consonant (such as {{IPA|/t, k, θ, s/}}) use a more raised vowel sound compared to ''bride, high, prize, wide'', etc. Because of this sound change, the words ''rider'' and ''writer'' {{Pronunciation|En-us-rider-writer.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}, for instance, remain distinct from one another by virtue of their difference in height (and length) of the diphthong's starting point (unrelated to both the letters ''d'' and ''t'' being pronounced in these words as alveolar flaps {{IPA|[ɾ]}}). The sound-change also applies across word boundaries, though the position of a word or phrase's stress may prevent the raising from taking place. For instance, a ''high school'' in the sense of &quot;secondary school&quot; is generally pronounced {{IPA|[ˈhɐɪskuɫ]}}; however, a ''high school'' in the literal sense of &quot;a tall school&quot; would be pronounced {{IPA|[ˌhaɪˈskuɫ]}}. This [[sound change]] began in the [[Northern American English|Northern]], [[New England English|New England]], and [[mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] regions of the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov||Ash|Boberg|2006|p=114}}: &quot;where Canadian raising has traditionally been reported: Canada, Eastern New England, Philadelphia, and the North&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and is becoming more common across the nation.
**Many speakers in the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]], [[North Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia dialect areas]] raise {{IPA|/aɪ/}} before voiced consonants in certain words as well, particularly {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[g]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. Hence, words like ''tiny'', ''spider'', ''cider'', ''tiger'', ''dinosaur'', ''beside'', ''idle'' (but sometimes not ''idol''), and ''fire'' may contain a raised nucleus. The use of {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} rather than {{IPA|[aɪ]}} in such words is unpredictable from phonetic environment alone, though it may have to do with their acoustic similarity to other words that ''do'' contain {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} before a voiceless consonant, per the traditional Canadian-raising system. Hence, some researchers have argued that there has been a [[phonemic split]] in these dialects; the distribution of the two sounds is becoming more unpredictable among younger speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1087&amp;context=curej|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]]|title=The Spread of Raising: Opacity, lexicalization, and diffusion|date=November 11, 2007|accessdate=September 21, 2016|last=Freuhwald|first=Josef T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conditioned [[/æ/ raising]] (especially before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}): The raising of the {{IPA|/æ/}} or {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel occurs in specific environments that vary widely from region to region, though nationwide most commonly before {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/æ/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/æ/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of &quot;continuum&quot; of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/æ/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[eə̯]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[æ]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[mæs]}} for ''mass'', but {{IPA|[meə̯n]}} for ''man''). In some American accents though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[eə̯]}} are indeed entirely separate (or &quot;split&quot;) phonemes, for example, in ''planet'' {{IPA|[pʰlænɪ̈ʔ]}} vs. ''plan it'' {{IPA|[pʰleənɪ̈ʔ]}}. These are called Mid-Atlantic [[/æ/#Phonemic tensing|split-''a'']] systems. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction (high and forward) in the mouth when compared to the backed Standard British &quot;[[broad a|broad ''a'']]&quot;, though the two nation's ''a'' systems are probably related phonologically if not phonetically; a British-like phenomenon occurs among some older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area for whom {{IPA|/æ/}} changes to {{IPA|/a/}} before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /θ/, /ð/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.
{{/æ/ tensing in North American English|hidden=yes}}
* [[Mergers of /ɒr-/ and /ɔːr-/|&quot;Short ''o''&quot; before ''r'' before a vowel]]: In typical North American accents (U.S. and Canada alike), the historical sequence {{IPA|/ɒr/}} (a short ''o'' sound followed by ''r'' and then another vowel, as in ''orange'', ''forest'', ''moral'', and ''warrant'') is realized as {{IPA|[oɹ~ɔɹ]}}, thus further merging with the already-merged {{IPA|/ɔr/–/oʊr/}} ([[horse–hoarse merger|''horse''–''hoarse'']]) set. In the U.S., four words (''tom'''orr'''ow, s'''orr'''y, s'''orr'''ow, b'''orr'''ow'' and, for some speakers, ''m'''orr'''ow'') usually contain the sound {{IPA|[ɑɹ]}} instead, and merge with the {{IPA|/ɑr/}} set (thus, ''sorry'' and ''[[sari]]'' become [[homophone]]s, both rhyming with ''starry'').{{sfnp|Wells|1982|p=476}}
{{English -or- table|header=General American {{IPA|/ɑr/}} and {{IPA|/ɔr/}} followed by a vowel, compared with other dialects|hidden=yes}}
Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:
* [[Horse–hoarse merger|''Horse–hoarse'' merger]]: This merger makes the vowels {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} homophones, with homophonous pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning, war/wore,'' etc. [[homophone]]s. Many older varieties of American English still keep these sets of words distinct, particularly in the extreme Northeast, the South (especially along the Gulf Coast), and the central Midlands,&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 52&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the merger is evidently spreading and younger Americans rarely show it.
* [[Wine–whine merger|''Wine–whine'' merger]]: This produces pairs like ''wine/whine, wet/whet, Wales/whales, wear/where,'' etc. [[homophone]]s, in most cases eliminating {{IPA|/ʍ/}}, also transcribed {{IPA|/hw/}}, the [[voiceless labiovelar fricative]]. However, scatterings of older speakers who do not merge these pairs still exist nationwide and perhaps most strongly in the South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 52&quot;/&gt;

Most [[Mexican Spanish]] contributions came after the [[War of 1812]], with the opening of the West, like ''[[ranch]]'' (now a common [[ranch house|house style]]). Due to the Mexican culinary influence, many Spanish words are incorporated in general use when talking about certain popular dishes: cilantro (instead of coriander), queso, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas, tostadas, fajitas, burritos, and guacamole. These words don't really have an English equivalent and are found in popular restaurants. New forms of dwelling created new terms ''([[Land lot|lot]], waterfront)'' and types of homes like ''[[log cabin]], [[adobe]]'' in the 18th century; ''[[apartment]], [[Wikt:shanty|shanty]]'' in the 19th century; ''project, [[condominium]], [[townhouse]], [[mobile home]]'' in the 20th century; and parts thereof ''([[driveway]], breezeway, [[backyard]])''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Industry and material innovations from the 19th century onwards provide distinctive new words, phrases, and idioms through [[railroad]]ing (see further at [[rail terminology]]) and [[transport]]ation terminology, ranging from types of roads (''dirt roads'', ''[[freeway]]s'') to infrastructure ''([[parking lot]], [[overpass]], [[rest area]]),'' to automotive terminology often now standard in English internationally.&lt;ref&gt;A few of these are now chiefly found, or have been more productive, outside the U.S.; for example, ''jump,'' &quot;to drive past a traffic signal&quot;; ''block'' meaning &quot;building&quot;, and ''center,'' &quot;central point in a town&quot; or &quot;main area for a particular activity&quot; (cf. Oxford English Dictionary).&lt;/ref&gt; Already existing English words—such as ''[[General store|store]], [[Retailing|shop]], [[lumber]]''—underwent shifts in meaning; others remained in the U.S. while changing in Britain.

New foreign loanwords came with 19th and early 20th century European immigration to the U.S.; notably, from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''([[chutzpah]], schmooze'') and [[German language|German]] (''[[hamburger]], [[Hot dog|wiener]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19970923 |title=The Maven's Word of the Day: gesundheit |publisher=[[Random House]] |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trudgill|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from ''[[OK]]'' and ''cool'' to ''[[nerd]]'' and ''[[24/7]]),'' while others have not ''([[have a nice day]], for sure);''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=009421%23x1%23x1%23day&amp;selected_word=day&amp;search_word=day |title=Definition of day noun from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Oup.com |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=036903%23x1%23x1%23sure&amp;selected_word=sure&amp;search_word=sure#sure_adv |title=Definition of sure adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Oup.com |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; many are now distinctly old-fashioned ''(swell, groovy).'' Some English words now in general use, such as ''hijacking, [[disc jockey]], boost, bulldoze'' and ''[[jazz]],'' originated as American slang.

American English has always shown a marked tendency to [[Anthimeria|use words in different parts of speech]] and nouns are [[functional shift|often used as verbs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iqiyyl&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trudgill|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of nouns that are now also verbs are ''interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, hashtag, head, divorce, loan, estimate, X-ray, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, bad-mouth, [[vacation]], major,'' and many others. [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounds]] coined in the U.S. are for instance ''[[foothill]], [[landslide]]'' (in all senses), ''[[Wikt:backdrop|backdrop]], [[teenager]],'' [[brainstorming|brainstorm]], [[Wikt:bandwagon|bandwagon]], [[hitchhike]], smalltime, and a huge number of others. Other compound words have been founded based on industrialization and the wave of the automobile: five-passenger car, four-door sedan, two-door sedan, and station-wagon (called an estate car in England).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theword.cz/inotherwords/american-vs-british-smackdown-station-wagon-vs-estate-car/|title=The Word » American vs. British Smackdown: Station wagon vs. estate car|access-date=2019-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are euphemistic ''([[human resources]], [[affirmative action]], [[correctional facility]]).'' Many compound nouns have the verb-and-preposition combination: ''stopover, lineup, tryout, spin-off, [[shootout]], holdup, hideout, comeback, [[makeover]],'' and many more. Some prepositional and [[phrasal verb]]s are in fact of American origin (''win out, hold up, back up/off/down/out, face up to'' and many others).&lt;ref&gt;British author [[George Orwell]] (in ''English People'', 1947, cited in OED s.v. ''lose)'' criticized an alleged &quot;American tendency&quot; to &quot;burden every verb with a preposition that adds nothing to its meaning (''win out'', ''lose out'', ''face up to'', etc.)&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noun endings such as ''-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)'' and ''-cian (beautician)'' are also particularly productive in the U.S.&lt;ref name = &quot;iqiyyl&quot;/&gt; Several verbs ending in ''-ize'' are of U.S. origin; for example, ''fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, [[weatherization|weatherize]],'' etc.; and so are some [[back-formation]]s ''(locate, fine-tune, curate, donate, emote, upholster'' and ''enthuse).'' Among syntactical constructions that arose are ''outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of,'' etc. Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably ''pesky, phony, rambunctious, buddy, [[sundae]], skeeter, sashay'' and ''kitty-corner.'' Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are, for example, ''lengthy, bossy, [[cuteness|cute]]'' and ''cutesy, punk'' (in all senses), ''sticky'' (of the weather), ''through'' (as in &quot;finished&quot;), and many colloquial forms such as ''peppy'' or ''wacky''.

A number of words and meanings that originated in [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]] and that have been in everyday use in the United States have since disappeared in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scots]]. Terms such as ''[[autumn|fall]]'' (&quot;autumn&quot;), ''[[faucet]]'' (&quot;tap&quot;), ''[[diaper]]'' (&quot;nappy&quot;; itself unused in the U.S.), ''[[candy]]'' (&quot;sweets&quot;), ''[[Frying pan|skillet]]'', ''[[eyeglasses]]'', and ''[[obligate]]'' are often regarded as Americanisms. ''Fall'' for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like &quot;fall of the leaf&quot; and &quot;fall of the year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fall}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gotten'' ([[past participle]] of ''get'') is often considered to be largely an Americanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Other words and meanings were brought back to Britain from the U.S., especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include ''hire'' (&quot;to employ&quot;), ''I guess'' (famously criticized by [[H. W. Fowler]]), ''[[baggage]]'', ''hit'' (a place), and the adverbs ''overly'' and ''presently'' (&quot;currently&quot;). Some of these, for example, ''[[monkey wrench]]'' and ''[[wastebasket]]'', originated in 19th century Britain. The adjectives ''mad'' meaning &quot;angry,&quot; ''smart'' meaning &quot;intelligent,&quot; and ''sick'' meaning &quot;ill&quot; are also more frequent in American (and Irish) English than British English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_angry.gif |title=angry |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |url-status=dead |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309172328/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_angry.gif |archivedate=9 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_intelligent.gif |title=intelligent |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |url-status=dead |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309172334/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_intelligent.gif |archivedate=9 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/ill |title=Definition of ill adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=Oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com |accessdate=29 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527173051/http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/ill |archive-date=2013-05-27 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between American and British English==
{{Main|Comparison of American and British English}}
{{American and British English differences}}
American English and [[British English]] (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography. The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: typically a lack of differentiation between adjectives and adverbs, employing the equivalent adjectives as adverbs ''he ran quick''/''he ran quickly'';different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly &quot;British&quot; forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''&lt;!--when it means &quot;to be a student&quot;--&gt;); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-37993-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.

Differences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. [[Noah Webster]] popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, &quot;he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John. &quot;The Effects of the Revolution on Language,&quot; in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. p.599&lt;/ref&gt; Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] Britain (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-62181-X}}, pp. 34 and 511.&lt;/ref&gt; AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' on occasion (see [[Oxford spelling]]).

There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of [[run-on sentences]], called &quot;[[comma splice]]s&quot; in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark (&quot;like this&quot;) over single ('as here').&lt;ref name=&quot;APA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocabulary differences vary by regions. For example, autumn is used more commonly in the United Kingdom, whereas fall is more common in American English. Some other differences include: aerial (United Kingdom) vs. antenna, biscuit (United Kingdom) vs. cookie/cracker, car park (United Kingdom) vs. parking lot, caravan (United Kingdom) vs. trailer, city centre (United Kingdom) vs. downtown, flat (United Kingdom) vs. apartment, fringe (United Kingdom) vs. bangs, and holiday (United Kingdom) vs. vacation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.studyenglishtoday.net/british-american-english.html|title=British vs. American English – Vocabulary Differences|website=www.studyenglishtoday.net|access-date=2019-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.

British English also differs from American English in that &quot;schedule&quot; can be pronounced with either {{IPA|[sk]}} or {{IPA|[ʃ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English Pronouncing Dictionary|last=Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1991|isbn=9780521425865|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Side box|above={{Map of American English}}|text=The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (in [[all caps]]) plus smaller and more local dialects, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps]. Any region may also contain speakers of a &quot;[[General American]]&quot; accent that resists the marked features of their region. Furthermore, this map does not account for speakers of ethnic or cultural varieties (such as [[African-American English]], [[Chicano English]], [[Cajun English]], etc.).}}
While written American English is largely standardized across the country and spoken American English dialects are highly mutually intelligible, there are still several recognizable regional and ethnic accents and lexical distinctions.

===Regional accents===
{{Main|Regional vocabularies of American English|North American English regional phonology}}
The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of &quot;both convergence and divergence&quot;: some accents are homogenizing and [[accent levelling|levelling]], while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;DD&quot;&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Labov|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been settled longer than the American West Coast, the East Coast has had more time to develop unique accents, and it currently comprises three or four linguistically significant regions, each of which possesses English varieties both different from each other as well as quite internally diverse: [[New England]], the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] (including a [[New York accent]] as well as a unique [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Philadelphia–Baltimore accent]]), and the [[Southern United States|South]]. As of the twentieth century, the middle and eastern [[Great Lakes area]], Chicago being the largest city with these speakers, also ushered in certain unique features, including the [[fronting (phonetics)|front]]ing of the {{sc2|LOT}} {{IPA|/ɑ/}} vowel in the mouth toward {{IPA|[a]}} and [[tenseness|tensing]] of the {{sc2|TRAP}} {{IPA|/æ/}} vowel wholesale to {{IPA|[eə]}}. These sound changes have triggered a series of other [[vowel shift]]s in the same region, known by linguists as the &quot;[[Inland North]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 190&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inland North shares with the [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England dialect]] (including [[Boston accent]]s) a [[back vowel|backer tongue positioning]] of the {{Sc2|GOOSE}} {{IPA|/u/}} vowel (to {{IPA|[u]}}) and the {{Sc2|MOUTH}} {{IPA|/aʊ/}} vowel (to {{IPA|[ɑʊ~äʊ]}}) in comparison to the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 230&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranging from northern New England across the Great Lakes to Minnesota, another Northern regional marker is the variable fronting of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} before {{IPA|/r/}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example appearing four times in the stereotypical Boston [[shibboleth]] ''Park the car in Harvard Yard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vorhees|first=Mara|title=Boston. Con Pianta. Ediz. Inglese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0sQ5UzkiQUC&amp;pg=PA52|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74179-178-5|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Non-RhoticityUSA.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The red dots show every U.S. metropolitan area where over 50% non-rhotic speech has been documented among some of that area's local white speakers in the twenty-first century. Non-rhotic speech may be heard from [[African-American English|black speakers]] throughout the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Several other phenomena serve to distinguish regional U.S. accents. Boston, [[Western Pennsylvania English|Pittsburgh]], [[North-Central American English|Upper Midwestern]], and [[Western American English|Western U.S. accents]] have fully completed a merger of the {{Sc2|LOT}} vowel with the {{Sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel ({{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, respectively):&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[cot–caught merger|''cot–caught'' merger]], which is rapidly spreading throughout the whole country. However, the South, Inland North, and a Northeastern coastal corridor passing through Rhode Island, New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore typically preserve an older ''cot–caught'' distinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 190&quot;/&gt; For that Northeastern corridor, the realization of the {{sc2|THOUGHT}} vowel is particularly [[markedness|marked]], as depicted in humorous spellings, like in ''tawk'' and ''cawfee'' (''talk'' and ''coffee''), which intend to represent it being [[tenseness|tense]] and [[diphthong]]al: {{IPA|[oə]}}.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/Atlas_chapters/Ch16_2nd.rev.pdf This phonemic and phonetic arrangement of the low back vowels makes Rhode Island more similar to New York City than to the rest of New England]&quot;.{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Ash|2006|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[æ tensing|split of {{sc2|TRAP}}]] into two separate [[phoneme]]s, using different ''a'' pronunciations for example in ''gap'' {{IPA|[æ]}} versus ''gas'' {{IPA|[eə]}}, further defines New York City as well as Philadelphia–Baltimore accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Americans preserve all historical {{IPA|/ɹ/}} sounds, using what is known as a [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic accent]]. The only traditionally ''r''-dropping (or non-rhotic) regional U.S. accents are spoken in [[Eastern New England English|eastern New England]], [[New York City English|New York City]] variably, and some of the [[older Southern American English|former plantation South]] primarily among older speakers (and consequently [[African-American Vernacular English]] variably across the country), though the vowel-consonant cluster found in &quot;bird,&quot; &quot;work,&quot; &quot;hurt,&quot; &quot;learn,&quot; etc. usually retains its ''r'' pronunciation, even in these non-rhotic American accents. Non-rhoticity among such speakers is presumed to have arisen from their upper classes' close historical contact with [[England]], imitating London's ''r''-dropping, a feature that has continued to gain prestige throughout England from the late 18th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Trudgill|2004|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which has conversely lost prestige in the U.S. since at least the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=5, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-rhoticity makes a word like ''car'' sound like ''cah'' or ''source'' like ''sauce''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 137, 141&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=137, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent and stigmatized regional accents of the country are New York City and [[Southern American English|Southern accents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes, 2013, p. 51&quot;&gt;Hayes, 2013, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Southern speech, strongest in southern Appalachia and certain areas of Texas, is commonly identified among Americans as a &quot;country&quot; accent,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes, 2013, p. 51&quot;/&gt; and is defined by the {{IPA|/aɪ/}} vowel losing its [[diphthong|gliding quality]]: {{IPA|[aː]}}, the initiation event for a complicated Southern vowel shift, including a &quot;[[Southern drawl]]&quot; that makes short [[front vowel]]s into distinct-sounding [[gliding vowel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Labov 2006 125&quot;&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fronting of the vowels of {{sc2|GOOSE}}, {{sc2|GOAT}}, {{sc2|MOUTH}}, and {{sc2|STRUT}} tends to also define Southern accents as well as the accents spoken in the &quot;[[Midland American English|Midland]]&quot;: a vast band of the country that constitutes an intermediate dialect region between the traditional North and South. Western U.S. accents mostly fall under the [[General American]] spectrum.

===General American===
In 2010, [[William Labov]] noted that Great Lakes, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and West Coast accents have undergone &quot;vigorous new sound changes&quot; since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, so they &quot;are now more different from each other than they were 50 or 100 years ago&quot;, while other accents, like of New York City and Boston, have remained stable in that same time-frame.&lt;ref name=&quot;DD&quot;/&gt; However, a [[General American]] sound system also has some debated degree of influence nationwide, for example, gradually beginning to oust the regional accent in urban areas of the South and at least some in the Inland North. Rather than one particular accent, General American is best defined as an umbrella covering any American accent that does not incorporate features associated with some particular region, ethnicity, or socioeconomic group. Typical General American features include [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]ity, the [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]], [[Mary–marry–merry merger|''Mary–marry–merry'' merger]], [[/æ/ tensing|pre-nasal &quot;short ''a''&quot; tensing]], and other [[General American#Phonology|particular vowel sounds]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Dialects are considered &quot;[[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]&quot; if they pronounce the ''r'' sound in all historical environments, without ever &quot;dropping&quot; this sound. The [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]] is the pronunciation of the unrounded {{IPA|/ɒ/}} vowel variant (as in ''cot, lot, bother'', etc.) the same as the {{IPA|/ɑ/}} vowel (as in ''spa, haha, Ma''), causing words like ''con'' and ''Kahn'' and like ''sob'' and ''[[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'' to [[homophone|sound identical]], with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as {{IPA|[ɑ~ä]}}. Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the &quot;short ''a''&quot; vowel (in ''cat, trap, bath'', etc.), causing {{IPA|/æ/}} to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like {{IPA|[ɛə]}}) particularly when before a [[nasal consonant]]; thus, ''mad'' is {{IPA|[mæd]}}, but ''man'' is more like {{IPA|[mɛən]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; General American features are embraced most by Americans who are highly educated or in the most formal contexts, and regional accents with the most General American native features include North Midland, Western New England, and Western accents.

===Other varieties===
Although no longer region-specific,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{harvnb|Trudgill|2004|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African-American Vernacular English]], which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including [[hip hop culture]]. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are [[Chicano English]], spoken in the West and Midwest, and [[New York Latino English]], spoken in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as [[Yeshivish|Yeshiva English]] and &quot;[[Yinglish]]&quot; are spoken by some [[American Jews|American]] [[Orthodox Jew]]s, [[Cajun English|Cajun Vernacular English]] by some [[Cajun]]s in southern Louisiana, and [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] by some [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] in Pennsylvania and the Midwest. [[American Indian English]]es have been documented among diverse Indian tribes. The island state of [[Hawaii]], though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [[creole language]] known commonly as [[Hawaiian Pidgin]], and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent.
