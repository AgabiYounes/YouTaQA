With [[Isidore of Miletus]], he designed the [[Hagia Sophia]] for [[Justinian&amp;nbsp;I]].

==Life==
Anthemius was one of the five sons of Stephanus of Tralles, a physician. His brothers were Dioscorus, Alexander, Olympius, and Metrodorus. Dioscorus followed his father's profession in Tralles; Alexander did so in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and became one of the most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius became a noted [[Roman law|lawyer]]; and Metrodorus worked as a [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|grammarian]] in Constantinople.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}}

Anthemius was said to have annoyed his neighbor Zeno in two ways: first, by engineering a miniature earthquake by sending steam through leather tubes he had fixed among the [[joist]]s and flooring of Zeno's parlor while he was entertaining friends and, second, by simulating [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] and flashing intolerable light into Zeno's eyes from a slightly hollowed mirror.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} In addition to his familiarity with steam, some dubious authorities credited Anthemius with a knowledge of [[gunpowder]] or other explosive compound.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}}

==Mathematics==
Anthemius was a capable [[Greek mathematics|mathematician]]. In the course of his treatise &quot;On [[Burning Glass]]es&quot;, intended to facilitate the construction of surfaces to reflect light to a single point, he described the string construction of the [[ellipse]]{{sfnp|Boyer|1991|p=193}} and assumed a property of ellipses not found in [[Apollonius of Perga]]'s ''Conics'': the equality of the angles subtended at a focus by two tangents drawn from a point. His work also includes the first practical use of the [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]: having given the focus and a double ordinate, he used the focus and directrix to obtain any number of points on a [[parabola]].{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} This work was later known to [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] such as [[Book of Optics|Alhazen]].

Eutocius's commentary on Apollonius's ''Conics'' was dedicated to Anthemius.{{sfnp|Boyer|1991|p=193}}

==Architecture==
As an architect, Anthemius is best known for his work designing the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=98}} He was commissioned with [[Isidore of Miletus]] by [[Justinian&amp;nbsp;I]] shortly after the earlier church on the site burned down in 532 but died early on in the project. He is also said to have repaired the flood defenses at [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Daras]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Anthemius.html&lt;/ref&gt;
