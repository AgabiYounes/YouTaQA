'''Adenosine triphosphate''' ('''ATP''') is a complex [[organic compound|organic chemical]] that provides energy to drive many processes in living [[cell (biology)|cells]], e.g. muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis. Found in all forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the &quot;molecular unit of [[currency]]&quot; of intracellular [[energy transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knowles |first=J.&amp;nbsp;R. |title=Enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer reactions |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=49 |pages=877–919 |year=1980 |pmid=6250450 | doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.49.070180.004305}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When consumed in [[Metabolism|metabolic]] processes, it converts either to [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) or to [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP). Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Törnroth-Horsefield |first1=S. |last2=Neutze |first2=R. |title=Opening and closing the metabolite gate |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=105 |issue=50 |pages=19565–19566 |date=December 2008|pmid=19073922 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0810654106 |pmc=2604989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] to DNA and RNA, and is used as a [[coenzyme]].

From the perspective of [[biochemistry]], ATP is classified as a [[nucleoside triphosphate]], which indicates that it consists of three components: a nitrogenous base ([[adenine]]), the sugar [[ribose]], and the [[Polyphosphate|triphosphate]].

==Structure==
In terms of its structure, ATP consists of an [[adenine]] attached by the 9-nitrogen atom to the 1′ carbon atom of a sugar ([[ribose]]), which in turn is attached at the 5' carbon atom of the sugar to a triphosphate group. In its many reactions related to metabolism, the adenine and sugar groups remain unchanged, but the triphosphate is converted to di- and monophosphate, giving respectively the derivatives [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and [[adenosine monophosphate|AMP]]. The three phosphoryl groups are referred to as the alpha (α), beta (β), and, for the terminal phosphate, gamma (γ).

In neutral solution, ionized ATP exists mostly as ATP&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;, with a small proportion of ATP&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Storer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Storer |first1=A.|authorlink2=Athel Cornish-Bowden |last2=Cornish-Bowden |first2=A. | title = Concentration of MgATP&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and other ions in solution.

===Binding of metal cations to ATP===
Being polyanionic and featuring a potentially [[chelation|chelatable]] polyphosphate group, ATP binds metal cations with high affinity. The [[binding constant]] for {{chem|link=magnesium|Mg|2+}} is ({{gaps|9|554}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=J. |last2=Chin |first2=A. | title = Chelation of divalent cations by ATP, studied by titration calorimetry | journal = Anal.

Due to the strength of the ATP-Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; interaction, ATP exists in the cell mostly as a complex with {{chem|Mg|2+}} bonded to the phosphate oxygen centers.&lt;ref name=Storer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garfinkel |first1=L. |last2=Altschuld |first2=R. |last3=Garfinkel |first3=D. | title = Magnesium in cardiac energy metabolism | journal = J.

==Production from AMP and ADP==
===Production, aerobic conditions===
A typical intracellular [[concentration]] of ATP is hard to pin down, however, reports have shown there to be 1–10&amp;nbsp;[[molarity|μM]] per gram of tissue in a variety of eukaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Beis |first1=I. |last2= Newsholme |first2=E.&amp;nbsp;A. | date = October 1, 1975 | title= The contents of adenine nucleotides, phosphagens and some glycolytic intermediates in resting muscles from vertebrates and invertebrates | journal= Biochem. J. | volume=152 | pages= 23–32 | pmid=1212224 |pmc=1172435| issue = 1 | doi=10.1042/bj1520023}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism.

ATP can be produced by a number of distinct cellular processes; the three main pathways in [[eukaryote]]s are (1) [[glycolysis]], (2) the [[citric acid cycle]]/[[oxidative phosphorylation]], and (3) [[beta-oxidation]]. The overall process of oxidizing glucose to [[carbon dioxide]], the combination of pathways 1 and 2, is known as [[cellular respiration]], produces about 30 equivalents of ATP from each molecule of glucose.&lt;ref name=Rich&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rich |first=P.&amp;nbsp;R. |title=The molecular machinery of Keilin's respiratory chain |journal=Biochem. Soc. Trans. |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=1095–1105 |year=2003 |pmid=14641005 |doi=10.1042/BST0311095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP production by a non-[[photosynthetic]] aerobic eukaryote occurs mainly in the [[mitochondria]], which comprise nearly 25% of the volume of a typical cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lodish |first1=H. |last2=Berk |first2=A. |last3=Matsudaira |first3=P. |last4=Kaiser |first4=C.&amp;nbsp;A. |last5=Krieger |first5=M. |last6=Scott |first6=M.&amp;nbsp;P. |last7=Zipursky |first7=S.&amp;nbsp;L. |last8=Darnell |first8=J. |title=Molecular Cell Biology |edition=5th |publisher=W.&amp;nbsp;H. Freeman |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-7167-4366-8 |year=2004 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/molecularcellbio00harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Glycolysis====
{{Main|Glycolysis}}

In glycolysis, glucose and glycerol are metabolized to [[pyruvate]]. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through [[substrate-level phosphorylation|substrate phosphorylation]] catalyzed by two enzymes, [[Phosphoglycerate kinase|PGK]] and [[pyruvate kinase]]. Two equivalents of [[NADH]] are also produced, which can be oxidized via the [[electron transport chain]] and result in the generation of additional ATP by [[ATP synthase]]. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the [[citric acid cycle|Krebs Cycle]].&lt;ref name=Voet&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voet |first1=D. |last2=Voet |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;G. | year=2004 | title=Biochemistry |volume=1 |edition=3rd | publisher= Wiley |location=Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 978-0-471-19350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycolysis is viewed as consisting of two phases with five steps each. Phase 1, &quot;the preparatory phase&quot;, glucose is converted to 2 d-glyceraldehyde -3-phosphate (g3p). One ATP is invested in the Step 1, and another ATP is invested in Step 3. Steps 1 and 3 of glycolysis are referred to as &quot;Priming Steps&quot;. In Phase 2, two equivalents of g3p are converted to two pyruvates . In Step 7, two ATP are produced. In addition, in Step 10, two further equivalents of ATP are produced. In Steps 7 and 10, ATP is generated from ADP. A net of two ATPs are formed in the glycolysis cycle. The glycolysis pathway is later associated with the Citric Acid Cycle which produces additional equivalents of ATP.

=====Regulation=====
In glycolysis, [[hexokinase]] is directly inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and [[pyruvate kinase]] is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control point for the glycolytic pathway is [[phosphofructokinase]] (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a [[tetramer protein|tetramer]] that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two [[binding site]]s for ATP&amp;nbsp;– the [[active site]] is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet&quot; /&gt; A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including [[cyclic AMP]], [[ammonium]] ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet&quot; /&gt;

====Citric acid cycle====
{{Main|Citric acid cycle|oxidative phosphorylation}}

In the [[mitochondrion]], pyruvate is oxidized by the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] to the [[acetyl]] group, which is fully oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] by the [[citric acid cycle]] (also known as the Krebs cycle). Every &quot;turn&quot; of the citric acid cycle produces two molecules of carbon dioxide, one equivalent of ATP [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) through [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] catalyzed by [[succinyl-CoA synthetase]], as succinyl- CoA is converted to Succinate,  three equivalents of [[NADH]], and one equivalent of [[Flavin group|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are recycled (to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]], respectively), generating additional ATP by [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. The oxidation of NADH results in the synthesis of 2–3 equivalents of ATP, and the oxidation of one FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields between 1–2 equivalents of ATP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rich&quot; /&gt; The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process. Although the citric acid cycle itself does not involve molecular [[oxygen]], it is an obligately [[aerobic glycolysis|aerobic]] process because O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used to recycle the NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the absence of oxygen, the citric acid cycle ceases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot; /&gt;

The generation of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH relies on the [[malate-aspartate shuttle]] (and to a lesser extent, the [[glycerol-phosphate shuttle]]) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a [[malate dehydrogenase]] enzyme converts [[oxaloacetate]] to [[malate]], which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. A [[transaminase]] converts the oxaloacetate to [[aspartate]] for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lodish&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--will put the antiporter/full cycle in the shuttle article--&gt;

In oxidative phosphorylation, the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through the electron transport chain pumps [[proton]]s out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space. This pumping generates a [[proton motive force]] that is the net effect of a [[pH]] gradient and an [[electric potential]] gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Flow of protons down this potential gradient&amp;nbsp;– that is, from the intermembrane space to the matrix&amp;nbsp;–  yields ATP by [[ATP synthase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abrahams |first1=J. |last2=Leslie |first2=A. |last3=Lutter |first3=R. |last4=Walker |first4=J. | title = Structure at 2.8&amp;nbsp;Å resolution of F1-ATPase from bovine heart mitochondria | journal = Nature | volume = 370 | issue = 6491 | pages = 621–628 | year = 1994 |pmid=8065448 | doi = 10.1038/370621a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three ATP are produced per turn.

Although oxygen consumption appears fundamental for the maintenance of the [[proton motive force]], in the event of oxygen shortage ([[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]]), intracellular acidosis (mediated by enhanced glycolytic rates and ATP hydrolysis), contributes to mitochondrial membrane potential and directly drives ATP synthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 30713504 | volume=9, 1914 | title=Acidosis Maintains the Function of Brain Mitochondria in Hypoxia-Tolerant Triplefin Fish: A Strategy to Survive Acute Hypoxic Exposure? | pmc=6346031 | date=January 2019 | journal=Front Physiol | doi=10.3389/fphys.2018.01941 | last1 = Devaux | first1 = JBL | last2 = Hedges | first2 = CP | last3 = Hickey | first3 = AJR}}&lt;/ref&gt;..  

Most of the ATP synthesized in the mitochondria will be used for cellular processes in the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. ATP outward movement is favored by the membrane's electrochemical potential because the cytosol has a relatively positive charge compared to the relatively negative matrix. For every ATP transported out, it costs 1 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. One ATP costs about 3  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, making and exporting one ATP requires  4H&lt;sup&gt;+.&lt;/sup&gt; The inner membrane contains an [[antiporter]], the [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]/ATP translocase, which is an [[integral membrane protein]] used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] in the intermembrane space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandolin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dahout-Gonzalez |first1=C. |last2=Nury |first2=H. |last3=Trézéguet |first3=V. |last4=Lauquin |first4=G. |last5=Pebay-Peyroula |first5=E. |last6=Brandolin |first6=G. | title = Molecular, functional, and pathological aspects of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier | journal = Physiology | volume = 21 | pages = 242–249 | year = 2006| pmid = 16868313 | doi=10.1152/physiol.00005.2006 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient. After completing glycolysis, the Citric Acid Cycle, electrons transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation, approximately 30–38 ATP are produced per glucose.

=====Regulation=====
The citric acid cycle is regulated mainly by the availability of key substrates, particularly the ratio of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADH and the concentrations of [[calcium]], inorganic phosphate, ATP, [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], and AMP. [[Citrate]]&amp;nbsp;– the ion that gives its name to the cycle&amp;nbsp;– is a feedback inhibitor of [[citrate synthase]] and also inhibits PFK, providing a direct link between the regulation of the citric acid cycle and glycolysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet&quot; /&gt;

====Beta oxidation====
{{Main|Beta-oxidation}}
In the presence of air and various cofactors and enzymes, fatty acids are converted to [[acetyl-CoA]]. The pathway is called [[beta-oxidation]]. Each cycle of beta-oxidation shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and produces one equivalent each of acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The acetyl-CoA is metabolized by the citric acid cycle to generate ATP, while the NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are used  by oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP.  Dozens of ATP equivalents are generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ronnett |first1=G. |last2=Kim |first2=E. |last3=Landree |first3=L. |last4=Tu |first4=Y. | title = Fatty acid metabolism as a target for obesity treatment | journal = Physiol. Behav. | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–35 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15878185 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.04.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Regulation=====
In oxidative phosphorylation, the key control point is the reaction catalyzed by [[cytochrome c oxidase]], which is regulated by the availability of its substrate&amp;nbsp;– the reduced form of [[cytochrome c]]. The amount of reduced cytochrome c available is directly related to the amounts of other substrates:

:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac12 \ce{NADH} + \ce{cyt}\ \ce{c_{ox}} + \ce{ADP} + \ce{P_i} \rightleftharpoons
\frac12 \ce{NAD^+} + \ce{cyt}\ \ce{c_{red}} + \ce{ATP}
&lt;/math&gt;

which directly implies this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{[\mathrm{cyt~c_{red}}]}{[\mathrm{cyt~c_{ox}}]} = \left(\frac{[\mathrm{NADH}]}{[\mathrm{NAD}]^{+}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{ADP}] [\mathrm{P_i}]}{[\mathrm{ATP}]}\right)K_\mathrm{eq}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a high ratio of [NADH] to [NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] or a high ratio of [ADP][P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;] to [ATP] imply a high amount of reduced cytochrome c and a high level of cytochrome c oxidase activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voet&quot; /&gt; An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brandolin&quot; /&gt;

====Ketosis====
{{Main|Ketone bodies}}

Ketone bodies can be used as fuels, yielding 22 ATP and 2 [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] molecules per acetoacetate molecule when oxidized in the mitochondria. Ketone bodies are transported from the [[liver]] to other tissues, where [[acetoacetate]] and [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|''beta''-hydroxybutyrate]] can be reconverted to [[acetyl-CoA]] to produce reducing equivalents (NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), via the [[citric acid cycle]]. Ketone bodies cannot be used as fuel by the liver, because the liver lacks the enzyme β-ketoacyl-CoA transferase, also called thiophorase.  [[Acetoacetate]] in low concentrations is taken up by the liver and undergoes detoxification through the methylglyoxal pathway which ends with lactate. [[Acetoacetate]] in high concentrations is absorbed by cells other than those in the liver and enters a different pathway via [[1,2-propanediol]].  Though the pathway follows a different series of steps requiring ATP, 1,2-propanediol can be turned into pyruvate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Environmental Protection Agency; TOXICOLOGICAL REVIEW OF ACETONE (CAS No. 67-64-1)&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0128tr.pdf| title=Integrated Risk Information System| date=2013-03-15| access-date=2019-02-01| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924074331/http://www.epa.gov/iris/toxreviews/0128tr.pdf| archive-date=2015-09-24| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production, anaerobic conditions===
[[fermentation (biochemistry)|Fermentation]] is the metabolism of organic compounds in the absence of air. It involves [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] in the absence of a respiratory [[electron transport chain]]. The equation for the oxidation of glucose to [[lactic acid]] is:
: {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}} → 2&amp;nbsp;{{chem|CH|3|CH(OH)COOH}} + 2&amp;nbsp;ATP

[[Anaerobic respiration]] is respiration in the absence of {{chem|link=oxygen|O|2}}. Prokaryotes can utilize a variety of electron acceptors. These include [[nitrate]], [[sulfate]], and carbon dioxide.

===ATP replenishment by nucleoside diphosphate kinases===
ATP can also be synthesized through several so-called &quot;replenishment&quot; reactions catalyzed by the enzyme families of [[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]s (NDKs), which use other nucleoside triphosphates as a high-energy phosphate donor, and the [[ATP:guanido phosphotransferase family|ATP:guanido-phosphotransferase]] family.

===ATP production during photosynthesis===
In plants, ATP is synthesized in the [[thylakoid membrane]] of the [[chloroplast]].  The process is called photophosphorylation. The &quot;machinery&quot; is similar to that in mitochondria except that light energy is used to pump protons across a membrane to produce a proton-motive force. ATP synthase then ensues exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = J. | title = Photosynthesis of ATP-electrons, proton pumps, rotors, and poise | journal = Cell | volume = 110 | issue = 3 | pages = 273–276 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12176312 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00870-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the [[Calvin cycle]], which produces [[triose]] sugars.

===ATP recycling===
The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.2&amp;nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|mole]]s. The majority of ATP is recycled from [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] by the aforementioned processes. Thus, at any given time, the total amount of ATP + [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] remains fairly constant.

The energy used by human cells requires the [[hydrolysis]] of 100 to 150&amp;nbsp;moles of ATP daily, which is around 50 to 75&amp;nbsp;kg. A human will typically use up his or her body weight of ATP over the course of the day. Each equivalent of ATP is recycled 500–750 times during a single day ({{nowrap|100 / 0.2 {{=}} 500}}).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==Biochemical functions==
===Intracellular signaling===
ATP is involved in [[signal transduction]] by serving as substrate for kinases, enzymes that transfer phosphate groups.  Kinases are the most common ATP-binding proteins.  They share a small number of common folds.&lt;ref name=Scheeff&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheeff |first1=E. |last2=Bourne |first2=P. | title = Structural evolution of the protein kinase-like superfamily |pmc=1261164 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010049 | journal = PLoS Comput. Biol. | volume = 1 | issue = 5 | pages = e49 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16244704}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Phosphorylation]] of a protein by a kinase can activate a cascade such as the [[mitogen-activated protein kinase]] cascade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mishra |first1=N. |last2=Tuteja |first2=R. |last3=Tuteja |first3=N. | title = Signaling through MAP kinase networks in plants | journal = Arch. Biochem. Biophys. | volume = 452 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–68 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16806044 | doi = 10.1016/j.abb.2006.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ATP is also a substrate of [[adenylate cyclase]], most commonly in [[G protein–coupled receptor|G protein-coupled receptor]] signal transduction pathways and is transformed to [[second messenger]], cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kamenetsky |first1=M. |last2=Middelhaufe |first2=S. |last3=Bank |first3=E. |last4=Levin |first4=L. |last5=Buck |first5=J. |last6=Steegborn |first6=C. | title = Molecular details of cAMP generation in mammalian cells: a tale of two systems | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 362 | issue = 4 | pages = 623–639 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16934836 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.07.045 | pmc = 3662476}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanoune |first1=J. |last2=Defer |first2=N. | title = Regulation and role of adenylyl cyclase isoforms | journal = Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. | volume = 41 | pages = 145–174 | year = 2001| pmid = 11264454 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.41.1.145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA and RNA synthesis===
ATP is one of four &quot;monomers&quot; required in the synthesis of [[RNA]]. The process is promoted by [[RNA polymerase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Joyce |first1=C.&amp;nbsp;M. |last2=Steitz |first2=T.&amp;nbsp;A. |title=Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=177 |issue=22 |pages=6321–6329 |year=1995 |pmid=7592405 |pmc=177480 |doi=10.1128/jb.177.22.6321-6329.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar process occurs in the formation of DNA, except that ATP is first converted to the [[deoxyribonucleotide]] dATP.  Like many condensation reactions in nature, [[DNA replication]] and [[DNA transcription]] also consumes ATP.

===Amino acid activation in protein synthesis===
{{main|Amino acid activation}}
[[Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase]] enzymes consume ATP in the attachment tRNA to amino acids, forming aminoacyl-tRNA complexes. Aminoacyl transferase binds AMP-amino acid to tRNA. The coupling reaction proceeds in two steps:

# aa + ATP ⟶ aa-AMP + [[pyrophosphate|PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]]
# aa-AMP + tRNA ⟶ aa-tRNA + AMP

The amino acid is coupled to the penultimate nucleotide at the 3′-end of the tRNA (the A in the sequence CCA) via an ester bond (roll over in illustration).

===ATP binding cassette transporter===
Transporting chemicals out of a cell against a gradient is often associated with ATP hydrolysis.  Transport is mediated by [[ATP binding cassette transporter]]s.  The human genome encodes 48 ABC transporters, that are used for exporting drugs, lipids, and other compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mammalian ABC transporters in health and disease|authors=Borst, P.; Elferink, R. Oude|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|year=2002|volume=71|pages=537–592|doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.102301.093055|pmid=12045106|url=https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/3499814/42885_202387y.pdf|access-date=2018-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421032744/https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/3499814/42885_202387y.pdf|archive-date=2018-04-21|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracellular signalling and neurotransmision===
Cells secrete ATP to communicate with other cells in a process called [[purinergic signalling]]. ATP serves as a neurotransmitter in many parts of the nervous system, modulates ciliary beating, affects vascular oxygen supply etc.  ATP is either secreted directly across the cell membrane through channel proteins&lt;ref name=&quot;RomanovLasher2018&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romanov|first1=Roman A.|last2=Lasher|first2=Robert S.|last3=High|first3=Brigit|last4=Savidge|first4=Logan E.|last5=Lawson|first5=Adam|last6=Rogachevskaja|first6=Olga A.|last7=Zhao|first7=Haitian|last8=Rogachevsky|first8=Vadim V.|last9=Bystrova|first9=Marina F.|last10=Churbanov|first10=Gleb D.|last11=Adameyko|first11=Igor|last12=Harkany|first12=Tibor|last13=Yang|first13=Ruibiao|last14=Kidd|first14=Grahame J.|last15=Marambaud|first15=Philippe|last16=Kinnamon|first16=John C.|last17=Kolesnikov|first17=Stanislav S.|last18=Finger|first18=Thomas E.|title=Chemical synapses without synaptic vesicles: Purinergic neurotransmission through a CALHM1 channel-mitochondrial signaling complex|journal=Science Signaling|volume=11|issue=529|year=2018|pages=eaao1815|issn=1945-0877|doi=10.1126/scisignal.aao1815|pmid=29739879|pmc=5966022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dahl2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dahl|first1=Gerhard|title=ATP release through pannexon channels|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=370|issue=1672|year=2015|pages=20140191|issn=0962-8436|doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0191|pmid=26009770|pmc=4455760}}&lt;/ref&gt; or is pumped into vesicles&lt;ref name=&quot;LarssonSawada2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larsson|first1=Max|last2=Sawada|first2=Keisuke|last3=Morland|first3=Cecilie|last4=Hiasa|first4=Miki|last5=Ormel|first5=Lasse|last6=Moriyama|first6=Yoshinori|last7=Gundersen|first7=Vidar|title=Functional and Anatomical Identification of a Vesicular Transporter Mediating Neuronal ATP Release|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=22|issue=5|year=2012|pages=1203–1214|issn=1460-2199|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhr203|pmid=21810784}}&lt;/ref&gt; which then [[exocytosis|fuse]] with the membrane. Cells detect ATP using the [[purinergic receptor]] proteins P2X and P2Y.

=== Protein solubility ===
ATP has recently been proposed to act as a biological [[hydrotrope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyman|first=Anthony A.|last2=Krishnan|first2=Yamuna|last3=Alberti|first3=Simon|last4=Wang|first4=Jie|last5=Saha|first5=Shambaditya|last6=Malinovska|first6=Liliana|last7=Patel|first7=Avinash|date=2017-05-19|title=ATP as a biological hydrotrope|journal=Science|language=en|volume=356|issue=6339|pages=753–756|doi=10.1126/science.aaf6846|issn=0036-8075|pmid=28522535}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been shown to affect proteome-wide solubility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savitski|first=Mikhail M.|last2=Bantscheff|first2=Marcus|last3=Huber|first3=Wolfgang|last4=Dominic Helm|last5=Günthner|first5=Ina|last6=Werner|first6=Thilo|last7=Kurzawa|first7=Nils|last8=Sridharan|first8=Sindhuja|date=2019-03-11|title=Proteome-wide solubility and thermal stability profiling reveals distinct regulatory roles for ATP|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=1155|doi=10.1038/s41467-019-09107-y|pmid=30858367|pmc=6411743|issn=2041-1723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ATP analogues==
Biochemistry laboratories often use ''[[in vitro]]'' studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. ATP analogs are also used in [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine a [[protein structure]] in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.

[[Enzyme inhibitor]]s of ATP-dependent enzymes such as [[kinase]]s are needed to examine the [[binding site]]s and [[transition state]]s involved in ATP-dependent reactions.

Most useful ATP analogs cannot be hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a [[sulfur]] atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound [[vanadate]] ion.

Caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.&lt;ref name=Resetar&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Resetar |first1=A.&amp;nbsp;M. |last2=Chalovich |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;M. | year=1995 | title= Adenosine 5′-(gamma-thiotriphosphate): an ATP analog that should be used with caution in muscle contraction studies | volume=34 | issue=49 | pages=16039–16045 | pmid=8519760 | doi = 10.1021/bi00049a018 | journal= Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
