'''Astoria''' is a [[Port|port city]] and the seat of [[Clatsop County, Oregon]], United States. Founded in 1811, Astoria is the oldest city in the state of Oregon and was the first American settlement west of the [[Rocky Mountains]].{{sfn|Lescroart|2009|p=981}} Astoria is located on the south shore of the [[Columbia River]], where the river meets the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The city is named for [[John Jacob Astor]], an investor from New York City whose [[American Fur Company]] founded [[Fort Astoria]] at the site. Astoria was incorporated by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] on October 20, 1876.&lt;ref name=incorp /&gt;

The city is served by the deepwater Port of Astoria. Transportation includes the [[Astoria Regional Airport]] with [[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]] and [[U.S. Route 101 in Oregon|U.S. Route 101]] as the main highways, and the {{convert|4.1|mi|adj=on}} [[Astoria–Megler Bridge]] connecting to neighboring [[Washington (state)|Washington]] across the river. The population was 9,477 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 census&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census profiles: Oregon cities alphabetically A-C|url=http://www.pdx.edu/sites/www.pdx.edu.prc/files/media_assets/2010_PL94_cities_A-C_updated.pdf|publisher=Portland State University Population Research Center|access-date=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== 19th century ===
The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] spent the winter of 1805–1806 at [[Fort Clatsop]], a small log structure southwest of modern-day Astoria. The expedition had hoped a ship would come by to take them back east, but instead they endured a torturous winter of rain and cold, later returning the way they came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Clark|author2-link=Meriwether Lewis |author2=Meriwether Lewis |title= The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804–1806 |origyear= |edition= Library of Alexandria |year= 2015 |publisher= |isbn= 978-1-613-10310-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NrOUUf7288C&amp;pg=PP1|author1-link=William Clark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the fort has been recreated and is now a [[Lewis and Clark National and State Historical Parks|historical park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History &amp; Culture: Places: Fort Clatsop – ''The National Park Service maintains a replica fort within the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park that is believed to sit on or near the site of the original fort.'' |publisher= National Park Service / U.S. Department of the Interior|access-date=May 12, 2016|url=https://www.nps.gov/lewi/learn/historyculture/histcult-places-focl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, British explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], the first person known to have navigated the [[David Thompson (explorer)#Columbia River travels|entire length]] of the Columbia River, reached the partially constructed [[Fort Astoria]] near the mouth of the river. He arrived just two months after the [[Pacific Fur Company]]'s ship, the ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]''.{{Sfn|Meinig|1995|pages=37–38, 50}} The fort constructed by the Tonquin party established Astoria as a U.S., rather than a British, settlement,{{Sfn|Meinig|1995|pages=37–38, 50}} became a vital post for American exploration of the continent and was later used as an American claim in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] with European nations.

The Pacific Fur Company, a subsidiary of John Jacob Astor's [[American Fur Company]], was created to begin fur trading in the [[Oregon Country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ronda | first= James |title=Astoria &amp; Empire |url= https://archive.org/details/astoriaempire0000rond |url-access= registration |year= 1995 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn= 0-8032-3896-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[War of 1812]], in 1813, the company's officers sold its assets to their Canadian rivals, the [[North West Company]]. The fur trade would remain under British control until U.S. pioneers following the [[Oregon Trail]] began filtering into the town in the mid-1840s. The [[Treaty of 1818]] established joint U.S.&amp;nbsp;– British occupancy of the Oregon Country.&lt;ref name=&quot;US Treaties in Force 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In 1846, the [[Oregon Treaty]] divided the mainland at the [[49th parallel north]], and the southern portion of [[Vancouver Island]] south of this line was awarded to the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canado-American Treaties Text&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2000 |url=http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/ca_us/en/cus.1818.15.en.html |title=Convention of Commerce between His Majesty and the United States of America.—Signed at London, 20th October 1818 |work=Canado-American Treaties |publisher=Université de Montréal |access-date=March 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411212640/http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/ca_us/en/cus.1818.15.en.html |archivedate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Washington Irving]], a prominent American writer with a European reputation, was approached by John Jacob Astor to mythologize the three-year reign of his Pacific Fur Company. ''[[Astoria (book)|Astoria]]'' (1835), written while Irving was Astor's guest, cemented the importance of the region in the American psyche.&lt;ref&gt;In his Introduction to the rambling work, Irving reports that Astor explicitly &quot;expressed a regret that the true nature and extent of his enterprize&lt;!--enterprize in original--&gt;and its national character and importance had never been understood.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In Irving's words, the fur traders were &quot;Sinbads of the wilderness&quot;, and their venture was a staging point for the spread of American economic power into both the continental interior and into the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdRKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA105|title=Collections of the Kansas State Historical Society, Volume 9|date=1906|publisher=Kansas State Historical Society|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Oregon Territory]] grew and became increasingly more colonized by Americans, Astoria likewise grew as a [[Port|port city]] near the mouth of the great river that provided the easiest access to the interior. The first U.S. post office west of the Rocky Mountains was established in Astoria in 1847&lt;ref name=&quot;Oregon Sesquicentennial exhibit online version.pdf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificnorthwestpostalhistorysociety.org/Downloads/OregonTerritorialExhibit/Oregon%20Sesquitennial%20exhibit%20online%20version.pdf |title=Oregon Territorials – Oregon Sesquicentennial exhibit online version.pdf |author= |date=2009 |website= |publisher=Pacific Northwest Postal History Society |access-date=November 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220055006/http://pacificnorthwestpostalhistorysociety.org/Downloads/OregonTerritorialExhibit/Oregon%20Sesquitennial%20exhibit%20online%20version.pdf |archive-date=February 20, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and official state incorporation in 1876.&lt;ref name=incorp /&gt;

Astoria attracted a host of immigrants beginning in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century: [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] settlers, primarily [[Swedes]], Swedish speaking [[Finnish Americans|Finns]] and [[History of Chinese Americans|Chinese]] soon became larger parts of the population. The Nordic settlers mostly lived in Uniontown, near the present-day end of the Astoria–Megler Bridge, and took fishing jobs; the Chinese tended to do [[Salmon cannery|cannery]] work, and usually lived either downtown or in [[bunkhouse]]s near the canneries. By the late 1800s, 22% of Astoria's population was Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.loffe.net/emigration-mainmenu-59/1474-the-swedes-of-oregon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opb.org/news/article/astoria_embraces_chinese_legacy/|title=Astoria Embraces Chinese Legacy|author=Chelsea Gorrow|newspaper= The Daily Astorian | date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNwizCeblKgC&amp;pg=PA38|title = American Swedish Historical Museum: Yearbook 1946|isbn = 9781437950021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883, and again in [[1922 Astoria, Oregon fire|1922]], downtown Astoria was devastated by fire, partly because it was mostly wood and entirely raised off the marshy ground on pilings. Even after the first fire, the same format was used, and the second time around the flames spread quickly again, as collapsing streets took out the water system. Frantic citizens resorted to [[dynamite]], blowing up entire buildings to stop the fire from going further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/O/index.ssf/2010/12/infernos_leave_historic_marks.html | first = John | last= Terry | title = Infernos leave historic marks on Astoria's waterfront | publisher = The Oregonian/OregonLive | date=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEwiCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26| first = Rachel | last= Dresbeck | title = Oregon Disasters: True Stories of Tragedy and Survival |chapter=Chapter 3 – Port Town In Flames – The Astoria Fire – 1922 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | date= Jul 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astoria has served as a port of entry for over a century and remains the trading center for the lower Columbia basin, although it has long since been eclipsed by [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], as an economic hub on the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Astoria's economy centered on fishing, fish processing, and lumber. In 1945, about 30 canneries could be found along the Columbia; however, in 1974, the [[Bumble Bee Foods|Bumble Bee Seafoods]] corporation moved its headquarters out of Astoria and gradually reduced its presence until closing its last Astoria cannery in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=South Tongue Point Land Exchange and Marine Industrial Park Development Project, Clatsop County: Environmental Impact Statement&amp;nbsp;– &quot;...&amp;nbsp;Bumblebee Seafood plant closed in 1982 (Powell, Goss &amp; Associates, 1990).&quot;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDQ3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT106|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wood industry|lumber industry]] likewise declined; Astoria Plywood Mill, the city's largest employer, closed in 1989, and the [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]] discontinued service to Astoria in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/lifestyle/3256316-153/going-goonie-in-astoria| first = John Gottberg | last= Anderson | title = Going &quot;Goonie&quot; in Astoria | publisher = Bend Bulletin | date=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1921 to 1966, a [[Astoria–Megler ferry|ferry route across the Columbia River]] connected Astoria with [[Pacific County, Washington]]. In 1966, the [[Astoria–Megler Bridge]] was opened. The bridge completed [[U.S. Route 101]] and linked Astoria with Washington on the opposite shore of the Columbia, replacing the ferry service.{{Sfn|Smith|1989|p=299}}

Today, tourism, Astoria's growing art scene, and light manufacturing are the main economic activities of the city. Logging and fishing persist, but at a fraction of their former levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://koin.com/2014/10/29/report-astoria-tops-west-coast-fishing-ports/ |title=Report: Astoria tops West Coast fishing ports |publisher=The Associated Press |date=October 29, 2014 |access-date=May 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808204432/http://koin.com/2014/10/29/report-astoria-tops-west-coast-fishing-ports/ |archive-date=August 8, 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a port of call for [[cruise ship]]s since 1982, after $10&amp;nbsp;million in pier improvements to accommodate these larger ships.
