'''Cheddar''' is a large village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Sedgemoor]] district of the English county of [[Somerset]]. It is situated on the southern edge of the [[Mendip Hills]], {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} north-west of [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. The civil parish includes the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] of '''Nyland''' and '''Bradley Cross'''. The parish had a population of 5,755 in 2011 and an acreage of {{convert|8592 |acres}} as of 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheddar CP/AP through time acreage|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&amp;data_cube=N_AREA_ACRES&amp;u_id=10423909&amp;c_id=10001043&amp;add=Y|work=A vision of Britain through time|accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheddar Gorge]], on the northern edge of the village, is the largest [[canyon|gorge]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and includes several [[show cave]]s, including [[Gough's Cave]]. The gorge has been a centre of human settlement since [[Neolithic]] times including a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] palace. It has a temperate climate and provides a unique geological and biological environment that has been recognised by the designation of several [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheddar Gorge and Caves|url=http://www.bristol-link.co.uk/entertainment/cheddar-gorge.htm|publisher=Bristol-link | accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the site of several [[limestone]] [[quarry|quarries]]. The village gave its name to [[Cheddar cheese]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cheddar|volume=6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a centre for [[strawberry]] growing.  The crop was formerly transported on the [[Cheddar Valley line|Cheddar Valley rail line]], which closed in the late 1960s but is now a cycle path. The village is now a major tourist destination with several cultural and community facilities, including the Cheddar Show Caves Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Plan your day |url=https://www.cheddargorge.co.uk/visitor-info/plan-your-day |publisher=Cheddar Gorge and Caves |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village supports a variety of community groups including religious, sporting and cultural organisations. Several of these are based on the site of [[The Kings of Wessex Academy]], which is the largest educational establishment.

== History ==

The name Cheddar comes from the [[Old English]] word ''ceodor'', meaning deep dark cavity or pouch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Atthill |first=Robin |title=Mendip: A new study |year=1976 |page=75 |publisher=David &amp; Charles |location=Newton Abbott |isbn= 0-7153-7297-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence of occupation from the [[Neolithic]] period in Cheddar. Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, [[Cheddar Man]], estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in Cheddar Gorge in 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourist hotspots—Cheddar Gorge&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/naturescalendar/summer/honeypots/cheddar/cheddar_gorge.shtml | title= Tourist hotspots—Cheddar Gorge | work = [[BBC]] |accessdate =12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older remains from the [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Late Palaeolithic]] era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;sher&quot;&gt;

In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.&lt;ref name=&quot;sssi&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The Cheddar Complex | work=English Nature | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003940.pdf | accessdate=17 July 2006|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gorge and caves ===
{{Main article|Cheddar Gorge}}
[[Cheddar Gorge]], which is located on the edge of the village, is the largest [[canyon|gorge]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/may05/Travels0505.html | title= Cheddar Gorge: Not entirely cheesy |date=May 2005 | work= Geotimes, a publication of the American Geological Institute | accessdate=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The gorge is the site of the Cheddar Caves, where [[Cheddar Man]] was found in 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourist hotspots—Cheddar Gorge&quot;/&gt; Older remains from the [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Late Palaeolithic]] era (12,000–13,000 years ago) have been found.&lt;ref name=&quot;sher&quot;/&gt; The caves, produced by the activity of an underground river, contain [[stalactite]]s and [[stalagmite]]s.

Cheddar Gorge, including Cox's Cave, Gough's Cave and other attractions, has become a tourist destination, attracting about 500,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebmc.co.uk/Feature.aspx?id=1843 | title = Access Q&amp;A: Cheddar Gorge | work = British Mountaineering Council | year = 1999 | accessdate =12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2005 poll of ''[[Radio Times]]'' readers, following its appearance on the 2005 television programme ''[[Seven Natural Wonders]]'', Cheddar Gorge was named as the second greatest natural wonder in Britain, surpassed only by the [[Dan yr Ogof]] caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/mid_/4735935.stm |title = Caves win 'natural wonder' vote | work = [[BBC]] | date =2 August 2005 | accessdate =7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sites of Special Scientific Interest ===
[[File:Cheddarreser.JPG|thumb|right|[[Cheddar Reservoir]] at dusk, looking towards the western edge of the [[Mendip Hills]] and [[Crook Peak to Shute Shelve Hill|Crook Peak]]]]
There are several large and unique [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) around the village.

[[Cheddar Reservoir]] is a near-circular artificial reservoir operated by [[Bristol Water]]. Dating from the 1930s, it has a capacity of 135&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;gallons (614,000&amp;nbsp;cubic&amp;nbsp;metres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/cheddar-info.asp |title=Cheddar Reservoir Introduction |publisher=Bristol Water |accessdate=30 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325204405/http://www.bristolwater.co.uk/leisure/cheddar-info.asp |archivedate=25 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reservoir is supplied with water taken from the [[Cheddar Yeo]], which rises in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge and is a tributary of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]]. The inlet grate for the {{convert|54|in|m|1|adj=on}} water pipe that is used to transport the water can be seen next to the [[sensory garden]] in Cheddar Gorge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Axbridge Raw Water Treatment Works|url=http://www.ceequal.co.uk/awards_035.htm|work=Axbridge Raw Water|publisher=CEEQUAL|accessdate=5 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912011706/http://www.ceequal.co.uk/awards_035.htm|archive-date=12 September 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to its wintering waterfowl populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1003948 |title=English Nature SSSI information for Cheddar Reservoir |publisher=[[English Nature]] |accessdate=7 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524222856/http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1003948 |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheddar Wood]] and the smaller Macall's Wood form a [[biological Site of Special Scientific Interest]] from what remains of the wood of the [[Bishops of Bath and Wells]] in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century and of [[Edmund I of England|King Edmund]] the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make [[strawberry]] fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was [[coppice]]d until 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aspects of the medieval landscape of Somerset |last=Aston |first=Michael |authorlink=Mick Aston |year= 1988|publisher=[[Somerset County Council]] |location= |isbn=0-86183-129-2 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of [[calcareous grassland]] and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for [[starved wood-sedge]] (''Carex depauperata'').&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarwoodsssi&quot;/&gt; [[Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum|Purple gromwell]] (''Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum''), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarwoodsssi&quot;/&gt; [[Butterflies]] include [[silver-washed fritillary]] (''Argynnis paphia''), [[dark green fritillary]] (''Argynnis aglaja''), [[pearl-bordered fritillary]] (''Boloria euphrosyne''), [[holly blue]] (''Celastrina argiolus'') and [[brown argus]] (''Aricia agestis''). The [[slug]] ''[[Arion fasciatus]]'', which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the [[soldier beetle]] ''[[Cantharis fusca]]'' also occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarwoodsssi&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Cheddar Wood | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003970.pdf | format= PDF| accessdate=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the largest of the SSSIs is called [[Cheddar Complex]] and covers {{convert|441.3|ha|acre|1}} of the gorge, caves and the surrounding area. It is important because of both biological and geological features. It includes four SSSIs, formerly known as Cheddar Gorge SSSI, August Hole/Longwood Swallet SSSI, GB Cavern Charterhouse SSSI and Charterhouse on-Mendip SSSI.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarcomplexsssi&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=The Cheddar Complex | publisher=[[English Nature]] | url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1003940.pdf | format= PDF| accessdate=17 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partly owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] who acquired it in 1910&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nature and the National Trust|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-nature/w-nature-strategy.htm|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=4 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130222504/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-chl/w-countryside_environment/w-nature/w-nature-strategy.htm|archive-date=30 November 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly managed by the [[Somerset Wildlife Trust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cheddarcomplexsssi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheddar Complex|url=http://www.somersetwildlife.org/cheddar_complex.html|publisher=Somerset Wildlife Trust|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quarries ===
[[File:Batts Combe Quarry from tower.JPG|alt=Exposed stone face of quarry, and buildings|thumb|Batts Combe Quarry from the lookout tower above [[Cheddar Gorge]]]]
Close to the village and gorge are [[Batts Combe quarry]] and [[Callow Rock quarry]], two of the active [[Quarries of the Mendip Hills]] where [[limestone]] is still extracted. Operating since the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, Batts Combe is owned and operated by [[Hanson plc|Hanson Aggregates]]. The output in 2005 was around 4,000 tonnes of limestone per day, one third of which was supplied to an on-site lime kiln, which closed in 2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notice of variation and consolidation with introductory note |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/607057/Variation_Notice.pdf |publisher=Environment Agency |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remainder was sold as coated or dusted aggregates. The limestone at this site is close to 99&amp;nbsp;percent [[carbonate]] of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] ([[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Atthill |first=Robin |authorlink= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_KMwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Atthill%2C+Robin+Mendip%3A+A+new+study&amp;q=99%25#search_anchor |title=Mendip: A new study |year=1976 |pages=22 |publisher=David &amp; Charles |location=Newton Abbott |isbn= 0-7153-7297-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chelmscombe Quarry finished its work as a limestone quarry in the 1950s and was then used by the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]] as a [[tower testing station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West Mendip Quarries|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mendips/more_info/west_mendip_quarries_history.htm|publisher=British Geological Survey|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s it was also used to test the ability of containers of radioactive material to withstand impacts and other accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Dropping a nuclear brick|journal=New Scientist|date=October 1973|volume=60|issue=868|pages=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWRmXO0ut6YC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=National+Tower+Testing+Station+Cheddar#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20Tower%20Testing%20Station%20Cheddar&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 February 2011|author1=Information|first1=Reed Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Cheddar has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=South West England: climate |work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |accessdate=14 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605003222/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ |archivedate= 5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|°C|°F|1}}. [[Temperateness|Seasonal temperature variation]] is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea, which moderates temperature. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately {{convert|21|°C|°F|1}}. In winter mean minimum temperatures of {{convert|1|°C|°F|1}} or {{convert|2|°C|°F|1}} are common.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt; In the summer the [[Azores]] high-pressure system affects the south-west of England. [[Convective]] cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine; annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt; In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by [[Low-pressure area|Atlantic depressions]] or by [[convection]]. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which are most active during those seasons. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around {{convert|700|mm|abbr=on}}. About 8–15 days of snowfall per year is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather&quot;/&gt;

Since the 1880s, Cheddar's other main produce has been the [[strawberry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last= Rendell | first= J. | year= 1973 | title= Economic problems of the protected strawberry crop in south west England | work= Acta Horticulturae | publisher= International Society for Horticultural Science | url= http://www.actahort.org/books/30/30_26.htm |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which is grown on the south-facing lower slopes of the Mendip hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;richardson&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of its use for transporting strawberries to market, the since-closed [[Cheddar Valley line]] became known as ''The Strawberry Line'' after it opened in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files/leaflets/Strawberry%20Line%20leaflet.pdf | format= PDF | publisher= Sustrans | title= The Strawberry Line | accessdate= 25 April 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100326090404/http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files/leaflets/Strawberry%20Line%20leaflet.pdf | archive-date= 26 March 2010 | url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.thestrawberryline.co.uk/d/103/Search_Results.php?doc=62 | title= Archive | publisher= The Strawberry Line | accessdate= 25 April 2010 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111005040858/http://www.thestrawberryline.co.uk/d/103/Search_Results.php?doc=62 | archive-date= 5 October 2011 | url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The line ran from [[Yatton]] to [[Wells, Somerset|Wells]]. When the rest of the line was closed and all passenger services ceased, the section of the line between Cheddar and Yatton remained open for goods traffic. It provided a fast link with the main markets for the strawberries in [[Birmingham]] and London, but finally closed in 1964,&lt;ref name=&quot;daniels&quot;&gt;{{Daniels-NoMore | edition = 3rd | page = 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming part of the Cheddar Valley Railway Nature Reserve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strawberry Line&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestofavon.org/sl.html |title=Strawberry Line |accessdate=23 November 2007 |work=Forest of Avon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landmarks ==
[[File:Cheddar Cross.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of Cheddar Market Cross in the 1890s]]
The [[Market Cross, Cheddar|market cross]] in Bath Street dates from the 15th&amp;nbsp;century, with the shelter having been rebuilt in 1834. It has a central octagonal pier, a socket raised on four steps, a hexagonal shelter with six arched four-centred openings, shallow two-stage buttresses at each angle, and an embattled parapet.

The village is situated on the [[A371 road]] which runs from [[Wincanton]], to [[Weston-super-Mare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A371|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A371|publisher=SABRE|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately {{convert|5|mi|km}} from the route of the [[M5 motorway]] with around a {{convert|10|mi|km}} drive to junction 21 or 22.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS182&quot;&gt;{{cite map |publisher=Ordnance Survey |title= 182 Weston-super-Mare, Bridgwater and Wells |url=http://leisure.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/paper-maps/paper-maps-ordnance-survey-great-britain/paper-maps-ordnance-survey-great-britain-os-landranger-map/weston-super-mare/pid-9780319228609 |format= |edition=C2 |year=2002 |cartography= |scale=1:50000 |series=Landranger |page= |section= |inset= |accessdate=24 February 2011 |isbn=0-319-22782-0 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was on the [[Cheddar Valley line]], a railway line that was opened in 1869 and closed in 1963. It became known as The Strawberry Line because of the large volume of locally-grown [[Strawberry|strawberries]] that it carried. It ran from [[Yatton railway station]] through {{stnlnk|Cheddar}} to [[Wells (Tucker Street) railway station]] and joined the [[East Somerset Railway]] to make a through route via [[Shepton Mallet (High Street) railway station]] to [[Witham (Somerset) railway station|Witham]]. Sections of the now-disused railway have been opened as the Strawberry Line Trail, which currently runs from Yatton to Cheddar. The Cheddar Valley line survived until the &quot;[[Beeching Axe]]&quot;. Towards the end of its life there were so few passengers that diesel [[railcar]]s were sometimes used. The Cheddar branch closed to passengers on 9 September 1963 and to goods in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;daniels&quot;/&gt; The line closed in the 1960s, when it became part of the Cheddar Valley Railway Nature Reserve,&lt;ref name=&quot;Strawberry Line&quot;/&gt; and part of the [[National Cycle Network]] route&amp;nbsp;26. The cycle route also intersects with the West [[Mendip Way]] and various other footpaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movingsomersetforward.co.uk/files/uploads/maps/CheddarWEB.pdf|title=Cycling Map 10 Cheddar and Axbridge|publisher=Moving Somerset Forward|format=PDF|accessdate=30 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305105155/http://www.movingsomersetforward.co.uk/files/uploads/maps/CheddarWEB.pdf|archive-date=5 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
