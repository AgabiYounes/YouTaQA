'''Caelum''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|iː|l|əm}} is a faint [[constellation]] in the [[southern sky]], introduced in the 1750s by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]] and counted among the [[88 modern constellations]]. Its name means “''[[chisel]]''” in [[Latin]], and it was formerly known as '''Caelum Scalptorium''' (“''the engravers’ chisel''”); It is a rare word, unrelated to the far more common Latin ''caelum'', meaning “sky, heaven, atmosphere”.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, Ph.D. and. Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'' Oxford University Press, 1879. Entries for ''caelum'' and ''caelum''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a [[solid angle]] of around 0.038&amp;nbsp;[[steradian]]s, just less than that of [[Corona Australis]].

Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the [[Milky Way]], Caelum is a rather barren constellation, with few objects of interest. The constellation's brightest star, [[Alpha Caeli]], is only of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;4.45, and only one other star, [[Gamma1 Caeli|(Gamma) γ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Caeli]], is brighter than magnitude 5&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;. Other notable objects in Caelum are [[RR Caeli|RR&amp;nbsp;Caeli]], a [[binary star]] with one known planet approximately {{convert|20.13|pc|ly}} away; [[X Caeli|X&amp;nbsp;Caeli]], a [[Delta Scuti variable]] that forms an [[Double star|optical double]] with γ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Caeli; and [[HE0450-2958]], a [[Seyfert galaxy]] that at first appeared as just a [[astrophysical jet|jet]], with no host galaxy visible.

== History ==
Caelum was incepted as one of fourteen southern constellations in the 18th century by [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], a French astronomer and celebrater of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LacailleStarTales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/lacaille.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Lacaille |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate=3 May 2014 |publisher=self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It retains its name ''Burin'' among French speakers, latinized in his catalogue of 1763 as ''Caelum Sculptoris'' (“''Engraver's Chisel''”).&lt;ref&gt; ''Coelum australe stelliferum'', [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille|N. L. de Lacaille]], 1763&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Canis Major, Lepus, Columba Noachi &amp; Cela Sculptoris.jpg|thumb|left|Seen as “Cela Sculptoris” in the lower right of this 1825 star chart from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''|alt=Caelum depicted in ''Urania's Mirror'']]
[[Francis Baily]] shortened this name to ''Caelum'', as suggested by [[John Herschel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CaelumStarTales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/caelum.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Caelum |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate=3 May 2014 |publisher=self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacaille's original chart, it was shown as a pair of engraver's tools: a standard [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and more specific shape-forming [[échoppe]] tied by a ribbon, but came to be ascribed a simple chisel.&lt;ref name=&quot;CaelumStarTales&quot;/&gt; [[Johann Elert Bode]] stated the name as plural with a singular possessor, ''Caela Scalptoris'' &amp;ndash; in German (''die''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;) ''Grabstichel'' (“''the Engraver’s Chisels''”) &amp;ndash; but this did not stick.&lt;ref name=&quot;wagman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Bode: ''Allgemeine Beschreibung und Nachweisung der Gestirne nebst Verzeichniß der geraden Aufsteigung und Abweichung von 17240 Sternen, Doppelsternen, Nebelflecken und Sternhaufen.'' Berlin, 1801, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

== Characteristics ==
Caelum is bordered by [[Dorado]] and [[Pictor]] to the south, [[Horologium (constellation)|Horologium]] and [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]] to the east, [[Lepus (constellation)|Lepus]] to the north, and [[Columba (constellation)|Columba]] to the west. Covering only 125&amp;nbsp;[[square degree]]s, it ranks 81st of the [[88 modern constellations]] in size. 

Its main [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] consists of four stars, and twenty stars in total are brighter than magnitude&amp;nbsp;6.5&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;

The constellation's boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are a 12-sided polygon. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|04|19.5}} and {{RA|05|05.1}} and [[declination]]s of {{dec|−27.02}} to {{dec|−48.74}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Caelum, Constellation Boundary | journal=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cae|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) adopted the three-letter abbreviation “Cae” for the constellation in 1922.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=H. N.| title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]] | volume=30 |pages=469–71 |bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main stars are visible in favourable conditions and with a clear southern horizon, for part of the year as far as about the [[41st parallel north]]&lt;ref name=tirionconst&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ianridpath.com/constellations1.htm | title=Constellations: Andromeda–Indus | work= Star Tales |last=Ridpath |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Ridpath |publisher=self-published | accessdate= 1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|1=While parts technically reach the horizon to observers between 41°N and [[62nd parallel north|62°N]], stars within a few degrees of the horizon are to all intents and purposes unobservable.&lt;ref name=tirionconst/&gt;}}

These stars avoid being engulfed by daylight for some of every day (when above the horizon) to viewers in mid- and well-inhabited higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. Caelum shares with (to the north) Taurus, Eridanus and Orion midnight culmination in December (high summer), resulting in this fact.  In winter (such as June) the constellation can be observed sufficiently inset from the horizons during its rising before dawn and/or setting after dusk as it culminates then at around mid-day, well above the sun.  In South Africa, Argentina, their sub-tropical neighbouring areas and some of Australia in high June the key stars may be traced before dawn in the east; near the equator the stars lose night potential in May to June; they ill-compete with the Sun in northern tropics and sub-tropics from late February to mid-September with March being unfavorable as to post-sunset due to the light of the [[Milky Way]].

Caelum is a faint constellation: It has no star brighter than [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]]&amp;nbsp;4 and only two stars brighter than magnitude&amp;nbsp;5.

Lacaille gave six stars [[Bayer designations]], labeling them Alpha (α&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;) to Zeta (ζ&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;) in 1756, but omitted Epsilon (ε&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;) and designated two adjacent stars as Gamma (γ&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Johann Elert Bode|Bode]] extended the designations to Rho (ρ&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;) for other stars, but most of these have fallen out of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;wagman&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Wagman  | first = Morton  | year = 2003  | title = Lost Stars: Lost, Missing, and Troublesome Stars from the Catalogues of Johannes Bayer, Nicholas Louis de Lacaille, John Flamsteed, and Sundry Others | publisher = The McDonald &amp; Woodward Publishing Company | location = [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg, VA]]  | isbn = 978-0-939923-78-6 |pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caelum is too far south for any of its stars to bear [[Flamsteed designation]]s.{{efn|1=Southern constellations such as Caelum have no Flamsteed designations because Flamsteed only catalogued stars that were visible from England,.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starnames&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kaler |first1=J.
