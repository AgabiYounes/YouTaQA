The CLP first fielded candidates at the [[1975 Australian federal election|1975 federal election]], winning one seat in the Senate and the non-voting seat in the House of Representatives. Since 1979, the CLP has been formally affiliated with both the federal [[Liberal Party of Australia]] and the [[National Party of Australia]] (previously the Country Party and National Country Party).

Currently, the CLP has one representative in federal parliament, [[Australian Senate|Senator]] [[Nigel Scullion]], who also serves as the Senate leader of the National Party.

At the [[2008 Northern Territory general election|2008 election]] it increased its numbers, winning 11 seats.

The CLP returned to office following the [[2012 Northern Territory general election|2012 election]], winning 16 of 25 seats, and leader [[Terry Mills (Australian politician)|Terry Mills]] became [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]]. Less than a year later, Mills was replaced as Chief Minister and CLP leader by [[Adam Giles]] at the [[Country Liberal Party leadership spill, 2013|2013 CLP leadership ballot]] on 13 March.

Multiple defections saw the CLP reduced to [[minority government]] a few months later.

Finocchiaro became CLP leader and leader of the opposition on 1 February 2020.

==History==
===Origins===
The Territory Country Party members first contested the [[1919 Australian federal election|1919 federal election]], with a newly established federal [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] contesting the [[1922 Australian federal election|1922 federal election]]. The 1922 election saw the main opposition party to the Australian Labor Party, the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] deprived of a majority, and were required to form a coalition in order to command a majority on the floor of parliament. The price for such support was the resignation of Nationalist (ex-Labor) Prime Minister, [[Billy Hughes]], who was replaced by [[Stanley Bruce]].

In 1922, the federal [[Division of Northern Territory]] was created, with one non-voting Member in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=DocumentingDemocracy&gt;Documenting Democracy: [http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html Northern Territory Representation Act 1922 (Cth)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331140907/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-63.html |date=31 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold George Nelson]] was the inaugural member serving between 16 December 1922 and 15 September 1934. He was elected as an Independent but later joined the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP). Between 15 September 1934 and 10 December 1949 the [[Division of Northern Territory]] was held by [[Adair Blain]], an independent member. Between 10 December 1949 and 31 October 1966 the Division was held by [[Jock Nelson]], a member of the ALP. The Territory seat was won by the Country Party's [[Sam Calder]] at the [[1966 Australian federal election|1966 federal election]], who held the seat from 26 November 1966 to 19 September 1980.

In 1966, the Country Party was established in the Northern Territory, while the Liberal Party was a small party. In recognition of this, the local Liberals supported the Country Party's Calder for the sole NT seat from 1969 to 1972. An alliance had formed, primarily against the conservatives' main opponent, the ALP.  After the gradual extension of limited voting rights, in 1968 the federal Coalition government gave the Member for Northern Territory full voting rights.&lt;ref name=DocumentingDemocracy /&gt;

===Foundation and electoral record===
After the [[1974 Australian federal election|1974 federal election]] and the subsequent [[Joint Sitting, Australian parliament, 1974|Joint Sitting of parliament]], legislation was passed to give the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the Northern Territory representation in the [[Australian Senate]], with two senators being elected.

The [[Whitlam Government]] passed legislation in 1974 to establish a fully elected [[unicameral]] [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] to replace the previous partly elected [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]], which had been in existence since 1947. The term of the Legislative Assembly was four years. Initially, the Legislative Assembly consisted of 19 members, which was increased in 1982 to 25 members, the present number. The Northern Territory was granted self-government in 1978.

Following the creation of the Legislative Assembly in 1974, the Territory's branches of the Country and Liberal parties merged to form the &quot;Country Liberal Party&quot; (CLP) to field candidates at the [[1974 Northern Territory general election|1974 general election]] for the Legislative Assembly,&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.curriculum.edu.au&quot;/&gt; going on to win 17 out of 19 seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansford2014&quot;/&gt; Calder was largely responsible for the push to unite the non-Labor forces in the Territory.

The CLP fielded candidates at the [[1975 Australian federal election|1975 federal election]], winning one seat each in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. Since 1979, the CLP has been formally affiliated with both the federal National (previously the Country Party and National Country Party) and Liberal parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansford2014&quot;/&gt; The CLP contests seats for the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] in the Northern Territory rather than the Liberal or National parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The CLP has full voting rights within the National Party, and observer status with the Liberal Party.

The CLP governed the Northern Territory from 1974 until the [[2001 Northern Territory general election|2001 election]]. During this time, it never faced more than nine opposition members. Indeed, the CLP's dominance was so absolute that its internal politics were seen as a bigger threat than any opposition party.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Green|Green, Antony]]. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nt/2005/guide/summary.htm 2005 election summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906125850/http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nt/2005/guide/summary.htm |date=6 September 2013 }}. [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]], 2005-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; This was especially pronounced in the mid-1980s, when a series of party-room coups resulted in the Territory having three Chief Ministers in four years.

===2001–2011: In opposition===
At the [[2001 Northern Territory general election|2001 election]] the Australian Labor Party won government by one seat, ending 27 years of CLP government.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.curriculum.edu.au&quot;/&gt; The loss marked a major turning point in Northern Territory politics, a result which was exacerbated when, at the [[2005 Northern Territory general election|2005 election]], the ALP won the second-largest majority government in the history of the Territory, reducing the once-dominant party to just four members in the Legislative Assembly. This result was only outdone by the 1974 election, in which the CLP faced only two independents as opposition.  The CLP even lost two seats in [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]], an area where the ALP had never come close to winning any seats before.

In the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001 federal election]], the CLP won the newly formed seat of [[Division of Solomon|Solomon]], based on Darwin/Palmerston, in the House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlisle2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rodney P. Carlisle|title=Encyclopedia of Politics: The Left and the Right|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bpx2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA535|year=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6531-5|page=535}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]], the CLP held one seat in the House of Representatives, and one seat in the Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansford2014&quot;/&gt; The CLP lost its federal lower house seat in the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansford2014&quot;/&gt; but regained it when Palmerston deputy mayor [[Natasha Griggs]] won back Solomon for the CLP. She sat with the Liberals in the House.

The [[2008 Northern Territory general election|2008 election]] saw the CLP recover from the severe loss it suffered three years earlier, increasing its representation from four to 11 members. Following the 2011 decision of ALP-turned-independent member [[Alison Anderson]] to join the CLP, this increased CLP's representation to 12 in the Assembly, leaving the incumbent Henderson Government to govern in minority with the support of Independent MP [[Gerry Wood]].

Historically, the CLP has been particularly dominant in the Territory's two major cities, [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]/Palmerston and [[Alice Springs]]. However, in recent years the ALP has pulled even with the CLP in the Darwin area; indeed, its 2001 victory was fueled by an unexpected swing in Darwin.

===2012 return to office===
{{main|Northern Territory general election, 2012}}
The CLP under the leadership of [[Terry Mills (Australian politician)|Terry Mills]] returned to power in the [[2012 Northern Territory general election|2012 election]] with 16 of 25 seats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Antony|title=Final Figures for 2012 Northern Territory Election|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/09/northern-territory-election-updates.html|publisher=ABC|accessdate=2 September 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110823032733/http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2012/09/northern-territory-election-updates.html|archivedate=23 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; defeating the incumbent Labor Government led by [[Paul Henderson (politician)|Paul Henderson]]. In the lead up to the Territory election, CLP Senator [[Nigel Scullion]] sharply criticised the [[Gillard Government|Federal Labor Government]] for its suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia - an economic mainstay of the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kristy O'Brien |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-12/politicians-link-suicides-to-cattle-export-ban/4256526 |title=Politicians link suicides to cattle export ban |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2012-09-12 |accessdate=2016-09-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031013826/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-12/politicians-link-suicides-to-cattle-export-ban/4256526 |archivedate=31 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election victory ended 11 years of ALP rule in the Northern Territory. The victory was also notable for the support it achieved from [[indigenous Australians|indigenous people]] in pastoral and remote electorates. Large swings were achieved in remote Territory electorates (where the indigenous population comprised around two-thirds of voters) and a total of five Aboriginal CLP candidates won election to the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/indigenous-vote-decided-outcome-in-the-territory/story-e6frgd0x-1226479040753 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922011057/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/indigenous-vote-decided-outcome-in-the-territory/story-e6frgd0x-1226479040753 |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the indigenous candidates elected were high-profile Aboriginal activist [[Bess Price]] and former ALP member [[Alison Anderson]]. Anderson was appointed Minister for Indigenous Advancement. In a nationally reported speech in November 2012, Anderson condemned welfare dependency and a culture of entitlement in her first ministerial statement on the status of Aboriginal communities in the Territory and said the CLP would focus on improving education and on helping create real jobs for indigenous people.&lt;ref name=&quot;theaustralian.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/indigenous/my-people-must-grow-up-alison-anderson/story-fn9hm1pm-1226508746330|title=Subscribe to The Australian - Newspaper home delivery, website, iPad, iPhone &amp; Android apps|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202020706/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/indigenous/my-people-must-grow-up-alison-anderson/story-fn9hm1pm-1226508746330|archivedate=2 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 27 August Territory election, the CLP was swept from power in a massive Labor landslide, suffering easily the worst defeat of a sitting government in Territory history.  The party not only lost all of the bush seats it picked up in 2012, but was all but shut out of Darwin/Palmerston, winning only one seat there.  All told, the CLP only won two seats, easily its worst showing in an election.  Giles himself lost his own seat, becoming the second Majority Leader/Chief Minister to lose his own seat.  Even before Giles' defeat was confirmed, second-term MP [[Gary Higgins]]—the only surviving member of the Giles cabinet—was named the party's new leader, with [[Lia Finocchiaro]] as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-02/gary-higgins-becomes-country-liberals-new-leader-in-nt/7810772 | title=Gary Higgins becomes Country Liberals' new leader, Lia Finnochiaro his deputy | work=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=2 September 2016 | accessdate=2 September 2016 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903130953/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-02/gary-higgins-becomes-country-liberals-new-leader-in-nt/7810772 | archivedate=3 September 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 2020, Higgins announced his resignation as party leader and announced his retirement at the next election. Finocchiaro succeeded him as CLP leader and leader of the opposition on 1 February 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finocchiaro&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vivian |first1=Steve |title=Country Liberal Party &quot;100 per cent&quot; behind new leader Lia Finocchiaro |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-20/gary-higgins-resigns-as-clp-leader-ahead-of-2020-nt-election/11882108 |accessdate=5 February 2020 |work=ABC News |date=20 January 2020 |language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The CLP stands for office in the Northern Territory Assembly and [[Federal Parliament of Australia]] and primarily concerns itself with representing Territory interests. It is a regionally based party, that has parliamentary representation in both the Federal Parliament and at the Territory level. It brands as a party with strong roots in the Territory.

The CLP competes against the [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)]] (the local branch of Australia's [[social democracy|social-democratic]] party). It is closely affiliated with, but is independent from the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] (a mainly urban, pro-private enterprise party comprising mainly [[liberalism|liberal]] membership) and the [[National Party of Australia]] (a conservative-liberal [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and regional interests party).&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.curriculum.edu.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.curriculum.edu.au/parties_countrylib.htm |title=Parliament @ Work - The Country Liberal Party (CLP) |publisher=Parliament.curriculum.edu.au |accessdate=2016-09-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218171746/http://www.parliament.curriculum.edu.au/parties_countrylib.htm |archivedate=18 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party promotes traditional Liberal Party values such as [[individualism]] and [[private enterprise]], and what it describes as &quot;progressive&quot; political policy such as [[Proposed Northern Territory statehood|full statehood]] for the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.curriculum.edu.au&quot;/&gt;

==Organisation==
Branch delegates and members of the party's Central Council attend the Annual Conference of the Country Liberal Party to decide the party's platform. The Central Council is composed of the party's office bearers, its leaders from the Territory Assembly and the Federal Parliament and representatives of party branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.curriculum.edu.au&quot;/&gt;

The Annual Conference of the Country Liberal Party, attended by branch delegates and members of the party's Central Council, decides matters relating to the party's platform and philosophy. The Central Council administers the party and makes decisions on [[pre-selection]]s. It is composed of the party's office bearers, its leaders in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, members in the Federal Parliament, and representation from each of the party's branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.curriculum.edu.au&quot;/&gt;

The CLP president has full voting rights with the National Party and observer status with the Liberal Party. Both the Liberals and Nationals receive Country Liberal delegations at their conventions. After federal elections, the CLP directs its federal members and senators as to which of the two other parties they should sit with in the parliamentary chamber. In practice, CLP House members usually sit with the Liberals, while CLP Senators sit with the Nationals.
