'''Chamaeleon''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|m|iː|l|i|ən}}) is a small [[constellation]] in the southern sky. It is named after the [[chameleon]], a kind of [[lizard]]. It was first defined in the 16th century.

== History ==
[[File:Chameleon Constellation.png|thumb|The constellation Camaeleon (Chamaeleon)  as depicted in [[Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr]]'s ''Atlas Coelestis'', ca. 1742.]]
Chamaeleon was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|p=118}} It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in [[Amsterdam]] by Plancius and [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;!-- The preceding is not covered by Staal (1988) --&gt; [[Johann Bayer]] was the first [[uranography|uranographer]] to put Chamaeleon in a celestial atlas. It was one of many constellations created by European explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries out of unfamiliar Southern Hemisphere stars.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=260}}

{{see also|List of stars in Chamaeleon}}

There are four bright stars in Chamaeleon that form a compact diamond-shape approximately 10 degrees from the [[South Celestial Pole]] and about 15 degrees south of [[Alpha Crucis|Acrux]], along the axis formed by Acrux and [[Gamma Crucis]]. [[Alpha Chamaeleontis]] is a white-hued star of magnitude 4.1, 63 light-years from Earth. [[Beta Chamaeleontis]] is a blue-white hued star of magnitude 4.2, 271 light-years from Earth. [[Gamma Chamaeleontis]] is a red-hued giant star of magnitude 4.1, 413 light-years from Earth. The other bright star in Chamaeleon is [[Delta Chamaeleontis]], a wide [[double star]]. The brighter star is [[Delta2 Chamaeleontis|Delta&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Chamaeleontis]], a blue-hued star of magnitude 4.4. [[Delta1 Chamaeleontis|Delta&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Chamaeleontis]], the dimmer component, is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 5.5. They both lie about 350 light years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|p=118}}

Chamaeleon is also the location of [[Cha 110913]], a unique dwarf star or proto solar system.

In 1999, a nearby [[open cluster]] was discovered centered on the star [[Eta Chamaeleontis|η Chamaeleontis]]. The cluster, known as either
the [[Eta Chamaeleontis cluster]] or Mamajek 1, is 8 million years old, and lies 316 [[light years]] from Earth.{{sfn|Luhman|Steeghs|2004|p=917}}

The constellation contains a number of [[molecular clouds]] (the [[Chamaeleon complex|Chamaeleon dark clouds]]) that are forming low-mass [[T Tauri star]]s. The cloud complex lies some 400 to 600 [[light years]] from Earth, and contains tens of thousands of solar masses of gas and dust. The most prominent cluster of T Tauri stars and young B-type stars are in the Chamaeleon I cloud, and are associated with the reflection nebula [[IC 2631]].

Chamaeleon contains one planetary nebula, [[NGC 3195]], which is fairly faint. It appears in a telescope at about the same apparent size as [[Jupiter]].{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2017|p=118}}
