==History==
[[File:SM Chojnów Zamek ID 593385.jpg|thumb|left|Piast Castle in Chojnów]]
The town is first mentioned in a Latin mediaeval document issued in [[Wrocław]] on February 26, 1253, stating, the Silesian Duke [[Henry III the White|Henry III]] when the town is mentioned under the name Honowo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=26222&amp;from=FBC Historical doccontent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315001239/http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=26222&amp;from=FBC |date=March 15, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georg Korn, &quot;Breslauer Urkundenbuch&quot;, Erster Theil, Breslau, Verlag von Wilhelm Gottlieb Korn 1870, p14.&lt;/ref&gt; Possible the name of nearby Hainau Island.{{source needed|date=February 2020}} The name is of Polish origin, and in more modern records from the 19th century, the Polish name appears as ''Hajnów'',&lt;ref&gt;Józef Lompa, ''Krótki rys jeografii Śląska dla nauki początkowej'', Głogówek 1847, p. 14 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sgk&gt;''Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich'', Tom III, Warsaw, 1882, p. 10 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Haynau'' is the Germanized version of the original Polish name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=26222&amp;from=FBC Haynau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315001239/http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=26222&amp;from=FBC |date=March 15, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement of ''Haynow'' was mentioned in a 1272 deed. It was already called a ''civitas'' in a 1288 document issued by the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] duke [[Henry V, Duke of Legnica|Henry V of Legnica]], and officially received [[town privileges]] in 1333 from Duke [[Bolesław III the Generous]].&lt;ref name=sgk/&gt; It was part of the duchies of [[Duchy of Silesia|Wrocław]], [[Duchy of Głogów|Głogów]] and [[Duchy of Legnica|Legnica]] of fragmented [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]] and remained under the rule of the [[Piast dynasty]] until 1675. Its population was predominantly [[Poles|Polish]].&lt;ref name=cho&gt;{{cite web|url=https://promocja.chojnow.eu/index.php?menu=2&amp;strona=2|title=Historia miasta|website=Chojnow.eu|author=Marta Kociuba|accessdate=7 February 2020|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1292 the first [[castellan]] of Chojnów, Bronisław Budziwojowic, was mentioned. In the 14th and early 15th centuries Chojnów was granted various [[privilege (law)|privileges]], including [[staple right]] and gold mining right, thanks to which it flourished.&lt;ref name=cho/&gt;

The town survived the [[Hussite]]s, who burned almost the entire town center and castle, but it quickly helped recover its former glory. The largest boom Chojnów experienced was in the 16th century, however by the end of that century began to decline due to fires and epidemic, which claimed many victims in 1613. During the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), there was another outbreak in the city, it was occupied by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrians]] and [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]]&lt;ref name=cho/&gt; and in 1642 it was also plundered by the Swedes.&lt;ref name=sgk/&gt; It remained part of the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]]-ruled [[Duchy of Legnica]] until its dissolution in 1675, when it was incorporated to [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]]-ruled [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]].

In the 18th century, cloth production developed and a clothmaking school was established in the town.&lt;ref name=cho/&gt; One of two main routes connecting [[Warsaw]] and [[Dresden]] ran through the town in the 18th century and Kings [[Augustus II the Strong]] and [[Augustus III of Poland]] traveled that route numerous times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dresden-warszawa.eu/pl/prolog/informacja-historyczna/|title=Informacja historyczna|website=Dresden-Warszawa|accessdate=7 February 2020|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1740 the town was captured by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and subsequently annexed in 1742. In 1804 it suffered a flood.&lt;ref name=cho/&gt; During the [[Napoleonic wars]] there were more epidemics. In 1813 in Chojnów, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] issued instructions regarding the reorganization of the 8th Polish Corps of Prince [[Józef Poniatowski]]. The event is commemorated by a plaque in the facade of the Piast Castle. A railway line was opened in the 19th century. [[Sewerage|Sewer]], [[Gas light]]ing a Newspaper and a hospital soon followed as the towns economy improved.

The city was not spared in [[World War II]], with 30% of the town being destroyed on February 10, 1945 when Soviet [[Red Army]] troops took the abandoned town.&lt;ref name=cho/&gt; After World War II and the implementation of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in 1945, the town passed to the [[People's Republic of Poland|Republic of Poland]]. It was repopulated by Poles, expelled from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]]. In 1946 it was renamed ''Chojnów'', a more modern version of the old Polish ''Hajnów''. Also Greeks, [[refugees of the Greek Civil War]], settled in Chojnów.&lt;ref&gt;Mieczysław Wojecki, ''Ludność grecko-macedońska na Dolnym Śląsku'', &quot;Śląski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sobótka&quot;, No. 1/1980, p. 95-96 (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;
