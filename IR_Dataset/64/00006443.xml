'''Ceuta''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|s|j|uː|t|ə|}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|s|eɪ|uː|t|ə}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LPD|3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|ˈθeuta|lang}}; {{lang-ber|Sebta|script=Latn}}; {{lang-ar|سبتة|Sabtah}}) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Autonomous communities of Spain#Autonomous cities|autonomous city]] on the north coast of [[Africa]].

Bordered by [[Morocco]], it lies along the boundary between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and is one of nine populated Spanish territories in Africa and, along with [[Melilla]], one of two populated Spanish territories on mainland Africa. It was part of [[province of Cádiz]] until 14 March 1995. On that date [[Statute of Autonomy|Statutes of Autonomy]] were passed for both Ceuta and Melilla.

Ceuta, like Melilla and the [[Canary Islands]], was classified as a [[free port]] before Spain joined the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrer-Gallardo|first=Xavier|title=The Spanish–Moroccan border complex: Processes of geopolitical, functional and symbolic rebordering|journal=Political Geography|volume=27|issue=3|pages=301–321|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2007.12.004|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its population consists of [[Christians]], [[Muslim]]s and small minorities of [[Sephardic Jews]] and ethnic [[Sindhi Hindus]].

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language. [[Moroccan Darija|Darija Arabic]] is also spoken by the 40–50% of the population who are of Moroccan origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.um.es/tonosdigital/znum12/secciones/Estudios%20U-CEUTA.htm |author=Verónica Rivera |title=IMPORTANCIA Y VALORACIÓN SOCIOLINGÜÍSTICA DEL DARIJA EN EL CONTEXTO DE LA EDUCACIÓN SECUNDARIA PÚBLICA EN CEUTA |language=es |trans-title=Importance and Socio-Linguistic Valuation of Darija in the Context of Public Secondary Education in Ceuta |journal=Revista Electrónica de Estudios Filológicos |volume= |issue=12 |issn=1577-6921 |date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=33 |issue=1 |year=2016 |pages=23–46 |journal=Revista de Filología Románica |issn=0212-999X |doi=10.5209/RFRM.55230 |publisher=Universidad Complutense de Madrid |title=Nacionalismo y representaciones lingüísticas en Ceuta y en Melilla |first=Alicia |location=Madrid |last=Fernández García}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The name '''Abyla''' has been said to have been a [[Punic language|Punic]] name (&quot;Lofty Mountain&quot;{{sfnp|Cauvin &amp; al.|1843}} or &quot;Mountain of [[El (deity)|God]]&quot;) for [[Jebel Musa (Morocco)|Jebel Musa]],{{sfnp|Bonney &amp; al.|1907|p=26}} the southern [[Pillars of Hercules|Pillar of Hercules]].{{sfnp|Smith|1854}} The name of the mountain was in fact ''Habenna'' ({{lang-xpu|𐤀𐤁{{popdf}}𐤍{{popdf}}}}, {{sc|ʾbn}}, &quot;[[Stone]]&quot; or &quot;[[Stele]]&quot;) or ''ʾAbin-ḥīq'' ({{lang|xpu|𐤀𐤁{{popdf}}𐤍𐤇{{popdf}}𐤒}}, {{sc|ʾbnḥq}}, &quot;Rock of the Bay&quot;), in reference to the nearby [[Bay of Benzú]].&lt;ref name=lip&gt;{{harvp|Lipiński|2004|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA422 422–425]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was [[hellenization|hellenized]] variously as ''Ápini'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἄπινι}}),&lt;ref name=lip/&gt; ''Abýla'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀβύλα}}), ''Abýlē'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀβύλη}}),  ''Ablýx'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀβλύξ}}), and ''Abílē Stḗlē'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀβίλη Στήλη}}, &quot;Pillar of Abyla&quot;){{sfnp|Smith|1854}} and in [[Latin]] as Mount Abyla (''{{lang|la|Abyla Mons}}'') or the Pillar of Abyla (''{{lang|la|Abyla Columna}}'').

The settlement below Jebel Musa was later renamed for the seven hills around the site, collectively referred to as the &quot;Seven Brothers&quot;{{sfnp|Smedley &amp; al.|1845|p=49}} ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἑπτάδελφοι|Heptádelphoi}};&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]], ''[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geography]]'', IV.i.5.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|Septem Fratres}}).&lt;ref&gt;In, e.g., [[Pomponius Mela]].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the Roman stronghold at the site took the name &quot;Fort at the Seven Brothers&quot; ({{lang|la|Castellum ad Septem Fratres}}).{{sfnp|Smith|1854}} This was gradually shortened to Septem&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaegi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walter E.

==History==
===Ancient===
[[File:Catedral de la Asunción de Ceuta (11).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Phoenician archeological site, dated to the 7th century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, next to the [[Cathedral of Ceuta]]]]
Controlling access between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] is an important military and commercial [[chokepoint]]. The [[Phoenicians]] realized the extremely narrow isthmus joining the [[Peninsula of Almina]] to the African mainland makes Ceuta eminently defensible and established an outpost there in the early 1st millennium{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. The [[ancient Greek geography|Greek geographers]] record it by variations of &quot;Abyla&quot;, the ancient name of nearby [[Jebel Musa (Morocco)|Jebel Musa]]. Beside Calpe, the other [[Pillars of Hercules|Pillar of Hercules]] now known as the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], the Phoenicians established [[Carteia|Kart]] at what is now [[San Roque, Cádiz|San Roque]], [[Spain]]. Other good anchorages nearby became [[Phoenician colonies|Phoenician]] and then [[Carthaginian Empire|Carthaginian]] ports at what are now [[Tangiers]] and [[Cadiz]].

After [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]]'s [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|destruction]] in the [[Punic Wars]], most of [[northwest Africa]] was left to the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[client state]]s of [[Numidia]] and{{mdash}}around Abyla{{mdash}}[[Mauretania]]. [[Punics|Punic culture]] continued to thrive in what the Romans knew as &quot;Septem&quot;. After the [[Battle of Thapsus]] in 46&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and his heirs began annexing north Africa directly as [[Roman province]]s but, as late as [[Augustus]], most of Septem's [[Berbers|Berber]] residents continued to speak and write in [[Punic language|Punic]].

[[Caligula]] assassinated the Mauretanian king [[Ptolemy of Mauretania|Ptolemy]] in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}40 and seized his kingdom, which [[Claudius]] organized in 42, placing Septem in the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Tingitana]] and raising it to the level of a [[Roman colonia|colony]]. It subsequently [[romanization (cultural)|romanized]] and thrived into the late 3rd century, trading heavily with [[Hispania|Roman Spain]] and becoming well known for its [[salted fish]]. [[Roman road|Roads]] connected it overland with [[Tingis]] (Tangiers) and [[Volubilis]]. Under {{nowrap|[[Theodosius I]]}} in the late 4th century, Septem still had 10,000 inhabitants, nearly all [[Early Christianity|Christian]] [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] speaking [[Latin]] and [[African Romance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Theodore |last=Mommsen |title=The Provinces of the Roman Empire |at=s.v. &quot;Africa&quot; }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
[[File:Interior de los Baños Árabes de Ceuta.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Arab Baths (Ceuta)|Arab Baths of Ceuta]], built between the 11th and 13th centuries.]]
[[File:Murallas_meriníes_de_Ceuta.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Marinid Walls of Ceuta|Marinid Walls]], built by [[Abu Sa'id Uthman II]] in 1328.]]
[[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], probably invited by [[Bonifacius|Count Boniface]] as protection against the [[Galla Placidia|empress dowager]], crossed the strait near Tingis around 425 and swiftly overran Roman North Africa. Their king [[Gaiseric]] focused his attention on the rich lands around [[Carthage]]; although the Romans eventually accepted his conquests and he continued to raid them anyway, he soon lost control of Tingis and Septem in a series of Berber revolts. When [[Justinian I|Justinian]] decided to [[Vandal War|reconquer the Vandal lands]], his victorious general [[Belisarius]] continued along the coast, making Septem an [[Hispania#Byzantine reconquest|outpost]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] around 533. Unlike the Roman administration, however, the Byzantines did not push far into hinterland and made the more defensible Septem their regional capital in place of Tingis.

[[Plague of Justinian|Epidemics]], less capable successors, and overstretched supply lines forced a retrenchment and left Septem isolated. It is likely that its [[comes|count]] (''{{lang|la|comes}}'') was obliged to pay homage to the [[Visigoth Kingdom]] in Spain in the early 7th century. There are no reliable contemporary accounts of the end of the [[Islamic conquest of the Maghreb]] around 710. Instead, the rapid [[Muslim conquest of Spain]] produced [[medieval romance|romances]] concerning [[Count Julian]] of Septem and his betrayal of Christendom in revenge for the dishonor that befell his daughter at [[Roderic|King Roderick]]'s court. Allegedly with Julian's encouragement and instructions, the Berber convert and freedman [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] took his garrison from Tangiers across the strait and overran the Spanish so swiftly that both he and his master [[Musa bin Nusayr]] fell afoul of [[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik|a jealous caliph]], who stripped them of their wealth and titles.

After the death of Julian, sometimes also described as a king of the [[Ghomara people|Ghomara Berbers]], Berber converts to Islam took direct control of what they called Sebta. It was then destroyed during [[Berber Revolt|their great revolt]] against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] around 740. Sebta subsequently remained a small village of Muslims and Christians surrounded by ruins until its resettlement in the 9th century by Mâjakas, chief of the Majkasa Berber tribe, who started the short-lived [[Banu Isam]] dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;GibbKramers1994&quot;&gt;{{citation|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen |last=Gibb |author2=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author3=Bernard Lewis |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZXrAAAAMAAJ |year=1994 |publisher=E.J. Brill |page=690 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His great-grandson briefly allied his tribe with the [[Idrisid]]s, but Banu Isam rule ended in 931 when he abdicated in favor of [[Abd ar-Rahman III]], the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph of Cordoba]]. Ceuta reverted to [[Moorish]] [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian rule in 927 along with [[Melilla]], and later [[Tangier]], in 951.

Chaos ensued with the fall of the Spanish Umayyads in 1031. Following this, Ceuta and Muslim Iberia were controlled by successive North African dynasties. Starting in 1084, the [[Almoravid]] Berbers ruled the region until 1147, when the [[Almohad]]s conquered the land. Apart from [[Ibn Hud]]'s rebellion in 1232, they ruled until the Tunisian [[Hafsid]]s established control. The Hafsids' influence in the west rapidly waned, and Ceuta's inhabitants eventually expelled them in 1249. After this, a period of political instability persisted, under competing interests from the [[Kingdom of Fez|kingdoms of Fez]] and [[Kingdom of Granada|Granada]] as well as autonomous rule under the native [[Banu al-Azafi]]. The Fez finally conquered the region in 1387, with assistance from [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]].

On the morning of 21 August 1415, King [[John I of Portugal]] led his sons and their assembled forces in a surprise assault that would come to be known as the [[Conquest of Ceuta]]. The battle was almost anti-climactic, because the 45,000 men who traveled on 200 Portuguese ships caught the defenders of Ceuta off guard and only suffered eight casualties. By nightfall the town was captured. On the morning of August 22, Ceuta was in Portuguese hands. [[Álvaro Vaz de Almada, 1st Count of Avranches]] was asked to hoist what was to become the [[flag of Ceuta]], which is identical to the [[flag of Lisbon]], but in which the coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was added to the center; the original Portuguese flag and [[coat of arms]] of Ceuta remained unchanged, and the modern-day Ceuta flag features the configuration of the [[Flag of Portugal#Portuguese shield|Portuguese shield]].

John's son [[Henry the Navigator]] distinguished himself in the battle, being wounded during the conquest. The looting of the city proved to be less profitable than expected for John I; he decided to keep the city to pursue further enterprises in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Granada y la expansión portuguesa en el Magreb extremo|first=José Enrique|last=López de Coca Castañer|journal=Historia. Instituciones. Documentos|issn=0210-7716|issue=25|year=1998|page=351|publisher=[[Universidad de Sevilla]]|location=Seville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1415 to 1437, [[Pedro de Meneses, 1st Count of Vila Real|Pedro de Meneses]] became the first governor of Ceuta.

The Benemerine sultan started the [[Siege of Ceuta (1418)|1418 siege]] but was defeated by the first governor of Ceuta before reinforcements arrived in the form of [[John, Constable of Portugal]] and his brother [[Henry the Navigator]] who were sent with troops to defend Ceuta.

Under [[John I of Portugal|King John I]]'s son, [[Edward, King of Portugal|Duarte]], the colony at Ceuta rapidly became a drain on the Portuguese treasury. [[Trans-Saharan trade]] journeyed instead to [[Tangier]]. It was soon realized that without the city of [[Tangier]], possession of Ceuta was worthless. In 1437, [[Illustrious Generation (Portugal)|Duarte's brothers]] [[Henry the Navigator]] and [[Fernando, the Saint Prince]] persuaded him to launch an attack on the [[Marinid]] sultanate. The resulting [[Battle of Tangier (1437)]], led by Henry, was a debacle. In the resulting treaty, Henry promised to deliver Ceuta back to the Marinids in return for allowing the Portuguese army to depart unmolested, which he reneged on.

Possession of Ceuta would indirectly lead to further [[History of Portugal (1415–1578)|Portuguese expansion]]. The main area of Portuguese expansion, at this time, was the coast of the [[Maghreb]], where there was grain, cattle, sugar, and textiles, as well as fish, hides, wax, and honey.&lt;ref name=Payne&gt;[http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne10.pdf Payne, Stanley G., ''A History of Spain and Portugal'', Vol.1, Chap.10 &quot;The Expansion&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceuta had to endure alone for 43 years, until the position of the city was consolidated with the taking of [[Ksar es-Seghir]] (1458), [[Arzila]] and [[Tangier]] (1471) by the Portuguese.

The city was recognized as a Portuguese possession by the [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]] (1479) and by the [[Treaty of Tordesilhas]] (1494).

In the 1540s the Portuguese began building the [[Royal Walls of Ceuta]] as they are today including bastions, a navigable moat and a drawbridge. Some of these bastions are still standing, like the bastions of Coraza Alta, Bandera and Mallorquines.&lt;ref name=fortified-places&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceuta|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/ceuta/|website=fortified-places.com|accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luís de Camões]] lived in Ceuta between 1549 and 1551, losing his right eye in battle, which influenced his work of poetry ''[[Os Lusíadas]]''.

===Iberian Union===
In 1578 King [[Sebastian of Portugal]] died at the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]] (known as the Battle of Three Kings) in what is today northern Morocco, without descendants, triggering the [[1580 Portuguese succession crisis]]. His granduncle, the elderly [[Henry I of Portugal|Cardinal Henry]], succeeded him as King, but Henry also had no descendants, having taken holy orders. When the cardinal-king died two years after Sebastian's disappearance, three grandchildren of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] claimed the throne: [[Infanta Catarina, Duchess of Braganza]], [[António, Prior of Crato]], and Philip II of Spain (Uncle of former King [[Sebastian of Portugal]]), who would go on to be crowned King [[Philip I of Portugal]] in 1581, uniting the two crowns and overseas empires known as the [[Iberian Union]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamen177&quot;&gt;*{{cite book |last=Kamen |first=Henry |title=Philip of Spain |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780300078008 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wyWourPR5S8C&amp;pg=PA177 |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed the two kingdoms to continue without being merged.

During the [[Iberian Union]] 1580 to 1640, Ceuta attracted many residents of Spanish origin.&lt;ref name=Griffinh&gt;{{cite book | author=Griffin, H | year=2010 | title=Ceuta Mini Guide | url=http://www.miragebooks.co.uk/ceuta | publisher=Mirage | isbn=978-0-9543335-3-9 | access-date=18 January 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305205916/http://www.miragebooks.co.uk/ceuta | archive-date=5 March 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceuta became the only city of the [[Portuguese Empire]] that sided with Spain when Portugal regained its independence in the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] of 1640.

On 1 January 1668, King [[Afonso VI of Portugal]] recognized the formal allegiance of Ceuta to Spain and formally ceded Ceuta to King [[Carlos II of Spain]] by the [[Treaty of Lisbon (1668)|Treaty of Lisbon]].

The city was attacked by Moroccan forces under [[Moulay Ismail]] during the [[Siege of Ceuta (1694-1727)]]. During the longest siege in history, the city underwent changes leading to the loss of its Portuguese character. While most of the military operations took place around the [[Royal Walls of Ceuta]], there were also small-scale penetrations by Spanish forces at various points on the Moroccan coast, and seizure of shipping in the Strait of Gibraltar.

Disagreements regarding the border of Ceuta resulted in the [[Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–60)]], which ended at the [[Battle of Tétouan|Battle of Tetuán]].

In July 1936, General [[Francisco Franco]] took command of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]] and rebelled against the Spanish republican government; his military uprising led to the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–1939. Franco transported troops to mainland Spain in an airlift using transport aircraft supplied by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Ceuta became one of the first casualties of the uprising: General Franco's rebel nationalist forces seized Ceuta, while at the same time the city came under fire from the air and sea forces of the official republican government.&lt;ref&gt;

When Spain recognized the independence of [[Spanish Morocco]] in 1956, Ceuta and the other {{lang|es|[[plazas de soberanía]]|italic=yes}} remained under Spanish rule. Spain considered them integral parts of the Spanish state, but Morocco has disputed this point.

Culturally, modern Ceuta is part of the Spanish region of [[Andalusia]]. It was attached to the [[province of Cádiz]] until 1925, the Spanish coast being only 20&amp;nbsp;km (12.5 miles) away. It is a cosmopolitan city, with a large ethnic [[Arab people|Arab]] Muslim minority as well as [[Sephardic]] Jewish and [[Hindu]] minorities.&lt;ref&gt;

On 5 November 2007, King [[Juan Carlos I]] visited the city, sparking great enthusiasm from the local population and protests from the Moroccan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/infordeus.php/2007/11/06/p125486 |title=Ceuta y Melilla son España, dice Juan Carlos I; Sebta y Melilia son nuestras, responde Mohamed VI |publisher=Blogs.periodistadigital.com |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=2009-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718140213/http://blogs.periodistadigital.com/infordeus.php/2007/11/06/p125486 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a Spanish head of state had visited Ceuta in 80 years.

Ceuta is part of the territory of the [[European Union]]. The city was a [[free port]] before Spain joined the European Union in 1986. Now it has a low-tax system within the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]]. As of 2018, its population was 85,144.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=La población de Ceuta aumenta en un 0,2% con respecto a 2017 |url=https://elfarodeceuta.es/poblacion-ceuta-2018-cuantos-habitantes-tiene/ |website=El Faro de Ceuta |accessdate=8 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceuta has held elections every four years since 1979, for its 25-seat assembly. The leader of its government was the Mayor until the Autonomy Statute had the title changed to the [[Mayor-President]]. {{as of|2011}}, the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) won 18 seats, keeping [[Juan Jesús Vivas]] as Mayor-President, which he has been since 2001. The remaining seats are held by the regionalist [[Caballas Coalition]] (4) and the [[Socialist Workers' Party (Spain)|Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE, 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2011/municipales/18/ |title=Resultados Electorales en Ceuta: Elecciones Municipales 2011 en EL PAÍS |publisher=EDICIONES EL PAÍS S.L. |date=2011 |language=es |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its small population, Ceuta elects only one member of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]], the lower house of the Spanish legislature. {{As of|November 2019|pre=the}} election, this post is held by María Teresa López of [[Vox (political party)|Vox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2019/11/286616/ceuta-far-right-vox-spanish-elections/|title=Ceuta Votes for Far-Right Vox Party in Spanish General Elections|website=Morocco World News|language=English|date=November 11, 2019|accessdate=January 28, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subdivisions===
Ceuta is subdivided into 63 ''barriadas'' (&quot;neighborhoods&quot;), such as Barriada de Berizu, Barriada de P. Alfonso, Barriada del Sarchal, and El Hacho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200708/20070819/200708195101.html |title=El servicio de Policia de Barriadas podria funcionar a partir del 15 de septiembre |language=es |trans-title=The Police Service of Barriadas could work from September 15 |website=El Pueblo de Ceuta |accessdate=2009-06-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720140539/http://www.elpueblodeceuta.es/200708/20070819/200708195101.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetware.com/i/map/MAR/ceuta-map.jpg |title=Map of Ceuta |website=planetware}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://codigo-postal.info/ceuta/ceuta?page=7 |title=Códigos postales de Ceuta en Ceuta |publisher=Codigo-postal.info |accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dispute with Morocco===

See also: [[Greater Morocco]]

The government of Morocco has repeatedly called for Spain to transfer the sovereignty of Ceuta and [[Melilla]], together with the rest of the Spanish ''plazas de soberanía'' on the North African coast, on the grounds of asserting its territorial integrity. Morocco has claimed the territories are colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Europe or Africa?

(2014) ‘The Spanish-Moroccan relationship: combining bonne entente with territorial disputes’, in K. Stoklosa (ed.) Living on the border. European Border Regions in Comparison (p. 103). Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was originally developed by one of the founders of the Moroccan [[Istiqlal Party]], Alal-El Faasi, who openly advocated the Moroccan conquest of Ceuta and other territories under Spanish rule.&lt;ref&gt;Castan Pinos, J.

[[Lidl]], [[Decathlon Group]] and [[El Corte Inglés]] (hardware) have branches in Ceuta. There is also a [[casino]].
Border trade between Ceuta and Morocco is active because of advantage of tax-free status. Thousands of Moroccan women are involved in porter trade daily. [[Moroccan dirham]] is actually used in such trade, despite the fact that prices are marked in euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.es/20171006/morocco-mule-women-in-back-breaking-trade-from-spain-enclave|title=Morocco 'mule women' in back-breaking trade from Spain enclave|date=2017-10-06|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldfinance.com/markets/separate-from-the-rest|title=The economics of exclaves|date=2018-04-24|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/moroccan-women-used-as-mules-to-avoid-tariffs/av-43736166|title=Moroccan women used as 'mules' to avoid tariffs {{!}} DW {{!}} 11.05.2018|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transport===
The city's [[Port of Ceuta]] receives high numbers of ferries each day from [[Algeciras]] in [[Andalusia]] in the south of Spain, along with Melilla and the Canary Islands. The closest airport is [[Sania Ramel Airport]] in Morocco.

A single road border checkpoint to the south of Ceuta near Fnideq allows for cars and pedestrians to travel between Morocco and Ceuta. An additional border crossing for pedestrians also exists between Benzú and Belyounech on the northern coast. The rest of the border is closed and inaccessible.

There is a bus service throughout the city, and while it does not pass into neighboring Morocco, it services both frontier crossings.

==Demographics==

Due to its location, Ceuta is home to a mixed ethnic and religious population. The two main religious groups are Christians and Muslims. As of 2006 approximately 50% of the population was Christian and approximately 48% Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roa |first=J.

[[Christianity]] has been present in Ceuta continuously from [[late antiquity]], as evidenced by the ruins of a basilica in downtown Ceuta&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/1378720 |title=Ceuta huellas del cristianismo en Ceuta |first=Fernando |last=Villada |website=academia.edu |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accounts of the [[Christian martyrdom|martyrdom]] of [[Daniel and companions|St. Daniel Fasanella]] and his [[Franciscan Order|Franciscans]] in 1227 during the [[Almohad Caliphate]].

The town's Grand Mosque had been built over a [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine-era]] church. In 1415, the year of the city's conquest, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] converted the Grand Mosque into [[Ceuta Cathedral]]. The present form of the cathedral dates to refurbishments undertaken in the late 17th century, combining [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] elements. It was [[Dedication|dedicated]] to [[Saint Mary of the Assumption|St{{nbsp}}Mary of the Assumption]] in 1726.

The [[Roman Catholic]] [[Diocese of Ceuta]] was established in 1417. It incorporated the suppressed [[Diocese of Tanger]] in 1570.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14736a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Tingis |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 July 1912 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Diocese of Ceuta was a [[suffragan]] of [[Patriarchate of Lisbon|Lisbon]] until 1675, when it became a suffragan of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seville|Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dc206|Diocese of Ceuta|21 January 2015}} [[Wikipedia:SPS|{{sup|[''self-published'']}}]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, Ceuta's administration was notionally merged into the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cadiz y Ceuta|Diocese of Cadiz and Ceuta]] as part of [[concordat of 1851|a concordat]] between Spain and the [[Holy See]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03131b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Cadiz |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 November 1908 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the union was not actually accomplished, however, until 1879.

===Education===
The [[University of Granada#Campus located in Ceuta|University of Granada]] offers undergraduate programs at their campus in Ceuta. Like all areas of Spain, Ceuta is also served by the [[National University of Distance Education|National University of Distance Education (UNED)]].

Primary and secondary education is possible only in Spanish however a growing number of schools are entering the Bilingual Education Program.

==Migrants==
{{Main|Ceuta border fence}}
Like [[Melilla#Immigration|Melilla]], Ceuta attracts African migrants who try to use it as an entry to Europe. As a result, the enclave is surrounded by double fences that are {{convert|6|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} high and hundreds of migrants congregate near the fences waiting for a chance to cross them. The fences are regularly stormed by migrants trying to claim asylum once they enter Ceuta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hundreds of migrants storm fence to reach Spanish enclave of Ceuta|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39002111|publisher=BBC|date=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
