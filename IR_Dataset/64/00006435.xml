'''Canes Venatici''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|iː|z|_|v|ᵻ|ˈ|n|æ|t|ᵻ|s|aɪ}} is one of the 88 official modern [[constellation]]s.  It is a small northern constellation that was created by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in the 17th century. Its name is [[Latin]] for &quot;[[hunting dog]]s&quot;, and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of [[Boötes]] the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation. [[Cor Caroli]] is the constellation's brightest star, with an apparent magnitude of 2.9. [[La Superba]] is one  of the reddest stars in the sky and one of the brightest [[carbon star]]s. The [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] is a [[spiral galaxy]] tilted face-on to observers on Earth, and was the first galaxy whose spiral nature was discerned.

==History==
[[Image:Canes Venatici.gif|left|200px|thumb|Canes Venatici depicted in Hevelius's star atlas. Note that, per the conventions of the time, the image is mirrored.]]
[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Bootes, Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices, and Quadrans Muralis.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Canes Venatici can be seen in the orientation they appear to the eyes in this 1825 star chart from ''[[Urania's Mirror]]''.]]
The stars of Canes Venatici are not bright. In classical times, they were listed by [[Ptolemy]] as unfigured stars below the constellation [[Ursa Major]] in his [[star catalogue]].  

In [[Middle Ages|medieval times]], the identification of these stars with the dogs of Boötes arose through a mistranslation.  Some of Boötes's stars were traditionally described as representing the [[Club (weapon)|club]] ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''κολλοροβος, kollorobos'') of Boötes. When the Greek astronomer Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' was translated from Greek to [[Arabic]], the translator [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]] did not know the Greek word and rendered it as a similar-sounding Arabic word for a weapon, writing ''al-`aşā dhāt al-kullāb'' (العصا ذات الكلاب), which means &quot;the spearshaft having a hook&quot;. When the Arabic text was later translated into [[Latin]], the translator [[Gerard of Cremona]] mistook ''kullāb'', meaning &quot;hook&quot;, for ''kilāb'' (which looks the same in unvowelled Arabic text), meaning &quot;dogs&quot;, writing ''hastile habens canes'' (&quot;spearshaft having dogs&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1959|pp=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1974|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|1990|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1533, the German astronomer [[Peter Apian]] depicted Boötes as having two dogs with him.&lt;ref name=apian1&gt;{{Harvnb|Apianus|1533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These spurious dogs floated about the astronomical literature until [[Johannes Hevelius|Hevelius]] decided to specify their presence in the sky by making them a separate constellation in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/canesvenatici.htm |work = Star Tales |title = Canes Venatici |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |accessdate = 9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridpath|2001|pp=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hevelius chose the name ''Asterion'' (from the Greek 'αστέριον, meaning the &quot;little star&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kunitzsch|Smart|2006|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[diminutive]] of 'αστηρ the &quot;star&quot;, or adjective meaning &quot;starry&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allen|1963|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for the northern dog and ''Chara'' (from the Greek χαρά, meaning &quot;joy&quot;) for the southern dog, as ''Canes Venatici'', the Hunting Dogs, in his [[star atlas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hevelius|1690}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his star catalogue, the Czech astronomer [[Antonín Bečvář|Bečvář]] assigned the names ''Asterion'' to β CVn and ''Chara'' to α CVn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bečvář|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Canes Venatici is bordered by [[Ursa Major]] to the north and west, [[Coma Berenices]] to the south, and [[Boötes]] to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union]] in 1922, is &quot;CVn&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pa30_469&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | title=The New International Symbols for the Constellations | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=30 | pages=469–71 | bibcode=1922PA.....30..469R | year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official constellation boundaries, as set by [[Eugène Joseph Delporte|Eugène Delporte]] in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 sides. In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the [[right ascension]] coordinates of these borders lie between {{RA|12|06.2}} and {{RA|14|07.3}}, while the [[declination]] coordinates are between +27.84° and +52.36°.&lt;ref name=&quot;boundary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Canes Venatici, Constellation Boundary | work=The Constellations | publisher=International Astronomical Union | url=http://www.iau.org/public/constellations/#cvn | accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covering 465 square degrees, it ranks 38th of the 88 constellations in size.

Canes Venatici contains no bright stars, [[Alpha Canum Venaticorum|Alpha]] and [[Beta Canum Venaticorum]] being only of 3rd and 4th [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] respectively. Flamsteed catalogued 25 stars in the constellation, labelling them 1 to 25 Canum Venaticorum, however 1 turned out to be in Ursa Major, 13 was in Coma Berenices, and 22 did not exist.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=366}}

*Alpha Canum Venaticorum, also known as Cor Caroli (&quot;heart of Charles&quot;), is the constellation's brightest [[star]], named by Sir [[Charles Scarborough]] in memory of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the deposed king of Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to R. H. Allen (''Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning''), the star was named by Halley for Charles II &quot;at the suggestion of the court physician Sir Charles Scarborough, who said it had shone with special brilliance on the eve of the king's return to London, May 29, 1660&quot;. According to Deborah J. Warner (''The Sky Explored: Celestial Cartography 1500-1800''), it was originally named &quot;Cor Caroli Regis Martyris&quot; (&quot;The Heart of King Charles the Martyr&quot;) for Charles I. According to Robert Burnham, Jr. (''Burnham's Celestial Handbook'', Volume 1), &quot;the attribution of the name to Halley appears in a report published by [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann Bode]] at Berlin in 1801, but seems to have no other verification&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Legend has it that α CVn was brighter than usual during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], as [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] returned to England to take the throne. Cor Caroli is a wide [[double star]], with a primary of magnitude 2.9 and a secondary of magnitude 5.6; the primary is 110 light-years from Earth. The primary also has an unusually strong variable magnetic field.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;
*[[Beta Canum Venaticorum]], or Chara, is a yellow-hued [[main sequence star]] of magnitude 4.2, 27 light-years from Earth. Its common name comes from the word for &quot;joy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;
*[[Y Canum Venaticorum]] ([[La Superba]]) is a [[semiregular variable star]] that varies between magnitudes 5.0 and 6.5 over a period of around 158 days.  It is a [[carbon star]] and is deep red in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;
*[[AM Canum Venaticorum]], a very blue star of magnitude 14, is the prototype of a special class of [[cataclysmic variable star]]s, in which the companion star is a [[white dwarf]], rather than a [[main sequence star]].
*[[RS Canum Venaticorum]] is the prototype of a [[RS Canum Venaticorum variable|special class of binary stars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite simbad |title = V* RS CVn |accessdate = 9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[chromosphere|chromospherically]] active and optically [[variable star|variable]] components.
*[[R Canum Venaticorum]] is a Mira variable that ranges between magnitudes 6.5 and 12.9 over a period of approximately 329 days.

===Supervoid===

The [[Giant Void]], an extremely large [[void (astronomy)|void]] (part of the universe containing very few galaxies) is within the vicinity of this constellation. It may be possibly the [[List of largest cosmic structures#List of largest known voids|largest void]] ever discovered, slightly larger than the [[CMB cold spot|Eridanus Supervoid]] and 1,200 times the volume of expected typical voids. It was discovered in 1988 in a deep-sky survey.

===Deep-sky objects===

Canes Venatici contains five [[Messier object]]s, including four [[galaxy|galaxies]]. One of the more significant galaxies in Canes Venatici is the [[Whirlpool Galaxy]] (M51, NGC 5194) and [[NGC 5195]], a small barred [[spiral galaxy]] that is seen face on. This was the first galaxy recognised as having a spiral structure, this structure being first observed by [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] in 1845.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; It is a face-on spiral galaxy 37 million light-years from Earth. Widely considered to be one of the most beautiful galaxies visible, M51 has many [[star formation|star-forming regions]] and [[nebula]]e in its arms, coloring them pink and blue in contrast to the older yellow core. M51 has a smaller companion, NGC 5195, that has very few star-forming regions and thus appears yellow. It is passing behind M51 and may be the cause of the larger galaxy's prodigious star formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Other notable spiral galaxies in Canes Venatici are the [[Sunflower Galaxy]] (M63, NGC 5055), [[Messier 94|M94]] (NGC 4736), and [[Messier 106|M106]] (NGC 4258). M63, the Sunflower Galaxy, was named for its appearance in large amateur telescopes. It is a spiral galaxy with an integrated magnitude of 9.0. M94 is a small face-on spiral galaxy with an approximate magnitude of 8.0, about 15 million light-years from Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; [[NGC 4631]] is a barred spiral galaxy, which is one of the largest and brightest edge-on galaxies in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, Stephen James: The Caldwell Objects, Sky Publishing Corporation {{ISBN|0-933346-97-2}} page 126&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Messier 3|M3]] (NGC 5272) is a [[globular cluster]] 32,000 light-years from Earth.  It is 18' in diameter, and at magnitude 6.3 is bright enough to be seen with [[binoculars]]. It can even be seen with the naked eye under particularly dark skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;

M94, also classified as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms and a bright core. The outskirts of the galaxy are incredibly luminous in the [[ultraviolet]] because of a ring of [[star formation|new stars]] surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are not sure what has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a [[barred spiral galaxy|bar]] that is thus far invisible.&lt;ref name=&quot;objects&quot;/&gt;
