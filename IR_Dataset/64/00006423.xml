The '''calorie''' is a [[unit of energy]] widely used in [[nutrition]].&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;and&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=How many calories do adults need? |url=https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/dietary-guidelines-and-myplate/how-many-calories-do-adults-need |website=eatright.org |publisher=Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics |accessdate=10 February 2020 |date=1 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For historical reasons, two main definitions of '''calorie''' are in wide use. The '''small calorie''' or '''gram calorie''' (usually denoted '''cal''') is the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of one ''[[gram]]'' of water by one degree [[Celsius]] (or one [[kelvin]]). &lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;/&gt;  The '''large calorie''', '''food calorie''', or '''kilocalorie''' ('''Cal''', '''calorie''' or '''kcal''') is the amount of heat needed to cause the same increase in one ''[[kilogram]]'' of water.&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;    Thus, 1 kilocalorie (kcal) = 1000 calories (cal). By convention in [[food science]], the large calorie is commonly called '''calorie'''&lt;ref name=and/&gt; (with a capital C by some authors) to distinguish from the smaller unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, labels of industrialized food products are required to indicate the nutritional energy value in (kilo or large) calories per serving or per weight.

Calorie relates directly to the [[metric system]], and therefore to the [[International System of Units|SI system]]. It is regarded as obsolete within the scientific community, since the adoption of the SI system, but is still in some use.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt; The SI unit of energy is the [[joule]], with symbol &quot;J&quot;: one small calorie is defined as exactly 4.184 J; one large calorie is 4184 J.

==History==
The calorie was first introduced by [[Nicolas Clément]], as a unit of [[heat]] energy, in lectures during the years 1819&amp;ndash;1824.  This was the &quot;large&quot; calorie, viz. modern kilocalorie.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hargrove&quot;&gt;
JL Hargrove, &quot;History of the calorie in nutrition&quot;, ''J Nutr'' 136/12 (December 2006), pp. 2957&amp;ndash;2961.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. It comes {{ety|la|calor|heat}}.

The &quot;small&quot; calorie (modern calorie) was introduced by Pierre Antoine Favre (Chemist) and Johann T. Silbermann (Physicist) in 1852. 
In 1879,  [[Marcellin Berthelot]] distinguished between gram-calorie (modern calorie) and kilogram-calorie (modern kilocalorie).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hargrove&quot;/&gt; Berthelot also introduced the convention of capitalizing the kilogram-calorie, as ''Calorie''.

The use of the kilogram-calorie (kcal) for nutrition was introduced to the American public by [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]], a professor at [[Wesleyan University]], in 1887.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;

The modern calorie (cal) was first recognized as a unit of the [[cm-g-s system]] (cgs) in 1896,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hargrove&quot;/&gt;
alongside the already-existing cgs unit of energy, the [[erg]] (first suggested by Clausius in 1864, under the name ''ergon'', and officially adopted in 1882).

Already in 1928 there were serious complaints about the possible confusion arising from the two main definitions of the calorie and whether the notion of using the capital letter to distinguish them was sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/121058d0
|accessdate=November 9, 2019
|title=The Two Calories, Percy L. Marks
|date=January 14, 1928}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Use of the calorie was officially deprecated by the ninth [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]], in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/9/3/ ''9th CGPM, Resolution 3: Triple point of water; thermodynamic scale with a single fixed point; unit of quantity of heat (joule).''], ''bipm.org.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternate spelling ''calory'' is archaic.

==Definitions==
The modern (small) calorie is defined as the amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of 1&amp;nbsp;gram of water by 1&amp;nbsp;°C (or 1&amp;nbsp;K, which is the same increment).&lt;ref name=&quot;cambridge&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford&quot;/&gt;
The definition depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature. Accordingly, several different precise definitions of the calorie have been used.

:{{Anchor|Note a}} (a) The 'Thermochemical calorie' was defined by Rossini simply as 4.1833 international joules in order to avoid the difficulties associated with uncertainties about the heat capacity of water.  It was later redefined as 4.1840 J exactly.&lt;ref name=FAO/&gt;
:{{Anchor|Note b}} (b) The figure depends on the conversion factor between &quot;international joules&quot; and &quot;absolute&quot; (modern, SI) joules. Using the mean international ohm and volt ({{val|1.00049|u=Ω}}, {{val|1.00034|u=V}}&lt;ref name=iupac/&gt;), the &quot;international joule&quot; is about {{val|1.00019|u=J}}, using the US international ohm and volt ({{val|1.000495|u=Ω}}, {{val|1.000330|u=V}}) it is about {{val|1.000165|u=J}}, giving {{val|4.18684}} and {{val|4.18674|u=J}}, respectively.
:{{Anchor|Note c}} (c) The [[standard atmospheric pressure]] can be taken to be {{val|101.325|u=kPa}}.

The two definitions most common in older literature appear to be the ''15&amp;nbsp;°C calorie'' and the ''thermochemical calorie''. Until 1948, the latter was defined as 4.1833 international joules; the current standard of 4.184&amp;nbsp;J was chosen to have the new thermochemical calorie represent the same quantity of energy as before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rossini&quot;/&gt;

The calorie was first defined specifically to measure energy in the form of heat, especially in experimental [[calorimetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/calculating-calories-by-burning-gummy-bears-to-death/|title=Calculating Calories by Burning Gummy Bears to Death|magazine=Scientific American|first=Rhett|last=Allain|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
  The [[joule]] was adopted as equivalent to {{val|e=7|u=erg}} in 1889.
--&gt;

==Nutrition==
{{Main|Food energy}}
In a nutritional context, the [[kilojoule]] (kJ) is the [[SI]] unit of food energy, although the ''calorie'' is commonly used.&lt;ref name=and/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prospects improve for food energy labelling using SI units|url=http://metricviews.org.uk/2012/02/prospects-improve-for-food-energy-labelling-using-si-units/|work=Metric Views|publisher=[[UK Metric Association]]|accessdate=17 April 2013|date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SI Conventions |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/measurement-units/si-conventions/ |accessdate=8 February 2016 |publisher=[[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''calorie'' is commonly used with the number of kilocalories (kcal) of nutritional energy measured.&lt;ref name=and/&gt;

To facilitate comparison, [[specific energy]] or energy density figures are often quoted as &quot;calories per serving&quot; or &quot;kcal per 100&amp;nbsp;g&quot;. A nutritional requirement or consumption is often expressed in calories or kcal per day. One gram of fat in food contains nine kcal, while a gram of either a [[carbohydrate]] or a [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]] contains approximately four kcal.&lt;ref name=SciAm /&gt; Alcohol in a food contains seven kcal or calories per gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutristrategy.com/nutrition/calories.htm|title=Calories - Fat, Protein, Carbohydrates, Alcohol. Calories per gram|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
In other scientific contexts, the term ''calorie'' almost always refers to the small calorie. Even though it is not an SI unit, it is still used in chemistry. For example, the energy released in a [[chemical reaction]] per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of reagent is occasionally expressed in [[kilocalorie per mole|kilocalories per mole]].&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt; Typically, this use was largely due to the ease with which it could be calculated in laboratory reactions, especially in [[aqueous solution]]: a volume of reagent dissolved in water forming a solution, with concentration expressed in moles per litre (1 litre weighing 1&amp;nbsp;kilogram), will induce a temperature change in degrees Celsius in the total volume of water solvent, and these quantities (volume, molar concentration and temperature change) can then be used to calculate energy per mole. It is also occasionally used to specify energy quantities that relate to reaction energy, such as [[bond energy|enthalpy of formation]] and the size of [[activation energy|activation barrier]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagavan&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhagavan|first1=N. V.|title=Medical Biochemistry|date=2002|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780120954407|pages=76–77|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b7Dc9bOs9uAC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=calorie+%22activation+barrier%22#v=onepage&amp;q=calorie%20%22activation%20barrier%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its use is being superseded by the SI unit, the joule, and multiples thereof such as the kilojoule.

== Measurement of energy content of food ==
In the past, a [[Calorimeter|bomb calorimeter]] was used to determine the energy content of food by burning a sample and measuring a temperature change in the surrounding water. Today, this method is not commonly used in the United States and has been replaced by calculating the energy content indirectly from adding up the energy provided by energy-containing nutrients of food (such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats). The fibre content is also subtracted to account for the fact that fibre is not digested by the body.&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/|title=How Do Food Manufacturers Calculate the Calorie Count of Packaged Foods?|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
