'''Cholesterol''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''chole-'' ([[bile]]) and ''stereos'' (solid), followed by the [[chemical]] [[suffix]] ''-ol'' for an [[alcohol]]) is an [[organic compound|organic]] [[molecule]]. It is a [[sterol]] (or [[chemical modification|modified]] [[steroid]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Cholesterol|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[lipid]].&lt;ref name=pubchem/&gt; Cholesterol is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by all animal [[Cell (biology)#Eukaryotic cells|cells]] and is an essential structural component of [[animal]] [[cell membrane]]s. 

Cholesterol also serves as a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] for the [[biosynthesis]] of [[steroid hormone]]s, [[bile acid]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanukoglu_1992&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I | title = Steroidogenic enzymes: structure, function, and role in regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis | journal = J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol | volume = 43 | issue = 8 | pages = 779–804 | date = Dec 1992 | pmid = 22217824 | doi = 10.1016/0960-0760(92)90307-5 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/890723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vitamin D]]. Cholesterol is the principal [[sterol]] synthesized by all animals. In [[vertebrate]]s, [[liver|hepatic]] cells typically produce the greatest amounts. It is absent among [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), although there are some exceptions, such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', which require cholesterol for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razin S, Tully JG | title = Cholesterol Requirement of Mycoplasmas | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–310 | date = May 1970 | pmid = 4911537 | pmc = 247552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Poulletier de la Salle]] first identified cholesterol in solid form in [[gallstone]]s in 1769. However, it was not until 1815 that chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] named the compound &quot;cholesterine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul (1816) &quot;Recherches chimiques sur les corps gras, et particulièrement sur leurs combinaisons avec les alcalis.

==Physiology==
Cholesterol is essential for all animal life, with each cell capable of synthesizing it by way of a complex 37-step process. This begins with the [[mevalonate]] or [[mevalonate pathway|HMG-CoA reductase pathway]], the target of [[statin]] drugs, which encompasses the first 18 steps. This is followed by 19 additional steps to convert the resulting [[lanosterol]] into cholesterol.

A human male weighing 68&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;lb) normally synthesizes about 1 gram (1,000&amp;nbsp;mg) of cholesterol per day, and his body contains about 35 g, mostly contained within the cell membranes. Typical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name=&quot;cdc-calories&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey | publisher = United States Center for Disease Control | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/databriefs/calories.pdf | accessdate = 2012-01-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ingested cholesterol is [[esterified]], which causes it to be poorly absorbed by the gut. The body also compensates for absorption of ingested cholesterol by reducing its own cholesterol synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Lecerf JM, de Lorgeril M | title = Dietary cholesterol: from physiology to cardiovascular risk | journal = Br J Nutr | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–14 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21385506 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114511000237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soliman |first1=Ghada A. |title=Dietary Cholesterol and the Lack of Evidence in Cardiovascular Disease |journal=Nutrients |date=2018 |doi=10.3390/nu10060780 |pmid=29914176 |volume=10 |pmc=6024687 |page=780}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various [[lipoprotein]]s (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubois C, Armand M, Mekki N, Portugal H, Pauli AM, Bernard PM, Lafont H, Lairon D | title = Effects of increasing amounts of dietary cholesterol on postprandial lipemia and lipoproteins in human subjects | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 35 | issue = 1994 | pages = 1993–2007 | date = 1994 | pmid = 7868978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants make cholesterol in very small amounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plant cholesterol&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | last1 = Behrman | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Gopalan | first2 = Venkat | name-list-format = vanc | title=Cholesterol and Plants | editor-first= William M. | editor-last = Scovell | volume = 82 | number = 12 | year = 2005 | pages = 1791 | doi = 10.1021/ed082p1791|bibcode=2005JChEd..82.1791B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants manufacture [[phytosterol]]s (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption.&lt;ref name=&quot;John_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = John S, Sorokin AV, Thompson PD | title = Phytosterols and vascular disease | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–40 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17218830 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e328011e9e3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the [[GI tract]], an important protective mechanism.

===Function in cells===

====Membranes ====
Cholesterol, given that it composes about 30% of all animal [[cell membrane]]s, is required to build and maintain membranes and modulates [[membrane fluidity]] over the range of physiological temperatures. The [[hydroxyl]] group of each cholesterol molecule interacts with water molecules surrounding the membrane, as do the [[Polar molecules|polar]] heads of the [[lipid bilayer|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s and [[sphingolipid]]s, while the bulky [[steroid]] and the [[hydrocarbon]] chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the [[Polar molecules#Nonpolar molecules|nonpolar]] [[Fatty acid|fatty-acid chain]] of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-4292-4646-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sadava D, Hillis DM, Heller HC, Berenbaum MR | title = Life: The Science of Biology 9th Edition | publisher = Freeman | location = San Francisco | year = 2011 | pages = 105–114 | isbn = 978-1-4292-4646-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.

The structure of the [[tetracyclic]] ring of cholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a ''trans'' conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohvo-Rekilä_2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohvo-Rekilä H, Ramstedt B, Leppimäki P, Slotte JP | title = Cholesterol interactions with phospholipids in membranes | journal = Prog. Lipid Res. | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–97 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11694269 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7827(01)00020-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this structural role, cholesterol also reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeagle_1991&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeagle PL | title = Modulation of membrane function by cholesterol | journal = Biochimie | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 1303–10 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1664240 | doi = 10.1016/0300-9084(91)90093-G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hydrogen]] ions, and [[sodium]] ions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haines_2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = [[Thomas H. Haines|Haines TH]] | title = Do sterols reduce proton and sodium leaks through lipid bilayers? | journal = Prog. Lipid Res. | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–324 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11412894 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7827(01)00009-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gates ====
Within the cell membrane, cholesterol also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated [[caveolae]] and [[clathrin]]-coated [[Pit (botany)|pits]], including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent [[endocytosis]]. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using [[methyl beta cyclodextrin]] (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. 

====Substrate presentation ====
Cholesterol regulates the biological process of [[substrate presentation]] and the enzymes that use substrate presentation as a mechanism of their activation. ([[PLD2]]) is a well-defined example of an enzyme activated by substrate presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petersen EN, Chung HW, Nayebosadri A, Hansen SB | title = Kinetic disruption of lipid rafts is a mechanosensor for phospholipase D | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 7 | pages = 13873 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27976674 | pmc = 5171650 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms13873 | bibcode = 2016NatCo...713873P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The enzyme is [[palmitoylation|palmitoylated]] causing the enzyme to traffic to cholesterol dependent lipid domains sometimes called &quot;[[lipid rafts]]&quot;. The substrate of [[phospholipase D]] is [[phosphatidylcholine]] (PC) which is unsaturated and is of low abundance in lipid rafts. PC localizes to the disordered region of the cell along with the polyunsaturated lipid [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] ([[PIP2]]). PLD2 has a PIP2 [[binding domain]]. When PIP2 concentration in the membrane increases, PLD2 leaves the cholesterol dependent domains and binds to PIP2 where it then gains access to its substrate PC and commences catalysis based on substrate presentation.
[[File:Enzyme translocation.png|thumb|right|upright=2|'''[[Substrate presentation]]'''; PLD (blue oval) is sequestered into cholesterol-dependent lipid domains (green lipids) by [[palmitoylation]]. PLD also binds PIP2(red hexagon) domains (grey shading) located in the disordered region of the cell with phosphatidylcholine (PC). When cholesterol decreases or PIP2 increases in the cell, PLD translocates to PIP2 where it is exposed to and hydrolizes PC to phosphatidic acid (red spherical lipid).]]

====Signaling ====
Cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of [[lipid raft]]s in the [[plasma membrane]], which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Incardona_2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Incardona JP, Eaton S | title = Cholesterol in signal transduction | journal = Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–203 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10712926 | doi = 10.1016/S0955-0674(99)00076-9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a [[myelin]] sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of [[Schwann cell]] membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7817-5056-3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pawlina W, Ross MW | title = Histology: a text and atlas: with correlated cell and molecular biology | edition = | publisher = Lippincott Wiliams &amp; Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = 230 | quote = | isbn = 978-0-7817-5056-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demyelination]] (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed to be part of the basis for [[multiple sclerosis]].

==== Chemical precursor ====
Within cells, cholesterol is also a precursor molecule for several [[Metabolic pathway|biochemical pathway]]s. For example, it is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of [[vitamin D]] in the [[calcium metabolism]] and all [[steroid hormones]], including the [[adrenal gland]] hormones [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]], as well as the sex hormones [[progesterone]], [[estrogen]]s, and [[testosterone]], and their derivatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanukoglu_1992&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne AH, Hales DB | title = Overview of steroidogenic enzymes in the pathway from cholesterol to active steroid hormones | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 947–70 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15583024 | doi = 10.1210/er.2003-0030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metabolism ===
Cholesterol is [[Enterohepatic circulation|recycled]] in the body. The liver excretes cholesterol into [[bile|biliary]] fluids, which is then stored in the [[gallbladder]], which then excretes it in a non-[[Ester|esterified]] form (via bile) into the digestive tract. Typically, about 50% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the [[small intestine]] back into the bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cohn JS, Kamili A, Wat E, Chung RW, Tandy S|date=February 2010|title=Dietary phospholipids and intestinal cholesterol absorption|journal=Nutrients|volume=2|issue=2|pages=116–27|doi=10.3390/nu2020116|pmc=3257636|pmid=22254012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosynthesis and regulation==
===Biosynthesis===
All animal cells manufacture cholesterol, for both membrane structure and other uses, with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 80% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the [[liver]] and the [[intestines]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-its-made-cholesterol-production-in-your-body|title=How it's made: Cholesterol production in your body - Harvard Health|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|work=Harvard Health|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; other sites of higher [[biosynthesis|synthesis]] rates include [[adrenal gland]]s, and [[reproductive organ]]s.

Synthesis within the body starts with the [[mevalonate pathway]] where two molecules of [[acetyl CoA]] condense to form [[acetoacetyl-CoA]]. This is followed by a second condensation between [[acetyl CoA]] and [[acetoacetyl-CoA]] to form [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA]] ([[HMG-CoA]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/09/biosynthesis-and-regulation-of-cholesterol-animation/|title=Biosynthesis and Regulation of Cholesterol (with Animation)|website=PharmaXChange.info|date=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Condensation of Acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

This molecule is then reduced to [[mevalonate]] by the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. Production of [[mevalonate]] is the rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for [[statin]]s (a class of cholesterol lowering drugs).

[[File:Melavonic Acid Synthesis.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
Mevalonate is finally converted to [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

[[File:Melavonate pathway to IPP.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]] through the action of geranyl transferase.

[[File:Cation formation from DMAPP.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
[[File:Formation of farnesyl pyrophosphate.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form [[squalene]] by the action of [[squalene synthase]] in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mehta&quot; /&gt; 
[[File:Squalene Synthesis.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
[[File:Squalene Synthesis 2.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

[[Oxidosqualene cyclase]] then cyclizes squalene to form [[lanosterol]]. Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol through a 19-step process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Berg J | title = Biochemistry | year = 2002 | publisher = WH Freeman | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7167-3051-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/biochemistrychap00jere }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7167-2009-4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rhodes CM, Stryer L, Tasker R | title = Biochemistry | edition = 4th | publisher = W.H.

The final 19 steps to cholesterol contain [[NADPH]] and oxygen to help oxidize [[methyl group]]s for removal of carbons, [[mutase]]s to move [[alkene]] groups, and [[NADH]] to help reduce [[ketones]].

[[Konrad Bloch]] and [[Feodor Lynen]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1964 for their discoveries concerning some of the mechanisms and methods of regulation of cholesterol and [[fatty acid metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1964|publisher==Nobel Prize, Nobel Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of cholesterol synthesis===
Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of [[intracellular]] cholesterol in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] by the [[protein]] [[sterol regulatory element binding protein|SREBP]] (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2).&lt;ref name=&quot;Espenshade_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Espenshade PJ, Hughes AL | title = Regulation of sterol synthesis in eukaryotes | journal = Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume = 41 | issue =  | pages = 401–27 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17666007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: [[SREBP cleavage-activating protein|SCAP]] (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and [[INSIG-1]]. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low.

The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, and acts as a [[transcription factor]] to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]) receptor and [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown MS, Goldstein JL | title = The SREBP pathway: regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–40 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9150132 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. [[Michael S. Brown]] and Dr. [[Joseph L. Goldstein]] in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.

Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the [[proteosome]]. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein [[kinase]]. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7167-4955-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tymoczko | first1 = John L. | last2 = Berg | first2 = Tymoczko | last3 = Stryer | first3 = Lubert | last4 = Berg | first4 = Jeremy Mark | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry | edition = | publisher = W.H.

===Plasma transport and regulation of absorption===

[[File:MetabolismoLipidiE.png|thumb|Lipid logistics: transport of triglycerides and cholesterol in organisms in form of lipoproteins as chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, IDL, HDL.]]
As an isolated molecule, cholesterol is only minimally soluble in [[water]], or [[hydrophilic]]. Because of this, it dissolves in blood at exceedingly small concentrations. To be transported effectively, cholesterol is instead packaged within [[lipoprotein]]s, complex [[Disk (mathematics)|discoidal]] particles with exterior [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble. This allows it to travel through the blood via [[emulsification]]. Unbound cholesterol, being amphipathic, is transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle along with phospholipids and proteins. Cholesterol esters bound to fatty acid, on the other hand, are transported within the fatty hydrophilic core of the lipoprotein, along with triglyceride.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Patton |first1=Kevin T. |last2=Thibodeau |first2=Gary A. |title=Anatomy and Physiology |date=2010 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |isbn=978-9996057762 |edition=7 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Anatomy_and_Physiology.html |accessdate=20 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of lipoproteins in the blood. In order of increasing density, they are [[chylomicron]]s, [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL), [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL), and [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL). Lower protein/lipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins. Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical, although some is carried as its native &quot;free&quot; alcohol form (the cholesterol-OH group facing the water surrounding the particles), while others as fatty acyl esters, known also as cholesterol esters, within the particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton 2010&quot;/&gt;

Lipoprotein particles are organized by complex [[apolipoproteins]], typically 80–100 different proteins per particle, which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes, directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles. These surface receptors serve as unique molecular signatures, which then help determine fat distribution delivery throughout the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton 2010&quot;/&gt;

Chylomicrons, the least dense cholesterol transport molecules, contain [[apolipoprotein B-48]], [[apolipoprotein C]], and [[apolipoprotein E]] (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27277824|year=2016|last1=Mahley|first1=R. W.|title=Apolipoprotein E: From cardiovascular disease to neurodegenerative disorders|journal=Journal of Molecular Medicine|volume=94|issue=7|pages=739–46|doi=10.1007/s00109-016-1427-y|pmc=4921111}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in their shells. Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, and taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton 2010&quot;/&gt;

VLDL molecules are produced by the liver from [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain [[apolipoprotein B100]] and [[apolipoprotein E]] in their shells, and can be degraded by [[lipoprotein lipase]] on the artery wall to IDL. This arterial wall cleavage allows absorption of [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] and increases concentration of circulating cholesterol. IDL molecules are then consumed in two processes: half is metabolized by [[HTGL]] and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become cholesterol laden LDL particles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton 2010&quot;/&gt;

LDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of [[apolipoprotein B100]], recognized by [[LDL receptor]]s in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of [[apolipoprotein B100]], many LDL receptors concentrate in [[clathrin]]-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via [[endocytosis]]. These vesicles then fuse with a [[lysosome]], where the [[Lysosomal lipase|lysosomal acid lipase]] enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with the cell membranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton 2010&quot;/&gt;

LDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by [[SREBP]], the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol ''de novo'', according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL molecules from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patton 2010&quot;/&gt;

When this process becomes unregulated, LDL molecules without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by [[macrophages]], which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to [[atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]] formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness).&lt;ref name=&quot;Weingärtner_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weingärtner O, Pinsdorf T, Rogacev KS, Blömer L, Grenner Y, Gräber S, Ulrich C, Girndt M, Böhm M, Fliser D, Laufs U, Lütjohann D, Heine GH | title = The relationships of markers of cholesterol homeostasis with carotid intima-media thickness | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e13467 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20976107 | pmc = 2956704 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013467 | editor1-last = Federici | editor1-first = Massimo |bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513467W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a [[lipoprotein]]) with &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7167-4955-6&quot;/&gt;

===Metabolism, recycling and excretion===
Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives called [[oxysterol]]s. Three different mechanisms can form these: autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kandutsch_1978&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kandutsch AA, Chen HW, Heiniger HJ | title = Biological activity of some oxygenated sterols | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4355 | pages = 498–501 | date = August 1978 | pmid = 663671 | doi = 10.1126/science.663671 |bibcode = 1978Sci...201..498K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding became known as the “oxysterol hypothesis”. Additional roles for oxysterols in human physiology include their participation in bile acid biosynthesis, function as transport forms of cholesterol, and regulation of gene transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell_2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Russell DW | title = Oxysterol biosynthetic enzymes | journal = Biochim.

In biochemical experiments radiolabelled forms of cholesterol, such as tritiated-cholesterol are used. These derivatives undergo degradation upon storage and it is essential to purify cholesterol prior to use. Cholesterol can be purified using small Sephadex LH-20 columns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanukoglu_1980&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I, Jefcoate CR | title = Pregnenolone separation from cholesterol using Sephadex LH-20 mini-columns|journal=Journal of Chromatography A | volume = 190 | issue = 1 | year = 1980 | pages = 256–262 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9673(00)85545-4 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/890904/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the [[liver]] into the [[bile]]. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolkoff_2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolkoff AW, Cohen DE | title = Bile acid regulation of hepatic physiology: I.

More current testing methods determine LDL (&quot;bad&quot;) and HDL (&quot;good&quot;) cholesterol separately, allowing cholesterol analysis to be more nuanced.

A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL—another useful measure—of far less than 5:1 is thought to be healthier.

Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a [[Low-density lipoprotein#Estimation of LDL particles via cholesterol content|variant]]): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by five. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warnick_1990&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warnick GR, Knopp RH, Fitzpatrick V, Branson L | title = Estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the Friedewald equation is adequate for classifying patients on the basis of nationally recommended cutpoints | journal = Clin.

This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a proxy or marker for frailty occurring with age.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ulmer_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ulmer H, Kelleher C, Diem G, Concin H | title = Why Eve is not Adam: prospective follow-up in 149650 women and men of cholesterol and other risk factors related to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality | journal = J Women's Health (Larchmt) | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 41–53 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15006277 | doi = 10.1089/154099904322836447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypocholesterolemia===
Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed ''[[hypocholesterolemia]]''. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[cancer]], and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewington_2007&quot; /&gt; A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes [[Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome]], which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels. [[Hyperthyroidism]], or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the [[LDL receptor]], may result in hypocholesterolemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rizos CV, Elisaf MS, Liberopoulos EN | title = Effects of thyroid dysfunction on lipid profile | journal = The Open Cardiovascular Medicine Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 76––84 | date = 24 February 2011 | pmid = 21660244 | doi = 10.2174/1874192401105010076 | pmc=3109527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cholesterol testing===
The [[American Heart Association]] recommends testing cholesterol every 4–6 years for people aged 20 years or older.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlHow To Get Your Cholesterol Tested&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Cholesterol/SymptomsDiagnosisMonitoringofHighCholesterol/How-To-Get-Your-Cholesterol-Tested_UCM_305595_Article.jsp | title = How To Get Your Cholesterol Tested | format = | website = | publisher = American Heart Association | pages = | quote = | accessdate = 2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate set of [[American Heart Association]] guidelines issued in 2013 indicates that patients taking [[statin]] medications should have their cholesterol tested 4–12 weeks after their first dose and then every 3–12 months thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cardiosource.org/News-Media/Publications/Cardiology-Magazine/2013/12/Getting-a-Grasp-of-the-Guidelines.aspx| publisher = American College of Cardiology| vauthors = Stone NJ, Robinson J, Goff DC| year = 2013| title = Getting a grasp of the Guidelines| accessdate = 2 April 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140707122736/http://www.cardiosource.org/News-Media/Publications/Cardiology-Magazine/2013/12/Getting-a-Grasp-of-the-Guidelines.aspx| archive-date = 7 July 2014| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A blood sample after 12-hour fasting is taken by a doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to measure a [[lipid profile]], an approach used to estimate a person's [[lipoproteins]], the vastly more important issue because lipoproteins have always been concordant with outcomes though the lipid profile is commonly discordant [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2720529/ LDL Particle Number and Risk of Future Cardiovascular Disease in the Framingham Offspring Study].

The lipid profile measures: (a) total cholesterol, (b) cholesterol associated with HDL (i.e. Higher Density {than water} Lipids-transported-within-proteins) particles (&quot;which can regress arterial disease&quot;), (c) triglycerides and (d) (by a calculation and assumptions) cholesterol carried by LDL (i.e. Lower Density {than water} Lipids-transported-within-proteins) particles (&quot;which drive arterial disease&quot;).

It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L or more (200+&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL-C values less than 1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), or there are other drivers heart disease and stroke. Additional drivers of heart disease include [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]] (or use of [[antihypertensive drug|anti-hypertensive medication]]), low HDL level, family history of [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) and [[hypercholesterolemia]], and [[tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlATP III Update 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |title=Implications of Recent Clinical Trials for the ATP III Guidelines |publisher=National Heart, Lungs and Blood Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202053506/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |archivedate=2 February 2014 |accessdate=2014-01-27 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cholesteric liquid crystals==
Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the [[liquid crystal]]line &quot;cholesteric phase&quot;. The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[Liquid crystal|nematic phase]], and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in [[liquid-crystal display]] [[thermometer]]s and in temperature-sensitive paints.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Stereoisomers==
Cholesterol has 256 [[stereoisomer]]s that arise from its 8 stereocenters, although only two of the stereoisomers are of biochemical significance (''nat''-cholesterol and ''ent''-cholesterol, for ''natural'' and ''enantiomer'', respectively),&lt;ref name=&quot;Westover_2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westover EJ, Covey DF, Brockman HL, Brown RE, Pike LJ | title = Cholesterol depletion results in site-specific increases in epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation due to membrane level effects.
