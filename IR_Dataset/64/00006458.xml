A '''ceramic''' ({{lang-grc|κεραμικός}}&amp;nbsp;– {{transl|grc|keramikós}}, &quot;potter's&quot;, from {{lang|grc|κέραμος}}&amp;nbsp;– {{transl|grc|kéramos}}, &quot;potter's clay&quot;) is a [[solid]] material comprising an [[inorganic compound]] of [[metal]], [[nonmetal|non-metal]] or [[metalloid|ionic]] and [[Covalent bond|covalent]] bonds. Common examples are [[earthenware]], [[porcelain]], and [[brick]].

The [[crystallinity]] of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi-crystalline, [[Vitrification|vitrified]], and often completely [[amorphous]] (e.g., [[glass]]es). Most often, fired ceramics are either vitrified or semi-vitrified as is the case with earthenware, [[stoneware]], and porcelain. Varying crystallinity and [[electron]] composition in the ionic and covalent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and [[Insulator (electricity)|electrical insulators]] (extensively researched in [[ceramic engineering]]). With such a large range of possible options for the composition/structure of a ceramic (e.g. nearly all of the elements, nearly all types of bonding, and all levels of crystallinity), the breadth of the subject is vast, and identifiable attributes (e.g. [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical conductivity]], etc.) are difficult to specify for the group as a whole. General properties such as high melting temperature, high hardness, poor conductivity, high [[elastic modulus|moduli of elasticity]], chemical resistance and low ductility are the norm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Black, J. T.  |author2=Kohser, R. A.  |title=DeGarmo's materials and processes in manufacturing |publisher=Wiley |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-470-92467-9 |pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with known exceptions to each of these rules (e.g. [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric ceramics]], [[glass transition]] temperature, [[superconductivity|superconductive ceramics]], etc.). Many composites, such as [[fiberglass]] and [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]], while containing ceramic materials, are not considered to be part of the ceramic family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carter, C.

The earliest ceramics made by humans were [[pottery]] objects (i.e. ''pots'' or ''vessels'') or [[figurine]]s made from [[clay]], either by itself or mixed with other materials like [[silicon dioxide|silica]], hardened and [[sintering|sintered]] in fire. Later ceramics were [[Glazing (ceramics)|glazed]] and fired to create smooth, colored surfaces, decreasing [[porosity]] through the use of glassy, amorphous ceramic coatings on top of the crystalline ceramic substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Carter, C. B.  |author2=Norton, M. G.  |title=Ceramic materials: Science and engineering |publisher=Springer |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-387-46271-4 |pages=20 &amp; 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramics now include domestic, industrial and building products, as well as a wide range of [[ceramic art]]. In the 20th century, new [[ceramic materials]] were developed for use in advanced ceramic engineering, such as in [[semiconductor]]s.

The word &quot;''[[wikt:ceramic|ceramic]]''&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|κεραμικός}} ({{transl|grc|keramikos}}), &quot;of pottery&quot; or &quot;for pottery&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkeramiko%2Fs κεραμικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κέραμος|κέραμος]]}} ({{transl|grc|keramos}}), &quot;potter's clay, tile, pottery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Framos κέραμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known mention of the root &quot;ceram-&quot; is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{nowrap|{{transl|gmy|ke-ra-me-we}}}}, &quot;workers of ceramics&quot;, written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=383 Palaeolexicon], Word study tool of ancient languages&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;ceramic&quot; may be used as an adjective to describe a material, product or process, or it may be used as a noun, either singular, or, more commonly, as the plural noun &quot;ceramics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|ceramic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ceramic fractured SEM.TIF|right|thumb|A low magnification [[Scanning Electron Microscope|SEM micrograph]] of an advanced ceramic material.  The properties of ceramics make fracturing an important inspection method.]]

A ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as [[carbon]] or [[silicon]], may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in [[shear stress|shearing]] and tension. They withstand chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments. Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, ranging from 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C to 1,600&amp;nbsp;°C (1,800&amp;nbsp;°F to 3,000&amp;nbsp;°F). [[Glass]] is often not considered a ceramic because of its [[amorphous]] (noncrystalline) character. However, glassmaking involves several steps of the ceramic process, and its mechanical properties are similar to ceramic materials.

Traditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as [[kaolinite]], whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide, more commonly known as [[alumina]]. The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include [[silicon carbide]] and [[tungsten carbide]]. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance and hence find use in applications such as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical, electronics industries and body armor.

===Crystalline ceramics===
Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing. Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories – either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction ''in situ'', or by &quot;forming&quot; powders into the desired shape, and then [[sintering]] to form a solid body. [[Ceramic forming techniques]] include shaping by hand (sometimes including a rotation process called &quot;throwing&quot;), [[Slipcasting|slip casting]], [[tape casting]] (used for making very thin ceramic capacitors), [[injection molding]], dry pressing, and other variations. 

===Noncrystalline ceramics===
Noncrystalline ceramics, being glass, tend to be formed from melts. The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing into a mold. If later heat treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic, widely used as cook-tops and also as a glass composite material for nuclear waste disposal.

==Properties==
The physical properties of any ceramic substance are a direct result of its crystalline structure and chemical composition. [[Solid-state chemistry]] reveals the fundamental connection between microstructure and properties such as localized density variations, grain size distribution, type of porosity and second-phase content, which can all be correlated with ceramic properties such as mechanical strength σ by the Hall-Petch equation, [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[dielectric constant]], and the [[optical]] properties exhibited by [[transparent materials]].

[[Ceramography]] is the art and science of preparation, examination and evaluation of ceramic microstructures. Evaluation and characterization of ceramic microstructures is often implemented on similar spatial scales to that used commonly in the emerging field of nanotechnology: from tens of [[angstrom]]s (A) to tens of micrometers (µm). This is typically somewhere between the minimum wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye.

The microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, grain boundaries, pores, micro-cracks, structural defects and hardness microindentions. Most bulk mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the observed microstructure. The fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure. The root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the cleaved and polished microstructure. Physical properties which constitute the field of [[materials science]] and [[engineering]] include the following:

===Mechanical properties===

[[File:Ultra-thin separated (Carborundum) disk.jpg|thumb|Cutting disks made of [[silicon carbide]]]]
Mechanical properties are important in structural and building materials as well as textile fabrics. In modern [[materials science]], fracture mechanics is an important tool in improving the mechanical performance of materials and components. It applies the [[physics]] of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], in particular the theories of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], to the microscopic [[crystallographic defects]] found in real materials in order to predict the macroscopic mechanical failure of bodies. [[Fractography]] is widely used with fracture mechanics to understand the causes of failures and also verify the theoretical [[failure]] predictions with real life failures.

Ceramic materials are usually [[ionic bond|ionic]] or [[covalent]] bonded materials, and can be [[crystal]]line or [[amorphous solid|amorphous]]. A material held together by either type of bond will tend to [[Fracture#Brittle fracture|fracture]] before any [[plastic deformation]] takes place, which results in poor [[toughness]] in these materials. Additionally, because these materials tend to be porous, the [[porosity|pore]]s and other microscopic imperfections act as [[Stress concentration|stress concentrators]], decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the [[tensile strength]]. These combine to give [[catastrophic failure]]s, as opposed to the more ductile [[failure mode]]s of metals.

These materials do show [[plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]]. However, because of the rigid structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available [[slip system]]s for [[dislocation]]s to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-crystalline (glassy) materials, [[Viscosity|viscous]] flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials.

To overcome the brittle behaviour, ceramic material development has introduced the class of [[ceramic matrix composite]] materials, in which ceramic fibers are embedded and with specific coatings are forming fiber bridges across any crack. This mechanism substantially increases the fracture toughness of such ceramics. Ceramic [[Disc brake|disc brakes]] are an example of using a ceramic matrix composite material manufactured with a specific process.

==== Ice-templating for enhanced mechanical properties ====
If a ceramic will be subjected to substantial mechanical loading it can undergo a process called [[Freeze-casting|ice-templating]], which allows some control of the [[microstructure]] of the ceramic product and therefore some control of the mechanical properties. Ceramic engineers use this technique to tune the mechanical properties to their desired application. Specifically, [[Strength of materials|strength]] is increased when this technique is employed. Ice templating allows the creation of macroscopic pores in a unidirectional arrangement. The applications of this oxide strengthening technique are important for [[Solid oxide fuel cell|solid oxide fuel cells]] and [[Water purification|water filtration]] devices.{{clarify|reason=why is it important in these specific applications? why is it specifically an oxide strengthening technique?|date=December 2019}}{{cn|date=December 2019}}

To process a sample through ice templating, an aqueous [[Colloid|colloidal suspension]] is prepared containing the dissolved ceramic powder evenly dispersed throughout the colloid,{{clarify|reason=is the powder in suspension or actually dissolved?|date=December 2019}} for example [[Yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ). The solution is then cooled from the bottom to the top on a platform that allows for unidirectional cooling. This forces [[ice]] crystals to grow in compliance to the unidirectional cooling, and these ice crystals force the dissolved YSZ particles to the solidification front of the solid-liquid interphase boundary, resulting in pure ice crystals lined up unidirectionally alongside concentrated pockets of colloidal particles. The sample is then simultaneously heated and the pressure is reduced enough to force the ice crystals to [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] and the YSZ pockets begin to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] together to form macroscopically aligned ceramic microstuctures. The sample is then further [[Sintering|sintered]] to complete the [[evaporation]] of the residual water and the final consolidation of the ceramic microstructure.{{cn|date=December 2019}}

During ice-templating a few variables can be controlled to influence the pore size and morphology of the microstructure. These important variables are the initial solids loading of the colloid, the cooling rate, the sintering temperature and duration, and the use of certain additives which can influence the micro-structural morphology during the process. A good understanding of these parameters is essential to understanding the relationships between processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of anisotropically porous materials.&lt;ref&gt;Seuba, Jordi, Silvain Deville, Christian Guizard, and Adam J. Stevenson (14 April 2016).  [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep24326 &quot;Mechanical properties and failure behavior of unidirectional porous ceramics.&quot;]  ''Scientific Reports'', vol. 6, article no. 24326.  Retrieved 9 October 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical properties===

====Semiconductors====
Some ceramics are [[semiconductor]]s. Most of these are [[transition metal oxides]] that are II-VI semiconductors, such as [[zinc oxide]].

While there are prospects of mass-producing blue [[LED]]s from zinc oxide, ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show [[grain boundary]] effects.

One of the most widely used of these is the varistor. These are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain [[threshold voltage]]. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a [[Electrical breakdown|breakdown]] of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its [[electrical resistance]] dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self-reset – after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high.

This makes them ideal for [[Surge protector|surge-protection]] applications; as there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in [[electrical substation]]s, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from [[lightning]] strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.

Semiconducting ceramics are also employed as [[gas sensor]]s. When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes. With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very inexpensive devices can be produced.

====Superconductivity====
[[File:Magnet 4.jpg|thumb|The [[Meissner effect]] demonstrated by levitating a magnet above a cuprate superconductor, which is cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]]]]
Under some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics exhibit [[high-temperature superconductivity]].{{clarify|reason=contradictory: why is it high-temperature superconductivity if extremely low temperatures are required? In superconductivity high temperature means above 30 K|date=December 2019}} The reason for this is not understood, but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics.

====Ferroelectricity and supersets====
[[Piezoelectricity]], a link between electrical and mechanical response, is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to [[crystal oscillator|measure time]] in watches and other electronics. Such devices use both properties of piezoelectrics, using electricity to produce a mechanical motion (powering the device) and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity (generating a signal). The unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again.

The piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit [[pyroelectricity]], and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. These materials can be used to inter-convert between thermal, mechanical, or electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts. Such materials are used in [[motion sensor]]s, where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.

In turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the [[ferroelectric effect]], in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field.  Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity. This can be used to store information in [[ferroelectric capacitor]]s, elements of [[ferroelectric RAM]].

The most common such materials are [[lead zirconate titanate]] and [[barium titanate]]. Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high-frequency [[loudspeaker]]s, transducers for [[sonar]], and actuators for [[atomic force microscope|atomic force]] and [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s.

====Positive thermal coefficient====
[[File:Si3N4thruster.jpg|thumb|left|Silicon nitride rocket thruster. Left: Mounted in test stand. Right: Being tested with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; propellants]]
Increases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] [[titanate]]s. The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry. In such materials, current will pass through the material until [[joule heating]] brings it to the transition temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease. Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.

At the transition temperature, the material's [[dielectric]] response becomes theoretically infinite. While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures. Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with &quot;ceramic&quot; in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.

===Optical properties===
[[File:cermax.jpg|thumb|150px|Cermax xenon arc lamp with synthetic sapphire output window]]
[[Optics|Optically transparent materials]] focus on the response of a material to incoming lightwaves of a range of wavelengths. [[Optical filter|Frequency selective optical filters]] can be utilized to alter or enhance the brightness and contrast of a digital image. Guided lightwave transmission via frequency selective [[waveguides]] involves the emerging field of fiber [[optics]] and the ability of certain glassy compositions as a [[transmission medium]] for a range of frequencies simultaneously ([[multi-mode optical fiber]]) with little or no [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]] between competing [[wavelengths]] or frequencies. This [[resonant]] [[Normal mode|mode]] of [[energy]] and [[data transmission]] via electromagnetic (light) [[wave propagation]], though low powered, is virtually lossless. Optical waveguides are used as components in [[Integrated optical circuit]]s (e.g. [[light-emitting diodes]], LEDs) or as the transmission medium in local and long haul [[optical communication]] systems. Also of value to the emerging materials scientist is the sensitivity of materials to radiation in the thermal [[infrared]] (IR) portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This heat-seeking ability is responsible for such diverse optical phenomena as [[Night-vision]] and IR [[luminescence]].

Thus, there is an increasing need in the [[military]] sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to [[transmit]] [[light]] ([[electromagnetic waves]]) in the [[visible spectrum|visible]] (0.4 – 0.7 micrometers) and mid-[[infrared]] (1 – 5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] armor, including next-generation high-speed [[missile]]s and pods, as well as protection against improvised explosive devices (IED).

In the 1960s, scientists at General Electric (GE) discovered that under the right manufacturing conditions, some ceramics, especially [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina), could be made [[translucent]]. These translucent materials were transparent enough to be used for containing the electrical [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] generated in high-[[pressure]] [[sodium]] street lamps. During the past two decades, additional types of transparent ceramics have been developed for applications such as nose cones for [[heat-seeking]] [[missiles]], [[window]]s for fighter [[aircraft]], and [[scintillation counter]]s for computed [[tomography]] scanners.

In the early 1970s, Thomas Soules pioneered computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic alumina. His model showed that microscopic [[porosity|pores]] in ceramic, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline [[Crystallite|grains]], caused light to [[scattering|scatter]] and prevented true transparency. The volume fraction of these microscopic pores had to be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission.

This is basically a [[particle size (grain size)|particle size]] effect. [[Opacity (optics)|Opacity]] results from the [[incoherent scattering]] of light at surfaces and [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]]. In addition to pores, most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.

In the formation of [[polycrystalline]] materials ([[metals]] and ceramics) the size of the [[crystalline]] grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline [[wiktionary:Particles|particles]] present in the raw material during formation (or pressing) of the object. Moreover, the size of the [[grain boundaries]] scales directly with particle size. Thus a reduction of the original particle size below the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]] (~ 0.5 micrometers for shortwave violet) eliminates any light [[scattering]], resulting in a [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] material.

Recently{{When|date=March 2011}}, Japanese scientists have developed techniques to produce ceramic parts that rival the [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]] of traditional crystals (grown from a single seed) and exceed the [[fracture toughness]] of a single crystal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In particular, scientists at the Japanese firm Konoshima Ltd., a producer of ceramic construction materials and industrial chemicals, have been looking for markets for their transparent ceramics.

Livermore researchers realized that these ceramics might greatly benefit high-powered [[lasers]] used in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Programs Directorate. In particular, a Livermore research team began to acquire advanced transparent ceramics from Konoshima to determine if they could meet the [[optical]] requirements needed for Livermore’s Solid-State Heat Capacity Laser (SSHCL).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://str.llnl.gov/content/pages/past-issues-pdfs/2006.04.pdf|title=Flexible Stress Sensing|last=Heller|first=Arnie|date=April 2006|website=Science and Technology Review|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livermore researchers have also been testing applications of these materials for applications such as advanced drivers for laser-driven [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] power plants.

Frequently, the raw materials of modern ceramics do not include clays.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Greg. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060815173829/http://www.newi.ac.uk/buckleyc/ceramics.htm Introduction To Ceramics], American Ceramic Society&lt;/ref&gt;
Those that do are classified as follows:
*[[Earthenware]], fired at lower temperatures than other types
*[[Stoneware]], [[Vitrification#In ceramics|vitreous]] or semi-vitreous 
*[[Porcelain]], which contains a high content of [[kaolin]]
*[[Bone china]]

===Classification===
Ceramics can also be classified into three distinct material categories: 
* [[Oxide]]s: [[alumina]], [[beryllia]], [[ceria]], [[zirconia]]
* Non-oxides: [[carbide]], [[boride]], [[nitride]], [[silicide]]
* [[Composite material]]s: particulate reinforced, [[Ceramic matrix composite|fiber reinforced]], combinations of [[oxide]]s and nonoxides.

Each one of these classes can be developed into unique material properties because ceramics tend to be crystalline.

==Applications==
*Knife blades: the blade of a [[ceramic knife]] will stay sharp for much longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and susceptible to breaking.
*[[Disk brake|Carbon-ceramic brake disks]] for vehicles are resistant to [[brake fade]] at high temperatures.
*Advanced [[Composite armour|composite ceramic and metal matrices]] have been designed for most modern [[armoured fighting vehicles]] because they offer superior penetrating resistance against [[shaped charge]]s (such as [[High explosive anti-tank|HEAT]] rounds) and [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s.
*Ceramics such as [[alumina]] and [[boron carbide]] have been used in [[bulletproof vest|ballistic armored vests]] to repel high-velocity [[rifle]] fire. Such plates are known commonly as [[Small Arms Protective Insert|small arms protective insert]]s, or SAPIs. Similar material is used to protect the [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpits]] of some military airplanes, because of the low weight of the material.
*Ceramics can be used in place of steel for [[ball bearing]]s. Their higher hardness means they are much less susceptible to wear and typically last for triple the lifetime of a steel part. They also deform less under load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from [[friction]] during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. In some cases, their electricity-insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings. Two drawbacks to ceramic bearings are a significantly higher cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads.
*In the early 1980s, [[Toyota]] researched production of an [[adiabatic]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] using ceramic components in the hot gas area. The ceramics would have allowed temperatures of over 3000&amp;nbsp;°F (1650&amp;nbsp;°C). The expected advantages would have been lighter materials and a smaller cooling system (or no need for one at all), leading to a major weight reduction. The expected increase of [[fuel efficiency]] of the engine (caused by the higher temperature, as shown by [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot's]] theorem) could not be verified experimentally; it was found that the heat transfer on the hot ceramic cylinder walls was higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall as the cooler gas film on the metal surface works as a [[thermal insulator]]. Thus, despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and the limited advantages. (Small imperfections in the ceramic material with its low [[fracture toughness]] lead to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure.) Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass production is not feasible with current technology. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=Where are any other references to Toyota's work?}}
*Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for [[gas turbine]] [[heat engine|engines]]. Currently, even blades made of [[superalloy|advanced metal alloys]] used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.
*Recent advances have been made in ceramics which include [[bioceramic]]s, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. [[Hydroxyapatite]], the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopedic implants coated with these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions so are of great interest for gene delivery and [[tissue engineering]] scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength, and are used to coat metal orthopedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein [[collagen]]s, synthetic bones.
*Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals.&lt;ref&gt;B.E.

*High-tech ceramic is used in watchmaking for producing watch cases. The material is valued by watchmakers for its light weight, scratch resistance, durability and smooth touch. [[International Watch Company|IWC]] is one of the brands that initiated the use of ceramic in watchmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Case Materials Explained: Ceramic {{!}} aBlogtoWatch|url=http://www.ablogtowatch.com/watch-case-materials-explained-ceramic/|website=aBlogtoWatch|date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
Ceramic artifacts have an important role in archaeology for understanding the culture, technology and behavior of peoples of the past. They are among the most common artifacts to be found at an archaeological site, generally in the form of small fragments of broken pottery called [[sherd]]s. Processing of collected sherds can be consistent with two main types of analysis: technical and traditional.

Traditional analysis involves sorting ceramic artifacts, sherds and larger fragments into specific types based on style, composition, manufacturing and morphology. By creating these typologies it is possible to distinguish between different cultural styles, the purpose of the ceramic and technological state of the people among other conclusions. In addition, by looking at stylistic changes of ceramics over time is it possible to separate (seriate) the ceramics into distinct diagnostic groups (assemblages). A comparison of ceramic artifacts with known dated assemblages allows for a chronological assignment of these pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Mississippi Valley Archaeological Center, [http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html Ceramic Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603053406/http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html |date=June 3, 2012 }}, Retrieved 04-11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical approach to ceramic analysis involves a finer examination of the composition of ceramic artifacts and sherds to determine the source of the material and through this the possible manufacturing site. Key criteria are the composition of the clay and the [[Temper (pottery)|temper]] used in the manufacture of the article under study: temper is a material added to the clay during the initial production stage, and it is used to aid the subsequent drying process. Types of temper include shell pieces, granite fragments and ground sherd pieces called 'grog'. Temper is usually identified by microscopic examination of the temper material. Clay identification is determined by a process of refiring the ceramic, and assigning a color to it using Munsell Soil Color notation. By estimating both the clay and temper compositions, and locating a region where both are known to occur, an assignment of the material source can be made. From the source assignment of the artifact further investigations can be made into the site of manufacture.
