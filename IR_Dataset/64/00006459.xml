The '''wuxing''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|五行}}|p={{linktext|wǔxíng}}|}}), also known as the '''Five Elements''', '''Five Agents''', '''Five Movements''', '''Five Phases''', '''Five Planets''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Zai 2015&quot;&gt;Dr Zai, J.

Ultravisum, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Five Processes''', '''Five Stages''', '''Five Steps''', or '''Five Ways''', is the short form of &quot;wǔ zhǒng liúxíng zhī qì&quot; ({{lang|zh|五種流行之氣}}) or &quot;the five types of chi dominating at different times&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/eastern/wuxing.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527225452/http://www.kheper.net/topics/eastern/wuxing.html |archivedate=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fivefold conceptual scheme that many traditional Chinese fields used to explain a wide array of phenomena, from cosmic cycles to the interaction between [[Zang-fu|internal organs]], and from the succession of political regimes to the [[Chinese herbology|properties of medicinal drugs]]. The &quot;Five Phases&quot; are [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|火}} ''huǒ''), [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|水}} ''shuǐ''), [[Wood (Wu Xing)|Wood]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|木}} ''mù''), [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|金}} ''jīn''), and [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|土}} ''tǔ''). This order of presentation is known as the &quot;[[Names of the days of the week#East Asian tradition|Days of the Week]]&quot; sequence. In the order of &quot;mutual generation&quot; ({{lang|zh|相生}} ''xiāngshēng''), they are Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. In the order of &quot;mutual overcoming&quot; ({{lang|zh|相剋/相克}} ''xiāngkè''), they are Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Deng Yu | author2=Zhu Shuanli | author3=Xu Peng | author4=Deng Hai | title=五行阴阳的特征与新英译 | trans-title=Characteristics and a New English Translation of Wu Xing and Yin-Yang | journal=[[Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine]] | date=2000 | volume=20 | issue=12 | page=937 | url=http://www.cjim.cn/zxyjhcn/zxyjhcn/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?file_no=20001226 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716115244/http://www.cjim.cn/zxyjhcn/zxyjhcn/ch/reader/view_abstract.aspx?file_no=20001226 | archivedate=2015-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deng Yu et al; Fresh Translator of Zang Xiang Fractal five System，Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine; 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deng Yu et al，TCM Fractal Sets {{lang|zh|中医分形集}}，Journal of Mathematical Medicine ，1999，12（3），264-265&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of five phases was used for describing interactions and relationships between phenomena. After it came to maturity in the second or first century BCE during the [[Han dynasty]], this device was employed in many fields of early Chinese thought, including seemingly disparate fields such as [[geomancy]] or [[feng shui]], [[Chinese astrology|astrology]], [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[music]], [[military strategy]], and [[martial arts]]. The system is still used as a reference in some forms of [[complementary and alternative medicine]] and martial arts.

==Names==
''Xing'' ({{linktext|lang=zh|行}}) of ''wuxing'' means moving; a planet is called a 'moving star' ({{linktext|lang=zh|行星}}) in Chinese. Wu Xing ({{linktext|lang=zh|五|行}}) originally refers to the five major planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Mars, Venus) that create five dimensions of earth life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zai 2015&quot;/&gt; ''Wuxing'' is also widely translated as &quot;Five Elements&quot; and this is used extensively by many including practitioners of Five Element acupuncture. This translation arose by false analogy with the Western system of the [[four elements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese History p. 179&quot;&gt;[[Nathan Sivin]] (1995), &quot;Science and Medicine in Chinese History,&quot; in his ''Science in Ancient China'' (Aldershot, England: Variorum), text VI, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the classical Greek elements were concerned with substances or natural qualities, the Chinese ''xíng'' are &quot;primarily concerned with process and change,&quot; hence the common translation as &quot;phases&quot; or &quot;agents&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sivin 1987.73&quot;&gt;[[Nathan Sivin]] (1987), ''Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China'' (Ann Arbor: Center for Chinese Studies, The University of Michigan) p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; By the same token, ''Mù'' is thought of as &quot;Tree&quot; rather than &quot;Wood&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lecture Room, CCTV-10&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media
|script-title = zh:千古中医之张仲景 |trans-title=Wood and Metal were often replaced with air
|publisher = [[Lecture Room]], CCTV-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word 'element' is thus used within the context of Chinese medicine with a different meaning to its usual meaning.

It should be recognized that the word ''phase'', although commonly preferred, is not perfect. ''Phase'' is a better translation for the five ''seasons'' ({{lang|zh|五運}} Wǔ Yùn) mentioned below, and so ''agents'' or ''processes'' might be preferred for the primary term ''xíng''. Manfred Porkert attempts to resolve this by using ''Evolutive Phase'' for {{lang|zh|五行}} ''Wǔ Xíng'' and ''Circuit Phase'' for {{lang|zh|五運}} ''Wǔ Yùn'', but these terms are unwieldy.

Some of the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] (no later than 168 BC) also present the wuxing as &quot;five virtues&quot; or types of activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contemporary China p. 72&quot;&gt;[[Nathan Sivin]] (1987), ''Traditional Medicine in Contemporary China'', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Chinese medicine texts the wuxing are also referred to as Wu Yun ({{linktext|lang=zh|五|運}}}}; wǔ yùn) or a combination of the two characters (Wu Xing-Yun) these emphasise the correspondence of five elements to five 'seasons' (four seasons plus one). Another tradition refers to the ''Wǔ Xíng'' as ''Wǔ Dé'' ({{lang|zh|五德}}), the {{Interlanguage link|Five Virtues (Chinese philosophy)|lt=Five Virtues|zh|五德終始說|WD=}}.

==The phases==
The five phases are around 72 days each and are usually used to describe the state in nature:
*Wood/Spring: a period of growth, which generates abundant wood and vitality
*Fire/Summer: a period of swelling, flowering, brimming with fire and energy
*Earth: the in-between transitional seasonal periods, or a separate 'season' known as Late Summer or Long Summer – in the latter case associated with leveling and dampening (moderation) and fruition
*Metal/Autumn: a period of harvesting and collecting
*Water/Winter: a period of retreat, where stillness and storage pervades

==Cycles==
The doctrine of five phases describes two cycles, a generating or creation ({{lang|zh|生}}, ''shēng'') cycle, also known as &quot;mother-son&quot;, and an overcoming or destruction ({{lang|zh|剋/克}}, ''kè'') cycle, also known as &quot;grandfather-grandson&quot;, of interactions between the phases. Within Chinese medicine the effects of these two main relations are further elaborated:
*Inter-promoting (''shēng'' cycle, mother/son)
*Interacting (grandmother/grandson)
*Overacting (''kè'' cycle, grandfather/grandson)
*Counteracting (reverse ''kè'')

===Generating===
The common memory jogs, which help to remind in what order the phases are:

*Wood feeds Fire
*Fire creates Earth (ash)
*Earth bears Metal
*Metal collects Water
*Water nourishes Wood

Other common words for this cycle include &quot;begets&quot;, &quot;engenders&quot; and &quot;mothers&quot;.

===Overcoming===
*Wood parts Earth (such as roots or trees can prevent soil erosion)
*Earth dams (or muddies or absorbs) Water
*Water extinguishes Fire
*Fire melts Metal
*Metal chops Wood

This cycle might also be called &quot;controls&quot;, &quot;restrains&quot; or &quot;fathers&quot;.

==Cosmology and ''feng shui''==
{{Main|Feng shui}}
[[File:FiveElementsCycleBalanceImbalance 02 plain.svg|thumb|right|Another illustration of the cycle.]]
According to wuxing theory, the structure of the cosmos mirrors the five phases. Each phase has a complex series of associations with different aspects of nature, as can be seen in the following table. In the ancient Chinese form of [[geomancy]], known as Feng Shui, practitioners all based their art and system on the five phases (wuxing). All of these phases are represented within the [[Bagua|trigrams]]. Associated with these phases are colors, seasons and shapes; all of which are interacting with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Five Elements Chart&quot;&gt;[http://www.northernshaolinacademy.com/new/docs/FiveElementsChart.xls Chinese Five Elements Chart] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928105605/http://www.northernshaolinacademy.com/new/docs/FiveElementsChart.xls |date=2007-09-28}} Information on the Chinese Five Elements from Northern Shaolin Academy in Microsoft Excel 2003 Format&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a particular directional energy flow from one phase to the next, the interaction can be expansive, destructive, or exhaustive. A proper knowledge of each aspect of energy flow will enable the Feng Shui practitioner to apply certain cures or rearrangement of energy in a way they believe to be beneficial for the receiver of the Feng Shui Treatment.

==Dynastic transitions==
According to the Warring States period political philosopher Zou Yan {{lang|zh|鄒衍}} (c. 305–240 BCE), each of the five elements possesses a personified &quot;virtue&quot; (''de'' {{lang|zh|德}}), which indicates the foreordained destiny (''yun'' {{lang|zh|運}}) of a dynasty; accordingly, the cyclic succession of the elements also indicates dynastic transitions. Zou Yan claims that the Mandate of Heaven sanctions the legitimacy of a dynasty by sending self-manifesting auspicious signs in the ritual color (yellow, blue, white, red, and black) that matches the element of the new dynasty (Earth, Wood, Metal, Fire, and Water). From the Qin dynasty onward, most Chinese dynasties invoked the theory of the Five Elements to legitimize their reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wu 2006&quot; /&gt;

The interdependence of [[zang-fu]] networks in the body was said to be a circle of five things, and so mapped by the Chinese doctors onto the five phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine: In Depth|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm|website=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|accessdate=20 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404224358/https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm|archivedate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hafner|first1=Christopher|title=The TCM Organ Systems (Zang Fu)|url=https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/explore-healing-practices/what-traditional-chinese-medicine/what-qi-and-other-concepts/-tcm-organ-sy|website=University of Minnesota|accessdate=5 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406021051/https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/explore-healing-practices/what-traditional-chinese-medicine/what-qi-and-other-concepts/-tcm-organ-sy|archivedate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to explain the integrity and complexity of the human body, Chinese medical scientists used the Five Elements theory to classify the human body's organs, physiological activities, and pathological reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chineseherbsinfo.com/five-elements-theory/|title=Five Elements Theory (Wu Xing)|date=2019-10-27|website=Chinese Herbs Info|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ming neiyin=== 
In [[Zi wei dou shu|Ziwei]], ''neiyin'' ({{lang|zh|纳音}}) or the method of divination is the further classification of the Five Elements into 60 ''ming'' ({{lang|zh|命}}), or life orders, based on the [[ganzhi]]. Similar to the astrology zodiac, the ming is used by fortune-tellers to analyse a person's personality and future fate.

*The Chinese word {{lang|zh|青}} ''qīng'', has many meanings, including green, [[Azure (color)|azure]], [[cyan]], and black. It refers to green in wuxing.
*In most modern music, various five note or seven note scales (e.g., the major scale) are defined by selecting five or seven frequencies from the set of twelve semi-tones in the [[Equal tempered]] tuning. The Chinese &quot;lǜ&quot; tuning is closest to the ancient Greek tuning of Pythagoras.

==Martial arts==
[[T'ai chi ch'uan]] uses the five elements to designate different directions, positions or footwork patterns. Either forward, backward, left, right and centre, or three steps forward (attack) and two steps back (retreat).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wu 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Legitimation Discourse and the Theory of the Five Elements in Imperial China|last=Chen|first=Yuan|date=|publisher=Journal of Song-Yuan Studies|year=2014|isbn=|location=https://www.academia.edu/23276848/_Legitimation_Discourse_and_the_Theory_of_the_Five_Elements_in_Imperial_China._Journal_of_Song-Yuan_Studies_44_2014_325-364|pages=|origyear=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Steps ({{Lang|zh|五步}} wǔ bù):
*''Jìn bù'' ({{Lang|zh-hant|進步}}, in [[simplified characters]] {{Lang|zh-hans|进步}}) – forward step
*''Tùi bù'' ({{Lang|zh|退步}}) – backward step
*''Zǔo gù'' ({{Lang|zh-hant|左顧}}, in simplified characters {{Lang|zh-hans|左顾}}) – left step
*''Yòu pàn'' ({{Lang|zh|右盼}}) – right step
*''Zhōng dìng'' ({{Lang|zh|中定}}) – central position, balance, equilibrium

[[Xingyiquan]] uses the five elements metaphorically to represent five different states of combat.
