'''Charles Proteus Steinmetz''' (born '''Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz''', April 9, 1865&amp;nbsp;– October 26, 1923) was a German-born American [[mathematician]] and [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and professor at [[Union College]]. He fostered the development of [[alternating current]] that made possible the expansion of the [[electric power industry]] in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of [[hysteresis]] that enabled engineers to design better [[electrical machine|electromagnetic apparatus equipment]] including especially [[induction motor|electric motor]]s for use in industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=139|website=Invent Now, Inc.

==Early life==
[[File:Steinmetz Cabin.jpg|thumb|Steinmetz maintained a small cabin overlooking the [[Mohawk River]] near [[Schenectady, New York]].]]
Steinmetz was born '''Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz''' on April 9, 1865 in [[Wrocław|Breslau]], [[Province of Silesia]], [[Prussia]] (now [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]]) the son of Caroline (Neubert) and Karl Heinrich Steinmetz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clemens (2011)&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Clemens|first=Nora|title=Discovering the Nature of Energy|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group.|location=New York|isbn=978-1448847020|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781448847020/page/78 78]|edition=1st|author2=Greenberger, Robert|date=August 15, 2011|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781448847020/page/78}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kline|2014}} He was baptized a [[Lutheran]] into the [[Evangelical Church of Prussia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Garlin1977&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Garlin|1977|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=70I5ZKOYW_QC&amp;pg=PT16&amp;dq=Charles+Steinmetz+lutheran|title=Credo: Unitarians and Universalists of Yesteryear Talk about Their Lives and Motivations|date=September 25, 2018|publisher=Eric Cherry|via=Google Books|isbn=9780970549907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinmetz, who only stood four feet tall as an adult,&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; suffered from [[dwarfism]],{{sfn|Kline|2014}} [[Kyphosis|hunchback]],{{sfn|Kline|2014}} and [[Hip dysplasia (human)|hip dysplasia]], as did his father and grandfather. Steinmetz attended Johannes [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and astonished his teachers with his proficiency in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]].

Following the Gymnasium, Steinmetz went on to the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]] to begin work on his undergraduate degree in 1883. He was on the verge of finishing his doctorate in 1888 when he came under investigation by the German police for activities on behalf of a [[Socialism|socialist]] university group and articles he had written for a local socialist newspaper.

==Socialism and technocracy==
As socialist meetings and press had been banned in Germany, Steinmetz fled to [[Zürich]] in 1888 to escape possible arrest. Faced with an expiring visa, he emigrated to the United States in 1889. He changed his first name to &quot;Charles&quot; in order to sound more American, and chose the middle name &quot;[[Proteus]]&quot;, a wise hunchbacked character from the ''[[Odyssey]]'' who knew many secrets, after a childhood epithet given by classmates Steinmetz felt suited him.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Gilbert|title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the Wizard of Schenectady|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/charles-proteus-steinmetz-the-wizard-of-schenectady-51912022/#ixzz2lRMjrfit|website=Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 9, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornell University]] Professor Ronald R. Kline, the author of ''Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist'',&lt;ref&gt;Ronald R. Klein, Steinmetz: Engineer and Socialist (Johns Hopkins Studies in the History of Technology), 1992, {{ISBN|978-0801842986}}.&lt;/ref&gt; contended that other factors were more directly involved in Steinmetz's decision to leave his homeland, such as being in arrears with his tuition at the University and life at home with his father, stepmother, and their daughters being tension-filled.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

Despite his earlier efforts and interest in socialism, by 1922 Steinmetz concluded that socialism would never work in the United States, because the country lacked a &quot;powerful, centralized government of competent men, remaining continuously in office&quot;, and because &quot;only a small percentage of Americans accept this viewpoint today&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UC Mag (1998)&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Charles Steinmetz: Union's Electrical Wizard|magazine=Union College Magazine|date=November 1, 1998|url=http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=1512|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805190419/http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=1512|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=May 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the original [[Technical Alliance]], which also included [[Thorstein Veblen]] and [[Leland Olds]], Steinmetz had great faith in the ability of machines to eliminate human toil and create abundance for all. He put it this way: &quot;Some day we make the good things of life for everybody&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;we&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=workerseducation.org – Charles Proteus Steinmetz|url=http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/pamphlets/wiener/steinmetz.html|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering wizard==
[[File:Charles Proteus Steinmetz.jpg|thumb|upright|Steinmetz circa 1915]]
Steinmetz is known for his contribution in three major fields of [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] systems theory: [[magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]], [[steady state (electronics)|steady-state]] analysis, and [[transient (oscillation)|transients]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Note-1&quot;&gt;See also [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary|Electropedia]]'s: [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=351-45-16 hysteresis], [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=603-02-06 steady state of a system], [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=102-02-09 complex number] and [http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&amp;ievref=351-45-08 transient behaviour].&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC hysteresis theory===
Shortly after arriving in the United States, Steinmetz went to work for Rudolf Eickemeyer in [[Yonkers, New York]], and published in the field of magnetic hysteresis, earning worldwide professional recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEEPER (1996)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Magnetic Force of Charles Proteus Steinmetz |journal=IEEE Power Engineering Review |date=Feb 1996 |volume=16 |issue=9 |page=7 |doi=10.1109/MPER.1996.535476 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eickemeyer's firm developed [[transformer]]s for use in the [[electric power transmission|transmission of electrical power]] among many other mechanical and electrical devices. In 1893 Eickemeyer's company, along with all of its patents and designs, was bought by the newly formed [[General Electric]] Company, where Steinmetz quickly became known as the engineering wizard in GE's engineering community.&lt;ref name=&quot;IEEEPER (1996)&quot;/&gt;

===AC steady state circuit theory===
Steinmetz's work revolutionized [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|circuit theory and analysis]], which had been carried out using complicated, time-consuming [[calculus]]-based methods. In the groundbreaking paper, &quot;Complex Quantities and Their Use in Electrical Engineering&quot;, presented at a July 1893 meeting published in the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE)]], Steinmetz simplified these complicated methods to &quot;a simple problem of algebra&quot;. He systematized the use of [[complex number]] [[phasor]] representation in electrical engineering education texts, whereby the [[lower-case letter]] &quot;j&quot; is used to designate the 90-degree [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] operator in AC system analysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alger1976&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bedell (1942)&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=865|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456|year=1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; His seminal books and many other AIEE papers &quot;taught a whole generation of engineers how to deal with AC phenomena&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alger1976&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZSE (nodate)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Steinmetz, Putting it in Perspective - R, L, and C Elements and the Impedance Concept|url=http://zrno.fsb.hr/katedra/download/materijali/966.pdf|publisher=Zabreb School of Engineering|accessdate=December 21, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105044817/http://zrno.fsb.hr/katedra/download/materijali/966.pdf|archivedate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC transient theory===
Steinmetz also greatly advanced the understanding of [[lightning]].  His systematic experiments resulted in the first laboratory created &quot;man-made lightning&quot;, earning him the nickname the &quot;Forger of [[Thunderbolt]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hammond/&gt;  These were conducted in a football field-sized laboratory at General Electric, using 120,000 [[voltage|volt]] generators. He also erected a lightning tower to attract natural lightning in order to study its patterns and effects, which resulted in several theories.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Professional life==
Steinmetz acted in the following professional capacities:
* At Union College, as chair of electrical engineering from 1902 to 1913&lt;ref name=&quot;lemelson-mit&quot;&gt;lemelson.mit.edu website, [http://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/charles-steinmetz &quot;Charles Steinmetz&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and as faculty member thereafter until his death in 1923&lt;ref name=&quot;lemelson-mit&quot;/&gt;
* As a board member on the [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady Board of Education]] for six years, including four years as the board's president&lt;ref name=&quot;lemelson-mit&quot;/&gt;
* As a president of the [[Schenectady, New York|Common Council of Schenectady]]&lt;ref name=&quot;lemelson-mit&quot;/&gt; 
* As the [http://ethw.org/List_of_Presidents_of_the_American_Institute_of_Electrical_Engineers_(AIEE) president] of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers|AIEE]] from 1901 to 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Charles_Proteus_Steinmetz |title=Charles Proteus Steinmetz |author= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* As the first vice-president of the International Association of Municipal Electricians (IAME) {which became the [[International Municipal Signal Association|International Municipal Signal Association (IMSA)]]} from 1913 until his death in 1923.

He was granted an honorary degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1901&lt;ref name=&quot;lemelson-mit&quot;/&gt; and a doctorate from Union College in 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemelson-mit&quot;/&gt;

Steinmetz wrote 13 books and 60 articles, not exclusively about engineering.{{elucidate|date=July 2015}} He was a member and adviser to the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] at [[Union College]], whose chapter house there was one of the first ever electrified residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/union-college/docs/union_college_magazine-winter19|title=Union Magazine Winter 2019|website=Issuu|language=en|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While serving as president of the Schenectady Board of Education Steinmetz introduced numerous progressive reforms, including extended school hours, school meals, [[school nurse]]s, special classes for the children of immigrants, and the distribution of free textbooks.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt;

==Personal life==
In spite of his love for children and family life, Steinmetz remained unmarried, to prevent the spinal deformity afflicting himself, his father, and grandfather from being passed on to any offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt;

When Joseph LeRoy Hayden, a loyal and hardworking lab assistant, announced that he would marry and look for his own living quarters, Steinmetz made the unusual proposal of opening his large home, complete with research lab, [[greenhouse]], and office to the Haydens and their prospective family. Hayden favored the idea, but his future wife was very wary of the unorthodox setup. She finally agreed after Steinmetz's assurance that she could run the house as she saw fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt;

After an uneasy start, the arrangement worked well for all parties, especially after three Hayden children were born. Steinmetz legally adopted Joseph Hayden as his son, becoming grandfather to the youngsters, entertaining them with fantastic stories and spectacular scientific demonstrations. The unusual but harmonious living arrangements lasted for the rest of Steinmetz's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot; /&gt;

Steinmetz founded America's first glider club, but none of its prototypes &quot;could be dignified with the term 'flight'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crouch2002&quot;&gt;Crouch, Tom D.

Steinmetz was a lifelong [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hammond1924&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1924|p=447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Quoting from Hammond, &quot;This has placed him before the public as an atheist.* The title he did not deny.
