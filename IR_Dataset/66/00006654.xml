The '''Chicago Cubs''' are an American professional [[baseball]] team based in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. The Cubs compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League Central|Central]] division. The team plays its home games at [[Wrigley Field]], located on the city's [[Community areas in Chicago#North Side|North Side]]. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the other, the [[Chicago White Sox]], is a member of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League Central|Central]] division. The Cubs, first known as the White Stockings, were a founding member of the NL in [[1876 in baseball|1876]], becoming the Chicago Cubs in [[1903 Chicago Cubs season|1903]].&lt;!-- Please DO NOT change or remove this; the Cubs' 2014 Media Guide says the team has been in existence since 1876, per http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/downloads/y2014/2014_CHI_NL_Media_Guide.pdf#page=326. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thorn|first=John|title=Why Is the National Association Not a Major League … and Other Records Issues|url=http://ourgame.mlblogs.com/2015/05/04/why-is-the-national-association-not-a-major-league-and-other-records-issues/|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|website=OurGame.MLBlogs.com|date=May 4, 2015|accessdate=November 1, 2015|quote=The National Association, 1871–1875, shall not be considered as a 'major league' due to its erratic schedule and procedures, but it will continue to be recognized as the first professional baseball league.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cubs have appeared in a total of eleven World Series.  The [[1906 Chicago Cubs season|1906 Cubs]] won 116 games, finishing 116–36 and posting a modern-era record winning percentage of {{Winning percentage|116|36}}, before losing the [[1906 World Series|World Series]] to the [[1906 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] (&quot;The Hitless Wonders&quot;) by four games to two. The Cubs won back-to-back World Series championships in [[1907 World Series|1907]] and [[1908 World Series|1908]], becoming the first major league team to play in three consecutive World Series, and the first to win it twice.  Most recently, the Cubs won the [[2016 National League Championship Series]] and [[2016 World Series]], which ended a 71-year [[List of National League pennant winners|National League pennant]] drought and a 108-year World Series championship drought,&lt;ref name=&quot;mlb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://m.mlb.com/gameday/dodgers-vs-cubs/2016/10/22/487629?partnerId=LR_box#game_tab=box,game=487629,game_state=final |title = Dodgers vs. Cubs – 10/22/16 |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are record [[list of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|droughts in Major League Baseball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Helyar&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2823256 |first = John |last = Helyar |title = Lovable losers?

=== Early club history ===

====1876–1902: A National League====
[[File:1876 white stockings.jpg|thumb|left|160px|The 1876 White Stockings won the N.L. championship]]
The Cubs began playing in 1870 as the '''Chicago White Stockings''', joining the [[National League]] (NL) in 1876 as a charter member. Owner [[William Hulbert]] signed multiple star players, such as pitcher [[Albert Spalding]] and infielders [[Ross Barnes]], [[Deacon White]], and [[Cap Anson|Adrian &quot;Cap&quot; Anson]], to join the team prior to the N.L.'s first season. The White Stockings played their home games at [[West Side Grounds]] and quickly established themselves as one of the new league's top teams. Spalding won forty-seven games and Barnes led the league in hitting at .429 as Chicago won the first ever National League [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]], which at the time was the game's top prize.

After back-to-back pennants in 1880 and 1881, Hulbert died, and Spalding, who had retired to start [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, assumed ownership of the club. The White Stockings, with Anson acting as player-manager, captured their third consecutive pennant in 1882, and Anson established himself as the game's first true superstar. In 1885 and 1886, after winning N.L. pennants, the White Stockings met the champions of the short-lived [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in that era's version of a World Series. Both seasons resulted in matchups with the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Brown Stockings]], with the clubs tying in 1885 and with St. Louis winning in 1886. This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest [[Cardinals–Cubs rivalry|rivalries]] in sports. In all, the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886. As a result, Chicago's club nickname transitioned, and by [[1890 in baseball|1890]] they had become known as the '''Chicago Colts''',&lt;ref name=&quot;1890colts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1890.shtml |title = 1890 Chicago Colts |publisher = baseball-reference.com |access-date = August 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes &quot;Anson's Colts&quot;, referring to Cap's influence within the club. Anson was the first player in history credited with collecting [[3,000 hit club|3,000 career hits]]. After a disappointing record of 59–73 and a ninth-place finish in 1897, Anson was released by the Cubs as both a player and manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mW2wa33Q4EAC&amp;lpg=PP1 |title = 365 Oddball Days in Chicago Cubs History |publisher = Clerisys Press |year = 2010 |access-date = April 5, 2012 |isbn = 9781578603435 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Anson's absence from the club after 22 years, local newspaper reporters started to refer to the Colts as the &quot;Orphans&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt;

After the [[1900 in baseball|1900]] season, the [[American League|American Base-Ball League]] formed as a rival professional league, and incidentally the club's old White Stockings nickname (eventually shortened to White Sox) would be adopted by [[Chicago White Sox|a new American League neighbor to the south]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1898orphans&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1898.shtml |title = 1898 Chicago Orphans |publisher = baseball-reference.com |access-date = August 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1902–1920: A Cubs dynasty====
[[File:1906 Chicago Cubs.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 1906 Cubs won a record 116 of 154 games. They then won back-to-back World Series titles in 1907–08]] In 1902, Spalding, who by this time had revamped the roster to boast what would soon be one of the best teams of the early century, sold the club to [[Jim Hart (baseball)|Jim Hart]]. The franchise was nicknamed the Cubs by the ''Chicago Daily News'' in 1902, although not officially becoming the Chicago Cubs until the 1907 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;1903cubs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1903.shtml |title = 1903 Chicago Cubs |publisher = baseball-reference.com |access-date = August 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, which has become known as baseball's [[dead-ball era]], Cub [[infielder]]s [[Joe Tinker]], [[Johnny Evers]], and [[Frank Chance]] were made famous as a double-play combination by [[Franklin P. Adams]]' poem ''[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]''. The poem first appeared in the July 18, 1910 edition of the ''[[New York Evening Mail]]''. [[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai &quot;Three-Finger&quot; Brown]], [[Jack Taylor (20th century baseball player)|Jack Taylor]], [[Ed Reulbach]], [[Jack Pfiester]], and [[Orval Overall]] were several key pitchers for the Cubs during this time period. With Chance acting as player-manager from 1905 to 1912, the Cubs won four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Although they fell to the &quot;Hitless Wonders&quot; White Sox in the [[1906 World Series]], the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the [[List of best MLB season records|best winning percentage]] (.763) in Major League history. With mostly the same roster, Chicago won back-to-back World Series championships in [[1907 World Series|1907]] and [[1908 World Series|1908]], becoming the first Major League club to play three times in the Fall Classic and the first to win it twice. However, the Cubs would not win another World Series until [[2016 World Series|2016]]; this remains the longest championship drought in North American professional sports.

[[File:1913 Chicago Cubs.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;1913 Chicago Cubs&lt;/div&gt;]]
The next season, veteran catcher [[Johnny Kling]] left the team to become a professional [[pocket billiards]] player. Some historians think Kling's absence was significant enough to prevent the Cubs from also winning a third straight title in 1909, as they finished 6 games out of first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Three Finger |first = Cindy |last = Thomson |first2 = Scott |last2 = Brown |publisher = University of Nebraska Press |isbn = 0-8032-4448-7 |pages = 88–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kling returned the next year, the Cubs won the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] again, but lost to the Philadelphia Athletics in the [[1910 World Series]].

In 1914, advertising executive [[Albert Lasker]] obtained a large block of the club's shares and before the 1916 season assumed majority ownership of the franchise. Lasker brought in a wealthy partner, [[Charles Weeghman]], the proprietor of a popular chain of lunch counters who had previously owned the [[Chicago Whales]] of the short-lived [[Federal League]]. As principal owners, the pair moved the club from the West Side Grounds to the much newer [[Weeghman Park]], which had been constructed for the Whales only two years earlier, where they remain to this day. The Cubs responded by winning a pennant in the war-shortened season of 1918, where they played a part in [[Curse of the Bambino|another team's curse]]: the [[Boston Red Sox]] defeated [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]'s Cubs four games to two in the [[1918 World Series]], Boston's last Series championship until 2004.

Beginning in 1916, [[William Wrigley, Jr.|Bill Wrigley]] of chewing-gum fame acquired an increasing quantity of stock in the Cubs. By 1921 he was the majority owner, maintaining that status into the 1930s.

Meanwhile, the year 1919 saw the start of the tenure of [[William Veeck, Sr.|Bill Veeck, Sr.]] as team president. Veeck would hold that post throughout the 1920s and into the 30s. The management team of Wrigley and Veeck came to be known as the &quot;double-Bills.&quot;

===The Wrigley years (1921–1945)===

====1929–1938: Every three years====
[[File:1920 cub logo.svg|thumb|left|120px|Club logo 1927–1936&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/54 |title = Chicago Cubs Logos }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]Near the end of the first decade of the double-Bills' guidance, the Cubs won the NL Pennant in 1929 and then achieved the unusual feat of winning a pennant every three years, following up the 1929 flag with league titles in 1932, 1935, and 1938. Unfortunately, their success did not extend to the [[List of baseball jargon (F)|Fall Classic]], as they fell to their [[American League|AL]] rivals each time. The [[1932 World Series|'32 series]] against the [[1932 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] featured Babe Ruth's &quot;[[Babe Ruth's called shot|called shot]]&quot; at Wrigley Field in game three. There were some historic moments for the Cubs as well; In 1930, [[Hack Wilson]], one of the top home run hitters in the game, had one of the most impressive seasons in MLB history, hitting 56 home runs and establishing the current runs-batted-in record of 191. That 1930 club, which boasted six eventual hall of fame members (Wilson, [[Gabby Hartnett]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[George Kelly (baseball)|George &quot;High Pockets&quot; Kelly]], [[Kiki Cuyler]] and manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]]) established the current team batting average record of .309. In 1935 the Cubs claimed the pennant in thrilling fashion, winning a record 21 games in a row in September. The [[1938 Chicago Cubs season|'38 club]] saw [[Dizzy Dean]] lead the team's pitching staff and provided a historic moment when they won a crucial late-season game at Wrigley Field over the [[1938 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] with a [[walk-off home run]] by Gabby Hartnett, which became known in baseball [[folklore|lore]] as &quot;[[The Homer in the Gloamin']]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Marc |last = Zarefsky |title = 'Homer in the Gloamin' most memorable |date = August 8, 2007 |publisher = MLB.com |url = http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/chc/y2007/m07/d20/c2099223.jsp |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the &quot;Double-Bills&quot; (Wrigley and Veeck) died in 1932 and 1933 respectively, [[P.K. Wrigley]], son of Bill Wrigley, took over as majority owner. He was unable to extend his father's baseball success beyond 1938, and the Cubs slipped into years of mediocrity, although the Wrigley family would retain control of the team until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/17/sports/chicago-cubs-are-sold-by-wrigley-to-tribune-co-for-20.5million.html |title = CHICAGO CUBS ARE SOLD BY WRIGLEY TO TRIBUNE CO.

====1945/The Curse of the Billy Goat====
The Cubs enjoyed one more pennant at the close of World War II, finishing 98–56. Due to the wartime travel restrictions, the first three games of the [[1945 World Series]] were played in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit]], where the Cubs won two games, including a one-hitter by [[Claude Passeau]], and the final four were played at Wrigley. The Cubs lost the series, and did not return until the [[2016 World Series]]. After losing the 1945 World Series to the [[Detroit Tigers]], the Cubs finished with a respectable 82–71 record in the following year, but this was only good enough for third place.

In the following two decades, the Cubs played mostly forgettable baseball, finishing among the worst teams in the National League on an almost annual basis. From 1947 to 1966, they only notched one winning season. Longtime infielder-manager [[Phil Cavarretta]], who had been a key player during the 1945 season, was fired during spring training in 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above fifth place. Although shortstop [[Ernie Banks]] would become one of the star players in the league during the next decade, finding help for him proved a difficult task, as quality players such as [[Hank Sauer]] were few and far between. This, combined with poor ownership decisions such as the [[College of Coaches]], and the ill-fated trade of future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] member [[Lou Brock]] to the Cardinals for pitcher [[Ernie Broglio]] (who won only seven games over the next three seasons), hampered on-field performance.

====1969: Fall of '69====
{{Main article|1969 Chicago Cubs season}}
The late-1960s brought hope of a renaissance, with third baseman [[Ron Santo]], pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]], and outfielder [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] joining Banks. After losing a dismal 103 games in 1966, the Cubs brought home consecutive winning records in [[1967 Major League Baseball season|'67]] and [[1968 Major League Baseball season|'68]], marking the first time a Cub team had accomplished that feat in over two decades.

In {{mlby|1969}} the Cubs, managed by [[Leo Durocher]], built a substantial lead in the newly created [[National League East]]ern Division by mid-August. [[Ken Holtzman]] pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 {{frac|1|2}} games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 {{frac|1|2}} games over the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York Mets]]. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84–52 with the Mets in second place at 77–55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9–2 and 13–4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a two-out, two-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7–5 in extra innings.[6]
Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84–58 just 1⁄2 game in front. More of the same followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally.
After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84–60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85–57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.[1] The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92–70 record, would be remembered for having lost a remarkable 17½ games in the standings to the Mets in the last quarter of the season.

====1977–1979: June Swoon====
{{Main article|1977 Chicago Cubs season}}
Following the 1969 season, the club posted winning records for the next few seasons, but no playoff action. After the core players of those teams started to move on, the 70s got worse for the team, and they became known as &quot;the Loveable Losers.&quot; In {{mlby|1977}}, the team found some life, but ultimately experienced one of its [https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1977.shtml biggest collapses.] The Cubs hit a high-water mark on June 28 at 47–22, boasting an {{frac|8|1|2}} game NL East lead, as they were led by [[Bobby Murcer]] (27 HR/89 RBI), and [[Rick Reuschel]] (20–10). However, the [[1977 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] cut the lead to two by the All-star break, as the Cubs sat 19 games over .500, but they swooned late in the season, going 20–40 after July 31. The Cubs finished in fourth place at 81–81, while Philadelphia surged, finishing with 101 wins. The following two seasons also saw the Cubs get off to a fast start, as the team rallied to over 10 games above .500 well into both seasons, only to again wear down and play poorly later on, and ultimately settling back to mediocrity. This trait became known as the &quot;June Swoon&quot;. Again, the Cubs' unusually high number of day games is often pointed to as one reason for the team's inconsistent late season play.

Wrigley died in 1977. The Wrigley family sold the team to the [[Chicago Tribune]] in 1981, ending a 65-year family relationship with the Cubs.

====1984: Heartbreak====
{{Main article|1984 Chicago Cubs season}}
[[File:Pic of ryne sandberg from the early 90's.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ryne Sandberg set numerous league and club records in his career and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2005.]]After over a dozen more subpar seasons, in 1981 the Cubs hired GM [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]] from Philadelphia to turn around the franchise. Green had managed the 1980 Phillies to the World Series title. One of his early GM moves brought in a young Phillies minor-league 3rd baseman named Ryne Sandberg, along with Larry Bowa for Iván DeJesús. The 1983 Cubs had finished 71–91 under Lee Elia, who was fired before the season ended by Green. Green continued the culture of change and overhauled the Cubs roster, front-office and coaching staff prior to 1984. [[Jim Frey]] was hired to manage the 1984 Cubs, with [[Don Zimmer]] coaching 3rd base and [[Billy Connors]] serving as pitching coach.

Green shored&lt;ref name=1984Cubs/&gt; up the 1984 roster with a series of transactions. In December, 1983 [[Scott Sanderson (baseball)|Scott Sanderson]] was acquired from Montreal in a three-team deal with San Diego for [[Carmelo Martínez]]. Pinch hitter [[Richie Hebner]] (.333 BA in 1984) was signed as a free-agent. In spring training, moves continued: LF [[Gary Matthews]] and CF [[Bobby Dernier]] came from Philadelphia on March 26, for [[Bill Campbell (baseball)|Bill Campbell]] and a minor leaguer. Reliever Tim Stoddard (10–6 3.82, 7 saves) was acquired the same day for a minor leaguer; veteran pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was released.

The team's commitment to contend was complete when Green made a midseason deal on June 15 to shore up the starting rotation due to injuries to [[Rick Reuschel]] (5–5) and Sanderson. The deal brought 1979 NL Rookie of the Year pitcher [[Rick Sutcliffe]] from the Cleveland Indians. [[Joe Carter]] (who was with the Triple-A [[Iowa Cubs]] at the time) and right fielder [[Mel Hall]] were sent to Cleveland for Sutcliffe and back-up catcher Ron Hassey (.333 with Cubs in 1984). Sutcliffe (5–5 with the Indians) immediately joined Sanderson (8–5 3.14), Eckersley (10–8 3.03), [[Steve Trout]] (13–7 3.41) and [[Dick Ruthven]] (6–10 5.04) in the starting rotation. Sutcliffe proceeded to go 16–1 for Cubs and capture the [[Cy Young Award]].&lt;ref name=1984Cubs/&gt;

The Cubs 1984 starting lineup was very strong.&lt;ref name=1984Cubs/&gt; It consisted of LF Matthews (.291 14–82 101 runs 17 SB), C [[Jody Davis (baseball)|Jody Davis]] (.256 19–94), RF [[Keith Moreland]] (.279 16–80), SS [[Larry Bowa]] (.223 10 SB), 1B [[Leon &quot;Bull&quot; Durham]] (.279 23–96 16SB), CF Dernier (.278 45 SB), 3B [[Ron Cey]] (.240 25–97), Closer [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]](9–7 3.65 33 saves) and 1984 NL MVP [[Ryne Sandberg]] (.314 19–84 114 runs, 19 triples,32 SB).&lt;ref name=1984Cubs&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1984.shtml |title = 1984 Chicago Cubs Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics |work = Baseball-Reference.com |access-date = August 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reserve players Hebner, [[Thad Bosley]], [[Henry Cotto]], Hassey and [[Dave Owen (baseball)|Dave Owen]] produced exciting moments. The bullpen depth of [[Rich Bordi]], [[George Frazier (pitcher)|George Frazier]], [[Warren Brusstar]] and [[Dickie Noles]] did their job in getting the game to Smith or Stoddard.

At the top of the order, Dernier and Sandberg were exciting, aptly coined &quot;the Daily Double&quot; by [[Harry Caray]]. With strong defense – Dernier CF and Sandberg 2B, won the NL [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]]- solid pitching and clutch hitting, the Cubs were a well balanced team. Following the &quot;Daily Double&quot;, Matthews, Durham, Cey, Moreland and Davis gave the Cubs an order with no gaps to pitch around. Sutcliffe anchored a strong top-to-bottom rotation, and Smith was one of the top closers in the game.

The shift in the Cubs' fortunes was characterized June 23 on the &quot;NBC Saturday Game of the Week&quot; contest against the St. Louis Cardinals; it has since been dubbed simply &quot;[[The Sandberg Game]].&quot; With the nation watching and Wrigley Field packed, Sandberg emerged as a superstar with not one, but two game-tying home runs against Cardinals closer [[Bruce Sutter]]. With his shots in the 9th and 10th innings Wrigley Field erupted and Sandberg set the stage for a comeback win that cemented the Cubs as the team to beat in the East. No one would catch them.

In early August the Cubs swept the Mets in a 4-game home series that further distanced them from the pack. An infamous Keith Moreland-[[Ed Lynch (baseball)|Ed Lynch]] fight erupted after Lynch hit Moreland with a pitch, perhaps forgetting Moreland was once a linebacker at the University of Texas. It was the second game of a double header and the Cubs had won the first game in part due to a three run home run by Moreland. After the bench-clearing fight the Cubs won the second game, and the sweep put the Cubs at 68–45.

In 1984, each league had two divisions, East and West. The divisional winners met in a best-of-5 series to advance to the World Series, in a &quot;2–3&quot; format, first two games were played at the home of the team who did not have home field advantage. Then the last three games were played at the home of the team, with home field advantage. Thus the first two games were played at Wrigley Field and the next three at the home of their opponents, San Diego. A common and unfounded myth is that since Wrigley Field did not have lights at that time the National League decided to give the home field advantage to the winner of the NL West. In fact, home field advantage had rotated between the winners of the East and West since 1969 when the league expanded. In even numbered years, the NL West had home field advantage. In odd numbered years, the NL East had home field advantage. Since the NL East winners had had home field advantage in 1983, the NL West winners were entitled to it.

The confusion may stem from the fact that Major League Baseball did decide that, should the Cubs make it to the World Series, the American League winner would have home field advantage unless the Cubs hosted home games at an alternate site since the Cubs home field of Wrigley Field did not yet have lights. Rumor was the Cubs could hold home games across town at Comiskey Park, home of the American League's Chicago White Sox. Rather than hold any games in the cross town rival Sox Park, the Cubs made arrangements with the August A. Busch, owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, to use Busch Stadium in St. Louis as the Cubs &quot;home field&quot; for the World Series. This was approved by Major League Baseball and would have enabled the Cubs to host games 1 and 2, along with games 6 and 7 if necessary. At the time home field advantage was rotated between each league. Odd numbered years the AL had home field advantage. Even numbered years the NL had home field advantage. In the 1982 World Series the St. Louis Cardinals of the NL had home field advantage. In the 1983 World Series the Baltimore Orioles of the AL had home field advantage.

In the [[1984 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], the Cubs easily won the first two games at Wrigley Field against the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]]. The Padres were the winners of the Western Division with [[Steve Garvey]], [[Tony Gwynn]], [[Eric Show]], [[Goose Gossage]] and [[Alan Wiggins]]. With wins of 13–0 and 4–2, the Cubs needed to win only one game of the next three in San Diego to make it to the World Series. After being beaten in Game 3 7–1, the Cubs lost Game 4 when Smith, with the game tied 5–5, allowed a game-winning home run to Garvey in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 5 the Cubs took a 3–0 lead into the 6th inning, and a 3–2 lead into the seventh with Sutcliffe (who won the [[Cy Young Award]] that year) still on the mound. Then, Leon Durham had a sharp grounder go under his glove. This critical error helped the Padres win the game 6–3, with a 4-run 7th inning and keep Chicago out of the [[1984 World Series]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The loss ended a spectacular season for the Cubs, one that brought alive a slumbering franchise and made the Cubs relevant for a whole new generation of Cubs fans.

The Padres would be defeated in 5 games by Sparky Anderson's Tigers in the World Series.

[[File:Shawon Dunston.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Shawon Dunston was the Cubs shortstop for 10 years.]]The 1985 season brought high hopes. The club started out well, going 35–19 through mid-June, but injuries to Sutcliffe and others in the pitching staff contributed to a 13-game losing streak that pushed the Cubs out of contention.

====1989: NL East division championship====
{{Main article|1989 Chicago Cubs season}}
In 1989, the first full season with night baseball at Wrigley Field, [[Don Zimmer]]'s Cubs were led by a core group of veterans in [[Ryne Sandberg]], [[Rick Sutcliffe]] and [[Andre Dawson]], who were boosted by a crop of youngsters such as [[Mark Grace]], [[Shawon Dunston]], [[Greg Maddux]], Rookie of the Year [[Jerome Walton]], and Rookie of the Year Runner-Up Dwight Smith. The Cubs won the NL East once again that season winning 93 games. This time the Cubs met the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the [[1989 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. After splitting the first two games at home, the Cubs headed to the Bay Area, where despite holding a lead at some point in each of the next three games, bullpen meltdowns and managerial blunders ultimately led to three straight losses. The Cubs couldn't overcome the efforts of Will Clark, whose home run off Maddux, just after a managerial visit to the mound, led Maddux to think Clark knew what pitch was coming. Afterward, Maddux would speak into his glove during any mound conversation, beginning what is a norm today. Mark Grace was 11–17 in the series with 8 RBI. Eventually, the Giants lost to the &quot;[[Bash Brothers]]&quot; and the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the famous &quot;''[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]]''.&quot;

====1998: Wild card race and home run chase====
[[File:Howmanyout.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Sammy Sosa was the captain of the Chicago Cubs during his tenure with the team.]]
{{Main article|1998 Chicago Cubs season|1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase}}
The 1998 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster [[Harry Caray]]. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill, and the signing of [[Henry Rodríguez (outfielder)|Henry Rodríguez]] to bat cleanup provided protection for [[Sammy Sosa]] in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. [[Kevin Tapani]] led the club with a career high 19 wins while [[Rod Beck]] anchored a strong bullpen and [[Mark Grace]] turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower [[Kerry Wood]]. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the [[1998 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname ''&quot;Kid K,&quot;'' and ultimately earned him the 1998 [[NL Rookie of the Year]] award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger [[Mark McGwire]] transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the [[National League MVP Award]]. After a down-to-the-wire [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]] chase with the [[1998 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field. Third baseman [[Gary Gaetti]] hit the eventual game winning homer in the playoff game. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason for the first time since 1989 with a 90–73 regular season record. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager [[Jim Riggleman]]'s club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by [[1998 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/3375336|title=1998 marked banner year for Cubs|website=Major League Baseball|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Sosa discusses future, McGwire's Hall chances |date = December 4, 2006 |publisher = [[ESPN]] |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2683234 |agency = Associated Press |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in 1998, but, after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town [[1998 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.

====2001: Playoff push====
{{Main article|2001 Chicago Cubs season}}
Despite losing fan favorite Grace to free agency and the lack of production from newcomer [[Todd Hundley]], skipper [[Don Baylor]]'s Cubs put together a good season in 2001. The [[2001 Major League Baseball season|season]] started with Mack Newton being brought in to preach &quot;positive thinking.&quot; One of the biggest stories of the season transpired as the club made a midseason deal for [[Fred McGriff]], which was drawn out for nearly a month as McGriff debated waiving his [[no-trade clause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Cubs still waiting for McGriff's OK |date = July 14, 2001 |publisher = [[ESPN]] |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1226222&amp;type=news |agency = Associated Press |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs led the wild card race by 2.5 games in early September, but crumbled when [[Preston Wilson]] hit a three run walk off homer off of closer [[Tom Gordon|Tom &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon]], which halted the team's momentum. The team was unable to make another serious charge, and finished at 88–74, five games behind both [[2001 Houston Astros season|Houston]] and [[2001 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]], who tied for first. Sosa had perhaps his finest season and [[Jon Lieber]] led the staff with a 20-win season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/2001.shtml |title = 2001 Chicago Cubs Statistics and Roster |website = Baseball-Reference.com |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2003: Five more outs====
{{Main article|2003 Chicago Cubs season|Steve Bartman incident}}
The Cubs had high expectations in 2002, but the squad played poorly. On July 5, 2002, the Cubs promoted assistant general manager and player personnel director [[Jim Hendry]] to the General Manager position. The club responded by hiring [[Dusty Baker]] and by making some major moves in 2003. Most notably, they traded with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for outfielder [[Kenny Lofton]] and third baseman [[Aramis Ramírez]], and rode dominant pitching, led by Kerry Wood and [[Mark Prior]], as the Cubs led the division down the stretch.

[[File:Mark Prior.jpg|thumb|right|144px|Mark Prior, along with Kerry Wood, led the Cubs' rotation in 2003.]]

Chicago halted St. Louis' run to the playoffs by taking four of five games from the Cardinals at Wrigley Field in early September, after which they won their first division title in 14 years. They then went on to defeat the [[2003 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] in a dramatic five-game [[2003 National League Division Series|Division Series]], the franchise's first postseason series win since beating the [[Detroit Tigers]] in the [[1908 World Series]].

After losing an extra-inning game in Game 1, the Cubs rallied and took a three-games-to-one lead over the Wild Card [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] in the [[2003 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. Florida shut the Cubs out in Game 5, but the Cubs returned home to Wrigley Field with young pitcher [[Mark Prior]] to lead the Cubs in Game 6 as they took a 3–0 lead into the 8th inning. It was at this point when a now-infamous [[Steve Bartman incident|incident]] took place. Several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of [[Luis Castillo (baseball)|Luis Castillo]]. A Chicago Cubs fan by the name of [[Steve Bartman incident|Steve Bartman]], of Northbrook, Illinois, reached for the ball and deflected it away from the glove of [[Moisés Alou]] for the second out of the eighth inning. Alou reacted angrily toward the stands and after the game stated that he would have caught the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = Report: Alou initially said he would have caught the Bartman ball |year = 2004 |publisher = [[ESPN]] |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3423732170 |agency = Associated Press |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alou at one point recanted, saying he would not have been able to make the play, but later said this was just an attempt to make Bartman feel better and believing the whole incident should be forgotten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartman&quot;/&gt; Interference was not called on the play, as the ball was ruled to be on the spectator side of the wall. Castillo was eventually walked by Prior. Two batters later, and to the chagrin of the packed stadium, Cubs shortstop [[Alex Gonzalez (shortstop, born 1973)|Alex Gonzalez]] misplayed an inning-ending double play, loading the bases. The error would lead to eight Florida runs and a Marlin victory. Despite sending [[Kerry Wood]] to the mound and holding a lead twice, the Cubs ultimately dropped Game 7, and failed to reach the [[2003 World Series|World Series]].

The &quot;Steve Bartman incident&quot; was seen as the &quot;first domino&quot; in the turning point of the era, and the Cubs did not win a playoff game for the next eleven seasons.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |title = Baseball fan feels Chicago's fury |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3200582.stm |publisher = [[BBC News]] |website = bbcnews.com |date = October 17, 2003 |access-date = July 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2004–2006====
{{Main article|2004 Chicago Cubs season|2005 Chicago Cubs season|2006 Chicago Cubs season}}
In [[2004 Major League Baseball season|2004]], the Cubs were a consensus pick by most media outlets to win the World Series. The offseason acquisition of [[Derek Lee (baseball)|Derek Lee]] (who was acquired in a trade with Florida for [[Hee-seop Choi]]) and the return of [[Greg Maddux]] only bolstered these expectations. Despite a mid-season deal for [[Nomar Garciaparra]], misfortune struck the Cubs again. They led the Wild Card by 1.5 games over [[2004 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]] and [[2004 Houston Astros season|Houston]] on September 25. On that day, both teams lost, giving the Cubs a chance at increasing the lead to 2.5 games with only eight games remaining in the season, but reliever [[LaTroy Hawkins]] blew a save to the [[2004 New York Mets season|Mets]], and the Cubs lost the game in extra innings. The defeat seemingly deflated the team, as they proceeded to drop six of their last eight games as the Astros won the Wild Card.
[[File:RyanDempster.jpg|thumb|left|144px|Dempster emerged in 2004 and became the Cubs' regular closer.]]
Despite the fact that the Cubs had won 89 games, this fallout was decidedly unlovable, as the Cubs traded superstar [[Sammy Sosa]] after he had left the season's final game early and then lied about it publicly. Already a controversial figure in the clubhouse after his [[Sammy Sosa#Corked bat incident|corked-bat incident]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Jayson |last = Stark |title = Sosa's legacy could be broken beyond repair |date = 2004-06-02 |publisher = [[ESPN]] |url = http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/stark_jayson/1562825.html |access-date = June 11, 2008 |authorlink = Jayson Stark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sammy's actions alienated much of his once strong fan base as well as the few teammates still on good terms with him, (many teammates grew tired of Sosa playing loud [[salsa music]] in the locker room) and possibly tarnished his place in Cubs' lore for years to come.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The disappointing season also saw fans start to become frustrated with the constant injuries to ace pitchers Mark Prior and Kerry Wood. Additionally, the 2004 season led to the departure of popular commentator [[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]], who had become increasingly critical of management during broadcasts and was verbally attacked by reliever [[Kent Mercker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Cubs shocked by Stone's comments |date = 2004-10-05 |publisher = [[ESPN]] |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1893170 |agency = Associated Press |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Things were no better in [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005]], despite a career year from first baseman [[Derrek Lee]] and the emergence of closer [[Ryan Dempster]]. The club struggled and suffered more key injuries, only managing to win 79 games after being picked by many to be a serious contender for the N.L. pennant. In 2006, bottom fell out as the Cubs finished 66–96, last in the [[NL Central]].

====2007–2008: Back to back division titles====
[[File:Alfonso Soriano 4.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Alfonso Soriano signed with the club in 2007]]
{{Main article|2007 Chicago Cubs season|2008 Chicago Cubs season}}
After finishing last in the NL Central with 66 wins in 2006, the Cubs re-tooled and went from &quot;worst to first&quot; in 2007. In the offseason they signed [[Alfonso Soriano]] to a contract at eight years for $136 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Muscat |first = Carrie |date = November 20, 2006 |url = http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20061120&amp;content_id=1743683&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc |title = Cubs complete blockbuster with Soriano |publisher = MLB.com |access-date = July 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced manager [[Dusty Baker]] with fiery veteran manager [[Lou Piniella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/team/coach_staff_bio.jsp?c_id=chc&amp;coachorstaffid=120586 |title = Lou Piniella Bio |publisher = MLB.com |access-date = July 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a rough start, which included a brawl between [[Michael Barrett (baseball)|Michael Barrett]] and [[Carlos Zambrano]], the Cubs overcame the [[2007 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]], who had led the division for most of the season. The Cubs traded Barrett to the Padres, and later acquired catcher [[Jason Kendall]] from Oakland. Kendall was highly successful with his management of the pitching rotation and helped at the plate as well. By September, [[Geovany Soto]] became the full-time starter behind the plate, replacing the veteran Kendall. Winning streaks in June and July, coupled with a pair of dramatic, late-inning wins against the [[2007 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]], led to the Cubs ultimately clinching the NL Central with a record of 85–77. They met [[2007 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona]] in the [[2007 National League Division Series|NLDS]], but controversy followed as Piniella, in a move that has since come under scrutiny,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = David |last = Sheinin |title = Cleveland...

The Cubs successfully defended their National League Central title in [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008]], going to the postseason in consecutive years for the first time since 1906–08. The offseason was dominated by three months of unsuccessful trade talks with the [[Baltimore Orioles|Orioles]] involving 2B [[Brian Roberts (baseball)|Brian Roberts]], as well as the signing of [[Chunichi Dragons]] star [[Kosuke Fukudome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Lucy |last = Nicholson |title = Cubs Sign Fukudome |date = December 12, 2007 |url = http://chicagoist.com/2007/12/12/cubs_sign_fukud.php |work = Chicagoist.com |access-date = July 14, 2008 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090102134510/http://chicagoist.com/2007/12/12/cubs_sign_fukud.php |archivedate = January 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team recorded their 10,000th win in April, while establishing an early division lead.

The Cubs took control of the division by sweeping a four-game series in Milwaukee. On September 14, in a game moved to [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]] due to [[Hurricane Ike]], Zambrano pitched a no-hitter against the [[2008 Houston Astros season|Astros]], and six days later the team clinched by beating [[2008 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] at Wrigley.

===The Ricketts era (2009–present)===
The Ricketts family acquired a majority interest in the Cubs in 2009, ending the Tribune years. Apparently handcuffed by the Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts siblings, led by chairman [[Thomas S. Ricketts]], the [[2009 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]]' quest for a NL Central three-peat started with notice that there would be less invested into contracts than in previous years. Chicago engaged [[2009 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] in a see-saw battle for first place into August 2009, but the Cardinals played to a torrid 20–6 pace that month, designating their rivals to battle in the Wild Card race, from which they were eliminated in the season's final week. The Cubs were plagued by injuries in 2009, and were only able to field their Opening Day starting lineup three times the entire season. Third baseman Aramis Ramírez injured his throwing shoulder in an early May game against the Milwaukee Brewers, sidelining him until early July and forcing journeyman players like [[Mike Fontenot]] and [[Aaron Miles]] into more prominent roles. Additionally, key players like Derrek Lee (who still managed to hit .306 with 35 HR and 111 RBI that season), Alfonso Soriano, and Geovany Soto also nursed nagging injuries. The Cubs posted a winning record (83–78) for the third consecutive season, the first time the club had done so since [[1972 Chicago Cubs season|1972]], and a new era of ownership under the Ricketts family was approved by MLB owners in early October.

====2010–2014: The decline and rebuild====
{{Main article|2010 Chicago Cubs season|2011 Chicago Cubs season|2012 Chicago Cubs season|2013 Chicago Cubs season|2014 Chicago Cubs season}}
[[File:Starlin Castro 09-05-2010.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Starlin Castro during his 2010 rookie season.]]Rookie [[Starlin Castro]] debuted in early May (2010) as the starting shortstop. However, the club played poorly in the early season, finding themselves 10 games under .500 at the end of June. In addition, long-time ace Carlos Zambrano was pulled from a game against the White Sox on June 25 after a tirade and shoving match with Derrek Lee, and was suspended indefinitely by Jim Hendry, who called the conduct &quot;unacceptable.&quot; On August 22, Lou Piniella, who had already announced his retirement at the end of the season, announced that he would leave the Cubs prematurely to take care of his sick mother. [[Mike Quade]] took over as the interim manager for the final 37 games of the year. Despite being well out of playoff contention the Cubs went 24–13 under Quade, the best record in baseball during that 37 game stretch, earning Quade the manager position going forward on October 19.

On December 3, 2010, Cubs broadcaster and former third baseman, [[Ron Santo]], died due to complications from bladder cancer and diabetes. He spent 13 seasons as a player with the Cubs, and at the time of his death was regarded as one of the greatest players not in the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/news/story?id=5703131 |title = Sports.espn.go.com |publisher = Sports.espn.go.com |date = October 20, 2010 |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously elected to the [[Major League Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2012.

Despite trading for pitcher [[Matt Garza]] and signing free-agent slugger [[Carlos Peña]], the Cubs finished the [[2011 Chicago Cubs season|2011 season]] 20 games under .500 with a record of 71–91. Weeks after the season came to an end, the club was rejuvenated in the form of a new philosophy, as new owner Tom Ricketts signed [[Theo Epstein]] away from the [[Boston Red Sox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/chi-chicago-cubs-hire-theo-epstein,0,2913884.story |work = Chicago Tribune |first = Paul |last = Sullivan |title = Done deal: Cubs land Epstein from Red Sox }}&lt;/ref&gt; naming him club President and giving him a five-year contract worth over $18 million, and subsequently discharged manager Mike Quade. Epstein, a proponent of [[sabremetrics]] and one of the architects of the [[2004 World Series|2004]] and [[2007 World Series]] championships in Boston, brought along [[Jed Hoyer]] from the [[San Diego Padres|Padres]] to fill the role of GM and hired [[Dale Sveum]] as manager. Although the team had a dismal 2012 season, losing 101 games (the worst record since 1966), it was largely expected. The youth movement ushered in by Epstein and Hoyer began as longtime fan favorite Kerry Wood retired in May, followed by [[Ryan Dempster]] and [[Geovany Soto]] being traded to [[2012 Texas Rangers season|Texas]] at the All-Star break for a group of minor league prospects headlined by [[Christian Villanueva]], but also included little thought of [[Kyle Hendricks]]. The development of Castro, [[Anthony Rizzo (baseball)|Anthony Rizzo]], [[Darwin Barney]], [[Brett Jackson]] and pitcher [[Jeff Samardzija]], as well as the replenishing of the minor-league system with prospects such as [[Javier Baez]], [[Albert Almora]], and [[Jorge Soler]] became the primary focus of the season, a philosophy which the new management said would carry over at least through the 2013 season.
[[File:Anthony Rizzo 2012.jpg|thumb|right|180px|One of two Cubs building blocks, Anthony Rizzo, swinging in the box.]]
The [[2013 Chicago Cubs season|2013 season]] resulted in much as the same the year before. Shortly before the trade deadline, the Cubs traded [[Matt Garza]] to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Mike Olt]], [[Carl Edwards Jr.|Carl Edwards Jr]], [[Neil Ramirez]], and [[Justin Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/dallas/mlb/story/_/id/9500209/texas-rangers-trade-matt-garza-chicago-cubs |title = Texas Rangers trade for Matt Garza of Chicago Cubs |publisher = ESPN |date = July 23, 2013 |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, the Cubs sent [[Alfonso Soriano]] to the [[New York Yankees]] for minor leaguer [[Corey Black]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Matt EhaltESPN New York contributorArchive |url = http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/9511031/alfonso-soriano-traded-new-york-yankees-chicago-cubs |title = Alfonso Soriano traded to New York Yankees from Chicago Cubs |publisher = ESPN |date = July 26, 2013 |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mid season fire sale led to another last place finish in the NL Central, finishing with a record of 66–96. Although there was a five-game improvement in the record from the year before, [[Anthony Rizzo (baseball)|Anthony Rizzo]] and [[Starlin Castro]] seemed to take steps backward in their development. On September 30, 2013, [[Theo Epstein]] made the decision to fire manager [[Dale Sveum]] after just two seasons at the helm of the Cubs. The regression of several young players was thought to be the main focus point, as the front office said Sveum would not be judged based on wins and losses. In two seasons as skipper, Sveum finished with a record of 127–197.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/9748610/chicago-cubs-fire-manager-dale-sveum-two-years |title = Chicago Cubs fire manager Dale Sveum after two years |publisher = ESPN |date = October 1, 2013 |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 season was also notable as the Cubs drafted future Rookie of the Year and MVP [[Kris Bryant]] with the second overall selection.

On November 7, 2013, the Cubs hired [[San Diego Padres]] bench coach [[Rick Renteria]] to be the 53rd manager in team history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/chc/cubs-name-rick-renteria-manager?ymd=20131106&amp;content_id=63720570&amp;vkey=news_chc |title = Cubs name Rick Renteria manager |publisher = Major League Baseball |date = November 7, 2013 |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs finished the [[2014 Chicago Cubs season|2014 season]] in last place with a 73–89 record in Rentería's first and only season as manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Rogers |first1 = Jesse |title = Cubs fire manager Rick Renteria after one season |url = http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/11797575/chicago-cubs-fire-manager-rick-renteria-one-season |publisher = ESPN Chicago |access-date = October 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the poor record, the Cubs improved in many areas during 2014, including rebound years by Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro, ending the season with a winning record at home for the first time since 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cubsinsider.com/cubs-notes-arrieta-cards-cubs-end-year-winning-record-wrigley/ |title = Cubs Notes: Arrieta Does It All Against Cards, Cubs End Year With Winning Record at Wrigley |publisher = cubsinsider.com |date = 2014-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and compiling a 33–34 record after the All-Star Break. However, following unexpected availability of Joe Maddon when he exercised a clause that triggered on October 14 with the departure of General Manager Andrew Friedman to the Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/sports/baseball/manager-joe-maddon-opts-out-of-tampa-bay-rays-contract.html|title=A Manager Opts Out to Test Free Agency|last=Kepner|first=Tyler|date=2014-10-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Cubs relieved Rentería of his managerial duties on October 31, 2014. During the season, the Cubs drafted [[Kyle Schwarber]] with the fourth overall selection.

Hall of Famer [[Ernie Banks]] died of a heart attack on January 23, 2015, shortly before his 84th birthday.&lt;ref name=Attack&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Gonzalez |first1 = Mark |last2 = Ziezulewicz |first2 = Geoff |title = Cubs legend Ernie Banks died of heart attack |url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-ernie-banks-presser-met-20150125-story.html |work = [[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date = January 25, 2015 |date = January 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 uniform carried a commemorative #14 patch on both its home and away jerseys in his honor.

On November 2, 2014, the Cubs announced that [[Joe Maddon]] had signed a five-year contract to be the [[List of Chicago Cubs managers|54th manager]] in team history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://m.cubs.mlb.com/news/article/100210426/chicago-cubs-hiring-joe-maddon-to-replace-rick-renteria |title = Cubs bring in Maddon, let Rentería go |publisher = [[MLB.com]] |date = November 2, 2014 |access-date = November 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 10, 2014, Maddon announced that the team had signed free agent [[Jon Lester]] to a six-year, $155 million contract. Many other trades and acquisitions occurred during the off season. The opening day lineup for the Cubs contained five new players including center fielder [[Dexter Fowler]]. Rookies [[Kris Bryant]] and [[Addison Russell]] were in the starting lineup by mid-April, and rookie [[Kyle Schwarber]] was added in mid-June. On August 30, [[Jake Arrieta]] threw a no hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Cubs' Jake Arrieta throws no-hitter vs. Dodgers |url = http://chicago.suntimes.com/baseball/7/71/920216/cubs-jake-arrieta-throws-hitter-vs-dodgers |work = Chicago Sun-Times |access-date = August 31, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150902155409/http://chicago.suntimes.com/baseball/7/71/920216/cubs-jake-arrieta-throws-hitter-vs-dodgers |archive-date = 2015-09-02 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs finished the 2015 season in third place in the NL Central, with a record of 97–65, the third best record in the majors and earned a wild card berth.

In an attempt to be the first team to repeat as World Series champions since the Yankees in [[1998 New York Yankees season|1998]], [[1999 New York Yankees season|1999]], and [[2000 New York Yankees season|2000]], the Cubs struggled for most of the first half of the [[2017 Chicago Cubs season|2017 season]], never moving more than four games over .500 and finishing the first half two games under .500. On July 15, the Cubs fell to a season-high 5.5 games out of first in the NL Central. The Cubs struggled mainly due to their pitching as Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester struggled and no starting pitcher managed to win more than 14 games (four pitchers won 15 games or more for the Cubs in 2016). The Cub offense also struggled as Kyle Schwarber batted near .200 for most of the first half and was even sent to the minors. However, the Cubs recovered in the second half of the season to finish 22 games over .500 and win the NL Central by six games over the [[2017 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]]. The Cubs pulled out a five-game [[2017 National League Division Series|NLDS]] series win over the [[2017 Washington Nationals season|Washington Nationals]] to advance to the NLCS for the third consecutive year.

The Cubs have played their home games at [[Wrigley Field]], also known as ''&quot;The Friendly Confines&quot;'' since 1916. It was built in 1914 as '''Weeghman Park''' for the [[Chicago Whales]], a [[Federal League]] baseball team. The Cubs also shared the park with the [[Chicago Bears]] of the NFL for 50 years. The ballpark includes a manual scoreboard, ivy-covered brick walls, and relatively small dimensions.

Located in Chicago's [[Lake View, Chicago|Lake View]] neighborhood, Wrigley Field sits on an irregular block bounded by Clark and Addison Streets and Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. The area surrounding the ballpark is typically referred to as Wrigleyville. There is a dense collection of sports bars and restaurants in the area, most with baseball inspired themes, including Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers and [[The Cubby Bear]]. Many of the apartment buildings surrounding Wrigley Field on Waveland and Sheffield Avenues have built bleachers on their [[Wrigley Rooftops|rooftops]] for fans to view games and other sell space for advertisement. One building on Sheffield Avenue has a sign atop its roof which says &quot;Eamus Catuli!&quot; which is [[Latin]] for &quot;Let's Go Cubs!&quot; and another chronicles the time since the last Division title, pennant, and World Series championship. The 00 denotes the 2016 NL Central title, NL pennant, and the World Series championship. On game days, many residents rent out their yards and driveways to people looking for parking spots. The uniqueness of the neighborhood itself has ingrained itself into the culture of the Chicago Cubs as well as the Wrigleyville neighborhood, and has led to being used for concerts and other sporting events, such as the 2010 [[NHL Winter Classic]] between the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]], as well as a 2010 [[NCAA]] men's football game between the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini]].

In 2013, Tom Ricketts and team president Crane Kenney unveiled plans for a five-year, $575 million privately funded renovation of Wrigley Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/05/01/photos-of-planned-wrigley-renovations-revealed/ |title = Photos Of Planned Wrigley Renovation Revealed |work = CBS Chicago |location = Chicago |publisher = WBBM-TV |date = May 1, 2013 |access-date = July 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Cubs Hint at Paying for Renovations |first = Ben |last = Strauss |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/baseball/cubs-unveil-wrigley-field-plans-hinting-at-picking-up-tab.html |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = January 20, 2013 |access-date = January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Called the 1060 Project, the proposed plans included vast improvements to the stadium's facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, [[press box]], [[bullpen]]s, and clubhouses, as well as a {{convert|6,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}t [[jumbotron]] to be added in the left field bleachers, [[Batting cage|batting tunnels]], a {{convert|3,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} video board in right field, and, eventually, an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Selling of Wrigley Field Renovation Plan Begins |first = Paul |last = Sullivan |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-20/sports/chi-wrigley-20130120_1_cubs-plan-wrigley-field-president-crane-kenney |newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] |date = January 20, 2013 |access-date = January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous years mostly all efforts to conduct any large-scale renovations to the field had been opposed by the city, former mayor [[Richard M.

Months of negotiations between the team, a group of rooftop properties investors, local Alderman [[Tom Tunney]], and Chicago Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]] followed with the eventual endorsements of the city's [[Commission on Chicago Landmarks|Landmarks Commission]], the [[Chicago Plan Commission|Plan Commission]] and final approval by the [[Chicago City Council]] in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Spielman |first1 = Fran |title = City Plan Commission approves Wrigley Field revamp |url = http://www.suntimes.com/news/21400523-418/city-plan-commission-approves-wrigley-field-revamp.html#.VDXP9Wd0xYd |work = Chicago Sun-Times |access-date = October 9, 2014 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141015025120/http://www.suntimes.com/news/21400523-418/city-plan-commission-approves-wrigley-field-revamp.html#.VDXP9Wd0xYd |archivedate = October 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began at the conclusion of the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Mooney |first1 = Patrick |title = The 1060 Project: World Series Dreaming |url = http://www.chicagonow.com/world-series-dreaming/2014/10/the-1060-project/ |work = Chicago Now |access-date = October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bleacher Bums ===
The &quot;[[Bleacher Bums]]&quot; is a name given to fans, many of whom spend much of the day heckling, who sit in the bleacher section at Wrigley Field. Initially, the group was called &quot;bums&quot; because they attended most of the games, and as Wrigley did not yet have lights, these were all day games, so it was jokingly presumed these fans were jobless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-michael-haley-obituary-20170113-story.html |title=Mike Haley, an original 'Bleacher Bum' beloved by Cubs fans and players, dies |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2017-10-13 |accessdate=2018-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Broadway play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.moviecitynews.com/Interviews/santo.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100109014716/http://www.moviecitynews.com/Interviews/santo.html |archive-date = January 9, 2010 |title = Jeff Santo }}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Joe Mantegna]], [[Dennis Farina]], [[Dennis Franz]], and [[James Belushi]] ran for years and was based on a group of Cub fans who frequented the club's games.

=== Cubs Win Flag ===
{{Multiple image

{{Main article|Cubs Win Flag}}
Beginning in the days of P.K. Wrigley and the 1937 bleacher/scoreboard reconstruction, and prior to modern media saturation, a flag with either a &quot;W&quot; or an &quot;L&quot; has flown from atop the scoreboard masthead, indicating the day's result(s) when baseball was played at Wrigley. In case of a split [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], both the &quot;W&quot; and &quot;L&quot; flags are flown.

Past Cubs media guides show that originally the flags were blue with a white &quot;W&quot; and white with a blue &quot;L&quot;. In 1978, consistent with the dominant colors of the flags, blue and white lights were mounted atop the scoreboard, denoting &quot;win&quot; and &quot;loss&quot; respectively for the benefit of nighttime passers-by.

The flags were replaced by 1990, the first year in which the Cubs media guide reports the switch to the now familiar colors of the flags: White with blue &quot;W&quot; and blue with white &quot;L&quot;. In addition to needing to replace the worn-out flags, by then the retired numbers of Banks and Williams were flying on the foul poles, as white with blue numbers; so the &quot;good&quot; flag was switched to match that scheme.

This long-established tradition has evolved to fans carrying the white-with-blue-W flags to both home and away games, and displaying them after a Cub win. The flags are known as the [[Cubs Win Flag]]. The flags have become more and more popular each season since 1998, and are now even sold as T-shirts with the same layout. In 2009, the tradition spilled over to the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] as [[Chicago Blackhawks]] fans adopted a red and black &quot;W&quot; flag of their own.

During the early and mid-2000s, Chip Caray usually declared that a Cubs win at home meant it was ''&quot;White flag time at Wrigley!&quot;''  More recently, the Cubs have promoted the phrase &quot;Fly the W!&quot; among fans and on social media.

=== Mascots ===
[[File:Clark-the-Cub-01.jpg|thumb|right|Clark (left) with the Oriole Bird]]
{{See also|Clark (mascot)}}
The official Cubs team [[mascot]] is a young bear cub, named [[Clark (mascot)|Clark]], described by the team's press release as a young and friendly Cub. Clark made his debut at Advocate Health Care on January 13, 2014, the same day as the press release announcing his installation as the club's first ever official physical mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Snyder |first = Matt |url = http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/24408433/cubs-announce-new-mascot-clark-a-young-friendly-cub |title = Cubs announce new mascot, Clark, a 'young, friendly cub' |publisher = CBSSports.com |date =  |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bear cub itself was used in the clubs since the early 1900s and was the inspiration of the Chicago Staleys changing their team's name to the [[Chicago Bears]], because the Cubs allowed the bigger football players—like bears to cubs—to play at Wrigley Field in the 1930s.

The Cubs had no official physical mascot prior to Clark, though a man in a 'polar bear' looking outfit, called &quot;The Bear-man&quot; (or Beeman), which was mildly popular with the fans, paraded the stands briefly in the early 1990s. There is no record of whether or not he was just a fan in a costume or employed by the club.  Through the 2013 season, there were &quot;Cubbie-bear&quot; mascots outside of Wrigley on game day, but none were employed by the team. They pose for pictures with fans for tips. The most notable of these was &quot;Billy Cub&quot; who worked outside of the stadium for over six years until July 2013, when the club asked him to stop. Billy Cub, who is played by fan John Paul Weier, had unsuccessfully petitioned the team to become the official mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=9181458 |title = Chicago Cubs tell unofficial 'Billy Cub' mascot to stop &amp;#124; abc7chicago.com |publisher = Abclocal.go.com |date = 2013-07-22 |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another unofficial but much more well-known mascot is [[Ronnie Woo Woo|Ronnie &quot;Woo Woo&quot; Wickers]]&lt;ref name=A&gt;{{cite news |first = William |last = Hageman |title = A Fan in Winter |work = Chicago Tribune |date = February 27, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is a longtime fan and local celebrity in the Chicago area. He is known to Wrigley Field visitors for his idiosyncratic cheers at baseball games, generally punctuated with an exclamatory &quot;Woo!&quot; (e.g., &quot;Cubs, woo! Cubs, woo! Big-Z, woo! [[Carlos Zambrano (baseball)|Zambrano]], woo! Cubs, woo!&quot;) Longtime Cubs announcer [[Harry Caray]] dubbed Wickers &quot;Leather Lungs&quot; for his ability to shout for hours at a time.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{cite news |first = Maura |last = Kelly |title = 'Leather Lungs' a hit at Wrigley, wooing fans with schtick and song |work = Boston Globe |date = May 28, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is not employed by the team, although the club has on two separate occasions allowed him into the broadcast booth and allow him some degree of freedom once he purchases or is given a ticket by fans to get into the games. He is largely allowed to roam the park and interact with fans by Wrigley Field security.

=== Music ===
During the summer of 1969, a Chicago studio group produced a single record called &quot;Hey Hey! Holy Mackerel! (The Cubs Song)&quot; whose title and lyrics incorporated the catch-phrases of the respective TV and radio announcers for the Cubs, [[Jack Brickhouse]] and [[Vince Lloyd]]. Several members of the Cubs recorded an album called ''Cub Power'' which contained a cover of the song. The song received a good deal of local airplay that summer, associating it very strongly with that bittersweet season. It was played much less frequently thereafter, although it remained an unofficial Cubs theme song for some years after.

For many years, Cubs radio broadcasts started with &quot;It's a Beautiful Day for a Ball Game&quot; by the Harry Simeone Chorale. In 1979, Roger Bain released a 45 rpm record of his song &quot;Thanks Mr. Banks&quot;, to honor &quot;Mr. Cub&quot; Ernie Banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://rogerbaindemo.com/ |title = RogerBaindemo.com |publisher = rogerbaindemo.com |access-date = August 31, 2009 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090529040804/http://rogerbaindemo.com/ |archivedate = May 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;[[Go, Cubs, Go|Go, Cubs, Go!]]&quot; by [[Steve Goodman]] was recorded early in the 1984 season, and was heard frequently during that season. Goodman died in September of that year, four days before the Cubs clinched the National League Eastern Division title, their first title in 39 years. Since 1984, the song started being played from time to time at [[Wrigley Field]]; since 2007, the song has been played over the loudspeakers following each Cubs home victory.

[[The Mountain Goats]] recorded a song entitled &quot;Cubs in Five&quot; on its 1995 EP [[Nine Black Poppies]] which refers to the seeming impossibility of the Cubs winning a World Series in both its title and Chorus.

In 2007, [[Pearl Jam]] frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] composed a song dedicated to the team called &quot;[[All the Way (Eddie Vedder song)|All the Way]]&quot;. Vedder, a Chicago native, and lifelong Cubs fan, composed the song at the request of Ernie Banks.
Pearl Jam has played this song live multiple times several of which occurring at Wrigley Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = All The Way |url = http://www.pearljam.com/music/lyrics/all/all/21111/all_the_way |publisher = Pearl Jam |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090713021811/http://www.pearljam.com/song/all-way |archive-date = July 13, 2009 |access-date = November 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = All the Way by Eddie Vedder Song Statistics &amp;#124; setlist.fm |url = http://www.setlist.fm/stats/songs/eddie-vedder-6bd6a2e2.html?song=All+the+Way |access-date = November 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Vedder has played this song live twice, at his solo shows at the Chicago Auditorium on August 21 and 22, 2008.

An album entitled ''Take Me Out to a Cubs Game'' was released in 2008.

The 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' showed a game played by the Cubs when Ferris' principal goes to a bar looking for him.

The 1989 film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' depicts the Chicago Cubs defeating a baseball team from [[Miami]] in the [[2015 World Series]], ending the [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts#Longest current World Series championship drought|longest championship drought]] in all four of the major [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American professional sports leagues]]. In 2015, the [[Miami Marlins]] failed to make the playoffs but the Cubs were able to make it to the [[2015 National League Wild Card Game|2015 National League Wild Card]] round and move on to the [[2015 National League Championship Series]] by October 21, 2015, the date where protagonist [[Marty McFly]] traveled to the future in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Oz |first1 = Mike |title = Reminder: The Cubs won the 2015 World Series in 'Back to the Future 2' |url = https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/reminder--the-cubs-won-the-2015-world-series-in--back-to-the-future-2-085935047.html |work = [[Yahoo!

Following the Cubs' win over the Cleveland Indians in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series, Nicholas, in celebration, tweeted the final shot from the movie: Henry holding his fist up to the camera to show a Cubs World Series ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite twitter |url = https://twitter.com/TINBand/status/794040486365302784 |number = 794040486365302784 |user = TinBAND |title = Amazing! @Cubs win the #WorldSeries 2016 |author = Nicholas, Thomas Ian |date = November 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tinker to Evers to Chance ===

''&quot;[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]],&quot;'' also known as ''&quot;Tinker to Evers to Chance&quot;'' after its refrain, is a 1910 [[baseball]] [[poetry|poem]] by [[Franklin Pierce Adams]]. The poem is presented as a single, rueful stanza from the point of view of a [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] fan seeing the talented Chicago Cubs infield of [[shortstop]] [[Joe Tinker]], [[second baseman]] [[Johnny Evers]], and [[first baseman]] [[Frank Chance]] complete a [[double play]]. The trio began playing together with the Cubs in 1902, and formed a double play combination that lasted through April 1912. The Cubs won the pennant four times between 1906 and 1910, often defeating the Giants en route to the [[World Series]].{{multiple image

:Trio of bear cubs, and fleeter than birds,
:Tinker and Evers and Chance.

:Words that are heavy with nothing but trouble:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poem was first published in the ''[[New York Evening Mail]]'' on July 12, 1912. Popular among [[sportswriter]]s, numerous additional verses were written. The poem gave Tinker, Evers, and Chance increased popularity and has been credited with their elections to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1946.

{{See also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}
The Chicago Cubs retired numbers are commemorated on pinstriped flags flying from the foul poles at Wrigley Field, with the exception of [[Jackie Robinson]], the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] player whose number 42 was [[retired]] for all clubs. The first retired number flag, Ernie Banks' number 14, was raised on the left field pole, and they have alternated since then. 14, 10 and 31 (Jenkins) fly on the left field pole; and 26, 23 and 31 (Maddux) fly on the right field pole.

* There is also a movement to retire numbers for other players, most notably the uniform shirt of [[Gabby Hartnett]]. The Cubs first wore numbers on their shirts in 1932, and Hartnett wore #7 initially but switched to #9 for the next four seasons. From 1937 to 1940 he wore #2, which is the number considered for retirement. Petitions have been sent in to the team for [[Cap Anson]] (shirt), [[Hack Wilson]] (shirt), [[Phil Cavarretta]] (3), [[Andre Dawson]] (8) and, as well as more recent departures [[Kerry Wood]] (34), [[Sammy Sosa]] (21), and [[Mark Grace]] (17).

Before signing a developmental agreement with the Kane County Cougars in 2012, the Cubs had a Class A minor league affiliation on two occasions with the [[Peoria Chiefs]] (1985–1995 and 2004–2012). [[Ryne Sandberg]] managed the Chiefs from 2006 to 2010. In the period between those associations with the Chiefs the club had affiliations with the [[Dayton Dragons]] and [[Lansing Lugnuts]]. The Lugnuts were often affectionately referred to by [[Chip Caray]] as &quot;[[Steve Stone (baseball)|Steve Stone]]'s favorite team.&quot; The 2007 developmental contract with the Tennessee Smokies was preceded by Double A affiliations with the [[Orlando Cubs]] and [[West Tenn Diamond Jaxx]]. On September 16, 2014 the Cubs announced a move of their top Class A affiliate from Daytona in the Florida State League to [[Myrtle Beach Pelicans|Myrtle Beach]] in the [[Carolina League]] for the 2015 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Cubs moving Class A affiliate to Myrtle Beach |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/09/16/cubs-moving-class-a-affiliate-to-myrtle-beach/15750791/ |work = USA Today |access-date = September 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the Cubs signed a four-year player development contract with the [[South Bend Silver Hawks]] of the Midwest League, ending their brief relationship with the Kane County Cougars and shortly thereafter renaming the Silver Hawks the [[South Bend Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Leventhal |first1 = Josh |title = Tracking the Affiliation Shuffle |url = http://www.baseballamerica.com/minors/minor-league-player-development-contracts/ |website = Baseball America |access-date = September 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spring training history ===
The Chicago White Stockings, (today's Chicago Cubs), began spring training in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] in 1886. President [[Albert Spalding]] (founder of Spalding Sporting Goods) and player/manager [[Cap Anson]] brought their players to Hot Springs and played at the Hot Springs Baseball Grounds. The concept was for the players to have training and fitness before the start of the regular season, utilizing the bath houses of Hot Springs after practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://baseballhall.org/archive-collection/short-stops/school-days-in-arkansas |title = School Days in Arkansas |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hotsprings.org/pages/history-buffs/ |title = arlington hotel, oaklawn, gangster museum, hot springs baseball trail, historical landmarks – Hot Springs, Arkansas |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopediaofarkansas.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=6221|title=Major League Spring Training in Hot Springs – Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the White Stockings had a successful season in 1886, winning the National League Pennant, other teams began bringing their players to Hot Springs for &quot;spring training&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopediaofarkansas.net&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1886.shtml |title = 1886 Chicago White Stockings Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics - Baseball-Reference.com |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chicago Cubs, [[St. Louis Browns]], [[New York Yankees]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Cleveland Spiders]], [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[New York Highlanders]], [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Boston Red Sox]] were among the early squads to arrive. [[Whittington Park (baseball)|Whittington Park]] (1894) and later [[Majestic Park (baseball)|Majestic Park]] (1909) and [[Fogel Field]] (1912) were all built in Hot Springs specifically to host Major League teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://digitalballparks.com/SpringTraining/BanJohnson.html |title = Ban Johnson Park-Whittington Park/Majestic Park/Fogel Field – Hot Springs Arkansas – Major League Spring Training grounds |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cubs' current spring training facility is located in [[Sloan Park]] in [[Mesa, Arizona]], where they play in the [[Cactus League]]. The park seats 15,000, making it Major League baseball's largest spring training facility by capacity. The Cubs annually sell out most of their games both at home and on the road. Before Sloan Park opened in 2014, the team played games at [[HoHoKam Park]] – Dwight Patterson Field from 1979. &quot;HoHoKam&quot; is literally translated from Native American as &quot;those who vanished.&quot; The North Siders have called Mesa their spring home for most seasons since 1952.

In addition to Mesa, the club has held spring training in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] (1886, 1896–1900), (1909–1910) [[Sports in New Orleans#Baseball|New Orleans]] (1870, 1907, 1911–1912); [[Champaign, Illinois]] (1901–02, 1906); Los Angeles (1903–04, 1948–1949), [[Santa Monica, California]] (1905); [[French Lick, Indiana]] (1908, 1943–1945); [[Tampa, Florida]] (1913–1916); [[Pasadena, California]] (1917–1921); [[Santa Catalina Island, California]] (1922–1942, 1946–1947, 1950–1951); Rendezvous Park in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] (1952–1965); [[Blair Field]] in [[Long Beach, California]] (1966); and [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] (1967–1978).

The curious location on Catalina Island stemmed from Cubs owner William Wrigley Jr.'s then-majority interest in the island in 1919. Wrigley constructed a ballpark on the island to house the Cubs in spring training: it was built to the same dimensions as Wrigley Field. The ballpark was called Wrigley Field of Avalon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.digitalballparks.com/SpringTraining/Catalina.html |title = Avalon's Wrigley Field – Catalina Island California – Former Spring Home of the Chicago Cubs |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The ballpark is long gone, but a clubhouse built by Wrigley to house the Cubs exists as the Catalina County Club.) However, by 1951 the team chose to leave Catalina Island and spring training was shifted to Mesa, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = '+relative_time(twitters[i].created_at)+' |url = http://www.springtrainingonline.com/teams/chicago-cubs.htm |title = Spring Training Online History |publisher = Springtrainingonline.com |date =  |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubs' 30-year association with Catalina is chronicled in the book, ''The Cubs on Catalina'', by [[Jim Vitti]], which was named International 'Book of the Year' by ''[[The Sporting News]]''. The Cubs left Catalina after some bad weather in 1951, choosing to move to Mesa, a city where the Wrigleys also had interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://springtrainingmagazine.com/history2.html |title = Spring Training History Articles |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there is an exhibit at the Catalina Museum dedicated to the Cubs' spring training on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catalinachamber.com/mediafilming/whats-new/catalinamuseum |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314010409/http://www.catalinachamber.com/mediafilming/whats-new/catalinamuseum |archivedate=2016-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.catalinamuseum.org/exhibitions_view.asp?nexhibition_ID=%7BA8ADEE93-DCB7-4EC8-9818-B116EB1B5FC7%7D |title = Catalina Island Museum |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150110041100/http://www.catalinamuseum.org/exhibitions_view.asp?nexhibition_ID=%7BA8ADEE93-DCB7-4EC8-9818-B116EB1B5FC7%7D |archivedate = 2015-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former location in Mesa is actually the second HoHoKam Park; the first was built in 1976 as the spring-training home of the Oakland Athletics who left the park in 1979. Apart from HoHoKam Park and Sloan Park the Cubs also have another Mesa training facility called Fitch Park, this complex provides {{convert|25000|sqft|m2}} of team facilities, including major league clubhouse, four practice fields, one practice infield, enclosed batting tunnels, batting cages, a maintenance facility, and administrative offices for the Cubs.

===Radio===
Cubs radio rights are held by [[Entercom]]; its acquisition of the radio rights effective 2015 (under [[CBS Radio]]) ended the team's 90-year association with [[WGN (AM)|720 WGN]]. During the first season of the contract, Cubs games aired on [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]], taking over as flagship of the [[Chicago Cubs Radio Network]]. On November 11, 2015, CBS announced that the Cubs would move to WBBM's all-sports sister station, [[WSCR (AM)|WSCR]], beginning in the 2016 season. The move was enabled by WSCR's end of their rights agreement for the White Sox, who moved to [[WLS (AM)|WLS]].&lt;ref name=suntimes-cubswscr&gt;{{cite web |title = Cubs make their radio move to WSCR official |url = http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/1091613/cubs-make-radio-move-wscr-official |website = Chicago Sun-Times |access-date = November 17, 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117224156/http://chicago.suntimes.com/sports/7/71/1091613/cubs-make-radio-move-wscr-official |archivedate = November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-06-04/business/chi-cubs-radio-wgn-wbbm-20140603_1_chicago-cubs-new-radio-home-pat-hughes |title = WBBM to be Cubs' new radio home |work = Chicago Tribune |date = June 4, 2014 |access-date = October 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = WSCR-AM 670 The Score Named The Cubs' New Flagship Station |url = http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/11/11/wscr-am-670-the-score-named-the-cubs-new-flagship-station/ |website = CBS Chicago |location = Chicago |publisher = WBBM-TV |date = November 11, 2015 |access-date = November 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play-by-play voice of the Cubs is [[Pat Hughes (sportscaster)|Pat Hughes]], who has held the position since 1996, joined by [[Ron Coomer]]. Former Cubs third baseman and fan favorite [[Ron Santo]] had been Hughes' long-time partner until his death in 2010. [[Keith Moreland]] replaced Hall of Fame inductee Santo for three seasons, followed by Coomer for the 2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.robertfeder.com/2013/12/12/coomer-scores-cubs-radio-job/ |title = Coomer scores Cubs radio job }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Print===
The club also produces its own print media; the Cubs' official magazine [http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/fan_forum/vineline.jsp ''Vineline''], which has 12 annual issues, is in its third decade, and spotlights players and events involving the club. The club also publishes a traditional [[media guide]].

===Television===
{{Main article| List of Chicago Cubs broadcasters}}
As of the 2020 season, all Cubs games not aired on broadcast television will air on [[Marquee Sports Network]], a joint venture between the team and [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]. The venture was officially announced in February 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-spt-cubs-marquee-tv-channel-debut-sinclair-what-to-know-20190213-story.html|title=The Cubs are starting a new TV channel in 2020.

[[WGN-TV]] had a long-term association with the team, having aired Cubs games via its [[WGN Sports]] department from its establishment in 1948, through the 2019 season. For a period, WGN's Cubs games aired nationally on [[WGN America]] (formerly [[Superstation]] WGN); however, prior to the 2015 season, the Cubs, as well as all other Chicago sports programming, was dropped from the channel as part of its re-positioning as a general entertainment cable channel.&lt;ref name=ccb-wgnanosports&gt;{{cite news |title = WGN America to drop Chicago sports |url = http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140530/NEWS01/140539978/wgn-america-to-drop-chicago-sports |first = Lynne |last = Marek |work = [[Crain's Chicago Business]] |date = May 30, 2014 |access-date = June 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To compensate, all games carried by over-the-air channels were syndicated to a network of other television stations within the Cubs' market, which includes Illinois and parts of Indiana and Iowa.&lt;ref name=wls-cubsaffiliates/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = WQAD picking up 45 Cubs, 55 Sox games |url = http://qctimes.com/entertainment/wqad-picking-up-cubs-sox-games/article_003e47a9-bf66-5bd0-afc9-9a7ea97a59ac.html |newspaper = [[Quad-City Times]] |date = March 5, 2015 |access-date = September 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = WISH-WNDY To Carry Cubs, White Sox |url = http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/83915/wishwndy-to-carry-cubs-white-sox |website = TVNewsCheck |publisher = NewsCheck Media |date = March 20, 2015 |access-date = September 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = WISH-TV and MyINDY-TV the new home of Chicago Blackhawks hockey |url = http://wishtv.com/2015/10/05/wish-tv-and-myindy-tv-the-new-home-of-chicago-blackhawks-hockey/ |publisher = [[WISH-TV]] |date = October 5, 2015 |access-date = October 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limits on program pre-emptions imposed by WGN's former affiliations with [[The WB]] and its successor [[The CW]], WGN occasionally sub-licensed some of its sports broadcasts to another station in the market, particularly independent station [[WCIU-TV]] (and later [[MyNetworkTV]] station [[WPWR-TV]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Times Are a Changin' . . .

In November 2013, the Cubs exercised an option to terminate its existing broadcast rights with WGN-TV after the 2014 season, requesting a higher-valued contract lasting through the 2019 season (which would be aligned with the end of its contract with CSN Chicago). The team would split its over-the-air package with a second partner, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WLS-TV]], who would acquire rights to 25 games per season from 2015 through 2019.&lt;ref name=tribune-closingin&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/ct-cubs-tv-1212-biz-20141211-story.html |title = It's official: WLS-Ch. 7 to air 25 Cubs games |last = Channick |first = Robert |work = Chicago Tribune |date = December 12, 2014 |access-date = December 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wls-cubsaffiliates&gt;{{cite web |title = Cubs TV affiliates for 24 games on ABC7 in 2015 |url = http://abc7chicago.com/sports/cubs-tv-affiliates-for-24-games-on-abc7-in-2015/602409/ |website = ABC7Chicago.com |location = Chicago |publisher = [[WLS-TV]] |access-date = April 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 2015, WGN announced that it would air 45 games per-season through 2019.&lt;ref name=cbj-cubs2015wgn&gt;{{cite news |title = Cubs reach deal with WGN-TV for remaining 45 broadcasts |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2015/01/07/cubs-reach-deal-with-wgn-tv-for-remaining-45.html |access-date = January 10, 2015 |work = Chicago Business Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune-contractend&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-chicago-cubs-wgn-tv-20131106-story.html |title = Cubs exercise option to end WGN-TV contract after next season |last = Channick |first = Robert |work = Chicago Tribune |date = November 6, 2013 |access-date = September 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
