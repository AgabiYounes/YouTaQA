The '''Central Powers''', also '''Central Empires'''&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in [https://books.google.fi/books?id=UpGkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185 Britain and the Olympic Games, 1908-1920] by Luke J.

It faced and was defeated by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] that had formed around the [[Triple Entente]]. The Powers' origin was the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1879]]. Despite having nominally joined the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] before, Italy did not take part in World War I on the side of the Central Powers; the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria did not join until after World War I had begun, even though the Ottoman Empire had retained close relations with both Germany and Austria-Hungary since the beginning of the 20th century.

== Member states ==
The Central Powers consisted of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the beginning of the war. The [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the Central Powers later in 1914. In 1915, the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] joined the alliance. The name &quot;Central Powers&quot; is derived from the location of these countries; all four (including the other groups that supported them except for [[Finland]] and [[Lithuania]]) were located between the [[Russian Empire]] in the east and [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in the west. Finland, [[Azerbaijan]], and Lithuania joined them in 1918 before the war ended and after the Russian Empire collapsed

In early July 1914, in the aftermath of the assassination of Austro-Hungarian [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and the immediate likelihood of war between Austria-Hungary and [[Serbia]], [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm II]] and the German government informed the Austro-Hungarian government that Germany would uphold its alliance with Austria-Hungary and defend it from possible Russian intervention if a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cashman, Greg 2007. P57&quot;&gt;Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 2007. P57&lt;/ref&gt; When Russia enacted a [[general mobilization]], Germany viewed the act as provocative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer, G.J 1918. P39&quot;&gt;Meyer, G.J. A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Russian government promised Germany that its general mobilization did not mean preparation for war with Germany but was a reaction to the events between Austria-Hungary and Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer, G.J 1918. P39&quot; /&gt; The German government regarded the Russian promise of no war with Germany to be nonsense in light of its general mobilization, and Germany, in turn, mobilized for war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer, G.J 1918. P39&quot; /&gt; On 1 August, Germany sent an ultimatum to Russia stating that since both Germany and Russia were in a state of military mobilization, an effective state of war existed between the two countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer, G.J 1918. P95&quot;&gt;Meyer, G.J. A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918. Delta Book. 2006. P95.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, France, an ally of Russia, declared a state of general mobilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer, G.J 1918. P95&quot; /&gt;

In August 1914, Germany waged war on Russia, the German government justified military action against Russia as necessary because of Russian aggression as demonstrated by the mobilization of the Russian army that had resulted in Germany mobilizing in response.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, William W. German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation. P228.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany responded to this action by declaring war on France.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer C. A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East. ABC-CLIO. 2009. P1556.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, facing a two-front war, enacted what was known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]], that involved German armed forces needing to move through Belgium and swing south into France and towards the French capital of Paris. This plan was hoped to quickly gain victory against the French and allow German forces to concentrate on the Eastern Front. Belgium was a neutral country and would not accept German forces crossing its territory. Germany disregarded Belgian neutrality and invaded the country to launch an offensive towards Paris. This caused [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] to declare war against the German Empire, as the action violated the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] that both nations signed in 1839 guaranteeing Belgian neutrality and defense of the kingdom if a nation reneged.

Subsequently, several states declared war on Germany in late August 1914, with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] declaring war on Austria-Hungary in 1915 and Germany on 27 August 1916, the [[United States]] declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917 and [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] declaring war on Germany in July 1917.

==== Colonies and dependencies ====
{{Main|German colonial empire}}
; Europe
Upon its founding in 1871, the German Empire controlled [[Alsace-Lorraine]] as an &quot;imperial territory&quot; incorporated from France after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. It was held as part of Germany's sovereign territory.

; Africa
Germany held multiple African colonies at the time of World War I. All of Germany's African colonies were invaded and occupied by Allied forces during the war.

[[Kamerun|Cameroon]], [[German East Africa]], and [[German Southwest Africa]] were German colonies in Africa. [[Togoland]] was a German protectorate in Africa.

; Asia

The [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] was a German dependency in East Asia leased from China in 1898. It was occupied by Japanese forces following the [[Siege of Tsingtao]].

; Pacific

[[German New Guinea]] was a German protectorate in the Pacific. It was occupied by Australian forces in 1914.

[[German Samoa]] was a German protectorate following the [[Tripartite Convention]]. It was [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied]] by the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in 1914.

=== Austria-Hungary ===

[[File:Austrian troops marching up Mt. Zion, 1916.JPG|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers marching up [[Mount Zion]] in [[Jerusalem]] in the Ottoman Empire, during the Middle Eastern campaign]]

==== War justifications ====
Austria-Hungary regarded the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] as being orchestrated with the assistance of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cashman, Greg 2007. P57&quot; /&gt; The country viewed the assassination as setting a dangerous precedent of encouraging the country's [[South Slavs|South Slav]] population to rebel and threaten to tear apart the multinational country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyer, G.J 1918. P39&quot; /&gt; Austria-Hungary formally sent an ultimatum to Serbia demanding a full-scale investigation of Serbian government complicity in the assassination, and complete compliance by Serbia in agreeing to the terms demanded by Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cashman, Greg 2007. P57&quot; /&gt; Serbia submitted to accept most of the demands, however Austria-Hungary viewed this as insufficient and used this lack of full compliance to justify military intervention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cashman, Greg 2007. P61&quot;&gt;Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. 2007. P61&lt;/ref&gt; These demands have been viewed as a diplomatic cover for what was going to be an inevitable Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cashman, Greg 2007. P61&quot; /&gt;

Austria-Hungary had been warned by Russia that the Russian government would not tolerate Austria-Hungary invading Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cashman, Greg 2007. P61&quot; /&gt; However, with Germany supporting Austria-Hungary's actions, the Austro-Hungarian government hoped that Russia would not intervene and that the conflict with Serbia would be a regional conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cashman, Greg 2007. P57&quot; /&gt;

Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia resulted in Russia declaring war on the country and Germany in turn declared war on Russia, setting off the beginning of the clash of alliances that resulted in the World War.

; Territory
Austria-Hungary was internally divided into two states with their own governments, joined in communion through the Habsburg throne. Austrian [[Cisleithania]] contained various duchies and principalities but also the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. Hungarian [[Transleithania]] comprised the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] sovereign authority was shared by both Austria and Hungary.

==== War justifications ====
The Ottoman Empire joined the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914. The Ottoman Empire had gained strong economic connections with Germany through the Berlin-to-Baghdad railway project that was still incomplete at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Michael. The First World War: Volume 4 The Mediterranean Front 1914–1923. P31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman Empire made a formal alliance with Germany signed on 2 August 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afflerbach, Holger 2012. P. 292&quot;&gt;Afflerbach, Holger; David Stevenson, David.

After pressure escalated from the German government demanding that the Ottoman Empire fulfill its treaty obligations, or else Germany would expel the country from the alliance and terminate economic and military assistance, the Ottoman government entered the war with the recently acquired cruisers from Germany, the ''[[SMS Goeben|Yavuz Sultan Selim]]'' (formerly ''SMS Goeben'') and the ''[[SMS Breslau|Midilli]]'' (formerly ''SMS Breslau'') launching a naval raid on the Russian port of [[Odessa]], thus engaging in a military action in accordance with its alliance obligations with Germany. [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and the Triple Entente declared war on the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Afflerbach, Holger; David Stevenson, David.

[[File:Bulgaria southern front.jpg|thumb|right|Bulgarian soldiers firing at incoming aircraft]]
Bulgaria was still resentful after its [[Second Balkan War|defeat]] in July 1913 at the hands of Serbia, [[Kingdom of Greece (Glücksburg)|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. It signed [[Ottoman–Bulgarian alliance|a treaty of defensive alliance]] with the Ottoman Empire on 19 August 1914. It was the last country to join the Central Powers, which Bulgaria did in October 1915 by declaring war on Serbia. It invaded Serbia in conjunction with [[German Army (German Empire)|German]] and [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian forces]]. Bulgaria held claims on the region of [[Vardar Macedonia]] then held by Serbia following the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–1913 and (from the Bulgarian point of view), the costly [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] (1913).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Richard C.|title=Bulgaria in the First World War|url=http://russiasgreatwar.org/media/arc/bulgaria.shtml|website=Russia's Great War and Revolution|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a condition of entering WW1 on the side of the Central Powers, Bulgaria was granted the right to reclaim that territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jelavich|first1=Charles|last2=Jelavich|first2=Barbara|title=The establishment of the Balkan national states, 1804–1920|date=1986|publisher=University of Washington Press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-0-295-96413-3|pages=284–297|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard C.

M. Roberts. Europe 1880–1945. P. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to create a Polish State was taken by Germany in order to attempt to legitimize its military occupation amongst the Polish inhabitants, following upon German propaganda sent to Polish inhabitants in 1915 that German soldiers were arriving as liberators to free Poland from subjugation by [[Russian Empire|Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Aviel Roshwald.

== Controversial cases ==
States listed in this section were not officially members of the Central Powers, but at some point during the war engaged in cooperation with one or more Central Powers members on a level that makes their neutrality disputable.

=== {{flagicon image|Flag of Ethiopia (1897-1936; 1941-1974).svg}} Ethiopia ===
[[File:Iyasu in a Muslim Turban.png|thumb|upright|[[Iyasu V|Lij Iyasu]], ruler of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] until 1916 pictured in his Ottoman-style turban]]
The [[Ethiopian Empire]] was officially neutral throughout World War I but widely suspected of sympathy for the Central Powers between 1915 and 1916. At the time, Ethiopia was one of the few independent states in Africa and a major power in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Its ruler, [[Iyasu V|Lij Iyasu]], was widely suspected of harbouring pro-Islamic sentiments and being sympathetic to the Ottoman Empire. The German Empire also attempted to reach out to Iyasu, dispatching several unsuccessful expeditions to the region to attempt to encourage it to collaborate in an [[Arab Revolt]]-style uprising in East Africa. One of the unsuccessful expeditions was led by [[Leo Frobenius]], a celebrated ethnographer and personal friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Under Iyasu's directions, Ethiopia probably supplied weapons to the Muslim Dervish rebels during the [[Somaliland Campaign]] of 1915 to 1916, indirectly helping the Central Powers' cause.&lt;ref name=EthiopiaBBC&gt;{{cite news |title=How Ethiopian prince scuppered Germany's WW1 plans |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-37428682 |accessdate=22 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fearing the rising influence of Iyasu and the Ottoman Empire, the Christian nobles of Ethiopia conspired against Iyasu over 1915. Iyasu was first excommunicated by the [[List of Abunas of Ethiopia|Ethiopian Orthodox Patriarch]] and eventually deposed in a coup d'état on 27 September 1916. A less pro-Ottoman regent, ''Ras'' [[Tafari Makonnen]], was installed on the throne.&lt;ref name=EthiopiaBBC/&gt;

Other movements supported the efforts of the Central Powers for their own reasons, such as the radical [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Irish Nationalists]] who launched the [[Easter Rising]] in [[Dublin]] in April 1916; they referred to their &quot;gallant allies in Europe&quot;. However, the majority of Irish Nationalists supported the British and allied war effort up until 1916 when the Irish political landscape was changing. In 1914, [[Józef Piłsudski]] was permitted by Germany and Austria-Hungary to form independent [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish legions]]. Piłsudski wanted his legions to help the Central Powers defeat Russia and then side with France and the UK and win the war with them.
