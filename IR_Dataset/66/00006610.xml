The '''Carolina Panthers''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. The Panthers compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL), as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division. The team is headquartered in [[Bank of America Stadium]] in [[Charlotte center city|uptown Charlotte]]; the stadium also serves as the team's [[Home (sports)|home field]]. They are one of the few NFL teams to own the stadium they play in, which is legally registered as Panthers Stadium, LLC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Panthers Stadium, LLC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Panthers Stadium, LLC|url=http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/Search/profcorp/5486354|publisher=North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State|date=July 16, 2002|accessdate=August 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095925/http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/Search/profcorp/5486354|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panthers are supported throughout the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]]; although the team has played its home games in Charlotte since 1996, it played home games at [[Memorial Stadium (Clemson)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]] during its first season. The team hosts its annual [[training camp]] at [[Wofford College]] in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]].

The Panthers were announced as the league's 29th franchise in 1993, and began play in 1995 under original owner and founder [[Jerry Richardson]]. The Panthers played well in their first two years, finishing {{Win-loss record|w=7|l=9}} in 1995 (an all-time best for an NFL expansion team's first season) and 12–4 the following year, winning the [[NFC West]] before ultimately losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Green Bay Packers]] in the NFC Championship Game. They did not have another winning season until 2003, when they won the [[NFC Championship Game]] and reached [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], losing 32–29 to the [[New England Patriots]]. After recording playoff appearances in 2005 and 2008, the team failed to record another playoff appearance until 2013, the first of three consecutive NFC South titles. After losing in the divisional round to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in 2013 and the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in 2014, the Panthers [[Super Bowl 50|returned to the Super Bowl in 2015]], but lost to the [[Denver Broncos]]. The Panthers have reached the playoffs eight times, advancing to four NFC Championship Games and two Super Bowls. They have won six division titles, one in the [[NFC West]] and five in the [[NFC South]].

==Franchise history==
{{Further|History of the Carolina Panthers}}

===Beginnings===
On December 15, 1987, entrepreneur [[Jerry Richardson]] announced his bid for an NFL expansion franchise in [[the Carolinas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot; /&gt; A North Carolina native, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the [[Baltimore Colts]] who had used his [[1959 NFL Championship Game|1959]] league championship bonus to co-found the [[Hardee's]] restaurant chain, later becoming president and CEO of [[Trans World Corporation|TW Services]]. Richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from [[George Shinn]], who had made a successful bid for an expansion [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) team in Charlotte, the [[Charlotte Hornets]]. Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself, his family, and a number of businessmen from North and South Carolina were also recruited to be [[limited partnership|limited partners]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Franchise&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffer |first=Richard |date=October 28, 1991 |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1140299/index.htm |title=The Franchise |journal=[[Sports Illustrated]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |pages=64–66, 70, 72–73 |volume=75 |issue=19 |issn=0038-822X |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225145317/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1140299/index.htm |archive-date=December 25, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing [[Charlotte center city|uptown Charlotte]].

To highlight the demand for professional football in the Carolinas, Richardson Sports held preseason games around the area from 1989 to 1991. The first two games were held at [[Carter–Finley Stadium]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], while the third and final game was held at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. The matchups were between existing NFL teams. In 1991, the group formally filed an application for the open expansion spot, and on October 26, 1993, the 28 NFL owners unanimously named the Carolina Panthers as the 29th member of the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot; /&gt;

The Panthers hired former [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[George Seifert]] to replace Capers, and he led the team to an {{Win-loss record|w=8|l=8}} record in [[1999 Carolina Panthers season|1999]].

This performance tied the NFL record for most losses in a single season and it broke the record held by the winless [[1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1976 Buccaneers]] for most consecutive losses in a single season (both records have since been broken by the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|2008 Lions]]), leading the Panthers to fire Seifert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Panthers fire head coach Seifert after 1-15 season&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/01/07/seifert_ap/|title=Panthers fire head coach Seifert after 1–15 season|date=January 2, 2002|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=January 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203022729/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/01/07/seifert_ap/|archive-date=February 3, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2020, [[Luke Kuechly]] announced his retirement from the league.

==Logo and uniforms==

===Logo===
The shape of the Panthers logo was designed to mimic the outline of both North Carolina and South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article58739358.html |title=Are the Panthers South Carolina's team? |work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]] |author=Breiner, Ben |date=February 5, 2016 |accessdate=October 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013074648/http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article58739358.html |archive-date=October 13, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panthers changed their logo and logotype in 2012, the first such change in team history. According to the team, the changes were designed to give their logo an &quot;aggressive, contemporary look&quot; as well to give it a more three-dimensional feel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Panthers introduce refined logo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-introduce-refined-logo/22b44075-6ab5-477d-ac6d-7d29733deea0|title=Panthers introduce refined logo|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Panthers.com|date=January 29, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131155706/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-introduce-refined-logo/22b44075-6ab5-477d-ac6d-7d29733deea0|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary tweaks were made in the eye and mouth, where the features, particularly the muscular brow and fangs, are more pronounced, creating a more menacing look. The revised logo has a darker shade of blue over the black logo, compared to the old design, which had teal on top of black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7517666/carolina-panthers-change-team-logo-first-time |title=Carolina Panthers change logo for the first time |work=ESPN |date=January 30, 2012 |accessdate=October 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013074759/http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/7517666/carolina-panthers-change-team-logo-first-time |archive-date=October 13, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniforms===
By the time they had been announced as the 29th NFL team in October 1993, the Panthers' logo and helmet design had already been finalized, but the uniform design was still under creation. After discussion, the Panthers organization decided on jerseys colored white, black, and blue, and pants colored white and silver. The exact tone of blue, which they decided would be &quot;process blue&quot; (a shade lighter than [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]]'s and darker than [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]]'s), was the most difficult color to choose.

The team's uniform has remained largely the same since its creation, with only minor alterations such as changing the sock color of the team's black uniforms from blue to black and changing the team's shoes from white to black.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fifteen years of the Panthers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/10/25/279610/fifteen-years-of-the-panthers.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130215170135/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2008/10/25/279610/fifteen-years-of-the-panthers.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 15, 2013 |title=Fifteen years of the Panthers |last=Chandler |first=Charles |date=October 26, 2008 |work=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |accessdate=January 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson, a self-described traditionalist, said that no major uniform changes would be made in his lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson tells Panther fan that helmets will change, uniforms won't&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=Scott|title=Richardson tells Panther fan that helmets will change, uniforms won't|url=http://scottfowlerobs.blogspot.com/2012/02/richardson-tells-panther-fan-that.html|newspaper=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209214346/http://scottfowlerobs.blogspot.com/2012/02/richardson-tells-panther-fan-that.html|archive-date=February 9, 2012|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panthers typically pair their white jerseys with white pants, while the black and blue jerseys are paired with silver pants; there have only been a few exceptions to these combinations.
The first such instance was in 1998, when the team paired their white jerseys with silver pants in a game against the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. The second instance was in 2012 during a game against the [[Denver Broncos]], when they paired their black jerseys with new black pants;&lt;ref name=&quot;When will Panthers be back in black?&quot; /&gt; this created an all-black uniform, with the exception of blue socks and silver helmets. The decision to wear blue socks was made by team captain [[Steve Smith Sr.|Steve Smith]], who felt the blue socks gave the uniforms a more distinct appearance compared with other teams that have all-black uniforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Notes: Committed to the Carolinas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Notes-Committed-to-the-Carolinas-/9446340f-a92c-4b97-a631-6f1bd7c45cd7|title=Notes: Committed to the Carolinas|last=Henson|first=Max|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Panthers.com|accessdate=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127074450/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Notes-Committed-to-the-Carolinas-/9446340f-a92c-4b97-a631-6f1bd7c45cd7|archive-date=January 27, 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The all-black uniforms won the &quot;Greatest Uniform in NFL History&quot; contest, a fan-voted contest run by NFL.com in July 2013.

In the 2018 exhibition season, the Panthers wore the black pants with the blue jerseys for a home game vs. the [[New England Patriots]], then paired the black pants with the white jerseys in an away game vs. the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. During the 2018 season, the team did not wear silver pants. Instead they wore the all-black uniforms and blue jerseys with white pants.

The team's uniform did not change significantly after [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] became the NFL's jersey supplier in 2012, but the collar was altered to honor former Panthers player and coach [[Sam Mills]] by featuring the phrase &quot;Keep Pounding&quot;. Nike had conceived the idea, and the team supported the concept as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, who died of cancer in 2005. Mills had introduced the phrase, which has since become a team slogan, in a speech that he gave to the players and coaches prior to their 2003 playoff game against Dallas; in the speech, Mills compared his fight against cancer with the team's on-field battle, saying &quot;When I found out I had cancer, there were two things I could do – quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep pounding!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carolina Panthers' uniforms to honor Sam Mills legacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestate.com/2012/04/04/2220106/carolina-panthers-uniforms-to.html|title=Carolina Panthers' uniforms to honor Sam Mills legacy|last=Fowler|first=Scott|date=April 3, 2012|work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|accessdate=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404221255/http://www.thestate.com/2012/04/04/2220106/carolina-panthers-uniforms-to.html|archive-date=April 4, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strickland|first=Bryan|title=Panthers uniforms unveiled|url=http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-uniforms-unveiled/455034b1-8cb6-4274-87ef-d7729ca13f54|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Panthers.com|date=April 3, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308181913/http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Panthers-uniforms-unveiled/455034b1-8cb6-4274-87ef-d7729ca13f54|archive-date=March 8, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the Panthers unveiled new uniforms. The new uniforms are Nike's &quot;Vapor Untouchable&quot; and have only minor differences: the tapered strips on the pants are replaced by stripes that extend down to the socks, the reflective shoulder cloth was replaced and the hip logos were also removed. The uniforms keep the same basic look, colors, numbers as the originals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.panthers.com/news/panthers-new-uniforms-2019-nike-vapor-untouchable&lt;/ref&gt; As the 2019 season was the team's 25th, the Panthers sported a 25th anniversary patch on their uniforms.

[[Sir Purr]], an [[anthropomorphic]] black cat who wears a jersey numbered '00', has been the Panthers' mascot since their first season.

===Keep Pounding Drum===
Starting with the 2012 season, the Panthers introduced the Keep Pounding Drum, inspired by the aforementioned motivational speech by Sam Mills before the team's 2004 playoff game against the Cowboys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/02/what-does-keep-pounding-mean-carolina-panthers-super-bowl-50 |title=How 'Keep Pounding' became the Panthers' inspirational team motto |first=Nick |last=Schwartz |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208082118/http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/02/what-does-keep-pounding-mean-carolina-panthers-super-bowl-50 |archive-date=February 8, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to each home game, an honorary drummer hits the six-foot tall drum four times to signify the four quarters of an American football game. According to the team, the drummers &quot;come from a variety of backgrounds and occupations, but all have overcome a great trial or adversity that has not only made them strong but also pushes them to make others around them stronger&quot;. Drummers have included current and former Panthers players, military veterans, [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Make-A-Wish]] children, and athletes from other sports, including [[NBA Most Valuable Player|NBA MVP]] and Charlotte native [[Stephen Curry]], [[United States women's national soccer team|US women's national soccer team]] players [[Whitney Engen]] and [[Heather O'Reilly]], and 7 time [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series|Cup Series]] champion [[Jimmie Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthers.com/community/keep-pounding-drummer.html|title=Keep Pounding Drummer|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Panthers.com|accessdate=September 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923132744/http://www.panthers.com/community/keep-pounding-drummer.html|archive-date=September 23, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;keep pounding&quot; chant was introduced during the 2015 season which starts before the opening kickoff of each home game. As prompted by the video boards, one side of the stadium shouts &quot;keep&quot; and the other side replies with &quot;pounding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citevideo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOmq5ZcgC_Q|title=Keep Pounding|date=January 4, 2016 |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chant is similar to ones that take place at college football games.

===Charity and community work===
The Carolina Panthers support a variety of non-profits in North and South Carolina through the Carolina Panthers Charities. Four annual scholarships are awarded to student athletes through the Carolina Panthers Graduate Scholarship and the Carolina Panthers Players Sam Mills Memorial Scholarship programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carolina Panthers Charities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolina Panthers Charities |url=http://www.panthers.com/community/panthers-charities.html |publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Panthers.com|accessdate=September 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915113104/http://www.panthers.com/community/panthers-charities.html |archivedate=September 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carolina Panthers Charities also offers grants to non-profits that support education, athletics, and human services in the community.

In 2003 the Panthers and Carolinas HealthCare Foundation established the Keep Pounding Fund, a fundraising initiative to support cancer research and patient support programs. The Panthers community has raised more than $1.4 million for the fund through direct donations, charity auctions, blood drives, and an annual 5k stadium run.

==Rivalries==
{{Main|Buccaneers–Panthers rivalry|Falcons–Panthers rivalry}}

The Falcons are a natural geographic rival for the Panthers, as Atlanta is only {{convert|230|mi}} south on [[Interstate 85|I-85]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen: Falcons vs. Panthers is no rivalry&quot; /&gt; The two teams have played each other twice a year since the Panthers' inception, and games between the two teams feature large contingents of Panthers fans at Atlanta's [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] and large contingents of Falcons fans at Bank of America Stadium.

The Panthers' rivalry with Tampa Bay has been described as the most intense in the NFC South.&lt;ref name=&quot;NFC South's most intense rivalry: Panthers vs. Bucs&quot; /&gt; The rivalry originated in 2002 with the formation of the NFC South, but became particularly heated before the 2003 season with verbal bouts between players on the two teams. It escalated further when the Panthers went to Tampa Bay and beat them in what ESPN.com writer Pat Yasinskas described as &quot;one of the most physical contests in recent memory&quot;. The rivalry has resulted in a number of severe injuries for players on both teams, some of which were caused by foul play.&lt;ref name=&quot;NFC South's most intense rivalry: Panthers vs. Bucs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcsouth/post/_/id/292/nfc-south-s-most-intense-rivalry-panthers-vs-bucs|title=NFC South's most intense rivalry: Panthers vs. Bucs|last=Yasinskas|first=Pat|date=September 11, 2008|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=January 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728224641/http://espn.go.com/blog/nfcsouth/post/_/id/292/nfc-south-s-most-intense-rivalry-panthers-vs-bucs|archive-date=July 28, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carolina Panthers cornerback Dante Wesley suspended for hit on Tampa Bay Buccaneers returner Clifton Smith&quot; /&gt; One of these plays, an illegal hit on Tampa Bay punt returner [[Clifton Smith (return specialist)|Clifton Smith]], sparked a brief melee between the teams in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carolina Panthers cornerback Dante Wesley suspended for hit on Tampa Bay Buccaneers returner Clifton Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/football/bucs/carolina-panthers-cornerback-dante-wesley-suspended-for-hit-on-tampa-bay/1045286|title=Carolina Panthers cornerback Dante Wesley suspended for hit on Tampa Bay Buccaneers returner Clifton Smith|last=Holder|first=Stephen F.|date=October 19, 2009|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|accessdate=March 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111061255/http://www.tampabay.com/sports/football/bucs/carolina-panthers-cornerback-dante-wesley-suspended-for-hit-on-tampa-bay/1045286|archivedate=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their time in the NFC West, the Panthers began developing a rivalry with the San Francisco 49ers. This rivalry faded after the NFL moved the Panthers out of the NFC West.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Panthers-49ers prediction&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scottfowlerobs.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-panthers-49ers-prediction.html|title=My Panthers-49ers prediction|last=Fowler|first=Scott|date=October 22, 2010|at=Scott Says|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|accessdate=January 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831153305/http://scottfowlerobs.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-panthers-49ers-prediction.html|archive-date=August 31, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seattle Seahawks===
{{main|Panthers–Seahawks rivalry}}
A relatively new rivalry, this one dates to the [[2005 NFL season|2005]] [[NFC Championship Game]], in which the Seahawks won the game 31–14. The rivalry started up again in 2012, when the Panthers lost a close regular season home game to a [[Seattle Seahawks]] team led by rookie quarterback [[Russell Wilson]], 16–12. In the 2013 season, the Panthers opened the season at home versus Seattle. They again lost a close game, with the final score 12–7. The Seahawks would go on to win [[Super Bowl XLVIII]]. In the 2014 season, once more at Bank of America Stadium, the Seahawks defeated the Panthers in week eight, 13–9. In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers faced Seattle in Seattle, notorious for being a tough opposing field to play in, and lost 31–17. The Seahawks would go on to lose [[Super Bowl XLIX]]. In the 2015 season the next year, the teams faced off in Seattle, where the Panthers won another close game, 27–23. In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers faced Seattle at Bank of America stadium, where they had yet to beat a Russell Wilson-led Seahawks team. By halftime they led 31–0, but the Seahawks rebounded and scored 24 unanswered points before the Panthers were able to seal the victory, 31–24. The Panthers would go on to lose [[Super Bowl 50]]. In the 2016 season, the teams met in Seattle, where the Panthers were beaten, 40–7. The teams did not face each other during the 2017 season. In the 2018 season, the Panthers were defeated by the Seahawks at home by a score of 30–27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Janower |first1=Jacob |title=Seahawks vs. Panthers: Score, results from Week 12 game in Carolina |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/seattle-seahawks-carolina-panthers-score-results-updates-highlights/1gha3ru1o8asd13l74060k8k09 |accessdate=December 3, 2018 |work=Sporting News |date=November 25, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203091414/http://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/seattle-seahawks-carolina-panthers-score-results-updates-highlights/1gha3ru1o8asd13l74060k8k09 |archivedate=December 3, 2018 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2012 season, Carolina is {{Win-loss record|w=2|l=6}} overall against Seattle and {{Win-loss record|w=1|l=1}} in the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Person|first=Joseph|title=A look back at past 5 games in Panthers-Seahawks rivalry|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/article54359770.html|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|date=January 12, 2016|accessdate=January 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131063852/http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/article54359770.html|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}} (updated with 2018 loss)&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry aspect stems from how close the majority of the matches have been and the fact that they have played each other eight times between 2012 and 2018—at least once a year.

===Coaches===
The Carolina Panthers have had six head coaches. Dom Capers was the head coach from 1995 to 1998 and led the team to one playoff appearance. Counting playoff games, he finished with a record of 31–35 (.470). George Seifert coached the team from 1999 to 2001, recording 16 wins and 32 losses (.333). John Fox, the team's longest-tenured head coach, led the team from 2002 to 2010 and coached the team to three playoff appearances including [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] which the Panthers lost. Including playoff games, Fox ended his tenure with a 78–74 (.513) record, making him the first Panthers coach to finish his tenure with the team with a winning record. Ron Rivera held the position from 2011 to 2019 and led the team to four playoff appearances including [[Super Bowl 50]].
