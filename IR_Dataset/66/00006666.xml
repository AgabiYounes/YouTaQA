'''Christopher Báthory''' ({{lang-hu|Báthory Kristóf}}; 1530 – 27 May 1581) was [[voivode of Transylvania]] from 1576 to 1581. He was a younger son of [[Stephen VIII Báthory|Stephen Báthory of Somlyó]]. Christopher's career began during the reign of Queen [[Isabella Jagiellon]], who administered the [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary]] on behalf of her son, [[John Sigismund Zápolya]], from 1556 to 1559. He was one of the commanders of John Sigismund's army in the early 1560s.

Christopher's brother, [[Stephen Báthory]], who succeeded John Sigismund in 1571, made Christopher captain of Várad (now [[Oradea]] in Romania). After being elected [[King of Poland]], Stephen Báthory adopted the title of [[Prince of Transylvania]] and made Christopher voivode in 1576. Christopher cooperated with [[Márton Berzeviczy]], whom his brother appointed to supervise the administration of the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]] as the head of the Transylvanian chancellery at [[Kraków]]. Christopher ordered the imprisonment of [[Ferenc Dávid]], a leading theologian of the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]], who started to condemn the adoration of Jesus. He supported his brother's efforts to settle the [[Jesuits]] in Transylvania.

== Early life ==
Christopher was the third of the four sons of Stephen Báthory of Somlyó and [[Catherine Telegdi]].{{sfn|Horn|2002|p=245}}{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}} His father was a supporter of [[John Zápolya]], [[King of Hungary]], who made him voivode of Transylvania in February 1530.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}} Christopher was born in [[Șimleu Silvaniei Fort|Báthorys' castle]] at Szilágysomlyó (now [[Șimleu Silvaniei]] in Romania) in the same year.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}} His father died in 1534.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=282}}

His brother, Andrew, and their kinsman, [[Tamás Nádasdy]], took charge of Christopher's education.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}} Christopher visited England, France, Italy, Spain, and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in his youth.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}} He also served as a page in [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]'s court.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}}

== Career ==
Christopher entered the service of John Zápolya's widow, Isabella Jagiellon, in the late 1550s.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}} At the time, Isabella administered the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary on behalf of her son, John Sigismund Zápolya.{{sfn|Barta|1994|pp=258–259}} She wanted to persuade [[Henry II of France]] to withdraw his troops from three fortresses that the Ottomans had captured in [[Banat]], so she sent Christopher to France to start negotiations in 1557.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}}

John Sigismund took charge of the administration of his realm after his mother died on 15 November 1559.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=259}}{{sfn|Keul|2009|p=99}} He retained his mother's advisors, including Christopher who became one of his most influential officials.{{sfn|Keul|2009|p=99}} After the rebellion of [[Melchior Balassa]],{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=259}} Christopher persuaded John Sigismund to fight for his realm instead of fleeing to Poland in 1562.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}} Christopher was one of the commanders of John Sigismund's troops during the ensuing war against the Habsburg rulers of the western territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] and [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], who tried to reunite the kingdom under their rule.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=259}} Christopher defeated Maximilian's commander, [[Lazarus von Schwendi]], forcing him to lift the siege of Huszt (now [[Khust]] in Ukraine) in 1565.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}}

After the death of John Sigismund, the [[Diet of Transylvania]] elected Christopher's younger brother, Stephen Báthory, voivode (or ruler) on 25 May 1571.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}} Stephen made Christopher captain of Várad (now Oradea in Romania).{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}} The following year, the [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[Selim II]] (who was the overlord of Transylvania), acknowledged the hereditary right of the [[Báthory family]] to rule the province.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}}

== Reign ==
[[Image:Partium1570.PNG|thumb|right|alt=Transylvania and the neighboring regions|[[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]] in 1570]]

Stephen Báthory was elected King of Poland on 15 December 1575.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}} He adopted the title of Prince of Transylvania and made Christopher voivode on 14 January 1576.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Szegedi|2009|p=101}} An Ottoman delegation confirmed Christopher's appointment at the Diet in Gyulafehérvár (now [[Alba Iulia]] in Romania) in July.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}}{{sfn|Granasztói|1981|p=404}} The sultan's charter (or ''[[ahidnâme]]'') sent to Christopher emphasized that he should keep the peace along the frontiers.{{sfn|Felezeu|2009|p=54}} Stephen set up a separate chancellery in Kraków to keep an eye on the administration of Transylvania.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=263}}{{sfn|Felezeu|2009|p=27}} The head of the new chancellery, Márton Berzeviczy, and Christopher cooperated closely.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}}

[[Nontrinitarianism|Anti-Trinitarian]] preachers began to condemn the worshiping of Jesus in [[Partium]] and [[Székely Land]] in 1576, although the Diet had already forbade all doctrinal innovations.{{sfn|Keul|2009|pp=119, 121}} Ferenc Dávid, the most influential leader of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania, openly joined the dissenters in the autumn of 1578.{{sfn|Keul|2009|p=121}} Christopher invited [[Fausto Sozzini]], a leading Anti-Trinitarian theologian, to Transylvania to convince Dávid that the new teaching was erroneous.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}} Since Dávid refused to obey, Christopher held a Diet and the &quot;[[Unio Trium Nationum|Three Nations]]&quot; (including the Unitarian delegates) ordered Dávid's imprisonment.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}}{{sfn|Szegedi|2009|pp=106–107}} Christopher also supported his brother's attempts to strengthen the position of the Roman Catholic Church in Transylvania.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}}{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}} He granted estates to the Jesuits to promote the establishment of a college in Kolozsvár (now [[Cluj-Napoca]] in Romania) on 5 May 1579.{{sfn|Granasztói|1981|p=405}}

Christopher fell seriously ill after his second wife, Elisabeth Bocskai, died in early 1581.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}} After a false rumor about Christopher's dead reached Istanbul, [[Koca Sinan Pasha]] proposed Transylvania to [[Pál Márkházy]] whom Christopher had been forced into exile.{{sfn|Papp|2004|p=61}} Although Christopher's only surviving son [[Sigismund Báthory|Sigismund]] was still a minor, the Diet elected him as voivode before Christopher's death, because they wanted to prevent the appointment of Márkházy.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}}{{sfn|Papp|2004|p=61}} Christopher died in Gyulafehérvár on 27 May 1581.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=101}} He was buried in the Jesuits' church in Gyulafehérvár, almost two years later, on 14 March 1583.{{sfn|Szabó|2012|p=182}}
