A '''cuisine'''  is a style of [[cooking]] characterized by distinctive [[ingredient]]s, [[List of cooking techniques|techniques]] and [[dish (food)|dishes]], and usually associated with a specific [[culture]] or geographic region. Regional [[food]] preparation traditions, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatscookingamerica.net/AmericanRegionalFoods/RegionalAmericanIndex.htm &quot;Rediscover the flavors and traditions of true American cuisine!&quot;] [http://whatscookingamerica.net Whatscookingamerica.net]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade, they can even be made into distinct ingredients themselves when they become popular within a region, take for example [[Japanese rice]] in [[Japan]]ese [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]] and [[New Mexico chile]] in [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] [[New Mexican cuisine|cuisine]].

[[Religion|Religious]] food laws can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine, such as [[Diet in Hinduism|Hinduism]] in [[India]]n [[Indian cuisine|cuisine]], [[Diet in Sikhism|Sikhism]] in [[Punjab]]i [[Punjabi cuisine|cuisine]], [[Buddhist vegetarianism|Buddhism]] in [[Asia]]n [[Asian cuisine|cuisine]], [[Islamic dietary laws|Islam]] in [[Middle East]]ern [[Middle Eastern cuisine|cuisine]], and [[Kashrut|Judaism]] in [[Israel]]i [[Israeli cuisine|cuisine]].

==Factors that affect a cuisine==
Some factors that have an influence on a region's cuisine include the area's [[climate]], the trade among different countries, [[Religious law|religiousness]] or [[sumptuary]] laws and culinary culture exchange. For example, a [[Tropical]] diet may be based more on fruits and vegetables, while a polar diet might rely more on meat and fish.

The area's climate, in large measure, determines the native foods that are available. In addition, climate influences food preservation. For example, foods preserved for winter consumption by [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], and [[pickling]] have remained significant in [[List of cuisines|world cuisines]] for their altered gustatory properties.

The trade among different countries also largely affects a region's cuisine. Dating back to the ancient spice trade''',''' seasonings such as [[cinnamon]], [[cassia bark|cassia]], [[cardamom]], [[ginger]], and [[turmeric]] were important items of commerce in the earliest evolution of trade. Cinnamon and cassia found their way to the [[Middle East]] at least 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/spice-trade|title=spice trade|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain foods and food preparations are required or proscribed by the religiousness or sumptuary laws, such as Islamic dietary laws and Jewish dietary laws.

Culinary culture exchange is also an important factor for cuisine in many regions: Japan's first substantial and direct exposure to the West came with the arrival of European missionaries in the second half of the 16th century. At that time, the combination of Spanish and Portuguese game frying techniques with a Chinese method for cooking vegetables in oil led to the development of ''[[tempura]]'', the &quot;popular Japanese dish in which seafood and many different types of vegetables are coated with batter and deep fried&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/factsheet/en/pdf/36JapFoodCulture.pdf|title=Japanese Food Culture|last=|first=|date=18 December 2008|website=Web Japan|publisher=|access-date=18 June 2019|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|List of historical cuisines}}
Cuisine dates back to the [[Ancient history|Antiquity]]. As food began to require more planning, there was an emergence of meals that situated around culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laudan|first1=Rachel|title=Cuisine &amp; Empire|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-26645-2|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New cuisines==

Cuisines evolve continually, and new cuisines are created by innovation and cultural interaction. One recent example is [[fusion cuisine]], which combines elements of various [[Culinary art|culinary]] traditions while not being categorized per any one cuisine style, and generally refers to the innovations in many contemporary restaurant cuisines since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last= Lindsey| url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E0DD1F38F93BA2575BC0A963948260&amp;sec=travel&amp;pagewanted=print | title= California Grows Her Own Cuisine. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date= 18 August 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nouvelle cuisine]]'' (New cuisine) is an approach to cooking and food presentation in [[French cuisine]] that was popularized in the 1960s by the food critics [[Henri Gault]], who invented the phrase, and his colleagues [[André Gayot]] and [[Christian Millau]] in a new restaurant guide, the [[Gault-Millau]], or ''Le Nouveau Guide''. [[Molecular cuisine]], is a modern style of cooking which takes advantage of many technical innovations from the scientific disciplines (molecular cooking). The term was coined in 1999 by the [[French people|French]] [[Institut national de la recherche agronomique|INRA]] chemist [[Hervé This]] because he wanted to distinguish it from the name [[Molecular cuisine]] that was previously introduced by him and the late [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] physicist [[Nicholas Kurti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scienceofcooking.com/molecular_gastronomy/|title=Why is Molecular Gastronomy?|website=www.scienceofcooking.com|access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also named as multi sensory cooking, modernist cuisine, culinary physics, and experimental cuisine by some chefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/10/foodanddrink.obsfoodmonthly|title=Statement on the 'new cookery'|last=Adria|first=Ferran|date=9 December 2006|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Heston|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Keller|first3=Thomas|last4=McGee|first4=Harold|access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, international trade brings new foodstuffs including ingredients to existing cuisines and leads to changes. The introduction of hot pepper to China from South America around the end of the 17th century, greatly influencing Sichuan cuisine, which combines the original taste with the taste of introduced hot pepper and creates a unique flavor of both spicy and pungent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-01/09/content_297521.htm|title=Sichuan Cuisine|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global cuisine==
{{main|Global cuisine|Regional cuisine|List of cuisines}}

A [[global cuisine]] is a cuisine that is practiced around the world, and can be categorized according to the common use of major foodstuffs, including [[grain]]s, [[produce]] and cooking [[fat]]s.

==Regional cuisines==
[[Regional cuisine]]s can vary based on availability and usage of specific ingredients, local cooking traditions and practices, as well as overall [[culture|cultural]] differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;cuisine&quot;&gt;[http://www.eldrbarry.net/hatr/eldrcuis.htm &quot;The American Food Revolutions: Cuisines in America.&quot;] [http://www.eldrbarry.net Eldrbarry.net]. Accessed June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors can be more-or-less uniform across wide swaths of territory, or vary intensely within individual regions. For example, in Central and South America, corn ([[maize]]), both fresh and dried, is a staple food, and is used in many different ways. In northern Europe, [[wheat]], [[rye]], and fats of animal origin predominate, while in southern Europe [[olive oil]] is ubiquitous and [[rice]] is more prevalent. In Italy, the cuisine of the north, featuring [[butter]] and rice, stands in contrast to that of the south, with its wheat [[pasta]] and olive oil. In some parts of China, rice is the staple, while in others this role is filled by [[noodle]]s and [[bread]]. Throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean, common ingredients include [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], olive oil, [[lemon]]s, [[chili pepper|peppers]], and rice. The [[vegetarianism]] practiced in much of India has made [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (crops harvested solely for the dry seed) such as [[chickpea]]s and [[lentil]]s as important as wheat or rice. From India to Indonesia, the extensive use of [[spice]]s is characteristic; [[coconut]]s and [[seafood]] are also used throughout the region both as foodstuffs and as [[seasoning]]s.

===African cuisine===
[[File:LocationAfrica.png|right|215px]]
{{Main|List of African cuisines}}

[[African cuisine]]s use a combination of locally available [[fruit]]s, [[cereal grain]]s and [[vegetable]]s, as well as [[milk]] and [[meat]] products. In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]] products. In much of tropical Africa, however, cow's milk is rare and cannot be produced locally (owing to various diseases that affect livestock). The continent's diverse demographic makeup is reflected in the many different eating and drinking habits, dishes, and preparation techniques of its manifold populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |title=The African Cookbook |author=Bea Sandler |others=Diane and Leo Dillon (Illust.) |publisher=Carol Publishing Group |year=1993 |isbn=0-8065-1398-5 |accessdate=18 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216154309/http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Cookbook/about_cb_wh.html |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asian cuisine===
[[File:LocationAsia.svg|right|215px]]
{{main|List of Asian cuisines}}

[[Asian cuisine]]s are many and varied. Ingredients common to many cultures in the east and Southeast regions of the continent include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilies, dried onions, soy, and tofu. [[Stir frying]], steaming, and [[deep frying]] are common cooking methods. While rice is common to most Asian cuisines, different varieties are popular in the various regions; [[Basmati rice]] is popular in the [[South Asia]], [[Jasmine rice|Jasmine]] is often found across the southeast, while long-grain rice is popular in China and short-grain in Japan and Korea.&lt;ref name=quaker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricearoni.com/rar_flavorsOfTheWorld/asian/ |title=The flavors of Asia |publisher=[[Quaker Oats Company]] |accessdate=19 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604051405/http://www.ricearoni.com/rar_flavorsOfTheWorld/asian/ |archivedate=4 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Curry]] is also a common dish found in southern and eastern Asia, however, they are not as popular in western Asian cuisines. Those curry dishes with origins in India and other South Asian countries usually have a [[yogurt]] base while Southeastern and Eastern curries generally use coconut milk as their foundation.&lt;ref name=kraft&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kraft.com.au/CookingSchool/CookingBasics/AsianCuisine/CuisineAreasOfAsia/ |title=Cuisine Areas Of Asia |author= |publisher=[[Kraft Foods|Kraft Foods (Australia)]] |year=2007 |accessdate=20 December 2008 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===European cuisine===
[[File:locationEurope.png|right|215px]]
{{Main|List of European cuisines}}

[[European cuisine]] (alternatively, &quot;Western cuisine&quot;) include the cuisines of [[Europe]] and other [[Western world|Western countries]]. European cuisine includes that of [[Europe]] and to some extent [[Russia]], as well as non-[[Indigenous people|indigenous]] cuisines of [[North America]], [[Australasia]], [[Oceania]], and [[Latin America]]. The term is used by [[East Asia]]ns to contrast with Asian styles of cooking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leung&quot;&gt;Leung Man-tao (12 February 2007), &quot;Eating and Cultural Stereotypes&quot;, ''Eat and Travel Weekly'', no. 312, p. 76. Hong Kong&lt;!--: PUBLISHER HERE--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is analogous to Westerners referring collectively to the cuisines of Asian countries as [[Asian cuisine]]. When used by Westerners, the term may refer more specifically to cuisine ''in'' Europe; in this context, a synonym is '''[[Continental Europe|Continental]] cuisine''', especially in [[British English]].

===Oceanian cuisine===
[[File:locationOceania.png|right|215px]]
{{Main|Oceanic cuisine}}

[[Oceanian cuisine]]s include [[Australian cuisine]], [[New Zealand cuisine]], and the cuisines from many other islands or island groups throughout Oceania. Australian cuisine consists of immigrant [[European cuisine]], and [[Bushfood]] prepared and eaten by native [[Aboriginal Australian]] peoples, and various newer [[Asia]]n influences. [[New Zealand cuisine]] also consists of [[Europe]]an inspired dishes, such as [[Pavlova (food)|Pavlova]], and native [[Maori cuisine]]. Across Oceania, staples include the Kumura ([[Sweet potato]]) and [[Taro]], which was/is a staple from [[Papua New Guinea]] to the South Pacific. On most islands in the south pacific, [[fish]] are widely consumed because of the proximity to the ocean.

===Cuisines of the Americas===
[[File:Americas (orthographic projection).svg|right|140px]]
{{Main|List of cuisines of the Americas|Native American cuisine}}

The [[Cuisine of the Americas|cuisines of the Americas]] are found across [[Americas|North and South America]], and are based on the cuisines of the countries from which the [[immigration|immigrant]] people came, primarily [[Europe]]. However, the traditional European cuisine has been adapted by the addition of many local and native ingredients, and many techniques have been added to traditional foods as well. [[Native American cuisine]] is prepared by indigenous populations across the continent, and its influences can be seen on multi-ethnic [[Latin American]] cuisine. Many [[staple foods]] eaten across the continent, such as [[Maize|Corn]], [[Beans]], and [[Potatoes]] have native origins. The regional cuisines are [[North American cuisine]], [[Mexican cuisine]], [[Central American cuisine]], [[South American cuisine]], and [[Caribbean cuisine]].
