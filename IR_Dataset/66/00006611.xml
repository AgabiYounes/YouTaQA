The '''Chicago Bears''' are a professional [[American football]] team based in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. The Bears compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC North|North]] division. The Bears have won nine [[History of the National Football League championship|NFL Championships]], including one [[Super Bowl XX|Super Bowl]], and hold the NFL record for the most enshrinees in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] and the most [[retired jersey]] numbers. The Bears have also recorded more victories than any other NFL franchise.&lt;ref name=CBFE&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/|title=Chicago Bears Franchise Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 15, 2008|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830025837/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/|archive-date=August 30, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/|title=Green Bay Packers Franchise Encyclopedia|accessdate=August 15, 2008|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011054633/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/gnb/|archive-date=October 11, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Time Win-Loss Records By Team|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/all-time-win-loss-records/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=August 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807002013/http://www.profootballhof.com/football-history/all-time-win-loss-records/|archive-date=August 7, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The franchise was founded in [[Decatur, Illinois]], on September 17, 1920,&lt;ref name=&quot;BearsTradition&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Halas&gt;{{cite book|title=Halas By Halas|first1=George|last1=Halas|last2=Morgan|first2=Gwen|last3=Veysey|first3=Arthur|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1979|pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to Chicago in 1921. It is one of only two remaining franchises from the NFL's founding in 1920, along with the [[Arizona Cardinals]], which was originally also in Chicago. The team played home games at Wrigley Field on Chicago's [[North Side, Chicago|North Side]] through the 1970 season; they now play at [[Soldier Field]] on the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]], next to [[Lake Michigan]]. The Bears have a [[Bears–Packers rivalry|long-standing rivalry]] with the [[Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/#headtohead|title=Chicago Bears Team Encyclopedia|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=December 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121124751/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/chi/#headtohead|archive-date=November 21, 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team headquarters, [[Halas Hall]], is in the Chicago suburb of [[Lake Forest, Illinois]]. The Bears practice at adjoining facilities there during the season, and began hosting Training Camp at Halas Hall in 2020 after major renovations.

[[File:Pete Rozelle and George Halas.jpg|thumb|left|The team's founder [[George Halas]] (right) with NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], early 1980s]]
Originally named the '''Decatur Staleys''', the club was established by the [[A. E. Staley]] food starch company of [[Decatur, Illinois]] as a company team. This was the typical start for several early professional football franchises. The company hired [[George Halas]] and [[Edward Sternaman|Edward &quot;Dutch&quot; Sternaman]] in 1920 to run the team. The [[1920 Decatur Staleys season]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independentfootball.site90.com/Teams/1920DecStaleys.htm |title=1920 Decatur Staleys |publisher=Independentfootball.site90.com |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075300/http://www.independentfootball.site90.com/Teams/1920DecStaleys.htm |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; was their inaugural [[Regular Season (NFL)|regular season]] completed in the newly formed American Professional Football Association (later renamed the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in 1922).

Full control of the team was turned over to Halas and Sternaman in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Decatur Staleys |work=Local Website |url=http://home.comcast.net/~esterneman/sternaman/football.htm |accessdate=June 15, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040223062149/http://home.comcast.net/~esterneman/sternaman/football.htm |archivedate=February 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Official team and league records cite Halas as the founder as he took over the team in 1920 when it became a charter member of the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Halas: Hall of Fame Member|work=Pro Football Hall of Fame|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=85|accessdate=May 14, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060405133723/http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?PLAYER_ID=85|archive-date=April 5, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team relocated to Chicago in 1921, where the club was renamed the '''Chicago Staleys'''. Under an agreement reached by Halas and Sternaman with Staley, Halas purchased the rights to the club from Staley for US$100.

In 1922, Halas changed the team name from the Staleys to the '''Bears'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/history-by-decades/highlights-1920s.html |title=Highlights from the 1920s |publisher=Chicago Bears |access-date=December 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416071306/http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/history-by-decades/highlights-1920s.html |archive-date=April 16, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team moved into [[Wrigley Field]], which was home to the [[Chicago Cubs]] [[baseball]] franchise. As with several early NFL franchises, the Bears derived their nickname from their city's baseball team (some directly, some indirectly – like the Bears, whose young are called &quot;cubs&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicagoist.com/2007/01/31/ask_chicagoist_why_are_they_called_the_bears.php |title=Ask Chicagoist: Why Are They Called the Bears? |last=Exoo |first=Thales |publisher=[[Gothamist]] |date=January 31, 2007 |website=Chicagoist |access-date=December 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510153921/http://chicagoist.com/2007/01/31/ask_chicagoist_why_are_they_called_the_bears.php |archivedate=May 10, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Halas liked the bright orange-and-blue colors of his alma mater, the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], and the Bears adopted those colors as their own, albeit in a darker shade of each (the blue is [[Pantone]] 5395, [[navy blue]], and the orange is Pantone 1665, similar to burnt orange).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/uniform-history.html |title=Chicago Bears Uniform History |publisher=Chicago Bears |access-date=December 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407205428/http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/uniform-history.html |archive-date=April 7, 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prod.static.bears.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/cb_brand_book_050410.pdf#page=15 |title=The Chicago Bears Brand |publisher=Chicago Bears |format=PDF |access-date=December 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304230137/http://prod.static.bears.clubs.nfl.com/assets/docs/cb_brand_book_050410.pdf#page=15 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Staleys/Bears dominated the league in the early years. Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the [[Canton Bulldogs]] (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4–4–2 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.

The Bears' rivalry with the [[Green Bay Packers]] is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Brian |title=Love-Hate Relationship: Bears-Packers Rivalry Always Bittersweet |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |publisher=Green Bay Packers |date=September 28, 2000 |accessdate=June 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107015852/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |archivedate=January 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1924bears.jpg|left|thumb|The 1924 team photo]]The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in {{nfly|1921}} and remaining competitive throughout the decade. In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the [[Cleveland Bulldogs]] on December 7, even putting the title &quot;World's Champions&quot; on their 1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after November 30 did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1924: The Third Time is Charmed |work=PFRA |url=http://footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=1924b |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013105712/http://footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=1924b |archivedate=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their only losing season came in {{nfly|1929}}.

During the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player [[Red Grange]] within a day of his final game as a collegian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galloping Ghost scared opponents|publisher=ESPN.com|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014213.html|accessdate=December 1, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231152202/http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014213.html|archive-date=December 31, 2005|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite much of the on-field success, the Bears were a team in trouble. They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000–6,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000–50,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21–0. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]]. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17–7 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the Bears cruised to a 60–3 over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChicagoBears&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whittingham |first1=Richard |last2=Ditka |first2=Mike |title=The Chicago Bears: From George Halas to Super Bowl XX |isbn=978-0-671-62885-7 |oclc=13795870 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/chicagobearsfrom0000whit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly dashed. A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to the AFL's [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]], owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]], who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChicagoBears&quot; /&gt;

After the financial losses of the {{nfly|1932}} Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|1932 &quot;Unofficial&quot; NFL Championship]], the Bears defeated the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] in the first indoor American football game at [[Chicago Stadium]].

The success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the very first [[History of NFL Championships|NFL Championship]], the Bears played against the [[New York Giants]], defeating them 23–21. The teams met again in the [[1934 NFL Championship Game|1934 NFL Championship]] where the [[1933 New York Giants season|Giants]], wearing sneakers&lt;ref&gt;See [[1934 NFL Championship Game]] for more information on how the Giants wore sneakers and defeated the Bears&lt;/ref&gt; defeated the Bears 30–13 on a cold, icy day at the [[Polo Grounds]].

===1940s: The Monsters of the Midway===
[[File:1946Bears.jpg|right|thumb|The 1946 NFL Championship team photo]]
From 1940–1947, [[quarterback]] [[Sid Luckman]] led the Bears to victories in four out of the five NFL Championship Games in which they appeared. The team acquired the [[University of Chicago]]'s discarded nickname &quot;[[Monsters of the Midway]]&quot; and their now-famous helmet wishbone &quot;C&quot;, as well as a newly penned [[Bear Down, Chicago Bears|theme song]] that declared them &quot;The Pride and Joy of Illinois&quot;. One famous victory during that period was their 73–0 victory over the favored [[1939 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] at [[Griffith Stadium]] in the [[1940 NFL Championship Game]]; the score is still an NFL record for lopsided results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General History — Chronology (1940 to 1959)|work=Pro Football Hall of Fame|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/chronology/1940-1959.jsp|accessdate=January 1, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213031909/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/chronology/1940-1959.jsp|archive-date=February 13, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secret behind the one-sided outcome was the introduction of a new offensive formation by Halas. The [[T-formation]], as Halas named it, involved two [[running back]]s instead of the traditional one in the backfield. Luckman established himself as one of the franchise's most elite quarterbacks. Between 1939 and 1950, He set the Bears' passing records for most career touchdowns, yards, and completions. Many of Luckman's records stood for decades before they were eclipsed by [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] in {{NFL Year|2014}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sid Luckman|work=Pro Football Hall of Fame|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=135|accessdate=July 12, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907082245/http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?player_id=135|archive-date=September 7, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cutler then went on to break Luckman's franchise record for most career passing touchdowns a year later in {{NFL Year|2015}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14094573/jay-cutler-sets-chicago-bears-record-138th-touchdown-pass|title=Cutler sets Bears record with 138th TD pass|publisher=|date=2015-11-10|access-date=January 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151110210713/http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14094573/jay-cutler-sets-chicago-bears-record-138th-touchdown-pass|archive-date=November 10, 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s–1968: Late-Halas era===
After declining throughout the 1950s, the team rebounded in {{nfly|1963}} to capture its eighth NFL Championship, which would be its last until 1985. The late 1960s and early-1970s produced notable players like [[Dick Butkus]], [[Gale Sayers]], and [[Brian Piccolo]],&lt;ref&gt;the subject of the film ''[[Brian's Song]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who died of [[embryonal carcinoma]] in 1970. The American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled ''[[Brian's Song]]'', starring [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; [[Jack Warden]] won an [[Emmy Award]] for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the Bears of this era.

Halas retired as coach in [[1967 Chicago Bears season|1967]] and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 [[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] between the NFL and the [[American Football League]], the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the [[National Football Conference]], a position that he held until his death in 1983. In his honor, the NFL named the NFC Championship trophy as the [[NFC Championship|George Halas Memorial Trophy]].

===1969–1982: Struggles===
[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 12 - Walter Payton (Walter Payton crop).jpg|thumb|right|Payton set several franchise and NFL records in rushing during his 13-season career with the Bears]]
After the merger, the Bears finished the [[1970 Chicago Bears season|1970 season]] last place in their division, a repeat of their placing in the [[1969 Chicago Bears season|1969 season]]. In [[1975 Chicago Bears season|1975]], the Bears [[1975 NFL Draft|drafted]] [[Walter Payton]] from [[Jackson State University]] with their first pick.

He died from a rare form of liver cancer in 1999 at the age of 45.

On November 1, 1983, a day after the death of George Halas, his oldest daughter, Virginia McCaskey, took over as the majority owner of the team. Her husband, [[Ed McCaskey]], succeeded her father as the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ed McCaskey |work=Cook County Clerk |url=http://www.cookctyclerk.com/html/041503resdoc.htm |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901175938/http://www.cookctyclerk.com/html/041503resdoc.htm |archivedate=September 1, 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son Michael became the third president in team history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike McCaskey |work=ChicagoBears Official Website |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/history_80s.asp |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070121040604/http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/history_80s.asp |archivedate=January 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. McCaskey holds the honorary title of &quot;secretary of the board of directors&quot;, but the 90-year–old [[matriarch]] has been called the glue that holds the franchise together.&lt;ref name=&quot;luvhsr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=McCaskey|work=Cranes Chicago Business|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=9999100024665|accessdate=July 12, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515230439/http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=9999100024665|archive-date=May 15, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. McCaskey's reign as the owner of the Bears was not planned, as her father originally earmarked her brother, [[George Halas Jr.|George &quot;Mugs&quot; Halas Jr.]] as the heir apparent to the franchise. However, he died of a massive heart attack in 1979. Her impact on the team is well-noted as her own family has dubbed her &quot;The First Lady of Sports&quot;, and the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' has listed her as one of Chicago's most powerful women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chicago's Most Powerful Women|work=Chicago Sun-Times| url=http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/powerful_women/sports_mccaskey.html|accessdate=April 24, 2004|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20040511081119/http://www.suntimes.com/special_sections/powerful_women/sports_mccaskey.html|archivedate=May 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983–1985: Contenders, then Super Bowl Champions===
[[File:Mike Ditka.jpg|thumb|left|Bears Hall of Famer [[Mike Ditka]] is the only person in the modern era to win an NFL championship as a player and coach for the Chicago Bears.]]
[[Mike Ditka]], a [[tight end]] for the Bears from [[1961 Chicago Bears season|1961]] to [[1966 Chicago Bears season|1966]], was hired to coach the team by George Halas in [[1982 Chicago Bears season|1982]]. His gritty personality earned him the nickname &quot;Iron Mike&quot;. The team reached the NFC Championship game in 1984. In the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]] season the fire in the Bears–Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315 pound defensive tackle [[William Perry (football)|&quot;Refrigerator&quot; Perry]] as a running back in a [[touchdown]] play at [[Lambeau Field]], against the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the [[AFL-NFL merger]], in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary [[46 defense]] and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song &quot;[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]&quot;. The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the &quot;unlucky 13th&quot; game of the season, a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] affair in which they were defeated by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. At the time, much was made of the fact that the {{nfly|1972}} [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] were the only franchise in history to have had an [[perfect season|undefeated season and post-season]]. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC title game]]. &quot;The Super Bowl Shuffle&quot; was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.

===1986–2003: Post-Super Bowl===
After the 1985 Championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the [[Super Bowl]] under Ditka. Between the firing of Ditka and the hiring of [[Lovie Smith]], the Bears had two head coaches, [[Dave Wannstedt]] and [[Dick Jauron]]. While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl. Therefore, the 1990s was largely considered to be a disappointment.

Before the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, [[Dave McGinnis]] (Arizona's defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position. The Bears scheduled a press conference to announce the hiring before McGinnis agreed to contract terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dave McGinnis|work=Bears History|url=http://www.bearshistory.com/seasons/1999chicagobears.aspx|accessdate=December 13, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208221755/http://www.bearshistory.com/seasons/1999chicagobears.aspx|archive-date=December 8, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Jauron's hiring, Mrs. McCaskey fired her son Michael as president, replacing him with [[Ted Phillips]] and promoting Michael to [[chairman of the board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael McCaskey|work=Cranes Chicago Business|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=9999100024665|accessdate=July 12, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515230439/http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=9999100024665|archive-date=May 15, 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips, the current Bears president, became the first man outside of the Halas-McCaskey family to run the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ted Phillips |work=Chicago Bears.com |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/team/frontofficeBio.jsp?id=29 |accessdate=July 12, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626100503/http://www.chicagobears.com/team/frontofficeBio.jsp?id=29 |archivedate=June 26, 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–2012: Lovie Smith era===
[[Lovie Smith]], hired on January 15, 2004, is the third post-Ditka head coach. Joining the Bears as a rookie head coach, Smith brought the highly successful [[Tampa 2]] defensive scheme with him to Chicago. Before his second season with the Bears, the team rehired their former offensive coordinator and then [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|Illinois]] head coach [[Ron Turner (football coach)|Ron Turner]] to improve the Bears' struggling offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Chicago Bears |work=Vividseats.com |url=http://www.vividseats.com/nfl/chicago-bears-tickets.html |accessdate=October 16, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017151717/http://www.vividseats.com/nfl/chicago-bears-tickets.html |archive-date=October 17, 2006 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{nfly|2005}}, the Bears won their division and reached the [[2005–06 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time in four years. Their previous playoff berth was earned by winning the NFC Central in {{nfly|2001}}. The Bears improved upon their success the following season, by clinching their second consecutive NFC North title during Week 13 of the {{nfly|2006}} season, winning their first playoff game since 1995, and earning a trip to [[Super Bowl XLI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GameCenter: Recap |work=Superbowl.com |url=http://www.superbowl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20070121_NO@CHI |accessdate=January 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125134400/http://www.superbowl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20070121_NO%40CHI |archivedate=January 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they fell short of the championship, losing 29–17 to the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. Following the 2006 season, the club decided to give Smith a contract extension through 2011, at roughly $5 million per year. This comes a season after being the lowest paid head coach in the National Football League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2783609|title=Bears coach Smith, GM Angelo ink contract extensions|publisher=Sports.espn.go.com|date=March 1, 2007|accessdate=December 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604015719/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2783609|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has played in over a thousand games since becoming a charter member of the NFL in {{nfly|1920}}. Through the 2010 season, they led the NFL in overall franchise wins with 704 and had an overall record of 704–512–42 (going 687–494–42 during the regular season and 17–18 in the playoffs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Time Chicago Bears Record|work=Pro Football Hall of Fame|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=6|accessdate=June 15, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623033757/http://profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=6|archive-date=June 23, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2010 the Bears recorded franchise win number 700 in a win against the [[Miami Dolphins]].

[[File:Staleythebear.jpg|thumb|right|Staley Da Bear in 2008.]]
Before the [[2003 Chicago Bears season|2003 season]], the team had two unofficial mascots named &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Bearman&quot;. &quot;Rocky&quot; was a man who donned a #1 Bears jersey, carried a [[megaphone]], and started chants all over Soldier Field during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, in a fashion similar to [[Fireman Ed]]. There is no known source of who &quot;Rocky&quot; was, and presumably currently lives in Northwestern Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rocky | work = Bearshistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx | accessdate = May 3, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060420090157/http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx | archive-date = April 20, 2006 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Don Wachter, also known as &quot;Bearman&quot;, is a [[season ticket]] holder who decided in 1995 that he could also assist the team by cheerleading, similar to Rocky. The club allowed him to run across the field with a large Bears flag during player introductions and each team score (a role currently done by the Bears 4th Phase and Bears captains). In 1996, he donned his &quot;costume&quot; of face paint, bear head and arms, and a number [[Doug Plank|46]] jersey. &quot;Bearman&quot; was forced to stop wearing his costume with the introduction of [[Staley Da Bear]] in 2003; however, in 2005, Wachter was allowed in costume again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bearman | work = Bearshistory.com | url = http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx | accessdate = May 1, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060420090157/http://www.bearshistory.com/sidelines/chicagohoneybears.aspx | archive-date = April 20, 2006 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalries==
===Divisional rivals===
====Green Bay Packers====

The [[Green Bay Packers]] are the Bears' biggest rivals since their team's inception in 1920. The Green Bay Packers currently have the lead at 97–95–6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rosenthal |first=Phil |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-cubs-bears-tv-ratings-spt-1022-20161021-story.html |title=Cubs clobber Bears in Thursday's TV ratings |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=October 21, 2016 |accessdate=December 18, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218022815/http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-cubs-bears-tv-ratings-spt-1022-20161021-story.html |archive-date=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the [[New York Giants]] in the [[1941 NFL Championship Game]], and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a [[Super Bowl XLV]] win over the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20–0. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14–10. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3–0 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as [[Frank Hanny]] of the Bears and [[Tillie Voss|Walter Voss]] of the Packers were ejected for punching each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsportswisconsin.com/01/21/11/History-is-special-between-old-rivals/landing.html?blockID=395657|title=History is special between old rivals|publisher=Foxsportswisconsin.com|date=|accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry also featured one of the last successful [[fair catch kick]]s in 1968, when Bears kicker [[Mac Percival]] kicked the game-winning field goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=8676 |title=Bears shocked Pack with late free kick |publisher=Chicagobears.com |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415035631/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=8676 |archivedate=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Minnesota Vikings====

Chicago and [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota]] took each other on in the Vikings' inaugural game, with the Vikings defeating the Bears in a 37–13 rout, and Minnesota currently holds the series lead 60–54–2.

====Detroit Lions====
{{main|Bears–Lions rivalry}}
The [[Detroit Lions]] and Bears have faced off since the Lions' inception in 1930, when they were known as the Portsmouth Spartans, with the Spartans winning, 7–6, and Chicago winning the second meeting, 14–6. Since then, the Bears have led the series, 99–74–5. The rivalry grew in 1932, when the Bears and Spartans met in the first ever postseason game in NFL history, with the Bears winning the [[1932 NFL Playoff Game|game 9–0]]. The game also was known as the first &quot;[[Indoor American football|indoor football]]&quot; game, as the game took place in indoor [[Chicago Stadium]] due to a blizzard at the time.

==Stadium==
{{Main|Wrigley Field|Soldier Field}}
[[File:Soldier Field, Chicago.jpg|thumb|Soldier Field in 2011, as seen from the lakeshore]]
Soldier Field, located on [[Lake Shore Drive]] in Chicago, is the current home of the Bears. The Bears moved to Soldier Field in 1971 after outgrowing [[Wrigley Field]], the team's home for 50 years.

In [[2002 Chicago Bears season|2002]], the stadium was closed and rebuilt with only the exterior wall of the stadium being preserved. It was closed on Sunday, January 20, 2002, a day after the Bears lost in the [[2001–02 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. It reopened on September 27, 2003 after a complete rebuild (the second in the stadium's history).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wrigley Field&quot; /&gt; Many fans refer to the rebuilt stadium as &quot;New Soldier Field&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soldier Field History |work=ChicagoBears.com |url=http://www.chicagobears.com/history/sf_facts.jsp |accessdate=July 16, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205064756/http://www.chicagobears.com/history/sf_facts.jsp |archivedate=December 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the {{nfly|2002}} season, the Bears played their home games at the University of Illinois' [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]], where they went 3–5.

Many critics have negative views of the new stadium.

In the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], the Bears won the NFC North Division and the No. 2 Seed in the NFC Playoffs, entitling them to play at least one home game in the postseason. The team hosted (and lost) their divisional round match on January 15, 2006 against the [[2005 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]].

While the Super Bowl XX Champion Bears were a fixture of mainstream American pop culture in the 1980s, the Bears made a prior mark with the 1971 American TV movie ''[[Brian's Song]]'' starring [[Billy Dee Williams]] as Gale Sayers and [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] as Brian Piccolo.

The 1985 team is also remembered for recording the song &quot;[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]&quot;, which reached number forty-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Greatest NFL Team's of All-Time |work=[[WatchMojo.com]] |url=http://www.watchmojo.com/sports/football/010.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929083541/http://www.watchmojo.com/sports/football/010.php |archivedate=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=July 16, 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=These records were meant to be broken|work=Floridan|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/012801/news_pf/Floridian/These_records_were_ma.shtml|accessdate=January 28, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003224710/http://www.sptimes.com/News/012801/news_pf/Floridian/These_records_were_ma.shtml|archive-date=October 3, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for the song depicts the team [[rapping]] that they are &quot;not here to start no trouble&quot; but instead &quot;just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle&quot;.

Ditka's success and popularity in Chicago has led him to land analyst roles on various American football pregame shows. Ditka worked for both the ''[[NFL on NBC]]'' and CBS's ''[[The NFL Today]]'', and he currently works on ESPN's ''[[Sunday NFL Countdown]]'' and provided Friday night analysis on the Bears on [[WBBM-TV]]'s ''2 on Football'' with former WBBM-TV sports director [[Mark Malone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ditka joins CBS2 |work=WBBM-TV |url=http://cbs2chicago.com/pressreleases/local_story_197002133.html |accessdate=July 14, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214041157/http://cbs2chicago.com/pressreleases/local_story_197002133.html |archivedate=February 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the color analyst for all local broadcasts of Bears preseason games.

He scored 1,116 points as the Bears kicker from 1985 to 1995. He is followed by running back [[Walter Payton]], with 750 points. Payton holds the team record for career rushing yards with 16,726.&lt;ref name=&quot;records&quot; /&gt; That was an NFL record until [[Emmitt Smith]] of the Dallas Cowboys broke it in {{nfly|2002}}. Former Bears running back [[Matt Forte]], who started playing for the Bears in 2008, is the closest to Payton's record with 6,985 yards. Forte also holds the team's single season record for rookies in rushing attempts, rushing yards and receptions. [[Mark Bortz]] holds the record for most Bear playoff appearances, with 13 between 1983 and 1994, and is followed by Kevin Butler, [[Dennis Gentry]], [[Dan Hampton]], [[Jay Hilgenberg]], Steve McMichael, [[Ron Rivera]], [[Mike Singletary]], and [[Keith Van Horne]], who have each played in 12 playoff games.

The 1940 Chicago Bears team holds the record for the biggest margin of victory in an NFL game ([[NFL playoffs|playoff]] or regular season) with a 73–0 victory over the Washington Redskins in the [[1940 NFL Championship Game]]. The largest home victory for the Bears came in a 61–7 result against the Green Bay Packers in 1980. The largest defeat in club history was a 52–0 loss against the Baltimore Colts in 1964. The club recorded undefeated regular seasons in 1934 and 1942, but (unlike the 1972 Dolphins) did not win the championship game in either season. In 1934, the club completed a 13–0 record but were defeated by the New York Giants, and in 1942 the club completed an 11–0 record but were defeated by the Redskins. Had the Bears won either championship, the club would have completed a championship three-peat – a feat completed only by the Packers (twice), although no team has done it since the AFL-NFL merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL History|work=NFL.com|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/standings|accessdate=August 1, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061225165438/http://www.nfl.com/history/standings/|archive-date=December 25, 2006|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halas holds the team record for coaching the most seasons with 40 and for having the most career victories of 324.
