[[File:USMC-110806-M-IX060-148.jpg|thumb|Cement powder, here conditioned in bag, is mixed with fine and coarse aggregates and water.]]

A '''cement''' is a [[binder (material)|binder]], a substance used for construction that [[solidification|set]]s, hardens, and adheres to other [[material]]s to bind them together. Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel ([[construction aggregate|aggregate]]) together. Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] for masonry, or with [[sand]] and [[gravel]], produces [[concrete]]. Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is only behind water as the planet's most-consumed resource.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46455844|title=The massive CO2 emitter you may not know about|last=Rodgers|first=Lucy|date=17 December 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=17 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cements used in construction are usually [[inorganic]], often [[lime (material)|lime]] or [[calcium silicate]] based, and can be characterized as either '''hydraulic''' or '''non-hydraulic''', depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water (see [[Lime mortar#Hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime|hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster]]).

'''Non-hydraulic cement''' does not set in wet conditions or under water. Rather, it sets as it dries and reacts with [[carbon dioxide]] in the air. It is resistant to attack by chemicals after setting.

'''Hydraulic cements''' (e.g., [[Portland cement]]) set and become [[adhesive]] due to a [[chemical reaction]] between the dry ingredients and water. The chemical reaction results in mineral [[hydrate]]s that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack. This allows setting in wet conditions or under water and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack. The chemical process for hydraulic cement was found by ancient Romans who used [[volcanic ash]] ([[pozzolana]]) with added lime (calcium oxide).

The word &quot;cement&quot; can be traced back to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] term ''[[opus caementicium]]'', used to describe [[masonry]] resembling modern [[concrete]] that was made from crushed rock with [[Calcium oxide|burnt lime]] as binder. The volcanic ash and pulverized [[brick]] supplements that were added to the burnt lime, to obtain a [[hydraulic binder]], were later referred to as ''cementum'', ''cimentum'', ''cäment'', and ''cement''. In modern times, organic polymers are sometimes used as cements in concrete.

If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world with up to 2.8bn tonnes, surpassed only by China and the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/25/concrete-the-most-destructive-material-on-earth Concrete: the most destructive material on Earth] The Guardian  31.8. 2019 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
Cement materials can be classified into two distinct categories: non-hydraulic cements and hydraulic cements according to their respective setting and hardening mechanisms. Hydraulic cements setting and hardening involve hydration reactions and therefore require water, while non-hydraulic cements only react with a gas and can directly set under air.

===Non-hydraulic cement===
[[File:Calcium oxide powder.JPG|thumb|[[Calcium oxide]] obtained by [[thermal decomposition]] of [[calcium carbonate]] at high temperature (above 825&amp;nbsp;°C).]]

'''Non-hydraulic cement''', such as [[slaked lime]] ([[calcium oxide]] mixed with water), hardens by [[carbonation]] in contact with [[carbon dioxide]], which is present in the air (~&amp;nbsp;412 vol. ppm ≃ 0.04 vol.&amp;nbsp;%). First [[calcium oxide]] (lime) is produced from [[calcium carbonate]] ([[limestone]] or [[chalk]]) by [[calcination]] at temperatures above 825&amp;nbsp;°C (1,517&amp;nbsp;°F) for about 10 hours at [[atmospheric pressure]]:
:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → CaO + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The calcium oxide is then ''spent'' (slaked) mixing it with water to make slaked lime ([[calcium hydroxide]]):
:CaO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Once the excess water is completely evaporated (this process is technically called ''setting''), the carbonation starts:
:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
This reaction takes time, because the [[partial pressure]] of carbon dioxide in the air is low (~&amp;nbsp;0.4&amp;nbsp;millibar). The carbonation reaction requires that the dry cement be exposed to air, so the slaked lime is a non-hydraulic cement and cannot be used under water. This process is called the ''lime cycle''.

===Hydraulic cement===
[[Image:LDClinkerScaled.jpg|thumb|[[Clinker (cement)|Clinker]] nodules produced by sintering at 1450&amp;nbsp;°C.]]

Conversely, '''hydraulic cement''' hardens by hydration of the [[Clinker (cement)|clinker]] minerals when water is added. Hydraulic cements (such as [[Portland cement]]) are made of a mixture of silicates and oxides, the four main mineral phases of the clinker, abbreviated in the [[cement chemist notation]], being:
:C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S: [[Alite]] (3CaO·SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;);
:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S: [[Belite]] (2CaO·SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;);
:C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A: [[Tricalcium aluminate]] (3CaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (historically, and still occasionally, called ''celite'');
:C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AF: [[Brownmillerite]] (4CaO·Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

The silicates are responsible for the cement's mechanical properties — the tricalcium aluminate and brownmillerite are essential for the formation of the liquid phase during the [[sintering]] ([[Pottery#Firing|firing]]) process of clinker at high temperature in the [[Cement kiln|kiln]]. The chemistry of these reactions is not completely clear and is still the object of research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cee.mit.edu/cee-in-focus/2011/spring/cement-structure Cement's basic molecular structure finally decoded (MIT, 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221105202/http://cee.mit.edu/cee-in-focus/2011/spring/cement-structure |date=21 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Perhaps the earliest known occurrence of cement is from twelve million years ago. A deposit of cement was formed after an occurrence of oil shale located adjacent to a bed of limestone burned due to natural causes. These ancient deposits were investigated in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=MAST&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Concrete|url=http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/hist.html|publisher=Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=8 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127052951/http://matse1.matse.illinois.edu/concrete/hist.html|archivedate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives to cement used in antiquity===
Cement, chemically speaking, is a product that includes lime as the primary curing ingredient, but is far from the first material used for cementation. The [[Babylonia]]ns and [[Assyria]]ns used [[bitumen]] to bind together burnt [[brick]] or [[alabaster]] slabs. In [[Egypt]] stone blocks were cemented together with a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] made of [[sand]] and roughly burnt [[gypsum]] (CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; · 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which often contained [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Blezard&quot;/&gt;

===Macedonians and Romans===
Lime (calcium oxide) was used on Crete and by the ancient Greeks. There is evidence that the [[Minoans]] of Crete used crushed potshards as an artificial pozzolan for hydraulic cement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blezard&quot;/&gt; Nobody knows who first discovered that a combination of [[Slaked lime|hydrated non-hydraulic lime]] and a [[pozzolan]] produces a hydraulic mixture (see also: [[Pozzolanic reaction]]), but such concrete was used by the [[Ancient Macedonians]],&lt;ref&gt;Brabant, Malcolm (12 April 2011).

=== Middle Ages ===
Any preservation of this knowledge in literature from the [[Middle Ages]] is unknown, but medieval [[masonry|masons]] and some military engineers actively used hydraulic cement in structures such as [[canal]]s, [[fortress]]es, [[harbor]]s, and [[Shipyard|shipbuilding facilities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sismondo&quot;&gt;Sismondo, Sergio (2009).

[[Tabby (cement)|Tabby]] is a building material made from oyster-shell lime, sand, and whole oyster shells to form a concrete. The Spanish introduced it to the Americas in the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Taves, Loren Sickels (Mar–Apr 1995).

===18th century===
The technical knowledge for making hydraulic cement was formalized by French and British engineers in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sismondo&quot;/&gt;

[[John Smeaton]] made an important contribution to the development of cements while planning the construction of the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) in the [[English Channel]] now known as [[Smeaton's Tower]]. He needed a hydraulic mortar that would set and develop some strength in the twelve-hour period between successive high tides. He performed experiments with combinations of different limestones and additives including trass and [[pozzolana]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Blezard&quot;&gt;Blezard, Robert G. (2004) &quot;The History of Calcareous Cements&quot; in Hewlett, Peter C., ed.. [https://books.google.com/books?id=v1JVu4iifnMC ''Leaʼs chemistry of cement and concrete'']. 4th ed. Amsterdam: Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann. pp. 1–24. {{ISBN|9780080535418}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did exhaustive market research on the available hydraulic limes, visiting their production sites, and noted that the &quot;hydraulicity&quot; of the lime was directly related to the clay content of the [[limestone]] used to make it. Smeaton was a [[civil engineer]] by profession, and took the idea no further.

In the [[Atlantic coastal plain|South Atlantic seaboard]] of the United States, [[Tabby (cement)|tabby]] relying on the oyster-shell [[midden]]s of earlier Native American populations was used in house construction from the 1730s to the 1860s.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] particularly, good quality building stone became ever more expensive during a period of rapid growth, and it became a common practice to construct prestige buildings from the new industrial bricks, and to finish them with a [[stucco]] to imitate stone. Hydraulic limes were favored for this, but the need for a fast set time encouraged the development of new cements. Most famous was Parker's &quot;[[Roman cement]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, A.J. (1977) ''The Cement Industry 1796–1914: A History'', David &amp; Charles. {{ISBN|0-7153-7386-2}}, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This was developed by [[James Parker (cement maker)|James Parker]] in the 1780s, and finally patented in 1796. It was, in fact, nothing like material used by the Romans, but was a &quot;natural cement&quot; made by burning [[Septarian concretion|septaria]] – nodules that are found in certain clay deposits, and that contain both [[clay minerals]] and [[calcium carbonate]]. The burnt [[nodule (geology)|nodules]] were ground to a fine powder. This product, made into a mortar with sand, set in 5–15 minutes. The success of &quot;Roman cement&quot; led other manufacturers to develop rival products by burning artificial [[hydraulic lime]] cements of [[clay]] and [[chalk]].
Roman cement quickly became popular but was largely replaced by Portland cement in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blezard&quot;/&gt;

===19th century===
Apparently unaware of Smeaton's work, the same principle was identified by Frenchman [[Louis Vicat]] in the first decade of the nineteenth century. Vicat went on to devise a method of combining chalk and clay into an intimate mixture, and, burning this, produced an &quot;artificial cement&quot; in 1817&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nationalcement.com/faq/who-discovered-cement|title= Who Discovered Cement|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130204131106/http://www.nationalcement.com/faq/who-discovered-cement|archivedate= 4 February 2013|df= dmy-all|date= 12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered the &quot;principal forerunner&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blezard&quot;/&gt; of Portland cement and &quot;...Edgar Dobbs of Southwark patented a cement of this kind in 1811.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blezard&quot;/&gt;

In Russia, [[Egor Cheliev]] created a new binder by mixing lime and clay. His results were published in 1822 in his book ''A Treatise on the Art to Prepare a Good Mortar'' published in St. Petersburg. A few years later in 1825, he published another book, which described various methods of making cement and concrete, and the benefits of cement in the construction of buildings and embankments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Znachko-Iavorskii |author2=I.

[[Portland cement]], the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of [[concrete]], [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], [[stucco]], and non-speciality [[grout]], was developed in [[England]] in the mid 19th century, and usually originates from [[limestone]]. [[James Frost (cement maker)|James Frost]] produced what he called &quot;British cement&quot; in a similar manner around the same time, but did not obtain a patent until 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, A.J. (1977) ''The Cement Industry 1796–1914: A History'', David &amp; Charles. {{ISBN|0-7153-7386-2}}, Ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1824, [[Joseph Aspdin]] patented a similar material, which he called ''Portland cement'', because the render made from it was in color similar to the prestigious [[Portland stone]] quarried on the [[Isle of Portland]], Dorset, England. However, Aspdins' cement was nothing like modern Portland cement but was a first step in its development, called a ''proto-Portland cement''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blezard&quot;/&gt; Joseph Aspdins' son [[William Aspdin]] had left his father's company and in his cement manufacturing apparently accidentally produced [[calcium silicate]]s in the 1840s, a middle step in the development of Portland cement. William Aspdin's innovation was counterintuitive for manufacturers of &quot;artificial cements&quot;, because they required more lime in the mix (a problem for his father), a much higher kiln temperature (and therefore more fuel), and the resulting [[clinker (cement)|clinker]] was very hard and rapidly wore down the [[millstone]]s, which were the only available grinding technology of the time. Manufacturing costs were therefore considerably higher, but the product set reasonably slowly and developed strength quickly, thus opening up a market for use in concrete. The use of concrete in construction grew rapidly from 1850 onward, and was soon the dominant use for cements. Thus Portland cement began its predominant role. [[Isaac Charles Johnson]] further refined the production of ''meso-Portland cement'' (middle stage of development) and claimed he was the real father of Portland cement.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Thomas F. and Kemp, Emory Leland (1994). ''Cement mills along the Potomac River''. Morgantown, WV: West Virginia University Press. p. 16. {{ISBN|9781885907004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Setting time and &quot;early strength&quot; are important characteristics of cements. Hydraulic limes, &quot;natural&quot; cements, and &quot;artificial&quot; cements all rely on their [[belite]] content for [[Strength of materials|strength]] development. Belite develops strength slowly. Because they were burned at temperatures below {{convert|1250|C|F}}, they contained no [[alite]], which is responsible for early strength in modern cements. The first cement to consistently contain alite was made by William Aspdin in the early 1840s: This was what we call today &quot;modern&quot; Portland cement. Because of the air of mystery with which William Aspdin surrounded his product, others (''e.g.,'' Vicat and Johnson) have claimed precedence in this invention, but recent analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hewlett, Peter|title=Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1JVu4iifnMC|year=2003|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-08-053541-8|page=Ch. 1|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101041700/https://books.google.com/books?id=v1JVu4iifnMC|archivedate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that William Aspdin's product made at [[Northfleet]], [[Kent]] was a true alite-based cement. However, Aspdin's methods were &quot;rule-of-thumb&quot;: Vicat is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements, and Johnson established the importance of [[sintering]] the mix in the kiln.

In the US the first large-scale use of cement was [[Rosendale cement]], a natural cement mined from a massive deposit of a large [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] deposit discovered in the early 19th century near [[Rosendale, New York]]. Rosendale cement was extremely popular for the foundation of buildings (''e.g.'', [[Statue of Liberty]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[Brooklyn Bridge]]) and lining water pipes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural Cement Comes Back&quot;&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VCcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 &quot;Natural Cement Comes Back&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425093525/https://books.google.com/books?id=VCcDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA118 |date=25 April 2016 }}, October 1941, ''Popular Science''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sorel cement]] was patented in 1867 by Frenchman [[Stanislas Sorel]]. It was stronger than Portland cement but its poor water resistance and corrosive qualities limited its use in building construction. The next development in the manufacture of Portland cement was the introduction of the [[rotary kiln]], which produced a stronger, more homogeneous mixture and facilitated a continuous manufacturing process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blezard&quot;/&gt;

In the US, after World War One, the long [[curing time]] of at least a month for [[Rosendale cement]] made it unpopular for constructing highways and bridges, and many states and construction firms turned to Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement, by the end of the 1920s only one of the 15 Rosendale cement companies had survived. But in the early 1930s, builders discovered that, while Portland cement set faster, it was not as durable, especially for highways—to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had helped construct the New York City's [[Catskill Aqueduct]], was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and Portland cements that had the good attributes of both. It was highly durable and had a much faster setting time. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near [[New Paltz, New York]], using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of Portland cement. It was a success, and for decades the Rosendale-Portland cement blend was used in highway and bridge construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural Cement Comes Back&quot;/&gt;

==Modern cements==
Modern hydraulic development began with the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] (around 1800), driven by three main needs:
* Hydraulic [[cement render]] ([[stucco]]) for finishing brick buildings in wet climates
* Hydraulic mortars for masonry construction of harbor works, etc., in contact with sea water
* Development of strong concretes

{{Components of Cement, Comparison of Chemical and Physical Characteristics}}
Modern cements are often [[Portland cement]] or Portland cement blends, but industry also uses other cements.

=== Portland cement ===
{{Main|Portland cement}}
Portland cement is by far the most common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating [[limestone]] (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as [[clay]]) to {{convert|1450|C}} in a [[kiln]], in a process known as [[calcination]] that liberates a molecule of [[carbon dioxide]] from the calcium carbonate to form [[calcium oxide]], or quicklime, which then chemically combines with the other materials in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of [[gypsum]] into a powder to make ''ordinary Portland cement'', the most commonly used type of cement (often referred to as OPC).
Portland cement is a basic ingredient of [[concrete]], [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], and most non-specialty [[grout]]. The most common use for Portland cement is to make concrete. Concrete is a composite material made of [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] ([[gravel]] and [[sand]]), cement, and [[water]]. As a construction material, concrete can be cast in almost any shape, and once it hardens, can be a structural (load bearing) element. Portland cement may be grey or white.

===Portland cement blend===
&lt;!--Clinker (cement) links here---&gt;
Portland cement blends are often available as inter-ground mixtures from cement producers, but similar formulations are often also mixed from the ground components at the concrete mixing plant.

'''Portland blast-furnace slag cement, or Blast furnace cement''' (ASTM C595 and EN 197-1 nomenclature respectively), contains up to 95% [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]], with the rest Portland clinker and a little gypsum. All compositions produce high ultimate strength, but as slag content is increased, early strength is reduced, while sulfate resistance increases and heat evolution diminishes. Used as an economic alternative to Portland sulfate-resisting and low-heat cements.

'''Portland-fly ash cement''' contains up to 40% [[fly ash]] under ASTM standards (ASTM C595), or 35% under EN standards (EN 197-1). The fly ash is [[pozzolanic]], so that ultimate strength is maintained. Because fly ash addition allows a lower concrete water content, early strength can also be maintained. Where good quality cheap fly ash is available, this can be an economic alternative to ordinary Portland cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Fly Ash | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm | accessdate = 24 January 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070621161733/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/flyash.htm | archivedate = 21 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Portland pozzolan cement''' includes fly ash cement, since fly ash is a [[pozzolan]], but also includes cements made from other natural or artificial pozzolans. In countries where [[volcanic ash]]es are available (e.g., [[Italy]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]]), these cements are often the most common form in use. The maximum replacement ratios are generally defined as for Portland-fly ash cement.

'''Portland silica fume cement'''. Addition of [[silica fume]] can yield exceptionally high strengths, and cements containing 5–20% silica fume are occasionally produced, with 10% being the maximum allowed addition under EN 197-1. However, silica fume is more usually added to Portland cement at the concrete mixer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Silica Fume | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | accessdate = 24 January 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070122022403/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | archivedate = 22 January 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Masonry cements''' are used for preparing bricklaying [[mortar (masonry)|mortars]] and [[stuccos]], and must not be used in concrete. They are usually complex proprietary formulations containing Portland clinker and a number of other ingredients that may include limestone, hydrated lime, air entrainers, retarders, waterproofers and coloring agents. They are formulated to yield workable mortars that allow rapid and consistent masonry work. Subtle variations of Masonry cement in the US are Plastic Cements and Stucco Cements. These are designed to produce a controlled bond with masonry blocks.

'''Expansive cements''' contain, in addition to Portland clinker, expansive clinkers (usually sulfoaluminate clinkers), and are designed to offset the effects of drying shrinkage normally encountered in hydraulic cements. This cement can make concrete for floor slabs (up to 60&amp;nbsp;m square) without contraction joints.

'''White blended cements''' may be made using white clinker (containing little or no iron) and white supplementary materials such as high-purity [[metakaolin]]. '''Colored cements''' serve decorative purposes. Some standards allow the addition of pigments to produce ''colored Portland cement''. Other standards (e.g., ASTM) do not allow pigments in Portland cement, and colored cements are sold as ''blended hydraulic cements''.

'''Very finely ground cements''' are cement mixed with sand or with slag or other pozzolan type minerals that are extremely finely ground together. Such cements can have the same physical characteristics as normal cement but with 50% less cement, particularly due to their increased surface area for the chemical reaction. Even with intensive grinding they can use up to 50% less energy (and thus less carbon emissions) to fabricate than ordinary Portland cements.&lt;ref name=Justnes&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mechanism for performance of energetically modified cement versus corresponding blended cement | url = http://www.emccement.com/Articles/EMC%20mechanism%20paper.pdf| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110710185446/http://www.emccement.com/Articles/EMC%20mechanism%20paper.pdf| archivedate = 10 July 2011|journal=Cement and Concrete Research |volume=35 |year=2005|pages= 315–323|doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.05.022 | last1 = Justnes | first1 = Harald | last2 = Elfgren | first2 = Lennart | last3 = Ronin | first3 = Vladimir | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cements===

''Pozzolan-lime cements'' are mixtures of ground [[pozzolanic ash|pozzolan]] and [[Agricultural lime|lime]]. These are the cements the Romans used, and are present in surviving Roman structures like the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. They develop strength slowly, but their ultimate strength can be very high. The hydration products that produce strength are essentially the same as those in Portland cement.

''Slag-lime cements''—[[ground granulated blast-furnace slag]] is not hydraulic on its own, but is &quot;activated&quot; by addition of alkalis, most economically using lime. They are similar to pozzolan lime cements in their properties. Only granulated slag (i.e., water-quenched, glassy slag) is effective as a cement component.

''Supersulfated cements'' contain about 80% ground granulated blast furnace slag, 15% [[gypsum]] or [[anhydrite]] and a little Portland clinker or lime as an activator. They produce strength by formation of [[ettringite]], with strength growth similar to a slow Portland cement. They exhibit good resistance to aggressive agents, including sulfate.
[[Calcium aluminate cements]] are hydraulic cements made primarily from [[limestone]] and [[bauxite]]. The active ingredients are monocalcium aluminate CaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CaO · Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or CA in [[Cement chemist notation]], CCN) and [[mayenite]] Ca&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; (12 CaO · 7 Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, or C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; in CCN). Strength forms by hydration to calcium aluminate hydrates. They are well-adapted for use in refractory (high-temperature resistant) concretes, e.g., for furnace linings.

''Calcium sulfoaluminate cements'' are made from clinkers that include [[ye'elimite]] (Ca&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(AlO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{overline|S}} in [[Cement chemist notation|Cement chemist's notation]]) as a primary phase. They are used in expansive cements, in ultra-high early strength cements, and in &quot;low-energy&quot; cements. Hydration produces ettringite, and specialized physical properties (such as expansion or rapid reaction) are obtained by adjustment of the availability of calcium and sulfate ions. Their use as a low-energy alternative to Portland cement has been pioneered in China, where several million tonnes per year are produced.&lt;ref&gt;Bye G.C. (1999), ''Portland Cement'' 2nd Ed., Thomas Telford. pp. 206–208. {{ISBN|0-7277-2766-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1680/adcr.1999.11.1.15|title=Development of the use of sulfo- and ferroaluminate cements in China|journal=Advances in Cement Research|volume=11|pages=15–21|year=1999|last1=Zhang|first1=Liang|last2=Su|first2=Muzhen|last3=Wang|first3=Yanmou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy requirements are lower because of the lower kiln temperatures required for reaction, and the lower amount of limestone (which must be endothermically decarbonated) in the mix. In addition, the lower limestone content and lower fuel consumption leads to a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission around half that associated with Portland clinker. However, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are usually significantly higher.

''&quot;Natural&quot; cements'' corresponding to certain cements of the pre-Portland era, are produced by burning [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous limestones]] at moderate temperatures. The level of clay components in the limestone (around 30–35%) is such that large amounts of [[belite]] (the low-early strength, high-late strength mineral in Portland cement) are formed without the formation of excessive amounts of free lime. As with any natural material, such cements have highly variable properties.

''[[Geopolymer]] cements'' are made from mixtures of water-soluble alkali metal silicates, and aluminosilicate mineral powders such as [[fly ash]] and [[metakaolin]].

'''Polymer cements''' are made from organic chemicals that polymerise. Producers often use [[thermoset]] materials. While they are often significantly more expensive, they can give a water proof material that has useful tensile strength.

==Setting, hardening and curing==
Cement starts to set when mixed with water, which causes a series of hydration chemical reactions. The constituents slowly hydrate and the mineral hydrates solidify and harden. The interlocking of the hydrates gives cement its strength. Contrary to popular belief, hydraulic cement does not set by drying out — proper curing requires maintaining the appropriate moisture content necessary for the hydration reactions during the setting and the hardening processes. If hydraulic cements dry out during the curing phase, the resulting product can be insufficiently hydrated and significantly weakened. A minimum temperature of 5&amp;nbsp;°C is recommended, and no more than 30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sovchem.co.uk/profile/news/read/id/206/|title=Using cement based products during winter months|last=|first=|date=29 May 2018|website=sovchem.co.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concrete at young age must be protected against water evaporation due to direct insolation, elevated temperature, low [[relative humidity]] and wind.

==Safety issues==
Bags of cement routinely have health and safety warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly [[alkali]]ne, but the setting process is [[exothermic]]. As a result, wet cement is strongly [[causticity|caustic]] (pH = 13.5) and can easily cause severe [[skin burn]]s if not promptly washed off with water. Similarly, dry cement powder in contact with [[mucous membrane]]s can cause severe eye or respiratory irritation. Some trace elements, such as chromium, from impurities naturally present in the raw materials used to produce cement may cause [[Allergic contact dermatitis|allergic dermatitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hse.gov.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/cis26.pdf |title=Construction Information Sheet No 26 (revision2) |accessdate=15 February 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604222509/http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/cis26.pdf |publisher=hse.gov.uk|archivedate=4 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are often added to cement to convert the carcinogenic hexavalent [[Chromate ion|chromate]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) into trivalent chromium (Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), a less toxic chemical species.

Over 2011 and 2012, global consumption continued to climb, rising to 3585 Mt in 2011 and 3736 Mt in 2012, while annual [[Economic growth|growth rates]] eased to 8.3% and 4.2%, respectively.

China, representing an increasing share of world cement consumption, remains the main engine of global growth. By 2012, Chinese demand was recorded at 2160 Mt, representing 58% of world consumption. Annual growth rates, which reached 16% in 2010, appear to have softened, slowing to 5–6% over 2011 and 2012, as China's economy targets a more sustainable growth rate.

Outside of China, worldwide consumption climbed by 4.4% to 1462 Mt in 2010, 5% to 1535 Mt in 2011, and finally 2.7% to 1576 Mt in 2012.

The performance in North America and Europe over the 2010–12 period contrasted strikingly with that of China, as the global financial crisis evolved into a sovereign debt crisis for many economies in this region and recession. Cement consumption levels for this region fell by 1.9% in 2010 to 445 Mt, recovered by 4.9% in 2011, then dipped again by 1.1% in 2012.

The performance in the rest of the world, which includes many emerging economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America and representing some 1020 Mt cement demand in 2010, was positive and more than offset the declines in North America and Europe.

=={{anchor|Environmental and social impacts}}Environmental impacts==
Cement manufacture causes environmental impacts at all stages of the process. These include emissions of airborne pollution in the form of dust, gases, noise and vibration when operating machinery and during blasting in [[quarry|quarries]], and damage to countryside from quarrying. Equipment to reduce dust emissions during quarrying and manufacture of cement is widely used, and equipment to trap and separate exhaust gases are coming into increased use. Environmental protection also includes the re-integration of quarries into the countryside after they have been closed down by returning them to nature or re-cultivating them.

Nearly 900&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are emitted for every 1000&amp;nbsp;kg of Portland cement produced. In the European Union, the specific energy consumption for the production of cement clinker has been reduced by approximately 30% since the 1970s. This reduction in primary energy requirements is equivalent to approximately 11 million tonnes of coal per year with corresponding benefits in reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. This accounts for approximately 5% of anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

The majority of carbon dioxide emissions in the manufacture of Portland cement (approximately 60%) are produced from the chemical decomposition of limestone to lime, an ingredient in Portland cement clinker. These emissions may be reduced by lowering the clinker content of cement. They can also be reduced by alternative fabrication methods such as the intergrinding cement with sand or with slag or other pozzolan type minerals to a very fine powder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Heavy metal emissions in the air===
In some circumstances, mainly depending on the origin and the composition of the raw materials used, the high-temperature calcination process of limestone and clay minerals can release in the atmosphere gases and dust rich in volatile [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], e.g. [[Thallium#Thallium pollution|thallium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.epa.gov/safewater/pdfs/factsheets/ioc/thallium.pdf| accessdate = 15 September 2009| title = Factsheet on: Thallium| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111232626/http://www.epa.gov/safewater/pdfs/factsheets/ioc/thallium.pdf| archivedate = 11 January 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cadmium]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] are the most toxic.

Environmental regulations exist in many countries to limit these emissions.

===Heavy metals present in the clinker===
The presence of heavy metals in the clinker arises both from the natural raw materials and from the use of recycled by-products or alternative fuels. The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater (12.5 &lt; pH &lt; 13.5) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases. [[Nickel]], [[zinc]] and [[lead]] are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations. [[Chromium]] may also directly arise as natural impurity from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard chromium steel alloys used in the ball mills when the clinker is ground. As [[Chromate ion|chromate]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) is toxic and may cause severe skin allergies at trace concentration, it is sometimes reduced into trivalent Cr(III) by addition of [[ferrous sulfate]] (FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Use of alternative fuels and by-products materials===
A cement plant consumes 3 to 6 [[Gigajoule|GJ]] of fuel per tonne of clinker produced, depending on the raw materials and the process used. Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels, and to a lesser extent natural gas and fuel oil. Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln (referred to as [[co-processing]]), replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels, like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium, silica, alumina, and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln, replacing raw materials such as clay, [[shale]], and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value, the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example, sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value, and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/DocRoot/Vjft3qGjo1v6HREH7jM6/tf2-guidelines.pdf Guidelines for the selection and use of fuels and raw materials in the cement manufacturing process] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910015447/http://www.wbcsd.org/DocRoot/Vjft3qGjo1v6HREH7jM6/tf2-guidelines.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, ''[[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]'' (1 June 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Scrap automobile and truck tires are useful in cement manufacturing as they have high calorific value and the iron embedded in tires is useful as a feed stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/cb361035-1872-4566-a7e7-d3d1441ad3ac/Alternative_Fuels_08+04.pdf|title= Increasing the use of alternative fuels at cement plants: International best practice|publisher=  International Finance Corporation, World Bank Group|date= 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 27}}

Clinker is manufactured by heating raw materials inside the main burner of a kiln to a temperature of 1450&amp;nbsp;°C. The flame reaches temperatures of 1800&amp;nbsp;°C. The material remains at 1200&amp;nbsp;°C for 12–15 seconds at 1800&amp;nbsp;°C for 5–8 seconds (also referred to as residence time). These characteristics of a clinker kiln offer numerous benefits and they ensure a complete destruction of organic compounds, a total neutralization of acid gases, sulphur oxides and hydrogen chloride. Furthermore, heavy metal traces are embedded in the clinker structure and no by-products, such as ash of residues, are produced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cembureau.eu/media/1229/9062_cembureau_cementconcretecirculareconomy_coprocessing_2016-09-01-04.pdf Cement, concrete &amp; the circular economy]. cembureau.eu&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU cement industry already uses more than 40% fuels derived from waste and biomass in supplying the thermal energy to the grey clinker making process. Although the choice for this so-called alternative fuels (AF) is typically cost driven, other factors are becoming more important. Use of alternative fuels provides benefits for both society and the company: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions are lower than with fossil fuels, waste can be co-processed in an efficient and sustainable manner and the demand for certain virgin materials can be reduced. Yet there are large differences in the share of alternative fuels used between the European Union (EU) member states. The societal benefits could be improved if more member states increase their alternative fuels share. The Ecofys study&lt;ref&gt;de Beer, Jeroen et al. (2017) [https://cembureau.eu/media/1618/full-report-_-2017-05-11_ecofys_publication_alternativefuels_report.pdf Status and prospects of co-processing of waste in EU cement plants]. ECOFYS study.&lt;/ref&gt; assessed the barriers and opportunities for further uptake of alternative fuels in 14 EU member states. The Ecofys study found that local factors constrain the market potential to a much larger extent than the technical and economic feasibility of the cement industry itself.

==Green cement==
Green cement is a cementitious material that meets or exceeds the functional performance capabilities of ordinary Portland cement by incorporating and optimizing recycled materials, thereby reducing consumption of natural raw materials, water, and energy, resulting in a more sustainable construction material. One is [[Geopolymer cement]].

New manufacturing processes for producing green cement are being researched with the goal to reduce, or even eliminate, the production and release of damaging pollutants and greenhouse gasses, particularly CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineers develop cement with 97 percent smaller carbon dioxide and energy footprint – DrexelNow|url=http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2012/February/Engineers-Develop-Cement-With-97-Percent-Smaller-Carbon-Dioxide-and-Energy-Footprint/|website=DrexelNow|accessdate=16 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218144742/http://www.drexel.edu/now/archive/2012/February/Engineers-Develop-Cement-With-97-Percent-Smaller-Carbon-Dioxide-and-Energy-Footprint/|archivedate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
