'''Cyrus''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: ⁄©Ÿàÿ±Ÿàÿ¥) is a male given name. Etymologically it is the [[English language|English]] transliteration of the [[Persian language|Persian]] name ''[[Kourosh]]'' (⁄©Ÿàÿ±Ÿàÿ¥). It is the given name of a number of [[Persian Kings|Persian kings]]. Most notably it refers to [[Cyrus the Great]]. Cyrus is also the name of [[Cyrus I of Anshan]] (ca. 650 BC), King of Persia the grandfather of Cyrus the Great; and [[Cyrus the Younger]] (died 401 BC), brother to the Persian King [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]].

== Etymology ==

Cyrus, as a word in English, is the [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:Œö·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ|Œö·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ]], ''K»≥ros'', from [[Old Persian]] {{lang|peo|[[wikt:êé§êé¢êéΩêé¢êèÅ|êé§êé¢êéΩêé¢êèÅ]]}} ''K≈´ru≈°''.&lt;ref name=cyrusthename&gt;{{harv|Schmitt|1996a}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the inscriptions the name is reflected in [[Elamite]] ''Kura≈°'', [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]] ''Ku(r)-ra≈°/-ra-√°≈°'' and [[Imperial Aramaic]] ''kwr≈°''. The modern Persian form of the name is [[Kourosh]].

The etymology of Cyrus has been and continues to be a topic of discussion amongst [[historians]], [[linguists]], and scholars of [[Iranology]]. The Old Persian name &quot;kuru≈°&quot; has been interpreted in various forms from &quot;the Sun&quot;, &quot;like Sun&quot;, &quot;young&quot;, &quot;hero&quot; to &quot;humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest&quot; and the Elamite &quot;kura≈°&quot; has been translated as one &quot;who bestows care&quot;.

The name has appeared on many monuments and inscriptions in Old Persian.&lt;ref name=chicyrus&gt;{{harv|Gershevitch|1985|pp=392‚Äì5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the record of a small inscription in Morghab (southwestern Iran) on which there is the sentence (''adam k≈´ru≈° x≈°ƒÅya∆üiya haxƒÅmani≈°iya'') in [[Old Persian]] meaning (''I am Cyrus the [[Achaemenian#Achaemenid kings and leaders|Achaemenian]] King'').&lt;ref name=murghabinscription&gt;{{harv|Tolman|1908|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a questionable&lt;ref name=kurusname&gt;{{harv|Tolam|1908|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposal by the German linguist F. H. Weissbach that [[Darius the Great]] was the first to inscribe in [[Old Persian|Persian]], it had previously been concluded by some scholars that the inscription in Morghab refers to Cyrus the Younger. This proposal was the result of a false interpretation of a passage in paragraph 70 of [[Behistun inscription]] by Darius the Great.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gershevitch|1985|p=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on many arguments,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Ghirshman|1965|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accepted theory among modern scholars is that the inscription does belong to Cyrus the Great.&lt;ref name=cyrustheyounger&gt;{{harv|Schmitt|1996b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are interpretations of name of Cyrus by classical authors identifying with or referring to the Persian word for ‚ÄúSun‚Äù. The Historian [[Plutarch]] (46 - 120) states that &quot;the sun, which, in the [[Old Persian|Persian language]], is called  Cyrus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/artaxerx.html ''Artoxerxes''] in [[Parallel Lives|(Parallel lives)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Physician [[Ctesias]] who served in the court of the Persian king [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]] writes in his book ''Persica'' as summarized by [[Photios I of Constantinople#Writings|Photios]] that the name Cyrus is from Persian word &quot;Khur&quot; (the sun).&lt;ref&gt;Epitome of [[Ctesias]]' Persica [http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica3.html 52].&lt;/ref&gt; These are, however, not accepted by modern scholars.&lt;ref name=cyrusthename/&gt;

Regarding the etymology of Old Persian ''kuru≈°'', linguists have proposed various etymologies based on Iranian languages as well as non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ones.&lt;ref name=Tavernier&gt;{{harv|Tavernier|2007|p=528}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tavernier, the name ''kura≈°'', attested in Elamite texts, is likely &quot;the original form&quot; as there is no Elamite or Babylonian spelling ''ku-ru-u≈°'' in the transcriptions of Old Persian ''ku-u-r(u)-u-≈°''. That is, according to Tavernier, ''kura≈°'' is an Elamite name and means &quot;to bestow care&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tavernier/&gt; Others, such as Schmitt, Hoffmann maintain that the Persian ''Kuru≈°'', which according to Skalmowsky, may be connected to (or a borrowing from) the [[Proto-Indo-European language|IE]] ''K√∫ru-'' from [[Old Indic]] can give an etymology of the Elamite ''kura≈°''.&lt;ref name=cyrusthename/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tavernier/&gt; In this regard  the Old Persian ''kuru≈°'' is considered with the following etymologies: One proposal is discussed by the linguist [[Janos Harmatta]] that refers to the common Iranian root &quot;kur-&quot; (be born) of many words in Old, middle, and new [[Iranian languages]] (e.g. [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). Accordingly, the name K≈´ru≈° means &quot;young, youth...&quot;.&lt;ref name=harmatta&gt;{{harv|Harmatta|1971|pp=5‚Äì6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Iranian etymologies have been proposed. The Indian proposal of Skalmowsky goes down to &quot;to do, accomplish&quot;. Another theory is the suggestion of [[Karl Hoffmann (German historian)|Karl Hoffmann]] that ''kuru≈°''  goes down to a ''-ru'' derivation from the IE root ''*(s)kau'' meaning &quot;to humiliate&quot;&lt;ref name=Tavernier/&gt;  and accordingly &quot;kuru≈°&quot; (hence &quot;Cyrus&quot;) means &quot;''humiliator'' (of the enemy in verbal contest)&quot;.&lt;ref name=cyrusthename/&gt;
