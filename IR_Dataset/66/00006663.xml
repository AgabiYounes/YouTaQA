'''Clyde William Tombaugh''' ({{IPAc-en|'|t|Q|m|b|aU}}; February 4, 1906{{spaced ndash}}January 17, 1997) was an American [[astronomer]]. He discovered [[Pluto]] in 1930, the first object to be discovered in what would later be identified as the [[Kuiper belt]]. At the time of discovery, Pluto was considered a [[planet]] but was later reclassified as a [[dwarf planet]] in 2006. Tombaugh also discovered many [[asteroid]]s. He called for the serious scientific research of [[unidentified flying object]]s, or UFOs.

==Life and career==
Tombaugh was born in [[Streator, Illinois]], son of Muron Dealvo Tombaugh, a farmer, and his wife Adella Pearl Chritton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tombaugh|first=Clyde|author2=Patrick Moore|title=Out of the Darkness: The Planet Pluto|publisher=Stackpole Books|date=1980|location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|pages=[https://archive.org/details/outofdarkness00tomb/page/17 17]|isbn=978-0-8117-1163-0|url=https://archive.org/details/outofdarkness00tomb/page/17}} &quot;I was born on a farm near Streator, Illinois, on 4 February 1906.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After his family moved to [[Burdett, Kansas]], in 1922, Tombaugh's plans for attending college were frustrated when a [[hail]]storm ruined his family's farm crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=A Man of Universal Wonder|work=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|date=2006-09-09|url=http://www.achievement.org/achiever/clyde-tombaugh/|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1926, he built several [[telescope]]s with [[lens (optics)|lens]]es and [[mirror]]s by himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;/&gt; To better test his telescope mirrors, Tombaugh, with just a pick and shovel, dug a pit 24 feet long, 8 feet deep, and 7 feet wide. This provided a constant air temperature, free of air currents, and was also used by the family as a root cellar and emergency shelter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tombaugh 1980 17&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Tombaugh|first=Clyde|author2=Patrick Moore|title=Out of the Darkness: The Planet Pluto|publisher=Stackpole Books|date=1980|location=Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|pages=[https://archive.org/details/outofdarkness00tomb/page/17 17]|isbn=978-0-8117-1163-0|url=https://archive.org/details/outofdarkness00tomb/page/17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent drawings of [[Jupiter]] and [[Mars]] to the [[Lowell Observatory]], at Flagstaff, Arizona, which offered him a job.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p02w1smf/the-sky-at-night-the-man-who-discovered-a-planet BBC Sky at Night episode on Clyde Tombaugh]&lt;/ref&gt; Tombaugh worked there from 1929 to 1945.

Following his discovery of Pluto, Tombaugh earned bachelor's and master's degrees in astronomy from the [[University of Kansas]] in 1936 and 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;/&gt; During [[World War II]] he taught naval personnel navigation at [[Northern Arizona University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;/&gt; He worked at [[White Sands Missile Range]] in the early 1950s, and taught astronomy at [[New Mexico State University]] from 1955 until his retirement in 1973. In 1980 he was inducted into the [[International Space Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/28242225/el_paso_times/|title=Space Hall of Fame Honors Four|newspaper=El Paso Times|location=El Paso, Texas|date=October 5, 1980|last1=McClellan|first1=Doug|page=1B|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[asteroid]] [[1604 Tombaugh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(1604) Tombaugh|publisher=Asteroid Dynamic Site|url=http://hamilton.dm.unipi.it/cgi-bin/astdys/astibo?objects:Tombaugh;main|accessdate=2007-02-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223122659/http://hamilton.dm.unipi.it/cgi-bin/astdys/astibo?objects%3ATombaugh%3Bmain|archivedate=2006-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered in 1931, is named after him. He discovered hundreds of asteroids, beginning with 2839 Annette in 1929, mostly as a by-product of his search for Pluto and his searches for other celestial objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Academy&quot;/&gt; Tombaugh named some of them after his wife, children and grandchildren. The [[Royal Astronomical Society]] awarded him the [[Jackson-Gwilt Medal]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackson-Gwilt Medal Winners|url=https://www.ras.org.uk/awards-and-grants/awards/2275-jackson-gwilt-medal|website=RAS website|publisher=[[Royal Astronomical Society]]|accessdate=14 July 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct visual observation became rare in astronomy. By 1965 [[Robert S. Richardson]] called Tombaugh one of two great living experienced visual observers as talented as [[Percival Lowell]] or [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;galaxy196506&quot;&gt;{{Cite magazine

Following the passage on July 14, 2015, of [[Pluto]] by the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft the &quot;Cold Heart of Pluto&quot; was named [[Tombaugh Regio]].

===Death===
Tombaugh died on January 17, 1997, when he was in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], at the age of 90. He was cremated. A small portion of his ashes was placed aboard the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft.

Tombaugh was an active [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]], and he and his wife helped found the Unitarian Universalist Church of Las Cruces, New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Kimberly|title=He found a planet and founded a church|publisher=UU World|date=Fall 2005|url=http://www.uuworld.org/articles/tombaugh-discovered-pluto|accessdate=2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Clyde Tombaugh had five siblings. Through the daughter of his youngest brother Robert, he is the great-uncle of [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] [[pitcher]] [[Clayton Kershaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berg|first=Ted|title=Clayton Kershaw disses International Astronomers Union over Pluto|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=July 30, 2013|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/07/clayton-kershaw-disses-international-astronomers-union-over-pluto/|accessdate=August 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of Pluto==
[[File:Lowell astrograph.jpg|thumb|left|Tombaugh created his photographic plates using this 13-inch [[astrograph]]]]

While a young researcher working for the [[Lowell Observatory]] in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], Tombaugh was given the job to perform a systematic search for a [[Trans-Neptunian object|trans-Neptunian]] planet (also called [[Planet X]]), which had been predicted by [[Percival Lowell]] based on calculations performed by his student mathematician Elizabeth Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/amp/human-computer-elizabeth-williams-pluto-discovery.html|title=Meet the unknown female mathematician whose calculations helped discover Pluto {{!}} Space|website=www.space.com|access-date=2020-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Henry Pickering|William Pickering]].

Tombaugh used the observatory's 13-inch [[astrograph]] to take photographs of the same section of sky several nights apart. He then used a [[blink comparator]] to compare the different images. When he shifted between the two images, a moving object, such as a planet, would appear to jump from one position to another, while the more distant objects such as stars would appear stationary. Tombaugh noticed such a moving object in his search, near the place predicted by Lowell, and subsequent observations showed it to have an orbit beyond that of Neptune. This ruled out classification as an asteroid, and they decided this was the ninth planet that Lowell had predicted. The discovery was made on Tuesday, February 18, 1930,&lt;ref name=&quot;content&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=|first1=|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia 6th Ed |year=2015|publisher=The Columbia University Press|location=|pages=|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1E1-Tombaugh/tombaugh-clyde-william|accessdate=24 February 2016|url-access=subscription |via=[[Questia]]|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; using images taken the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/portraits/tombaugh_clyde.htm Kansas State Historical Society portrait]&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;Pluto&quot; was suggested by an 11-year-old [[England|English]] schoolgirl, [[Venetia Burney]]. It won out over numerous other suggestions because it was the name of the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Pluto (god)|god of the underworld]], who was able to render himself invisible, and because [[Percival Lowell]]'s initials PL formed the first 2 letters. The name Pluto was officially adopted on May 1, 1930.
&lt;!--[[File:Pluto discovery plates.png|thumb|The photographic plates that were used to discover [[Pluto]] at [[apparent magnitude]] +15.4]]--&gt;
Following the discovery, starting in the 1990s, of other [[Kuiper belt]] objects, Pluto began to be seen not as a planet orbiting alone at 40 [[Astronomical unit|AU]], but as the largest of a group of icy bodies in that region of space. After it was shown that at least [[Eris (dwarf planet)|one such body]] was more massive than Pluto, on August 24, 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) reclassified Pluto, grouping it with two similarly sized &quot;[[dwarf planet]]s&quot; rather than with the eight &quot;[[classical planets]]&quot;.

Tombaugh's widow Patricia stated after the IAU's decision that while he might have been disappointed with the change since he had resisted attempts to remove Pluto's planetary status in his lifetime, he would have accepted the decision now if he were alive. She noted that he &quot;was a scientist. He would understand they had a real problem when they start finding several of these things flying around the place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|title=Pluto Discoverer Saw It Coming, Says His Widow|publisher=CTV|date=2006-08-25|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060825/pluto_discoverer_widow_060825/20060825?hub=SciTech|accessdate=2007-02-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830171224/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060825/pluto_discoverer_widow_060825/20060825?hub=SciTech|archivedate=2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hal Levison]] offered this perspective on Tombaugh's place in history: &quot;Clyde Tombaugh discovered the Kuiper Belt. That's a helluva lot more interesting than the ninth planet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/mysteries_of_the_universe/2014/02/pluto_new_horizons_mission_the_dwarf_planet_explains_the_history_of_our.2.html |title=Pluto Wins |author=Robert Irion |date=February 5, 2014 |work=Slate |accessdate=February 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205230631/http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/mysteries_of_the_universe/2014/02/pluto_new_horizons_mission_the_dwarf_planet_explains_the_history_of_our.2.html |archive-date=February 5, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further search==
Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, and the lack of further discoveries left him satisfied that no other object of a comparable [[apparent magnitude]] existed near the [[ecliptic]]. No more trans-Neptunian objects were discovered until [[15760 Albion]] in 1992.

However, more recently the relatively bright object {{dp|Makemake}} has been discovered. It has a relatively high orbital [[inclination]], but at the time of Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic near the border of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]]&lt;ref&gt;based on Minor Planet Center online Minor Planet Ephemeris Service: March 1, 1930: RA: 05h51m, Dec: +29.0&lt;/ref&gt; at an apparent magnitude of 16.&lt;ref name=FY9&gt;{{cite web|title=HORIZONS Web-Interface|publisher=[[JPL Solar System Dynamics]]|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi?find_body=1&amp;body_group=sb&amp;sstr=2005FY9|accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was also very near the [[galactic equator]], making it almost impossible to find such an object within the dense concentration of background stars of the [[Milky Way]].  In the fourteen years of looking for planets, Tombaugh looked for motion in 90 million star images.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tombaugh 1980 17&quot;/&gt;

==Asteroids discovered==
[[File:Lowell blink comparator.jpg|thumb|Tombaugh compared his photographic plates using this blink comparator.]]
Tombaugh is officially credited by the Minor Planet Center with discovering 15 asteroids, and he observed nearly 800 [[asteroid]]s&lt;ref name = &quot;asteroids&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Darling|first=David|authorlink=David Darling (astronomer)|title=Tombaugh, Clyde William (1906-1997)|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/ETEmain.html|work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his search for Pluto and years of follow-up searches looking for another candidate for the postulated Planet X.

==Interest in UFOs==
Tombaugh was probably the most eminent astronomer to have reported seeing [[unidentified flying object]]s. On August 20, 1949, Tombaugh saw several unidentified objects near [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. He described them as six to eight rectangular lights, stating: &quot;I doubt that the phenomenon was any terrestrial reflection, because... nothing of the kind has ever appeared before or since... I was so unprepared for such a strange sight that I was really petrified with astonishment.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waring2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott C. Waring|title=Ufo Sightings of 2006–2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fxdr5eOQZE4C&amp;pg=PA88|date=May 2010|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4502-3239-5|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tombaugh observed these rectangles of light for about 3 seconds and his wife saw them for about {{frac|1|1|2}} seconds.  He never supported the interpretation as a spaceship that has often been attributed to him.  He considered other possibilities, with a temperature inversion as the most likely cause.&lt;ref&gt;''The World of Flying Saucers: A scientific examination of a major myth of the space age'', by [[Donald H. Menzel]] and Lyle G. Boyd, 1963, Doubleday, pp. 266–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;From my own studies of the solar system I cannot entertain any serious possibility for intelligent life on other planets, not even for Mars... The logistics of visitations from planets revolving around the nearer stars is staggering.  In consideration of the hundreds of millions of years in the geologic time scale when such visits may have possibly occurred, the odds of a single visit in a given century or millennium are overwhelmingly against such an event.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
A much more likely source of explanation is some natural optical phenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sightings the faintness of the object, together with the manner of fading in intensity as it traveled away from the zenith towards the southeastern horizon, is quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in refractive index, as in an inversion layer.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have never seen anything like it before or since, and I have spent a lot of time where the night sky could be seen well.  This suggests that the phenomenon involves a comparatively rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the odds of an interstellar visitation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another sighting by Tombaugh a year or two later while at a White Sands observatory was of an object of &amp;minus;6 magnitude, four times brighter than Venus at its brightest, going from the zenith to the southern horizon in about 3 seconds. The object executed the same maneuvers as in Tombaugh's first sighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Brad|title=Project Blue Book|url=https://archive.org/details/projectbluebookt00stei|url-access=registration|publisher=Ballantine Books|date=1976|page=[https://archive.org/details/projectbluebookt00stei/page/280 280]|isbn=978-0-345-34525-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tombaugh later reported having seen three of the mysterious [[green fireballs]], which suddenly appeared over New Mexico in late 1948 and continued at least through the early 1950s. A researcher on [[Green fireballs#Project Twinkle|Project Twinkle]] reported that Tombaugh &quot;... never observed an unexplainable aerial object despite his continuous and extensive observations of the sky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project1947.com/gfb/twinklereport.htm Final report of Project Twinkle]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an entry in &quot;UFO updates&quot;, Tombaugh said: &quot;I have seen three objects in the last seven years which defied any explanation of known phenomenon, such as Venus, atmospheric optic, meteors or planes. I am a professional, highly skilled, professional astronomer. In addition I have seen three green fireballs which were unusual in behavior from normal green fireballs... I think that several reputable scientists are being unscientific in refusing to entertain the possibility of [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin and nature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ledger|first=Don|title=UFO UpDates|date=2004-09-20|url=http://virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/2004/sep/m20-022.shtml|accessdate=2007-02-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210090352/http://virtuallystrange.net/ufo/updates/2004/sep/m20-022.shtml|archivedate=2007-02-10|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after this in January 1957, in an [[Associated Press]] article in the ''[[Alamogordo Daily News]]'' titled &quot;Celestial Visitors May Be Invading Earth's Atmosphere,&quot; Tombaugh was again quoted on his sightings and opinion about them. &quot;Although our own solar system is believed to support no other life than on Earth, other stars in the galaxy may have hundreds of thousands of habitable worlds. Races on these worlds may have been able to utilize the tremendous amounts of power required to bridge the space between the stars...&quot; Tombaugh stated that he had observed celestial phenomena which he could not explain, but had seen none personally since 1951 or 1952. &quot;These things, which do appear to be directed, are unlike any other phenomena I ever observed.

In 1949, Tombaugh had also told the Naval missile director at [[White Sands Missile Range]], Commander Robert McLaughlin, that he had seen a bright flash on Mars on August 27, 1941, which he now attributed to an atomic blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Robert|title=Letter from Robert McLaughlin to James Van Allen|publisher=Roswell Proof|date=1949-05-12|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/McLaughlin_Van_Allen_letter.html|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tombaugh also noted that the first atomic bomb tested in New Mexico would have lit up the dark side of the Earth like a neon sign and that Mars was coincidentally quite close at the time, the implication apparently being that the atomic test would have been visible from Mars.

In June 1952, Dr. [[J. Allen Hynek]], an astronomer acting as a scientific consultant to the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]] UFO study, secretly conducted a survey of fellow astronomers on UFO sightings and attitudes while attending an astronomy convention. Tombaugh and four other astronomers, including Dr. [[Lincoln LaPaz]] of the University of New Mexico, told Hynek about their sightings. Tombaugh also told Hynek that his telescopes were at the Air Force's disposal for taking photos of UFOs, if he was properly alerted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Brad|title=Project Blue Book|url=https://archive.org/details/projectbluebookt00stei|url-access=registration|publisher=Ballantine Books|date=1976|pages=[https://archive.org/details/projectbluebookt00stei/page/268 268–85]|isbn=978-0-345-34525-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-Earth satellite search==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tombaugh Lapaz 3 3 1954.jpg|thumb|Clyde Tombaugh (left) discussing search for near-Earth satellites with [[Lincoln LaPaz]] (right), March 3, 1954. Photo from ''The Albuquerque Journal''{{ffdc|1=Tombaugh Lapaz 3 3 1954.jpg|log=2016 January 15}}]] --&gt;

Tombaugh's offer may have led to his involvement in a search for near-Earth [[satellite]]s, first announced in late 1953 and sponsored by the Army Office of Ordnance Research. Another public statement was made on the search in March 1954, emphasizing the rationale that such an orbiting object would serve as a natural [[space station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Armed Forces Seeks &quot;Steppingstone to Stars&quot;|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|pages=|date=1954-03-04|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_LATimes_SciNL_1954.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Donald Keyhoe]], later director of the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP), the real reason for the sudden search was because two near-Earth orbiting objects had been picked up on new long-range radar in the summer of 1953, according to his [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] source.

By May 1954, Keyhoe was making public statements that his sources told him the search had indeed been successful, and either one or two objects had been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=1 or 2 Artificial Satellites Circling Earth, Says Expert|newspaper=San Francisco Examiner|pages=14|date=1954-05-14|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_Keyhoe_May1954.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story did not break until August 23, 1954, when ''[[Aviation Week]]'' magazine stated that two satellites had been found only 400 and 600 miles out. They were termed &quot;natural satellites&quot; and implied that they had been recently captured, despite this being a virtual impossibility. The next day, the story was in many major newspapers. Dr. LaPaz was implicated in the discovery in addition to Tombaugh. LaPaz had earlier conducted secret investigations on behalf of the Air Force on the [[green fireballs]] and other unidentified aerial phenomena over New Mexico. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on August 29 that &quot;a source close to the O. O. R. unit here described as 'quite accurate' the report in the magazine Aviation Week that two previously unobserved satellites had been spotted and identified by Dr. Lincoln LaPaz of the University of New Mexico as natural and not artificial objects. This source also said there was absolutely no connection between the reported satellites and [[flying saucer]] reports.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Earth 'Satellites' Spur Army Study|newspaper=New York Times|pages=35|date=August 29, 1954|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_NYTIMES_1954.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the October 10th issue, LaPaz said the magazine article was &quot;false in every particular, in so far as reference to me is concerned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Scientist denies space base find|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 10, 1954|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_NYTIMES_1954.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both LaPaz and Tombaugh were to issue public denials that anything had been found. The October 1955 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' magazine reported: &quot;Professor Tombaugh is closemouthed about his results. He won't say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered.  He does say, however, that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct. He adds that there is no connection between the search program and the reports of so-called flying saucers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stimson, Jr.|first=Thomas E.|title=He Spies on Satellites|newspaper=Popular Mechanics|pages=106|date=October 1955|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_PopMech_Oct55.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meteor conference in Los Angeles in 1957, Tombaugh reiterated that his four-year search for &quot;natural satellites&quot; had been unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1957-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Tombaugh was to issue a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search. His personal 16-inch [[telescope]] was reassembled and dedicated on September 17, 2009 at [[Animas, New Mexico|Rancho Hidalgo, New Mexico (near Animas, New Mexico)]], adjacent to ''Astronomy'' 's new observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Editors dedicate Astronomy magazine's new observatory |author=David J.
