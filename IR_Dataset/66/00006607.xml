'''Chaosium Inc.''' is a publisher of [[role-playing games]] established by [[Greg Stafford]] in 1975. Its first title was the board game ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]'' (later renamed ''Dragon Pass''), set in Stafford's fictional fantasy gaming world of [[Glorantha]]. Chaosium's major titles have included the roleplaying games ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'' based on the [[horror fiction]] stories of [[H.P. Lovecraft]]'', and [[RuneQuest]]'' set in Glorantha.

Many of Chaosium’s product lines are based upon literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chaosium.com/about-us/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012212325/https://www.chaosium.com/about-us/|url-status=live|archive-date=12 October 2019|title=About Us|website=Chaosium Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stafford himself has been described as &quot;one of the most decorated game designers of all time&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1861515217/prince-valiant-storytelling-game-by-greg-stafford|title=Prince Valiant® Storytelling Game by Greg Stafford|author=|date=|work=kickstarter.com|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=August 2019}} and &quot;the grand shaman of gaming&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://juegosydados.wordpress.com/2016/07/19/interview-with-robin-d-laws/|title=Interview with Robin D.

These include [[David Conyers]], [[Matthew Costello]], [[Larry DiTillio]], [[David A.

==History==
===1975–1980: Early years===
Greg Stafford founded &quot;The Chaosium&quot; in 1975 to publish his board game ''[[White Bear and Red Moon]]''. He derived the name partly from his home, which was near the [[Oakland Coliseum]], combining &quot;coliseum&quot; with &quot;chaos.&quot;

In 1978 Chaosium published Steve Perrin's roleplaying game ''[[RuneQuest]]'', set in Stafford's mythic fantasy setting [[Glorantha]], following up with a second edition in 1980 and various supplements over the next six years.

===1980s: Growth and licensing with Avalon Hill===
In 1980, the company officially incorporated as Chaosium Inc. That year, Stafford and Lynn Willis simplified the RuneQuest rules into the 16-page [[Basic Role-Playing]] (BRP). These [[GNS Theory#Simulationism|simulationist]], skill-based generic rules formed the basis of many of Chaosium's later [[Dice notation#Percentile dice|&quot;d100&quot;]] RPGs, most notably ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', first published in 1982.

Chaosium entered into a licensing agreement with [[Avalon Hill]] in 1983 to produce a third edition of ''RuneQuest''. Avalon Hill manufactured and marketed the game, while Chaosium was responsible for acquisitions, design, development and layout. [[Ken Rolston]]  managed the line as &quot;Rune Czar&quot;.

One of the first RPGs by a female lead designer was published by Chaosium: [[Kerie Campbell-Robson]]'s  1986 release [[Hawkmoon (role-playing game)|Hawkmoon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons: The '70s|publisher=Evil Hat Productions|year=2014|edition=2|volume=1|ISBN=978-1-61317-075-5|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Late 1990s–early 2010s: Financial struggle===
In 1996 it was prematurely reported that Chaosium had secured the rights to publish a collectible card game based on the video game [[Doom (series)|Doom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duelist3&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Varney | first = Allen | title = Inside the Industry| pages = 84 | newspaper = The Duelist | date = February 1997 | issue =#15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, following the financial failure of the collectible card game ''[[Mythos (card game)|Mythos]]'', Greg Stafford resigned as Chaosium president and left the company, along with Sandy Petersen (although they both remained shareholders). Chaosium effectively split up into various successor companies, each maintaining its focus on a few of the company's products. Stafford took the rights to his game setting Glorantha, setting up the company [[Issaries, Inc.]] to continue publishing this line (later licensing it to [[Moon Design Publications]], along with the game [[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]).

Long-time employees and part-owners Charlie Krank and Lynn Willis remained at Chaosium as President and Editor-in-Chief respectively, continuing on with ''Call of Cthulhu'' as the main product line. Lynn Willis retired in 2008 due to poor health and died in 2013.

===Mid 2010s: The return of Stafford and Petersen===
Problems and delays fulfilling the [[Kickstarter]]s for the 7th edition of ''Call of Cthulhu'' led Stafford and Petersen to return to an active role at Chaosium in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/448333182/call-of-cthulhu-7th-edition/posts/1251694|title=Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charlie Krank subsequently left the company.

Later that year at [[Gen Con]] 2015, Stafford and Petersen announced Moon Design Publications were now part of the Chaosium ownership, and the four principals of Moon Design ([[Rick Meints]], Jeff Richard, [[Michael O'Brien (game designer)|Michael O'Brien]] and [[Neil Robinson (game designer)|Neil Robinson]]) had become the new Chaosium management team. Chaosium once again became the licensed publisher for ''RuneQuest'', ''HeroQuest'' and other products related to Gloranthan universe, and continue to publish the ''Call of Cthulhu'' line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chaosium.com/blog/greg-stafford-announces-new-ownership-group-for-chaosium-at-gen-con|title=Greg Stafford Announces New Ownership Group For Chaosium At Gen Con|author=Michael O'Brien|date=30 July 2015|work=Chaosium Blog|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stafford and Petersen remained as board members (Stafford as chair), and creative consultants to the company.

As part of its financial reorganization, the new management closed the company office and warehouse in [[Hayward, California]], ending Chaosium's long association with the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yog-sothoth.com/articles.html/_/main/chaosium-leaves-california|title=Chaosium Leaves California|date=23 September 2015|work=Yog-Sothoth}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is now based in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]] and uses a [[fulfillment house]] model for distribution of product.

Delivery of the core rewards of the Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition Kickstarter finally commenced in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cthulhu Company Kickstarted itself to Death, Then This Happened|url=http://geekandsundry.com/cthulhu-company-kickstarted-itself-to-death-then-this-happened|author=Ben Riggs|work=Geek and Sundry|date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new edition went on to win nine of the ten awards it was nominated for at the [[Gen Con]] 2017 [[ENnies|ENnie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Noms and Winners|url=http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/2017-noms-and-winners|website=ENnie Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2019, [[Chaosium Inc.]] announced they acquired the rights to the [[7th Sea (role-playing game)|7th Sea]] product line (both Second Edition and Khitai Kickstarters) from John Wick, including back stock of books published so far. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chaosium.com/blogjohn-wick-joins-chaosium/|title=John Wick joins Chaosium|first=Michael|last=O'Brien|date=2 April 2019|work=Chaosium press release|accessdate=3 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
Chaosium began publishing a line of non-game books (primarily fiction) in 1993. Many titles are themed around H.P. Lovecraft's [[Cthulhu Mythos]] and related topics, although the first work published was Greg Stafford's fantasy work ''King of Sartar'', set in his mythic world [[Glorantha]].

''Cassilda's Song'', a 2015 anthology based on [[Robert W. Chambers]]'s [[King in Yellow]] and written entirely by women, was nominated for two 2016 [[World Fantasy Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/News/2016/07/11044/|title=2016 World Fantasy Awards Finalists|date=10 July 2016|work=Locus Online News|accessdate=18 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819112044/http://www.locusmag.com/News/2016/07/11044/#|archive-date=2016-08-19|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2017, Chaosium appointed award-winning author and editor [[James Lowder]] as executive editor of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.chaosium.com/blog/chaosium-appoints-james-lowder-as-new-executive-editor-of-fiction/|title=Chaosium appoints James Lowder as new Executive Editor of Fiction|first=Michael|last=O'Brien|date=7 May 2017|work=Chaosium|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowder had previously served as a consultant for Chaosium, helping the company and freelancers resolve payment and contract problems with past fiction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.chaosium.com/blog/chaosium-appoints-james-lowder-as-new-consulting-editor-for-fiction/|title=Chaosium Appoints James Lowder as new Consulting Editor for Fiction|first=Michael|last=O'Brien|date=26 August 2015|work=Chaosium|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not published by Chaosium, the ongoing [[Wild Cards]] series of [[superhero]] science fiction originated from a long-running ''[[Superworld]]'' campaign gamemastered by [[Game of Thrones]] author [[George R. R. Martin]] and his circle of fellow writers who played in his game.&lt;ref name=&quot;designers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazines==
Three magazines have been published by Chaosium to promote its products:

* ''[[Wyrm's Footnotes]]'' ran for fourteen issues from 1976 to 1995. Initially it was a supporting material publication for ''White Bear and Red Moon'' but for its 11th issue, in 1981, it had become the official ''RuneQuest'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erzo.org/shannon/gaming/indices/glorantha-index.shtml#wyrms|title=Glorantha Magazine Indices|publisher=Erzo.org|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was revived in 2012 by [[Moon Design Publications]], continuing the issue numbering at 15, despite the 17-year hiatus.
* ''[[Different Worlds]]''. Forty-seven bimonthly issues from ''Different Worlds'' were published. Chaosium, from 1979 to 1985, published the first thirty-eight and [[Sleuth Publications]], from 1985 to 1987, the final nine. [[Tadashi Ehara]] was the editor of the magazine during the periods concerned by both publishing houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.rpg.net/display-search.phtml?key=magazine&amp;value=Different+Worlds&amp;type=pictures|title=Different Worlds Magazine Cover Listing - RPGnet RPG Game Index|publisher=Index.rpg.net|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
