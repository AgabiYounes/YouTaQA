The '''Colorado Rockies''' are an American professional [[baseball]] team based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West division]]. The team's home venue is [[Coors Field]], located in the [[LoDo, Denver|Lower Downtown]] area of Denver. The team is owned by the [[Monfort brothers]] and managed by [[Bud Black]].

The Rockies began play as an [[1993 Major League Baseball expansion|expansion team]] for the [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993 season]], and played their home games for their first two seasons at [[Mile High Stadium]]. Since [[1995 Colorado Rockies season|1995]], they have played at Coors Field, which has earned a reputation as a [[hitter's park]]. The Rockies have qualified for the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]] five times, each time as a [[List of National League Wild Card winners|Wild Card winner]]. In [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|2007]], the team earned its first (and only) [[List of National League pennant winners|NL pennant]] after winning 14 of their final 15 games in the regular season to secure a Wild Card position. In the [[2007 World Series]], they were swept by the [[American League]] (AL) champions [[Boston Red Sox]] in four games.

==History==
{{unsourced section|date=June 2017}}
{{main article|History of the Colorado Rockies}}
{{see also|1993 Major League Baseball expansion}}

Denver had long been a hotbed of [[Denver Zephyrs|Denver Bears/Zephyrs]] [[Minor League Baseball|minor league baseball]] and many{{who|date=June 2017}} in the area desired a Major League team.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Following the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]], an unsuccessful attempt was made to purchase the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and relocate them. However, in 1991, as part of Major League Baseball's two-team expansion (along with the [[Miami Marlins|Florida (now Miami) Marlins]]), an ownership group representing Denver led by John Antonucci and [[Michael I. Monus]] was granted a franchise; they took the name &quot;Rockies&quot; due to Denver's proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]], which is reflected in their logo; the name was previously used by the city's first NHL team (who are now the New Jersey Devils). Monus and Antonucci were forced to drop out in 1992 after Monus' reputation was ruined by an accounting scandal.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Trucking magnate [[Jerry McMorris]] stepped in at the 11th hour to save the franchise, allowing the team to begin play in 1993. The Rockies shared [[Mile High Stadium]] (which had originally been built for the Bears) with the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s [[Denver Broncos]] for their first two seasons while [[Coors Field]] was constructed. It was completed for the [[1995 Major League Baseball season]].

In [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]], they started play in the [[National League West|West division]] of the [[National League]]. The Rockies were MLB's first team based in the [[Mountain Time Zone]]. They have reached the [[Major League Baseball postseason]] five times, each time as the National League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team. Twice ([[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995]] and [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]]) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. In 2007, the Rockies advanced to the [[World Series]], only to be swept by the [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]]. Like their expansion brethren, the Miami Marlins, they have never won a division title since their establishment; they are also one of two current MLB teams that have never won their division.

The Rockies have played their home games at [[Coors Field]] since 1995. Their newest [[spring training]] home, [[Salt River Fields at Talking Stick]] in Scottsdale, Arizona, opened in March 2011 and is shared with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].
