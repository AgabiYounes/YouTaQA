In [[Greek mythology]], '''Cerberus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɜr|b|ər|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Cerberus|title= Cerberus|work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Κέρβερος}} ''Kérberos'' {{IPA-el|ˈkerberos|}}), often referred to as the '''hound of Hades''', is a [[polycephaly|multi-headed]] dog that guards the gates of the [[Underworld]] to prevent the dead from leaving. Cerberus was the offspring of the monsters [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]] and [[Typhon]], and is usually described as having three heads, a serpent for a tail, and snakes protruding from multiple parts of his body. Cerberus is primarily known for his capture by [[Heracles]], one of Heracles' [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labours]].

== Descriptions ==
Descriptions of Cerberus vary, including the number of his heads. Cerberus was usually three-headed, though not always. Cerberus had several multi-headed relatives. His father was the multi snake-headed [[Typhon]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D304 300–314], [[Acusilaus]], fragment 6 (Freeman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=B75GgVdxYT0C&amp;pg=PA15 p. 15]), [[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html Preface], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae4.html 151], and [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' (or ''Fall of Troy'') [https://archive.org/stream/falloftroy00quin#page/272/mode/2up 6.260–268 (pp. 272–275)] all have Cerberus as the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, while [[Bacchylides]], Ode [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0064%3Abook%3DEp%3Apoem%3D5 5.56–62], [[Sophocles]], ''[[Women of Trachis]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0196%3Acard%3D1076 1097–1099], [[Callimachus]], fragment 515 Pfeiffer (Trypanis, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/callimachus-fragments_uncertain_location/1973/pb_LCL421.259.xml?result=2&amp;rskey=li3r52 pp. 258–259]), and [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0028:book=4:card=481&amp;highlight=Echidna 4.500–501], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0028:book=7:card=404&amp;highlight=Cerberian 7.406–409] all have Cerberus as the offspring of Echidna without naming a father.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cerberus was the brother of three other multi-headed monsters, the multi-snake-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]]; [[Orthrus]], the two-headed dog who guarded the Cattle of [[Geryon]]; and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], who had three heads: that of a lion, a goat, and a snake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D306 309–324] (although it is not certain whom Hesiod meant as the mother of the Chimera: Echidna, the Hydra, or Ceto); [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.5.10 2.5.10], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+2.3.1 2.3.1]; [[Hyginus]],  ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html#Preface Preface].&lt;/ref&gt; And, like these close relatives, Cerberus was, with only the rare iconographic exception, multi-headed.

In the earliest description of Cerberus, [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (c. 8th – 7th century BC), Cerberus has fifty heads, while [[Pindar]] (c. 522 – c. 443 BC) gave him one hundred heads.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, p. 22;

An exception is the Latin poet [[Horace]]'s Cerberus which has a single dog head, and one hundred snake heads.&lt;ref&gt;West, David, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XCaYMyW1YQQC&amp;pg=PA108 p. 108];

Perhaps trying to reconcile these competing traditions, [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]]'s Cerberus has three dog heads and the heads of &quot;all sorts of snakes&quot; along his back, while the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] poet [[John Tzetzes]] (who probably based his account on Apollodorus) gives Cerberus fifty heads, three of which were dog heads, the rest being the &quot;heads of other beasts of all sorts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12];

In art Cerberus is most commonly depicted with two dog heads (visible), never more than three, but occasionally with only one.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, p. 87; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106. According to Gantz, &quot;Presumably the frequent variant of two heads arose from logistical problems in draftmanship,&quot; and Ogden wonders if &quot;such images salute or establish a tradition of a two-headed Cerberus, or are we to imagine a third head concealed behind the two that can be seen?&quot; For one-headed Cerberus, see ''LIMC'' Herakles 2553, 2570, 2576, 2591, 2621.&lt;/ref&gt; On one of the two earliest depictions (c. 590–580 BC), a [[Corinth]]ian cup from [[Argos]] (see below), now lost, Cerberus was shown as a normal single-headed dog.&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2553%22 Herakles 2553] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 97–98); Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, with n. 184. A relief ''pithos'' fragment (c.  590–570 BC) ''LIMC'' Herakles 2621 (Smallwood, p. 92), seems to show a single lion-headed Cerberus, with snake (open-mouthed) over his back.&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance of a three-headed Cerberus occurs on a mid-sixth-century BC [[Laconia]]n cup (see below).&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2605%22 Herakles 2605] (Smallwood, p. 91); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA129 p. 129]; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, with n. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace's many snake-headed Cerberus followed a long tradition of Cerberus being part snake. This is perhaps already implied as early as in Hesiod's ''Theogony'', where Cerberus' mother is the half-snake [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], and his father the snake-headed Typhon. In art Cerberus is often shown as being part snake,&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA63 p. 63].&lt;/ref&gt; for example the lost Corinthian cup showed snakes protruding from Cerberus' body, while the mid sixth-century BC Laconian cup gives Cerberus a snake for a tail. In the literary record, the first certain indication of Cerberus' serpentine nature comes from the rationalized account of [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (fl. 500–494 BC), who makes Cerberus a large poisonous snake.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hecataeus of Miletus]], fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (''apud'' [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf. ''FGrH'' 1 F27); Ogden 2013a, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] refers to Cerberus' composite nature,&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]] ''[[Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D588c 588c].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] (3rd century BC) describes Cerberus as having multiple snake tails,&lt;ref&gt;[[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorian]], fragment 71 Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.301.xml pp. 300–303]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA69 pp. 69–70]); Ogden 2013a, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably in connection to his serpentine nature, associates Cerberus with the creation of the poisonous [[Aconitum|aconite]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]], fragment 41a Lightfoot, (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.273.xml pp. 272–275] = [[Herodorus of Heraclea|Herodorus]] fragment 31 Fowler).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virgil]] has snakes writhe around Cerberus' neck,&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.417 6.419],&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]]'s Cerberus has a venomous mouth,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D481 4.500–501].&lt;/ref&gt; necks &quot;vile with snakes&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D1 10.22–24]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;hair inwoven with the threatening snake&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Heroides]]'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-heroides/1914/pb_LCL041.115.xml?result=7&amp;rskey=khGLLX 9.93–94 (pp. 114–115)].&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] gives Cerberus a mane consisting of snakes, and a single snake tail.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml 785–812 (pp. 112–113)].

Cerberus was given various other traits. According to [[Euripides]], Cerberus not only had three heads but three bodies,&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]] ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+22 22–25].&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Virgil he had multiple backs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.417 6.422].&lt;/ref&gt; Cerberus ate raw flesh (according to Hesiod),&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D304 311].&lt;/ref&gt; had eyes which flashed fire (according to Euphorion), a three-tongued mouth (according to Horace), and acute hearing (according to Seneca).&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml 788–791 (pp. 112–113)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euripides]], ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+22 22–25], calls this labor the last. However according to [[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.2] this labor was the eleventh and next to last, the twelfth being stealig the [[Apples of the Hesperides]].&lt;/ref&gt; In a fragment from a lost play ''Pirithous'', (attributed to either [[Euripides]] or [[Critias]]) Heracles says that, although Eurystheus commanded him to bring back Cerberus, it was not from any desire to see Cerberus, but only because Eurystheus thought that the task was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;''Pirthous'' ''TrGF'' 43 F1 lines 10–14 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA70 p. 70]; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.647.xml pp. 646–647]); Ogden 2013a, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heracles was aided in his mission by his being an initiate of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. Euripides has his initiation being &quot;lucky&quot; for Heracles in capturing Cerberus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]] ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+612 612–613]; Papadopoulou, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O3A-MUBefHYC&amp;pg=PA163 p. 163].&lt;/ref&gt; And both [[Diodorus Siculus]] and Apollodorus say that Heracles was initiated into the Mysteries, in preparation for his descent into the underworld. According to Diodorus, Heracles went to Athens, where [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]], the son of [[Orpheus]], was in charge of the initiation rites,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1–2].&lt;/ref&gt; while according to Apollodorus, he went to [[Eumolpus]] at [[Eleusis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12]; so also, [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], ''[[Chiliades]]'' 2.36.394 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/48/mode/1up p. 48]).  Apollodorus adds that, since it was unlawful for foreigners to be initiated, Heracles was adopted by Pylius, and that before Heracles could be initiated, he first had to be &quot;cleansed of the slaughter of the centaurs&quot;; see also Frazer's [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 note 2] to Apollodorus, 2.5.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heracles also had the help of [[Hermes]], the usual guide of the underworld, as well as [[Athena]]. In the ''Odyssey'', Homer has Hermes and Athena as his guides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=942966DAA722FA1A71797BE2B6F2624E?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D11%3Acard%3D601 11.620–626]; compare with [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+8.18.3 8.18.3].

By most accounts, Heracles made his descent into the underworld through an entrance at [[Tainaron]], the most famous of the various Greek entrances to the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013a, p. 110; Fowler 2013, [https://books.google.com/books?id=scd8AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA305 p. 305] with n. 159.

=== Theseus and Pirithous ===
While in the underworld, Heracles met the heroes [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]], where the two companions were being held prisoner by Hades for attempting to carry off Hades' wife [[Persephone]]. Along with bringing back Cerberus, Heracles also managed (usually) to rescue Theseus, and in some versions Pirithous as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, pp. 291–295.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Apollodorus, Heracles found Theseus and Pirithous near the gates of Hades, bound to the &quot;Chair of Forgetfulness, to which they grew and were held fast by coils of serpents&quot;, and when they saw Heracles, &quot;they stretched out their hands as if they should be raised from the dead by his might&quot;, and Heracles was able to free Theseus, but when he tried to raise up Pirithous, &quot;the earth quaked and he let go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+Epit.+E.1.24 E.1.24]; compare with [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], ''[[Chiliades]]'' 2.36.396–410, 4.31.911–916 (Greek: Kiessling, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 55–56], [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA153 153]; English translation: Berkowitz, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up 48], [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n138/mode/1up 138]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence for the involvement of Theseus and Pirithous in the Cerberus story, is found on a shield-band relief (c. 560 BC) from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], where Theseus and Pirithous (named) are seated together on a chair, arms held out in supplication, while Heracles approaches, about to draw his sword.&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+3519%22 Herakles 3519]; Gantz, p. 292; Schelfold 1966, pp. 68–69 fig. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest literary mention of the rescue occurs in Euripides, where Heracles saves Theseus (with no mention of Pirithous).&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]] ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+1169 1169–1170.], :[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+1221 1221–1222]; Gantz, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; In the lost play ''Pirithous'', both heroes are rescued,&lt;ref&gt;Gantz, P. 293; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.637.xml p. 637]; ''Pirithous'' ''TrGF'' 43 F1 Hypothesis (Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.640.xml pp. 640–641]).&lt;/ref&gt; while in the rationalized account of [[Philochorus]], Heracles was able to rescue Theseus, but not Pirithous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philochorus]], ''FGrH'' 328 F18a, b, c; Harding, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KH4T9CBXwEEC&amp;pg=PA67 pp. 67–70]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir5FhAQbcfAC&amp;pg=PA73 p. 73]; Ogden 2013a, p. 109 (Philochorus F18a = [[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D35%3Asection%3D1 35.1], compare with [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D31%3Asection%3D1 31.1–4]).&lt;/ref&gt; In one place Diodorus says Heracles brought back both [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]], by the favor of Persephone,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#26 4.26.1].&lt;/ref&gt; while in another he says that Pirithous remained in Hades, or according to &quot;some writers of myth&quot; that neither Theseus, nor Pirithous returned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4D*.html#63 4.63.4]; Gantz, pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are rescued in Hyginus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html#79 79].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various versions of how Heracles accomplished Cerberus' capture.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013a, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Apollodorus, Heracles asked Hades for Cerberus, and Hades told Heracles he would allow him to take Cerberus only if he &quot;mastered him without the use of the weapons which he carried&quot;, and so, using his lion-skin as a shield, Heracles squeezed Cerberus around the head until he submitted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.1]; compare with [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], ''[[Chiliades]]'' 2.36.400–401 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up p. 48]) which says that Heracles mastered Cerberus &quot;Covered only by his lion skin and breast piece / Apart from the rest of his weapons, just as Pluton [i.e. Hades] said&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some early sources Cerberus' capture seems to involve Heracles fighting Hades. Homer (''Iliad'' 5.395–397) has Hades injured by an arrow shot by Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Il.+5.395 5.395–397]; Kirk, p. 102; Ogden 2013a, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA110 110]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA111 111]; Gantz, pp. 70, 414, 416.

Compare with Seneca, ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.53.xml 48–51 (pp. 52–53)], where Heracles brings back &quot;spoils of triumph over that conquered king … subdued Dis&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; A scholium to the ''Iliad'' passage, explains that Hades had commanded that Heracles &quot;master Cerberus without shield or Iron&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schol. [[Homer]] ''[[Iliad]]'' 5.395–397 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA112 p. 112]; Gantz, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Heracles did this, by (as in Apollodorus) using his lion-skin instead of his shield, and making stone points for his arrows, but when Hades still opposed him, Heracles shot Hades in anger. Consistent with the no iron requirement, on an early-sixth-century BC lost Corinthian cup, Heracles is shown attacking Hades with a stone,&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, pp. 96–97; Ogden 2013a, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; while the iconographic tradition, from c. 560 BC, often shows Heracles using his wooden club against Cerberus.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013a, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euripides, has Amphitryon ask Heracles: &quot;Did you conquer him in fight, or receive him from the goddess [i.e. Persephone]? To which, Heracles answers: &quot;In fight&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[Euripides]] ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+610 610–613]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA69 pp. 69–70]. This question is echoed in Seneca, ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml 760–761 (pp. 110–111)], where Amphitryon asks &quot;Is it spoil [Heracles] brings, or a willing gift from his uncle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Pirithous'' fragment says that Heracles &quot;overcame the beast by force&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Pirithous'' ''TrGF'' 43 F1 Hypothesis (Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.640.xml pp. 640–641]).&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Diodorus, Persephone welcomed Heracles &quot;like a brother&quot; and gave Cerberus &quot;in chains&quot; to Heracles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#26 4.26.1].&lt;/ref&gt; Aristophanes, has Heracles seize Cerberus in a stranglehold and run off,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Frogs|Frogs]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0032%3Acard%3D460 465–469]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA65 pp. 65–66].&lt;/ref&gt; while Seneca has Heracles again use his lion-skin as shield, and his wooden club, to subdue Cerberus, after which a quailing Hades and Persephone, allow Heracles to lead a chained and submissive Cerberus away.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml 797–812 (pp. 112–113)].&lt;/ref&gt; Cerberus is often shown being chained, and Ovid tells that Heracles dragged the three headed Cerberus with chains of [[adamant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D404 7.409–413].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pausanias reports that according to local legend Cerberus was brought up through a chasm in the earth dedicated to Clymenus (Hades) next to the sanctuary of [[Chthonia]] at [[Ermioni|Hermione]], and in Euripides' ''Heracles'', though Euripides does not say that Cerberus was brought out there, he has Cerberus kept for a while in the &quot;grove of [[Chthonia]]&quot; at Hermione.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.35.10 2.35.10]; [[Euripides]], ''[[Heracles (Euripides)|Heracles]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Eur.+Her.+610 615] (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA69 pp. 69–70]).&lt;/ref&gt; Pausanias also mentions that at Mount Laphystion in Boeotia, that there was a statue of Heracles [[Charops (mythology)|Charops]] (&quot;with bright eyes&quot;), where the Boeotians said Heracles brought up Cerberus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.34.5 9.34.5].&lt;/ref&gt; Other locations which perhaps were also associated with Cerberus being brought out of the underworld include, [[Hierapolis]], [[Thesprotia]], and Emeia near [[Mycenae]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013a, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presented to Eurystheus, returned to Hades ===
In some accounts, after bringing Cerberus up from the underworld, Heracles paraded the captured Cerberus through Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013a, p. 113; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA69 pp. 69–71].&lt;/ref&gt; Euphorion has Heracles lead Cerberus through Midea in [[Argolis]], as women and children watch in fear,&lt;ref&gt;[[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorian]], fragment 71 Lightfoot 14–15 (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.301.xml pp. 300–303]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA69 pp. 69–70]).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diodorus Siculus]] says of Cerberus, that Heracles &quot;carried him away to the amazement of all and exhibited him to men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#26 4.26.1].&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca has Juno complain of Heracles &quot;highhandedly parading the black hound through Argive cities&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.53.xml 46–62 (pp. 52–53)].&lt;/ref&gt; and Heracles greeted by laurel-wreathed crowds, &quot;singing&quot; his praises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.115.xml 827–829 (pp. 114–115)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] (c. 425 – 348 BC) refers to Cerberus' composite nature, citing Cerberus, along with [[Scylla]] and the Chimera, as an example from &quot;ancient fables&quot; of a creature composed of many animal forms &quot;grown together in one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]] ''[[Republic]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D9%3Asection%3D588c 588c].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euphorion of Chalcis]] (3rd century BC) describes Cerberus as having multiple snake tails, and eyes that flashed, like sparks from a blacksmith's forge, or the volcaninc [[Mount Etna]].&lt;ref&gt;Euphorian, fragment 71 Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.301.xml pp. 300–303]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA69 pp. 69–70]); Ogden 2013a, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; From Euphorion, also comes the first mention of a story which told that at [[Heraclea Pontica]], where Cerberus was brought out of the underworld, by Heracles, Cerberus &quot;vomited bile&quot; from which the poisonous [[Aconitum|aconite]] plant grew up.&lt;ref&gt;Schol. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] ''[[Argonautica]]'' 2.353 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir5FhAQbcfAC&amp;pg=PA68 p. 68]); compare with [[Euphorion of Chalcis|Euphorion]], fragment 41a Lightfoot (Lightfoot, [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/euphorion_chalcis-poetic_fragments/2010/pb_LCL508.273.xml pp. 272–275]).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century BC), the capture of Cerberus was the eleventh of Heracles' labors, the twelfth and last being stealing the [[Apples of the Hesperides]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html#25 4.25.1, 26.1–2]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA66 p. 66].&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus says that Heracles thought it best to first go to [[Athens]] to take part in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]], &quot;[[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]], the son of [[Orpheus]], being at that time in charge of the initiatory rites&quot;, after which, he entered into the underworld &quot;welcomed like a brother by [[Persephone]]&quot;, and &quot;receiving the dog Cerberus in chains he carried him away to the amazement of all and exhibited him to men.&quot;

In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' (1st century BC), [[Aeneas]] and the [[Cumaean Sibyl|Sibyl]] encounter Cerberus in a cave, where he &quot;lay at vast length&quot;, filling the cave &quot;from end to end&quot;, blocking the entrance to the underworld. Cerberus is described as &quot;triple-throated&quot;, with &quot;three fierce mouths&quot;, multiple &quot;large backs&quot;, and serpents writhing around his neck. The Sybyl throws Cerberus a loaf laced with honey and herbs to induce sleep, enabling [[Aeneas]] to enter the underworld, and so apparently for Virgil—contradicting Hesiod—Cerberus guarded the underworld against entrance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.417 6.417–425]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA71 p. 71]; Ogden 2013a, p, 109; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA69 p. 69].

[[Horace]] (65 – 8 BC) also refers to Cerberus yielding to Orphesus' lyre, here Cerberus has a single dog head, which &quot;like a Fury's is fortified by a hundred snakes&quot;, with a &quot;triple-tongued mouth&quot; oozing &quot;fetid breath and gore&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''Odes'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0024%3Abook%3D3%3Apoem%3D11 3.11.13–20]; West, David, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XCaYMyW1YQQC&amp;pg=PA101 pp. 101–103]; Ogden 2013a, p. 108.

[[Ovid]] (43 BC – AD 17/18) has Cerberus' mouth produce venom,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D481 4.500–501].&lt;/ref&gt; and like Euphorion, makes Cerberus the cause of the poisonous plant aconite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D7%3Acard%3D404 7.406 ff.]; Ogden 2013a, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ovid, Heracles dragged Cerberus from the underworld, emerging from a cave &quot;where 'tis fabled, the plant grew / on soil infected by Cerberian teeth&quot;, and dazzled by the daylight, Cerberus spewed out a &quot;poison-foam&quot;, which made the aconite plants growing there poisonous.

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], in his tragedy ''Hercules Furens'' gives a detailed description of Cerberus and his capture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml?result=16&amp;rskey=CRLRlQ 782–821 (pp. 110–115)]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA66 pp. 66–68].&lt;/ref&gt;
Seneca's Cerberus has three heads, a mane of snakes, and a snake tail, with his three heads being covered in gore, and licked by the many snakes which surround them, and with hearing so acute that he can hear &quot;even ghosts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.111.xml?result=16&amp;rskey=CRLRlQ 782–791 (pp. 110–113)].&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca has Heracles use his lion-skin as shield, and his wooden club, to beat Cerberus into submission, after which Hades and Persephone, quailing on their thrones, let Heracles lead a chained and submissive Cerberus away. But upon leaving the underworld, at his first sight of daylight, a frightened Cerberus struggles furiously, and Heracles, with the help of Theseus (who had been held captive by Hades, but released, at Heracles' request) drag Cerberus into the light.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.113.xml?result=16&amp;rskey=CRLRlQ 797–821 (pp. 112–115)]; see also ''Agamemnon'', [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-agamemnon/2004/pb_LCL078.199.xml 859–862 (pp. 198–199)], which has Cerberus &quot;fearing the colour of the unknown light.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca, like Diodorus, has Heracles parade the captured Cerberus through Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''Hercules Furens'' [http://www.loebclassics.com/view/seneca_younger-hercules/2002/pb_LCL062.53.xml?result=16&amp;rskey=CRLRlQ 46–62 (pp. 52–53)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollodorus' Cerberus has three dog-heads, a serpent for a tail, and the heads of many snakes on his back.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=9AC4F2564ED0593B31146372FEC08E36?doc=Apollod.+2.5.12 2.5.12]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA64 pp. 64–65].&lt;/ref&gt; According to Apollodorus, Heracles' twelfth and final labor was to bring back Cerberus from Hades. Heracles first went to [[Eumolpus]] to be initiated into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. Upon his entering the underworld, all the dead flee Heracles except for [[Meleager]] and the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]. Heracles drew his sword against Medusa, but Hermes told Heracles that the dead are mere &quot;empty phantoms&quot;. Heracles asked Hades (here called Pluto) for Cerberus, and Hades said that Heracles could take Cerberus provided he was able to subdue him without using weapons. Heracles found Cerberus at the gates of [[Acheron]], and with his arms around Cerberus, though being bitten by Cerberus' serpent tail, Heracles squeezed until Cerberus submitted. Heracles carried Cerberus away, showed him to Eurystheus, then returned Cerberus to the underworld.

In an apparently unique version of the story, related by the sixth-century AD [[Pseudo-Nonnus]], Heracles descended into Hades to abduct Persephone, and killed Cerberus on his way back up.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Nonnus]], 4.51 (Nimmo Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzZnMCP4JRIC&amp;pg=PA37 p. 37]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA114 p. 114].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
[[File:Skyphos aus Argos.JPG|thumb|350px|One of the two earliest depictions of the capture of Cerberus (composed of the last five figures on the right) shows, from right to left: Cerberus, with a single dog head and snakes rising from his body, fleeing right, Hermes, with his characteristic hat (''[[petasos]]'') and [[caduceus]], Heracles, with quiver on his back, stone in left hand, and bow in right, a goddess, standing in front of Hades' throne, facing Heracles, and Hades, with scepter, fleeing left. Drawing of a lost Corinthian cup (c. 590–580 BC) from Argos.]]

The capture of Cerberus was a popular theme in ancient Greek and Roman art.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae]]'' (''LIMC''), Herakles 1697–1761 (Boardman, pp. 5–16), 2553–2675 (Smallwood, pp. 85–100); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA129 pp. 129–132].&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest depictions date from the beginning of the sixth century BC. One of the two earliest depictions, a [[Corinth]]ian cup (c. 590–580 BC) from Argos (now lost),&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2553%22 Herakles 2553] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 97–98); Schefold 1966, p. 68 fig. 23; Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA129 p. 129]; Ogden 2013a, pp. 106, 111; Gantz, pp. 22, 413&amp;ndash;414.&lt;/ref&gt; shows a naked Heracles, with quiver on his back and bow in his right hand, striding left, accompanied by Hermes. Heracles threatens Hades with a stone, who flees left, while a goddess, perhaps Persephone or possibly Athena, standing in front of Hades' throne, prevents the attack. Cerberus, with a single canine head and snakes rising from his head and body, flees right. On the far right a column indicates the entrance to Hades' palace. Many of the elements of this scene— Hermes, Athena, Hades, Persephone, and a column or portico— are common occurrences in later works. The other earliest depiction, a relief ''[[pithos]]'' fragment from [[Crete]] (c. 590–570 BC), is thought to show a single lion-headed Cerberus with a snake (open-mouthed) over his back being led to the right.&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2621%22 Herakles 2621] (Smallwood, pp. 92, 97); Ogden 2013a, p. 108. Cerberus is perhaps being led by Heracles, but only the left arm is preserved. According to Smallwood, the identification as Heracles and Cerberus is &quot;suggested by Dunbabin, taken as certain by Schäfer&quot; (p. 92), and &quot;too little of the fragment is preserved for a secure identification&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-sixth-century BC [[Laconia]]n cup by the [[Hunt Painter]] adds several new features to the scene which also become common in later works: three heads, a snake tail, Cerberus' chain and Heracles' club. Here Cerberus has three canine heads, is covered by a shaggy coat of snakes, and has a tail which ends in a snake head. He is being held on a chain leash by Heracles who holds his club raised over head.&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2605%22 Herakles 2605] (Smallwood, p. 91); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA129 pp. 129–130]; Pipili, p. 5, fig. 8; Gantz, p. 22; Ogden 2013a, p. 106, 111 with n. 185, p. 111 with n. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greek art, the vast majority of depictions of Heracles and Cerberus occur on [[Attica|Attic]] vases.&lt;ref&gt;Schefold 1992, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lost Corinthian cup shows Cerberus with a single dog head, and the relief ''pithos'' fragment (c. 590–570 BC) apparently shows a single lion-headed Cerberus, in [[Attica|Attic]] vase painting Cerberus usually has two dog heads.&lt;ref&gt;Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA129 p. 129]; Smallwood, p. 87. Exceptions include: ''LIMC'' Heracles 2570, 2576 (one head).&lt;/ref&gt; In other art, as in the Laconian cup, Cerberus is usually three-headed.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, pp. 87, 93. Exceptions include: ''LIMC'' Herakles 2553, 2591, 2621 (one head), 2579 (two heads).&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally in Roman art Cerberus is shown with a large central lion head and two smaller dog heads on either side.&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' Herakles 2640, 2642, 2656, 2666, Smallwood, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the Corinthian and Laconian cups (and possibly the relief ''pithos'' fragment), Cerberus is often depicted as part snake.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, p. 87; Ogden 2013b [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA63 p. 63]. Examples include: ''LIMC'' Herakles 2553–4, 2560, 2571, 2579, 2581, 2586, 2588, 2595, 2600, 2603–6, 2610–11, 2616, 2621, 2628).&lt;/ref&gt; In Attic vase painting, Cerberus is usually shown with a snake for a tail or a tail which ends in the head of a snake.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Snakes are also often shown rising from various parts of his body including snout, head, neck, back, ankles, and paws.

Two Attic amphoras from Vulci, one (c. 530–515 BC) by the [[Bucci Painter]] (Munich 1493),&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2604%22 Herakles 2604] (Smallwood, p. 91); Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/5058D8A6-1245-4283-B7F5-51A4D3734BD5 301639].&lt;/ref&gt; the other (c. 525–510 BC) by the [[Andokides painter]] (Louvre F204),&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2554%22 Herakles 2554] (Smallwood, pp. 87, 98); Schefold 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA130 pp. 130–131], [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA131 fig. 152]; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/2A5DF5DB-2CFF-4DD3-947A-0F9A51382F1A 200011]; Perseus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre+F+204&amp;object=vase Louvre F 204 (Vase)].&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the usual two heads and snake tail, show Cerberus with a mane down his necks and back, another typical Cerberian feature of Attic vase painting.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, pp. 8, 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Andokides' amphora also has a small snake curling up from each of Cerberus' two heads.

Besides this lion-like mane and the occasional lion-head mentioned above, Cerberus was sometimes shown with other leonine features. A pitcher (c. 530–500) shows Cerberus with mane and claws,&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2610%22 Herakles 2610] (Smallwood, p. 91); Buitron, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0044:entry=23 Worcester MA 1935.59]; Beazley Archive [http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/record/A9338627-1A1F-4AE8-B950-E4044C0DFD4E 351415].&lt;/ref&gt; while a first-century BC [[sardonyx]] cameo shows Cerberus with leonine body and paws.&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2628%22 Herakles 2628] (Smallwood, p. 93).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a limestone relief fragment from [[Taranto]] (c. 320–300 BC) shows Cerberus with three lion-like heads.&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Herakles+2618%22 Herakles 2618] (Smallwood, p. 92).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second quarter of the 5th century BC the capture of Cerberus disappears from Attic vase painting.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; After the early third century BC, the subject becomes rare everywhere until the Roman period. In Roman art the capture of Cerberus is usually shown together with other labors. Heracles and Cerberus are usually alone, with Heracles leading Cerberus.&lt;ref&gt;Smallwood, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Hades-et-Cerberus-III.jpg|thumb|right|Cerberus and Hades/[[Serapis]]. [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]], [[Crete]], [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;''LIMC'' [http://www.iconiclimc.ch/visitors/treesearch.php?source=100&amp;term=%22Kerberos+66%22 Kerberos 66]; Woodford, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The etymology of Cerberus' name is uncertain. Ogden&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013a, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to attempts to establish an Indo-European etymology as &quot;not yet successful&quot;.  It has been claimed to be related to the [[Sanskrit]] word सर्वरा ''sarvarā'', used as an epithet of one of the dogs of [[Yama]], from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *''k̑érberos'', meaning &quot;spotted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JY77EuSuLk8C&amp;pg=PA96 pp. 96–97].&lt;/ref&gt; among others, critiques this etymology. Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] dog [[Garmr]], relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root ''*ger-'' &quot;to growl&quot; (perhaps with the suffixes ''-*m/*b'' and ''-*r''). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires ''Kerberos'' and ''Garmr'' to be derived from two ''different'' Indo-European roots (*''ker-'' and *''gher-'' respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.

Though probably not Greek, Greek etymologies for Cerberus have been offered. An etymology given by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] (the late-fourth-century commentator on [[Virgil]])—but rejected by Ogden—derives Cerberus from the Greek word ''creoboros'' meaning &quot;flesh-devouring&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil]], ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA190 p. 190]; compare with [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]], ''Mythologies'' 1.6 (Whitbread, [https://books.google.com/books?id=73mJIuYfmzEC&amp;pg=PA51 pp. 51–52]); [[First Vatican Mythographer]], 1.57 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA73 pp. 73–74; Pepin, p. 36]); [[Second Vatican Mythographer]], 13 (Pepin, 106), 173 (Pepin, p. 171); [[Third Vatican Mythographer]], 13.4 (Pepin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sE7WnkLLt2gC&amp;pg=PA324 p. 324]). According to Ogden, 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA74 p. 74], &quot;''creoboros'' is a genuine Greek word and does indeed mean 'flesh-devouring', but it has no part to play in the genuine etymology of Cerberus's name, which remains obscure&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggested etymology derives Cerberus from &quot;Ker berethrou&quot;, meaning &quot;evil of the pit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Room, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cerberus rationalized==
At least as early as the 6th century BC, some ancient writers attempted to explain away various fantastical features of Greek mythology;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;pg=PA7 p. 7]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA183 p. 183].&lt;/ref&gt; included in these are various rationalized accounts of the Cerberus story.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA184 pp. 184–185].&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest such account (late 6th century BC) is that of [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hecataeus of Miletus]], fr. *27 a Fowler (Fowler 2001, p. 136) (''apud'' [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.4 3.25.4–5]), (cf. ''FGrH'' 1 F27); Hawes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tyuTAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 p. 8]; Hopman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hb4hAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182 p. 182]; Ogden 2013a, p. 107; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA72 pp. 72–73].&lt;/ref&gt; In his account Cerberus was not a dog at all, but rather simply a large poisonous snake, which lived on [[Tainaron]]. The serpent was called the &quot;hound of Hades&quot; only because anyone bitten by it died immediately, and it was this snake that Heracles brought to Eurystheus. The geographer Pausanias (who preserves for us Hecataeus' version of the story) points out that, since Homer does not describe Cerberus, Hecataeus' account does not necessarily conflict with Homer, since Homer's &quot;Hound of Hades&quot; may not in fact refer to an actual dog.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.6 3.25.6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rationalized accounts make Cerberus out to be a normal dog. According to [[Palaephatus]] (4th century BC)&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus, ''On Unbelievable Tales'' 39 (Stern, [https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;pg=PA71 pp. 71–72]).&lt;/ref&gt; Cerberus was one of the two dogs who guarded the cattle of [[Geryon]], the other being [[Orthrus]]. Geryon lived in a city named Tricranium (in Greek ''Tricarenia,'' &quot;Three-Heads&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA187 p. 187].&lt;/ref&gt; from which name both Cerberus and Geryon came to be called &quot;three-headed&quot;. Heracles killed Orthus, and drove away Geryon's cattle, with Cerberus following along behind. Molossus, a Mycenaen, offered to buy Cerberus from Eurystheus (presumably having received the dog, along with the cattle, from Heracles). But when Eurystheus refused, Molossus stole the dog and penned him up in a cave in Tainaron. Eurystheus commanded Heracles to find Cerberus and bring him back. After searching the entire Peloponnesus, Heracles found where it was said Cerberus was being held, went down into the cave, and brought up Cerberus, after which it was said: &quot;Heracles descended through the cave into Hades and brought up Cerberus.&quot;

In the rationalized account of [[Philochorus]], in which Heracles rescues Theseus, Perithous is eaten by Cerberus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philochorus]], ''FGrH'' 328 F18a (= [[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D35%3Asection%3D1 35.1]), F18b, F18c; Harding, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KH4T9CBXwEEC&amp;pg=PA68 pp. 68–70]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir5FhAQbcfAC&amp;pg=PA73 p. 73]; Ogden 2013a, p. 109; Gantz, p. 295; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.637.xml p. 637]. Compare with Plutarch,  ''Theseus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D31%3Asection%3D1 31.1–4]; [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], ''[[Chiliades]]'' 2.36.388–411 (Greek: Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA55 pp. 55–56]; English translation: Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n48/mode/1up p. 48]), 4.31.911–916 (Kiessling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dG0GAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]; Berkowitz, [https://archive.org/stream/TzetzesCHILIADES/Chiliades#page/n138/mode/1up p. 138]).&lt;/ref&gt; In this version of the story, Aidoneus (i.e., &quot;Hades&quot;) is the mortal king of the [[Molossians]], with a wife named Persephone, a daughter named Kore (another name for the goddess Persephone) and a large mortal dog named Cerberus, with whom all suiters of his daughter were required to fight. After having stolen Helen, to be Theseus' wife, Theseus and Perithous, attempt to abduct Kore, for Perithous, but Aidoneus catches the two heroes, imprisons Theseus, and feeds Perithous to Cerberus. Later, while a guest of Aidoneus, Heracles asks Aidoneus to release Theseus, as a favor, which Aidoneus grants.

A 2nd-century AD Greek known as [[Heraclitus the paradoxographer]] (not to be confused with the 5th-century BC Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]) – claimed that Cerberus had two pups that were never away from their father, which made Cerberus appear to be three-headed.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA73 p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cerberus allegorized==
[[File:Inferno Canto 6 lines 24-26.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Virgil feeding Cerberus earth, in the Third Circle of Hell. Illustration from Dante's ''Inferno'' by [[Gustave Doré]].]]
[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], a medieval commentator on [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', derived Cerberus' name from the Greek word ''creoboros'' meaning &quot;flesh-devouring&quot; (see above), and held that Cerberus symbolized the corpse-consuming earth, with Heracles' triumph over Cerberus representing his victory over earthly desires.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil]], ''Aeneid'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D6%3Acommline%3D395 6.395]; Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA190 p. 190]. For others who followed Servius in interpreting Cerberus as symbolizing the corruption of flesh, in both the literal and moral senses, see Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6KygKVV5l7YC&amp;pg=PA68 pp. 68–69].&lt;/ref&gt; Later the mythographer [[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]], allegorizes Cerberus' three heads as representing the three origins of human strife: &quot;nature, cause, and accident&quot;, and (drawing on the same flesh-devouring etymology as Servius) as symbolizing &quot;the three ages—infancy, youth, old age, at which death enters the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fabius Planciades Fulgentius|Fulgentius]], ''Mythologies'' 1.6 (Whitbread, [https://books.google.com/books?id=73mJIuYfmzEC&amp;pg=PA51 pp. 51–52]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&amp;pg=PA190 p. 190].&lt;/ref&gt;

The later [[Vatican Mythographers]] repeat and expand upon the traditions of Servius and Fulgentius. All three Vatican Mythographers repeat Servius' derivation of Cerberus' name from ''creoboros''.&lt;ref&gt;[[First Vatican Mythographer]], 1.57 (Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv0Fxm6Amh4C&amp;pg=PA73 pp. 73–74]; Pepin, p. 36); [[Second Vatican Mythographer]], 173 (Pepin, p. 171); [[Third Vatican Mythographer]], 13.4 (Pepin, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sE7WnkLLt2gC&amp;pg=PA324 p. 324]).&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Vatican Mythographer repeats (nearly word for word) what Fulgentius had to say about Cerberus,&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Vatican Mythographer]], 13 (Pepin, p. 106).&lt;/ref&gt; while the Third Vatican Mythographer, in another very similar passage to Fugentius', says (more specifically than Fugentius), that for &quot;the philosophers&quot; Cerberus represented hatred, his three heads symbolizing the three kinds of human hatred: natural, causal, and casual (i.e. accidental).&lt;ref&gt;[[Third Vatican Mythographer]] 6.22 (Pepin, p. 171).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Second and Third Vatican Mythographers, note that the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon and Hades each have tripartite insignia, associating Hades' three headed Cerberus, with [[Zeus]]' three-forked thunderbolt, and [[Poseidon]]'s three-pronged trident, while the Third Vatican Mythographer adds that &quot;some philosophers think of Cerberus as the tripartite earth: Asia, Africa, and Europe. This earth, swallowing up bodies, sends souls to Tartarus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Second Vatican Mythographer]], 13 (Pepin, p. 106); [[Third Vatican Mythographer]] 6.22 (Pepin, p. 171). For others who associated Cerberus' three heads with the three continents see Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6KygKVV5l7YC&amp;pg=PA69 p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgil described Cerberus as &quot;ravenous&quot; (''fame rabida''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.421 6.421].&lt;/ref&gt; and a rapacious Cerberus became proverbial. Thus Cerberus came to symbolize avarice,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson-Okamura, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5PaUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169 p. 169]; Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6KygKVV5l7YC&amp;pg=PA69 p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt; and so, for example, in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]],'' Cerberus is placed in the Third Circle of Hell, guarding over the gluttons, where he &quot;rends the spirits, flays and quarters them,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante]], ''Inferno'' [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Inferno/Canto_VI 6.13–18]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dante (perhaps echoing Servius' association of Cerbeus with earth) has his guide Virgil take up handfuls of earth and throw them into Cerberus' &quot;rapacious gullets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dante]], ''Inferno'' [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy/Inferno/Canto_VI 6.25–27]; Lansing, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CY-sAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154 p. 154].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hev 11 fig H hercules et cerberus.jpg|thumb|right|Cerberus constellation]]

== Constellation ==
In the [[Cerberus (constellation)|constellation Cerberus]] introduced by [[Johannes Hevelius]] in 1687, Cerberus is drawn as a three-headed snake, held in Hercules' hand (previously these stars had been depicted as a branch of the tree on which grew the [[Hesperides|Apples of the Hesperides]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/cerberus.htm |title=Ian Ridpath's 'Star Tales' |publisher=Ianridpath.com |date= |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snake genus==
In 1829 French naturalist [[Georges Cuvier]] gave the name ''[[Cerberus (snake)|Cerberus]]'' to a genus of Asian snakes, which are commonly called &quot;dog-faced water snakes&quot; in English.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. (&quot;Cerberus&quot;, p. 50).&lt;/ref&gt;
