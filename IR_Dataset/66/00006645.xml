'''Craven Cottage''' is a football [[stadium]] located in [[Fulham]], [[London]]. It has been the home ground of [[Fulham F.C.]] since 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialwebsite&quot; /&gt;
The ground's capacity was 25,700,&lt;ref name=&quot;officialwebsite&quot; /&gt; all-seated, until the closure of the Riverside Stand in the close season of 2019, though the record attendance is 49,335, for a game against [[Millwall FC|Millwall]], 8 October 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/feature/_/id/841079?cc=5739 |title=A brief history of Fulham | first=Rob | last=Smyth |publisher=ESPNFC |date=5 July 2012|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located next to [[Bishop's Park (Fulham)|Bishop's Park]] on the banks of the [[River Thames]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cafe&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/visit/craven-cottage/cafe-at-the-cottage |title=Café at the Cottage |publisher=Fulham F.C.|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Craven Cottage' was originally a royal hunting lodge and has history dating back over 300 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jbYQ4gS05EEC&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=%E2%80%9DCRAVEN+COTTAGE%E2%80%9C+HUNTING+LODGE#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9DCRAVEN%20COTTAGE%E2%80%9C%20HUNTING%20LODGE&amp;f=false |title=The football and real ale guide: Premiership | first=Richard | last=Stedman |publisher=Stedders Guides|year=2006|accessdate=18 November 2013|isbn=9781905423057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Pre-Fulham===
[[File:Craven Cottage LH4736.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Craven Cottage on the banks of the [[River Thames]] as it looks today]]
The original 'Cottage' was built in 1780, by [[William Craven, 6th Baron Craven|William Craven]], the sixth [[Baron Craven]]&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2011/may/20/a-place-in-history |title=A Place In History |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=20 May 2011|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was located on the centre circle of the pitch. At the time, the surrounding areas were woods which made up part of [[Anne Boleyn]]'s hunting grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt;

The Cottage was lived in by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; (who wrote ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Last Days of Pompeii | first=Edward | last=Bulwer-Lytton |publisher=Dodo Press |isbn = 1406521647}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and other somewhat notable (and moneyed) persons&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; until it was destroyed by fire in May 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; Many rumours persist among Fulham fans of past tenants of Craven Cottage. [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]],   [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[Florence Nightingale]] and even [[Queen Victoria]] are reputed to have stayed there, although there is no real evidence for this. Following the fire, the site was abandoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; Fulham had had 8 previous grounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/july/01/moments-that-made-ffc |title=50 Moments That Made Fulham: 10. The Formation of the Club – 1879 |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=1 July 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; before settling in at Craven Cottage for good. Therefore, The Cottagers have had 12 grounds overall (including a temporary stay at [[Loftus Road]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/september/11/top-10-loftus-road-matches |title=Top 10: Loftus Road Matches |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=11 September 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning that only their former 'landlords' and rivals [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] have had more home grounds (14) in British football. Of particular note, was [[Ranelagh House]], Fulham's palatial home from 1886–1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derelictlondon.com/londons-long-lost-sports-grounds.html |title=London's Long Lost Sports Grounds |publisher=Derelict London |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under construction: 1894–1905===
[[File:Rabbit Hutch at the Cottage.jpg|thumb|right|The 'Rabbit Hutch' stand along Stevenage Road before [[Archibald Leitch]]'s redesign in 1904-5]]
When representatives of Fulham first came across the land, in 1894, it was so overgrown that it took two years to be made suitable for football to be played on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; A deal was struck for the owners of the ground to carry out the work, in return for which they would receive a proportion of the gate receipts.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt;

The first football match at which there were any gate receipts was when Fulham played against [[Minerva F.C.|Minerva]] in the [[Middlesex Senior Cup]], on 10 October 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; The ground's first stand was built shortly after.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; Described as looking like an &quot;orange box&quot;, it consisted of four wooden structures each holding some 250 seats, and later was affectionately nicknamed the &quot;rabbit hutch&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt;

In 1904 [[London County Council]] became concerned with the level of safety at the ground, and tried to get it closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; A court case followed in January 1905, as a result of which [[Archibald Leitch]], a Scottish [[architect]] who had risen to prominence after his building of the [[Ibrox Stadium]], a few years earlier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=93&amp;Itemid=128 |title=Archibald Leitch – 'Engineering Archie': The Designer of Ibrox |publisher=The Rangers Archive |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was hired to work on the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; In a scheme costing £15,000&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; (a record for the time&lt;ref name=&quot;Terrace&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19009781 |title=Fulham's plans to increase Craven Cottage capacity approved |work=BBC Sport |date=27 July 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), he built a pavilion (the present-day 'Cottage' itself&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt;) and the Stevenage Road Stand,&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt; in his characteristic [[red brick]] style.&lt;ref name=&quot;placeinhistory&quot; /&gt;

The stand on Stevenage Road celebrated its centenary in the 2005–2006 season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2005/august/15/stevenage-road-centenary |title=Stevenage Road Centenary |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=15 August 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, following the death of Fulham FC's favourite son, former England captain [[Johnny Haynes]], in a car accident in October 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4353732.stm |title=Legendary Haynes dies after crash |work=BBC Sport|date=18 October 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Stevenage Road Stand was renamed the Johnny Haynes Stand after the club sought the opinions of Fulham supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/fulham/4480816.stm |title=Fulham re-name stand after Haynes |work=BBC Sport|date=29 November 2005|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Johnny Haynes Stand and Cottage remain among the finest examples of [[Archibald Leitch]] football architecture to remain in existence and both have been designated as Grade II listed buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialwebsite&quot; /&gt;

===Establishing itself as a stadium===
An [[England national football team|England]] v [[Wales national football team|Wales]] match was played at the ground in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englandstats.com/matches.php?mid=90 |title=England 1 – 1 Wales |publisher=England Stats |date=18 March 1907|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/englandmatchreports/090-wales-1907 |title=England 1 – 1 Wales |publisher=England Match Reports |date=18 March 1907|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a [[rugby league]] international between [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1911/game-7/england-vs-australia.html |title=England 6 lost to Australia 11 |publisher=The Rugby League Project |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925101657/http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/kangaroos-tour-1911/game-7/england-vs-australia.html |archivedate=25 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the club's directors [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]], and his friend William Hall, took over [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the early 1910s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/laying-the-foundations/club-moves-from-woolwich-to-highbury |title=Club moves from Woolwich to Highbury |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=16 December 2008|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plan being to merge Fulham with Arsenal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/arsenal-stadium-highbury/arsenal-stadium-a-history |title=Highbury – A history |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |date=14 July 2008|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form a &quot;London superclub&quot; at Craven Cottage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IcsXyTmY7MoC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=ARSENAL+FULHAM+%E2%80%9CLONDON+SUPERCLUB%E2%80%9D#v=onepage&amp;q=ARSENAL%20FULHAM%20%E2%80%9CLONDON%20SUPERCLUB%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false |title=Rebels for the Cause: The Alternative History of Arsenal Football Club | first=Jon | last=Spurling |publisher=Random House |date=2 November 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013|isbn=9781780574868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was largely motivated by Fulham's failure thus far to gain promotion to the top division of English football. There were also plans for Henry Norris to build a larger stadium on the other side of Stevenage Road but there was little need after the merger idea failed. During this era, the Cottage was used for choir singing and marching bands along with other performances, and Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs0LBqzEDIM|title=Craven Cottage 1926|date=16 November 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKDAASBY8yE|title=Craven Cottage Charity Match 1920|date=16 November 2010|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 there were plans to demolish the ground and start again from scratch with a new 80,000 capacity stadium. These plans never materialised mainly due to the [[Great Depression]].

On 8 October 1938, 49,335 spectators watched Fulham play [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN&quot; /&gt; It was the largest attendance ever at Craven Cottage and the record remains today, unlikely to be bettered as it is now an all-seater stadium with currently no room for more than 25,700. The ground hosted several football games for the [[1948 Summer Olympics]], and is one of the last extant that did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf 1948 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716035822/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1948/OR1948.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }} pp. 45–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-War===

It was not until after Fulham first reached the top division, in 1949, that further improvements were made to the stadium. In 1962 Fulham became the final side in the first division to erect [[floodlights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/august/22/throwback-thursday |title=1962: Cook Lights Up The Cottage |publisher=Fulham F.C. |date=22 August 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floodlights were said to be the most expensive in Europe at the time as they were so modern. The lights were like large pylons towering 50 metres over the ground and were similar in appearance to those at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]]. An electronic scoreboard was installed on the Riverside Terrace at the same time as the floodlights were installed and flagpoles flying the flags of all of the other first division teams were flown from them.&lt;ref name=&quot;pies&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/fulham/171403/the-black-and-white-years-scorching-vintage-photos-of-fulhams-craven-cottage-between-1923-1978.html |title=The Black-And-White Years: Scorching Vintage Photos Of Fulham's Craven Cottage, Between 1923–1978 | first=Chris | last=Wright |publisher=Who Ate All The Pies? |date=30 July 2013|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sale of Alan Mullery to Tottenham Hotspur in 1964 (for £72,500) the Hammersmith End had a roof put over it&lt;ref name=&quot;roof&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/fulham-go-from-laughing-stock-to-serious-players-1947790.html |title=Fulham go from laughing stock to serious players | first=Steve | last=Tongue |newspaper=Independent |date=18 April 2010|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of approximately £42,500.

Although Fulham was relegated, the development of Craven Cottage continued. The Riverside terracing, infamous for the fact that fans occupying it would turn their heads annually to watch [[The Boat Race]] pass,&lt;ref name=&quot;334,000&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z2rBc7i0RnsC&amp;pg=PT124&amp;lpg=PT124&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CCRAVEN+COTTAGE%E2%80%9C+334000#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CCRAVEN%20COTTAGE%E2%80%9C%20334000&amp;f=false |title=Football Fanatic: A Record Breaking Journey Through English Football | first=Ken | last=Ferris |publisher=Random House |date=1 March 2013|accessdate=19 November 2013|isbn=9781780578019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was replaced by what was officially named the 'Eric Miller Stand',&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16531444 |title=Fulham submit plans to expand Craven Cottage to a 30,000-seat stadium |work=BBC Sport |date=12 January 2012|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Miller (businessman)|Eric Miller]] being a director of the club at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/jan/18/sport.comment1 |title=The Cottage has been a block of flats waiting to happen since the 1980s | first=David | last=Lacey |newspaper=Guardian |date=18 January 2003|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stand, which cost £334,000&lt;ref name=&quot;334,000&quot; /&gt; and held 4,200 seats, was opened with a friendly game against [[S.L.

On [[Boxing Day]] 1963, Craven Cottage was the venue of the fastest [[hat-trick#Association football|hat-trick]] in the history of the English football league, which was completed in less than three minutes, by [[Graham Leggat]]. This helped his Fulham team to beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich]] 10–1 (a club record).&lt;ref&gt;Three minutes is the time quoted by [https://web.archive.org/web/20090325201135/http://www.grahamleggatsoccer.com/memories.htm his official website].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article6235.ece/BINARY/Fulham+10-1+Ipswich |title=Ten for The 'Turkeys' | first=Bill | last=Holden |newspaper=Daily Mirror |date=27 December 1963|accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international record is held by [[Jimmy O'Connor]], an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] player who notched up his hat trick in 2 minutes 14 seconds in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/3485294.stm |title=Hayter keeps feet on ground | first=Mark | last=Mitchener |work=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2004|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1984, '''Fulham [[rugby league]]''' played their home games at the Cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;rugbyleague&quot; /&gt; They have since evolved into the '''London Crusaders''', the '''London Broncos''' and '''Harlequins Rugby League'''&lt;ref name=&quot;rugbyleague&quot; /&gt; before reverting to [[London Broncos]] ahead of [[Super League XVII|the 2012 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/15353867 |title=Harlequins revert to London Broncos name again for 2012 |work=BBC Sport |date=1 November 2011|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craven Cottage held the team's largest ever crowd at any ground with 15,013, at a game against [[Wakefield Trinity]] on 15 February 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Napit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napit.co.uk/viewus/infobank/rugby/superleague/harlequinsrl.php |title=Harlequins RLFC |publisher=Napit |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After one and a half seasons at [[Loftus Road]], no work had been done on the Cottage.

The work proceeded as scheduled and the club were able to return to their home for the start of the [[2004–05 FA Premier League|2004–05 season]]. Their first game in the new-look 22,000 all-seater stadium was a pre-season friendly against Watford on 10 July 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialwebsite&quot; /&gt; [[Fenway Sports Group]] originally partnered with Fulham in 2009, due to the perceived heritage and quirks shared between the Cottage and [[Fenway Park]], saying no English club identifies with its stadium as much as Fulham. Boston Red Sox were later in bed with Liverpool FC, after the takeover by Fenway Sports Group.

The current stadium was one of the [[Premier League|Premiership's]] smallest grounds at the time of Fulham's relegation at the end of the [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]] season (it was third-smallest, after the [[KC Stadium]] and the [[Liberty Stadium]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22940442 |title=Cardiff City plan stadium expansion in time for 2014/15 season |work=BBC News|date=17 June 2013|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much admired for its fine architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/11767726/Ranking-all-54-stadiums-in-Premier-League-history.html?frame=3390163|title=Ranking all 54 stadiums in Premier League history|date=3 August 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stadium has recently hosted a few international games, mostly including [[Australia national association football team|Australia]]. This venue is suitable for Australia because most of the country's top players are based in Europe, and West London has a significant community of [[expatriate]] Australians.

The board seem to have moved away from their ambition to make Fulham the &quot;Manchester United of the south&quot; as it became clear how expensive such a plan would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/08/premier-league-preview-fulham |title=Premier League preview No7: Fulham | first=Paul | last=Doyle |newspaper=Guardian |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With large spaces of land at a premium in south-west London, Fulham appear to be committed to a gradual increase of the ground's capacity often during the summer between seasons. The capacity of Craven Cottage has been increased during summers for instance in 2008 with a small increase in the capacity of the Hammersmith End. Fulham previously announced in 2007 that they are planning to increase the capacity of Craven Cottage by 4,000 seats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/News/NewsArticles/2007/October/CottageRelease.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421203942/http://www.fulhamfc.com/Club/News/NewsArticles/2007/October/CottageRelease.aspx |archivedate=21 April 2012 |title=Stadium Announcement |publisher= Fulham F.C.|date=3 April 2007 |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is yet to be implemented.  There was also proposals for a bridge to span the Thames, for a redeveloped Riverside stand and a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/jan/17/newsstory.sport8?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | work=The Guardian | first=Paul | last=Kelso | title=Development at Craven Cottage to include museum | date=17 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More substantial plans arose in October 2011 with the 'Fulham Forever' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/stadium-development|title=Stadium Development – Fulham Football Club|work=fulhamfc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Al-Fayed selling [[Harrods]] department store for £1.5 billion in May 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8669657.stm |title=Mohammed Al Fayed sells Harrods store to Qatar Holdings|work=BBC News|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed plan emerged in the Riverside Stand as the only viable area for expansion. The scheme involved the demolition of the back of the Riverside Stand with a new tier of seating added on top of the current one and a row of corporate boxes; bringing Craven Cottage up to 30,000 capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/fulham-and-brighton-push-for-stadium-expansion/|title=Fulham and Brighton push for stadium expansion [UPDATED]|work=The Stadium Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account local residents, the proposal would: reopen the riverside walk; light pollution would be reduced with the removal of floodlight masts; new access points would make match-day crowds more manageable; and the new stand would be respectful in design to its position on the River Thames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/stadium-development/construction-phase|title=Construction Phase – Fulham Football Club|work=fulhamfc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham Group Contracting were chosen in March 2013 as the construction company for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2013/03/12/buckingham-set-to-score-with-15m-fulham-refurb/|title=Buckingham set to score with £15m Fulham refurb|work=constructionenquirer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2019, the club confirmed that work on the new Riverside Stand would commence in the summer of 2019.

==The ground as it stands==

===Hammersmith End===
[[File:The Hammersmith End - Fulham FC, SW6 - geograph.org.uk - 934070.jpg|thumb|right|The Hammy End]]
The [[Hammersmith]] End (or Hammy) is the northernmost stand in the ground, the closest to Hammersmith. The roofing was financed through the sale of [[Alan Mullery]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;roof&quot; /&gt; It is traditionally the &quot;home&quot; end where the more vocal Fulham fans sit,&lt;ref name=&quot;terrace&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/help/faq/a-to-z-reference-guides |title=A to Z Reference Guides |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;visiting&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/help/faq/visiting-the-cottage |title=Visiting The Cottage |publisher=Fulham F.C.|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many stand during games at the back rows of the stand. If Fulham win the toss, they usually choose to play towards the Hammersmith End in the second half. The hardcore fans tend to sit (or rather stand) in the back half of H6 and H7 zones (known as ‘H Block’ to the faithful). The stand had terracing until the reopening of the ground in 2004, when it was replaced with seating in order to comply with league rules following the [[Taylor Report]].&lt;ref name=&quot;terrace&quot; /&gt; 
[[File:Australia vs New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|The 'Little Switzerland' section of the Putney End seen in the background during an [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] vs [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] friendly in 2005]]

===Putney End===
The [[Putney]] End is the southernmost stand in the ground, nearest to [[Putney]] and backing onto Bishops Park.  This stand currently a mixture of home and away fans, separated by a &quot;wall&quot; of stewards, with away fans usually allocated blocks P5 and P6. When the ground became redeveloped, with the standing terraces replaced in 2003–04 the club applied for a licence to have a designated neutral area, in the rows closest to the Cottage, but this currently doesn’t exist due to the reduced capacity. Due to Fulham's history of having no segregation in the Putney End and no history of crowd trouble, the FA gave the club special dispensation to allow for this, making Fulham the only club currently in the UK to have such an area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shoot.co.uk/stadium-special-4/|title=Stadium special|first=George|last=Preece|publisher=Shoot|date=17 September 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003528/http://www.shoot.co.uk/stadium-special-4/|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flags of every nationality in the Fulham squad were hung from the roofing, although they were removed after the 2006–07 season commenced and there is now an electronic scoreboard in place. There is a plane tree in the corner by the river.&lt;ref name=&quot;tree&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/epltalk/304406352/ |title=Tree at Craven Cottage | first=The | last=Gaffer |publisher=Flickr |date=23 November 2006|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Riverside Stand===
[[File:Boat Race Craven Cottage.jpg|thumb|right|The Riverside Stand (up to 2019) beside the [[River Thames]]]]
The Riverside was originally terracing that backed onto the Thames.&lt;ref name=&quot;pies&quot; /&gt; It also featured large advertising hoardings above the fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pies&quot; /&gt; In 1971-72, an all-seater stand was built, originally known as the Riverside Stand (the name was confirmed in the Fulham v Carlisle United programme on 4 December 1971). Its hard lines and metallic and concrete finish are in stark contrast to the Johnny Haynes stand opposite. The stand was opened for a prestigious friendly against [[S.L. Benfica]], who included [[Eusébio]] in the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benfica&quot;/&gt; In the Fulham v Burnley programme on 4 October 1977, it was revealed that the stand would be re-named the [[Eric Miller (businessman)|Eric Miller]] Stand, following the recent death of the former vice-chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt;  It is sometimes incorrectly stated that, contrary to the above, the name of the stand was changed from the Eric Miller Stand to The Riverside Stand after the discovery of Miller's suicide. He had been under investigation for fraud and embezzlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald&quot; /&gt; The name of the stand actually  reverted to &quot;Riverside Stand&quot; in the 1990s.

The Riverside Stand backs onto the [[River Thames]]&lt;ref name=&quot;pies&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;visiting&quot; /&gt; and is elevated above pitch level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webzoom.freewebs.com/questforthe92/Fulham%20-%20Riverside%20Stand.JPG |title=Fulham - Riverside Stand.JPG |first=Richard |last=Hooper |publisher=Quest for the 92 |accessdate=21 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214233725/http://webzoom.freewebs.com/questforthe92/Fulham%20-%20Riverside%20Stand.JPG |archivedate=14 February 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; unlike the other three stands. It contains the corporate hospitality seating&lt;ref name=&quot;visiting&quot; /&gt; alongside Fulham fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;visiting&quot; /&gt; [[Jimmy Hill]] once referred to the Riverside being &quot;a bit like the London Palladium&quot; as Blocks V &amp; W (the middle section) are often filled with the rich and famous (including often Al-Fayed). There were then several [[Harrods]] advertising hoardings. Above the advertising hoardings is the gantry, for the press and cameras.&lt;ref name=&quot;terrace&quot; /&gt; Tickets in this area are often the easiest to buy, not surprisingly they are also some of the more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/tickets/season-tickets/pricing-and-stadium-map |title=2013/14 Season Ticket Prices|publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has the Hammersmith End to its left, the Putney End to its right and is opposite the [[Johnny Haynes]] Stand.&lt;ref name=&quot;visiting&quot; /&gt;

During the 1970s, Craven Cottage flooded, with water gushing in from the Riverside. The stand houses the [[George Cohen]] restaurant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/hospitality/packages/george-cohen-restaurant |title=George Cohen Restaurant |publisher=Fulham F.C. |accessdate=21 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201085440/http://www.fulhamfc.com/hospitality/packages/george-cohen-restaurant |archive-date=1 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; while on non-match days there is the Cottage Cafe, located near to the Cottage itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;cafe&quot; /&gt; ([[The River Café (London)|The River Café]] is also located nearby).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rivercafe.co.uk/rc_page.php?pg_id=12 |title=River Café |publisher=River Café |accessdate=21 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227093156/http://www.rivercafe.co.uk/rc_page.php?pg_id=12 |archivedate=27 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=loc:51.483889,-0.224167&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=51.479084,-0.22037&amp;spn=0.017373,0.038581&amp;t=h&amp;z=15 |title=loc: 51.483889,-0.224167 |publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Tommy Trinder]]'s chairmanship in the 60s, flags of all other teams in the Division 1 were proudly flown along the Thames.&lt;ref name=&quot;pies&quot; /&gt; However, when Fulham were relegated in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/fulham/1967-1968/table |title=Fulham 1967–1968 : English Division One (old) Table |publisher=Statto |accessdate=22 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231820/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/fulham/1967-1968/table |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinder decided not to change the flags as &quot;Fulham won't be in this division next season&quot;.

The end of the Riverside Stand towards the 'Hammy End' indicates the end of the 'Fulham Wall', a landmark in [[The Boat Race]].

From the 2019-20 season, this stand is being demolished and rebuilt, which will expand the capacity of the ground to around 29,600. It is due for completion for the beginning of the 2021-22 season. On 26 November 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2019/november/26/chairman-provides-riverside-stand-update|title=Chairman Provides Riverside Stand Update|website=fulhamfc.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Chairman Shahid Khan provided an update in which it was announced that the new development will be known as Fulham Pier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fulhampier.com/|title=Savour the day at Fulham Pier|website=https://fulhampier.com|access-date=2020-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; a destination venue outside of match-day use.

The exterior facing Stevenage Road has a brick façade&lt;ref name=&quot;pies&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flickr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/25645678@N06/sets/72157621791140557/detail/ |title=Craven Cottage Fulham FC Inside &amp; Out |publisher=Flickr |date=1 August 2009|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features the club's old emblem in the artwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;flickr&quot; /&gt; Decorative pillars show the club's foundation date as 1880 though this is thought to be incorrect. Also, a special stone to commemorate the supporters' fund-raising group Fulham 2000, and The Cottagers' return to Craven Cottage, was engraved on the façade.&lt;ref name=&quot;flickr&quot; /&gt; The family enclosures are located in the two corners of the stand, one nearest to the Hammersmith End and one nearest to the Putney End.&lt;ref name=&quot;terrace&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;visiting&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/tickets/-/media/Tickets/Season%20Tickets/2013-14/Family%20Zone%20Season%20Ticket.ashx |title=Family Zone Season Tickets |publisher=Fulham F.C.|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front of the stand now contains plastic seating, but originally was a standing area. Children were often placed at the front of this enclosure and the area had a distinctive white picket fence to keep fans off the pitch up until the 1970s.

===The Pavilion===
[[File:Fulham Football Club, Craven Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 577769.jpg|thumb|right|The Pavilion from outside the stadium]]
The Cottage Pavilion dates back to 1905 along with the [[Johnny Haynes]] Stand,&lt;ref name=&quot;officialwebsite&quot; /&gt; built by renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]].&lt;ref name=&quot;officialwebsite&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/june/away-day-guide-fulham/ |title=Away Day Guide: Fulham |publisher=Crystal Palace F.C. |date=29 July 2013|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being the changing rooms, the Cottage (also called The Clubhouse) is traditionally used by the players' families and friends who sit on the balcony to watch the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;terrace&quot; /&gt; In the past, board meetings used to be held in The Cottage itself as well. There is a large tapestry draped from the Cottage which says &quot;Still Believe&quot;.
