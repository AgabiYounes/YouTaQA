The '''Yangtze''' or '''Yangzi''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|j|æ|ŋ|t|s|i}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɑː|ŋ|t|s|i}}) is the longest [[list of rivers of Asia|river in Asia]], the [[list of rivers by length|third-longest]] in the world and the longest in the world to flow entirely within one country. It rises in the northern part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and flows {{cvt|6300|km|mi}} in a generally easterly direction to the [[East China Sea]]. It is the [[List of rivers by discharge|sixth-largest river by discharge volume in the world]].

The Yangtze has played a major role in the [[history of China|history]], [[culture of China|culture]] and [[economy of China]]. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking and war.  The prosperous [[Yangtze River Delta]] generates as much as 20% of the [[Historical GDP of the People's Republic of China|PRC's GDP]].

====''Chang Jiang'' – &quot;Long River&quot;====
'''''Chang Jiang''''' ({{zh|labels=no|s=长江 |t=長江}}) is the modern Chinese name for the lower {{convert|2884|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the Yangtze from its confluence with the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]] at [[Yibin]] in Sichuan to the river mouth at Shanghai.  ''Chang Jiang'' literally means the &quot;Long River.&quot;  In [[Old Chinese]], this stretch of the Yangtze was simply called ''Jiang/Kiang''   {{lang|zh|江}},&lt;ref name=baxjiang&gt;Baxter, Wm. H. &amp; Sagart, Laurent.

''Krong'' was probably a word in the [[Austroasiatic]] language of local peoples such as the [[Baiyue|Yue]]. Similar to ''*krong'' in [[Proto-Vietnamese]] and ''krung'' in [[Mon language|Mon]], all meaning &quot;river,&quot; it is related to [[Vietnamese language|modern Vietnamese]] ''sông'' (river) and [[Khmer language|Khmer]] ''kôngkea'' (water).&lt;ref&gt;Philipsen, Philip.

By the [[Han dynasty]], ''Jiang'' had come to mean ''any'' river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the &quot;Great River&quot; {{lang|zh|大江}} ({{transl|zh|Dàjiāng}}).  The epithet {{lang|zh-hant|長}} ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified version]] {{lang|zh-hans|长}}), means &quot;long,&quot; was first formally applied to the river during the [[Six Dynasties]] period.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Various sections of ''Chang Jiang'' have local names. From Yibin to [[Yichang]], the river through Sichuan and [[Chongqing Municipality]] is also known as the '''''Chuan Jiang''''' ({{zh|labels=no|c=川江 |p=Chuān Jiāng}}) or &quot;[[Sichuan River]].&quot;

In [[Hubei]], the river is also called the '''''Jing Jiang''''' ({{zh|labels=no|s=荆江 |p=Jīngjiāng}}) or the &quot;Jing River&quot; after [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jingzhou]].  In [[Anhui]], the river takes on the local name '''''Wan Jiang''''' after the shorthand name for Anhui, {{transl|zh|wǎn}} (皖).  And '''''Yangzi Jiang''''' ({{zh|labels=no|first=t|t=揚子江 |s=扬子江 |p=Yángzǐjiāng}}) or the &quot;Yangzi River,&quot; from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yangzhou]]. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called Yangzi or Yangzijin ({{zh|labels=no|t=揚子 / 揚子津 |p=Yángzǐ'' / ''Yángzǐjīn}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=An |first1=Min (安民) |url=http://www.yznews.com.cn/yzwb/html/2010-001/23/content_92703.html |script-title=zh:《夜晤扬子津》 |trans-title=Yangtze Ferry |website=yznews.com.cn |date=January 23, 2010 |language=zh-hans}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans who arrived in the [[Yangtze River Delta]] region applied this [[endonym|local name]] to the whole river.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamieson 1911, p. 903&quot;/&gt; The dividing site between upstream and [[midstream]] is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at [[Hukou County|Hukou]] ([[Jiujiang]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

From antiquity until the [[Ming dynasty]], this stretch of the river was believed to be a [[tributary]] of the Yangtze while the Min River was thought to be the main course of the river above Yibin.  In the [[Yu Gong]], written in the fifth century BCE, this section is called the ''Hei Shui'' {{lang|zh|黑水}}  or the &quot;Black Water.&quot;  The name &quot;Jinsha&quot; originates in the [[Song dynasty]] when the river attracted large numbers of gold prospectors.

==Geography==
[[File:Map of the Yangtze River.gif|thumb|320px|Yangtze drainage basin]]
[[File:TroyParfitt2.JPG|thumb|right|Cruise on the Yangtze River before sunset]]
The river originates from several tributaries in the eastern part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], two of which are commonly referred to as the &quot;source.&quot;  Traditionally, the Chinese government has recognized the source as the Tuotuo tributary at the base of a glacier lying on the west of [[Geladandong]] Mountain in the [[Tanggula Mountains]].  This source is found at {{coord|33|25|44|N|91|10|57|E|display=inline}} and while not the furthest source of the Yangtze, it is the highest source at {{cvt|5342|m|ft}} above sea level.  The true source of the Yangtze, hydrologically the longest river distance from the sea, is at Jari Hill at the head of the Dam Qu tributary, approximately {{cvt|325|km|mi}} southeast of Geladandong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winchester|first1=Simon|title=The River at the Center of the World|date=1996|publisher=[[Henry Holt (publisher)|Henry Holt]]|isbn=978-0-8050-3888-0|title-link=The River at the Center of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; This source was only discovered in the late 20th century and lies in wetlands at {{coord|32|36|14|N|94|30|44|E|display=inline}} and {{cvt|5170|m|ft}} above sea level just southeast of Chadan Township in [[Zadoi County]], [[Yushu Prefecture]], Qinghai.&lt;ref&gt;Wong How Man (2005) [http://www.cers.org.hk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=27&amp;layout=blog&amp;Itemid=61 New and longer Yangtze source discovered.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028215804/http://www.cers.org.hk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=61 |date=October 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the historical spiritual source of the Yangtze, the Geladandong source is still commonly referred to as the source of the Yangtze since the discovery of the Jari Hill source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winchester&quot; /&gt;

These tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through [[Qinghai]] (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of [[Sichuan]] (Szechwan) and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] to reach [[Yunnan]]. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above {{convert|5000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} to less than {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The headwaters of the Yangtze are situated at an elevation of about {{convert|4900|m|abbr=on|sp=us}}. In its descent to sea level, the river falls to an altitude of {{convert|305|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} at Yibin, Sichuan, the head of navigation for riverboats, and to {{convert|192|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} at Chongqing (Chungking). Between Chongqing and Yichang (I-ch'ang), at an altitude of {{convert|40|m|abbr=on|sp=us}} and a distance of about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}}, it passes through the spectacular [[Yangtze Gorges]], which are noted for their natural beauty but are dangerous to shipping.

It enters the basin of Sichuan at [[Yibin]]. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through [[Mount Wushan]] bordering [[Chongqing]] and [[Hubei]] to create the famous [[Three Gorges]]. Eastward of the Three Gorges, [[Yichang]] is the first city on the [[Yangtze Plain]].

After entering Hubei, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is [[Dongting Lake]], which is located on the border of [[Hunan]] and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At [[Wuhan]], it receives its biggest tributary, the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]], bringing water from its northern basin as far as [[Shaanxi]].

At the northern tip of Jiangxi, [[Lake Poyang]], the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]], receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the [[East China Sea]] at Shanghai.

Four of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to [[Hukou County]], where [[Lake Poyang]] meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.

The Yangtze flows into the [[East China Sea]] and was navigable by ocean-going vessels up {{convert|1000|mi|km}} from its mouth even before the Three Gorges Dam was built.{{dubious|Originally navigable 1000 miles...|date=April 2015}}

The Yangtze is flanked with metallurgical, power, chemical, auto, building materials and machinery industrial belts and high-tech development zones. It is playing an increasingly crucial role in the river valley's economic growth and has become a vital link for international shipping to the inland provinces. The river is a major transportation artery for China, connecting the interior with the coast.

The river is one of the world's busiest waterways. Traffic includes commercial traffic transporting bulk goods such as coal as well as manufactured goods and passengers. Cargo transportation reached 795 million tons in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/23/content_4089542.htm|title=Xinhua – English|access-date=February 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112125023/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/23/content_4089542.htm|archive-date=January 12, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/04/content_4133140.htm|title=Xinhua – English|access-date=February 7, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012210352/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/04/content_4133140.htm|archive-date=October 12, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; River cruises several days long, especially through the beautiful and scenic [[Three Gorges]] area, are becoming popular as the tourism industry grows in China.

Flooding along the river has been a major problem. The [[Wet season|rainy season]] in China is May and June in areas south of Yangtze River, and July and August in areas north of it. The huge river system receives water from both southern and northern flanks, which causes its flood season to extend from May to August. Meanwhile, the relatively dense population and rich cities along the river make the floods more deadly and costly. The most recent major floods were the [[1998 Yangtze River Floods]], but more disastrous were the [[1954 Yangtze River Floods]], which killed around 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Yangtze-River-floods|title=Yangtze River floods|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=January 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121000619/https://www.britannica.com/science/Yangtze-River-floods|archive-date=January 21, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geologic history ===
Although the mouth of the [[Yellow River]] has fluctuated widely north and south of the [[Shandong peninsula]] within the historical record, the Yangtze has remained largely static. Based on studies of [[deposition (geology)|sedimentation rates]], however, it is unlikely that the present discharge site predates the [[late Miocene]] ({{c.|lk=no|11}} [[megaannum|Ma]]).&lt;ref&gt;Métivier, F. &amp; al. &quot;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1999GeoJI.137..280M Mass Accumulation Rates in Asia During the Cenozoic] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327165948/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1999GeoJI.137..280M |date=March 27, 2019 }}.&quot; ''[[Geophysical Journal International]]'', Vol. 137, No. 2, p. 314. 1999.

[[File:Streitende-Reiche2.jpg|thumb|A map of the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] around 350 BC, showing the former coastline of the Yangtze delta.]]
In the lower Yangtze, two [[Baiyue|Yue]] tribes, the ''[[Gouwu]]'' in southern [[Jiangsu]] and the ''[[Yuyue]]'' in northern [[Zhejiang]], display increasing Zhou (i.e., North Chinese) influence from the 9th century&amp;nbsp;BC. Traditional accounts&lt;ref&gt;For example, in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; credit these changes to northern refugees ([[Wu Taibo|Taibo]] and [[Zhongyong of Wu|Zhongyong]] in Wu and [[Wuyi of Yue|Wuyi]] in Yue) who assumed power over the local tribes, though these are generally assumed to be myths invented to legitimate them to other Zhou rulers. As the kingdoms of [[state of Wu|Wu]] and [[state of Yue|Yue]], they were famed as fishers, shipwrights, and sword-smiths. Adopting [[Chinese characters]], political institutions, and military technology, they were among the most powerful [[Ancient Chinese states|states]] during the later [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]]. In the middle Yangtze, the [[state of Jing]] seems to have begun in the upper Han River valley a minor Zhou polity, but it adapted to native culture as it expanded south and east into the Yangtze valley. In the process, it changed its name to [[state of Chu|Chu]].&lt;ref&gt;Lothar von Falkenhausen, Chinese Society in the Age of Confucius (1000–250 BC): The Archaeological Evidence (Los Angeles: Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, 2006), 262–88; Constance A. Cook and John S. Major, eds. Defining Chu: Image and Reality in Ancient China (Honolulu: University of Hawaiʻi Press, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether native or nativizing, the Yangtze states held their own against the northern Chinese homeland: some lists credit them with three of the [[Spring and Autumn period]]'s [[Five Hegemons]] and one of the [[Warring States]]' [[Four Lords of the Warring States|Four Lords]]. They fell in against themselves, however. Chu's growing power led its rival [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] to support Wu as a counter. Wu successfully sacked Chu's capital [[Ying (Chu)|Ying]] in 506&amp;nbsp;BC, but Chu subsequently supported Yue in its attacks against Wu's southern flank. In 473&amp;nbsp;BC, [[King Goujian of Yue]] fully annexed Wu and moved his court to its [[Wu (city)|eponymous capital]] at modern Suzhou. In 333&amp;nbsp;BC, Chu finally united the lower Yangtze by annexing Yue, whose royal family was said to have fled south and established the [[Minyue]] kingdom in [[Fujian]]. [[state of Qin|Qin]] was able to unite China by first subduing [[state of Ba|Ba]] and [[state of Shu|Shu]] on the upper Yangtze in modern [[Sichuan]], giving them a strong base to attack Chu's settlements along the river.

The state of Qin conquered the central Yangtze region, previous heartland of Chu, in 278 BC, and incorporated the region into its expanding empire. Qin then used its connections along the Yangtze River the [[Xiang River]] to expand China into [[Hunan]], Jiangxi and [[Guangdong]], setting up military commanderies along the main lines of communication. At the [[collapse of the Qin Dynasty]], these southern commanderies became the independent [[Nanyue Empire]] under [[Zhao Tuo]] while Chu and Han [[Chu-Han Contention|vied with each other]] for control of the north.

From the [[Han dynasty]], the region of the Yangtze River became more and more important to China's economy. The establishment of irrigation systems (the most famous one is [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System|Dujiangyan]], northwest of Chengdu, built during the [[Warring States]] period) made agriculture very stable and productive. The Qin and Han empires were actively engaged in the agricultural colonization of the Yangtze lowlands, maintaining a system of dikes to protect farmland from seasonal floods.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Lander, &quot;State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region.&quot; T'oung Pao 100.4–5 (2014): 325–362.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Song dynasty, the area along the Yangtze had become among the wealthiest and most developed parts of the country, especially in the lower reaches of the river. Early in the Qing dynasty, the region called [[Jiangnan]] (that includes the southern part of [[Jiangsu]], the northern part of [[Zhejiang]], and the southeastern part of [[Anhui]]) provided {{frac|1|3}}–{{frac|1|2}} of the nation's revenues.

The Yangtze has long been the backbone of China's inland water transportation system, which remained particularly important for almost two thousand years, until the construction of the national railway network during the 20th century. The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the [[Jiangnan]] region south of the river ([[Wuxi]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]]) and with northern China (all the way from [[Yangzhou]] to Beijing). The less well known ancient [[Lingqu Canal]], connecting the upper [[Xiang River]] with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the [[Pearl River Delta]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ Lingqu Canal (Xiang'an County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qin Dynasty)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228071501/http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5339/ |date=February 28, 2019 }} (Nomination for the UNESCO Heritage List)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Yangtze became the political boundary between north China and south China several times (see [[History of China]]) because of the difficulty of crossing the river. This occurred notably during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], and the [[Southern Song]]. Many battles took place along the river, the most famous being the [[Battle of Red Cliffs]] in 208 AD during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

The Yangtze was the site of naval battles between the [[Song dynasty]] and [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin]] during the [[Jin–Song wars]]. In the [[Battle of Caishi]] of 1161, the ships of the Jin emperor [[Wanyan Liang]] clashed with the [[Naval history of China|Song fleet]] on the Yangtze. Song soldiers fired bombs of lime and sulphur using trebuchets at the Jurchen warships. The battle was a Song victory that halted the invasion by the Jin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jing-shen|last=Tao|chapter=A Tyrant on the Yangtze: The Battle of T'sai-shih in 1161|title=Excursions in Chinese Culture|year=2002|publisher=Chinese University Press|isbn=978-962-201-915-7|pages=149–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Needham|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Military technology: The Gunpowder Epic, Volume 5, Part 7|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-30358-3|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Tangdao]] was another Yangtze naval battle from the same year.

Politically, [[Nanjing]] was the capital of China several times, although most of the time its territory only covered the southeastern part of China, such as the [[Eastern Wu|Wu kingdom]] in the Three Kingdoms period, the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]], and during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] and [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] periods. Only the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] occupied most parts of China from their capital at [[Nanjing]], though it later moved the capital to Beijing. The [[Republic of China|ROC]] capital was located in [[Nanjing]] in the periods 1911–12, 1927–37, and 1945–49.

=== Age of steam ===
{{Main|Steamboats on the Yangtze River|China Station}}

The first merchant steamer in China, the ''Jardine'', was built to order for the firm of [[Jardine Matheson Holdings|Jardine Matheson]] in 1835. She was a small vessel intended for use as a mail and passenger carrier between [[Lintin Island]], Macau and [[Whampoa Dock|Whampoa]]. However, after several trips, the Chinese authorities, for reasons best known to themselves, prohibited her entrance into the river. [[Lord Palmerston]], the British Foreign Secretary who personified [[gunboat diplomacy]], decided to wage war on China mainly on the &quot;suggestions&quot; of Jardine Matheson{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In mid-1840, a large fleet of warships appeared on the China coast, and with the first cannon fire aimed at a British ship, the ''Royal Saxon'', the British started the [[First Opium War]]. The Imperial Government, forced to surrender, gave in to the demands of the British. British military was vastly superior during the conflict. British warships, constructed using such innovations as steam power combined with sail and the use of iron in shipbuilding, wreaked havoc on coastal towns; such ships (like the ''[[Nemesis (1839)|Nemesis]]'') were not only virtually indestructible using contemporary available weapons, but also highly mobile and able to support a gun platform with very heavy guns. In addition, the British troops were armed with modern rifled muskets and cannons, unlike the Qing forces. After the British took [[Guangzhou|Canton]], they sailed up the Yangtze and took the tax barges, a devastating blow to the Empire as it slashed the revenue of the imperial court in Beijing to just a small fraction of what it had been.

In 1842, the Qing authorities sued for peace, which concluded with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] signed on a gunboat in the river, negotiated in August of that year and ratified in 1843. In the treaty, China was forced to pay an indemnity to Britain, open five ports to Britain, and cede Hong Kong to [[Queen Victoria]]. In the supplementary Treaty of the Bogue, the Qing empire also recognized Britain as an equal to China and gave British subjects extraterritorial privileges in treaty ports.

=== U.S. and French conflicts ===
The US, at the same time, wanting to protect its interests and expand trade, ventured the {{USS|Wachusett|1861|6}} six hundred miles up the river to [[Hankou District|Hankow]] sometime in the 1860s, while the {{USS|Ashuelot|1865|6}}, a sidewheeler, made her way up the river to [[Yichang]] in 1874. The first {{USS|Monocacy|1864|6}}, a sidewheel gunboat, began charting the Yangtze River in 1871. The first {{USS|Palos|1865|6}}, an armed tug, was on [[Asiatic Squadron|Asiatic Station]] into 1891, cruising the Chinese and Japanese coasts, visiting the open treaty ports and making occasional voyages up the Yangtze River. From June to September 1891, anti-foreign riots up the Yangtze forced the warship to make an extended voyage as far as [[Hankou]], 600 miles upriver. Stopping at each open treaty port, the gunboat cooperated with naval vessels of other nations and repairing damage. She then operated along the north and central China coast and on the lower Yangtze until June 1892. The cessation of bloodshed with the [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Europeans]] put more steamers on the river. The French engaged the Chinese in war over the rule of [[Vietnam]]. The [[Sino-French War]]s of the 1880s emerged with the [[Battle of Shipu]] having French cruisers in the lower Yangtze.
[[File:USSLuzonPG-7.jpg|left|thumb|[[USS Luzon (PG-47)|USS ''Luzon'']]]]
[[The China Navigation Company]] was an early shipping company founded in 1876 in London, initially to trade up the Yangtze River from their Shanghai base with passengers and cargo. Chinese coastal trade started shortly after and in 1883 a regular service to Australia was initiated. Most of the company's ships were seized by Japan in 1941 and services did not resume until 1946. [[Robert Dollar]] was a later shipping magnate, who became enormously influential moving Californian and Canadian lumber to the Chinese and Japanese market.

[[Yichang]], or Ichang, {{convert|1600|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the sea, is the head of navigation for river steamers; oceangoing vessels may navigate the river to [[Hankow]], a distance of almost {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} from the sea. For about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on|sp=us}} inland from its mouth, the river is virtually at sea level.

The Chinese Government, too, had steamers. It had its own naval fleet, the [[Nanyang Fleet]], which fell prey to the French fleet. The Chinese would rebuild its fleet, only to be ravaged by another war with [[First Sino-Japanese War|Japan (1895)]], [[Xinhai Revolution|Revolution (1911)]] and ongoing inefficiency and corruption. Chinese companies ran their own steamers, but were second tier to European operations at the time.

Steamers came late to the upper river, the section stretching from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But summer was better navigationally and the [[three gorges]], described as an &quot;150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass,&quot; posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 – 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70–80 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver through some of the most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman P. Van Slyke, ''Yangtze, ''Nature'', History and the River'', Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., Massachusetts, 1988, p.18-19 and 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the [[Chefoo Convention]] opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built ''Kuling'' but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes.  ''Kuling'' was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service.  In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade as long as it was restricted to native crafts.  In 1895, the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade.  Little took up residence in Chongqing and built ''Leechuan'', to tackle the gorges in 1898.  In March ''Leechuan'' completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers.  ''Leechuan'' was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 170-172.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, Little persuaded Captain [[Samuel Cornell Plant]] to come out to China to lend his expertise.  Captain Plant had just completed navigation of [[Iran|Persia]]'s Upper [[Karun River]] and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on ''Leechuan'' at the end of 1898. With Plant's design input, Little had SS ''Pioneer'' built with Plant in command.  In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing.  ''Pioneer'' was sold to [[British Royal Navy]] after its first run due to threat from the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and renamed HMS ''Kinsha''.  Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS ''Suixing'' ended in catastrophe.  On ''Suixing's'' maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze.  In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing.  Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS ''Shutung'' and SS ''Shuhun''. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too.  Plant was appointed by [[Chinese Maritime Customs Service]] as First Senior River Inspector in 1915.  In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems.  He also wrote ''Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River'', a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction.  Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze.  Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, [[Jardine Matheson]], [[Butterfield and Swire]] and [[Standard Oil]] added their own steamers on the river between 1917 and 1919.  Between 1918 and 1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shih Brandmeyer | first1 = Polly | year = 2014 | title = Cornell Plant, Lost Girls and Recovered Lives – Sino-British Relations at the Human Level in Late Qing and Early Republican China | url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | journal = Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch | volume = 54 | pages = 106–110 | access-date = April 13, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180811112513/https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=875703566361829;res=IELHSS | archive-date = August 11, 2018 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shutung'' was commandeered by warlords and ''Shuhun'' was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Returns of Trade and Trade Reports 1918,&quot; ''China – The Maritime Customs'', published by Order of the Inspector General of Customs.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation.  The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots.  In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners.  One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English.  Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simpson, &quot;Hell and High Water,&quot; ''South China Morning Post Magazine'', October 2, 2011, p.24-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plant Memorial Brochure, March 20, 1923, ''National Maritime Museum'', Greenwich, Archive Collection, &quot;Papers of Capt.

Until 1881, the [[India]] and China coastal and river services were operated by several companies. In that year, however, these were merged into the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company Ltd, a public company under the management of Jardine's. The Jardine company pushed inland up the Yangtsze River on which a specially designed fleet was built to meet all requirements of the river trade. For many years, this fleet gave unequalled service. Jardine's established an enviable reputation for the efficient handling of shipping. As a result, the [[Royal Mail Steam Packet Company]] invited the firm to attend to the Agency of their Shire Line which operated in the Far East. Standard Oil ran the tankers Mei Ping, Mei An and Mei Hsia, which were all destroyed on December 12, 1937, when Japanese warplanes bombed and sank the U.S.S. Panay. One of the Standard Oil captains who survived this attack had served on the Upper River for 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;Mender, P., Thirty Years A Mariner in the Far East 1907–1937, The Memoirs of Peter Mender, A Standard Oil Ship Captain on China's Yangtze River, p.53, {{ISBN|978-1-60910-498-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navy ships===

{{see also|USS Asheville (PG-21)|Yangtze Patrol|Yangtze Incident}}
With the [[Treaty Ports]], the [[Great power|European powers]] and Japan were allowed to sail navy ships into China's waters. The British, Americans, and French did this. A full international fleet featured on Chinese waters: [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[German Empire|German]] navy ships came to Shanghai and the treaty ports. The Japanese engaged in open warfare with the Chinese over conquest of the Chinese [[Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894–1895, and with Russia over Qing Empire territory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905. Incidentally, both the [[French Navy|French]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] navies were heavily involved in running [[opium]] and [[narcotics]] to Shanghai, where it was refined into [[morphine]]. It was then transhipped by liner back to [[Marseille]] and France (i.e. [[French Connection]]) for processing in [[German Empire|Germany]] and eventual sale in the U.S. or Europe.

In 1909 the gunboat {{USS|Samar|PG-41|6}} changed station to Shanghai, where she regularly patrolled the lower Yangtze River up to [[Nanking]] and Wuhu. Following an anti-foreign riots in [[Changsha]] in April 1910, which destroyed a number of missions and merchant warehouses, Samar sailed up the Yangtze River to [[Hankow]] and then Changsa to show the flag and help restore order. The gunboat was also administratively assigned to the [[Asiatic Fleet]] that year, which had been reestablished by the Navy to better protect, in the words of the Bureau of Navigation, &quot;American interests in the Orient.&quot; After returning to Shanghai in August, she sailed up river again the following summer, passing Wuhu in June but then running aground off Kichau on July 1, 1911.

After staying stuck in the mud for two weeks, Samar broke free and sailed back down river to coal ship. Returning upriver, the gunboat reached Hankow in August and [[Ichang]] in September where she wintered over owing to both the dry season and the outbreak of rebellion at [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] in October 1911. Tensions eased and the gunboat turned downriver in July 1912, arriving at Shanghai in October. Samar patrolled the lower Yangtze after fighting broke out in the summer 1913, a precursor to a decade of conflict between provincial [[warlord]]s in China. In 1919, she was placed on the disposal list at Shanghai following a collision with a Yangtze River steamer that damaged her bow.

The Spanish boats were replaced in the 1920s by {{USS|Luzon|PG-47|6}} and {{USS|Mindanao|PR-8|6}} were the largest, {{USS|Oahu|PR-6|6}} and {{USS|Panay|PR-5|6}} next in size, and {{USS|Guam|PG-43|6}} and {{USS|Tutuila|PG-44|6}} the smallest. China in the first fifty years of the 20th century, was in low-grade chaos. Warlords, revolutions, natural disasters, civil war and invasions contributed. Yangtze boats were involved in the [[Nanking incident of 1927]] when the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalists]] broke into open war. The [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacre of the Communists]] in Shanghai in 1927 furthered the unrest, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with tanks were landed. River steamers were popular targets for both Nationalists and Communists, and peasants who would take periodic pot-shots at vessels. During the course of service the second {{USS|Palos|PG-16|6}} protected American interests in China down the entire length of the Yangtze, at times convoying U.S. and foreign vessels on the river, evacuating American citizens during periods of disturbance and in general giving credible presence to U.S. consulates and residences in various Chinese cities. In the period of great unrest in central China in the 1920s, Palos was especially busy patrolling the upper Yangtze against bands of warlord soldiers and outlaws. The warship engaged in continuous patrol operations between Ichang and [[Chongqing|Chungking]] throughout 1923, supplying armed guards to merchant ships, and protecting Americans at Chungking while that city was under siege by a warlord army.

The British [[Royal Navy]] had a series of [[Insect-class gunboat]]s which patrolled between Chungking and Shanghai. Cruisers and destroyers and [[Fly-class gunboat]]s{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} also patrolled. The most infamous incident was when ''Panay'' and {{HMS|Bee|1915|6}} in 1937, were dive-bombed by Japanese aeroplanes during the notorious [[Nanking massacre]]. The Westerners were forced to leave the Yangtze River with the Japanese takeover in 1941. The former steamers were either sabotaged or pressed into Japanese or Chinese service. Probably the most curious incident involved {{HMS|Amethyst|F116|6}} in 1949 during the [[Chinese Civil War]] between [[Kuomintang]] and [[People's Liberation Army]] forces; and led to the award of the [[Dickin Medal]] to the ship's cat [[Simon (cat)|Simon]].

===Periodic floods===
{{See also|List of deadliest floods}}
Tens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.

The [[1931 China floods|1931 Central China floods]] or the Central China floods of 1931 were a series of floods that occurred in the Republic of China. The floods are generally considered among the deadliest natural disasters ever recorded, and almost certainly the deadliest of the 20th century (when pandemics and famines are discounted). Estimates of the total death toll range from 145,000 to between 3.7&amp;nbsp;million and 4 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/flood/deluge.html &quot;Dealing with the Deluge&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318015234/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/flood/deluge.html |date=March 18, 2010 }}.

Island Press. {{ISBN|1-55963-919-9}}. p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yangtze again flooded in [[1935 Yangtze flood|1935]], causing great loss of life.

From June to September 1954, the [[1954 Yangtze River floods|Yangtze River Floods]] were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. Despite efforts to open three important flood gates to alleviate the rising water by diverting it, the flood level continued to rise until it hit the historic high of 44.67 m in Jingzhou, Hubei and 29.73 m in Wuhan. The number of dead from this flood was estimated at around 33,000, including those who died of plague in the aftermath of the disaster.

The [[1998 Yangtze River floods]] were a series of major floods that lasted from middle of June to the beginning of September 1998 along the Yangtze.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web |website=Chinanews.com.cn |url=http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130101151742/http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/special/guoqing/60/2009/06-25/127.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 1, 2013 |script-title=zh:98年特大洪水 |accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degradation of the river ===
{{See also|Water resources in China#Water quality}}
[[File:Yangtze-Ships.JPG|right|thumb|Barges on the river.]]

Beginning in the 1950s dams and thousands of kilometres of dikes were built for flood control, land reclamation, irrigation and for the control of diseases vectors such as [[blood fluke]]s that caused [[Schistosomiasis]]. More than a hundred lakes were thus cut off from the main river.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWF UK&quot;/&gt; There were gates between the lakes that could be opened during floods. However, farmers and settlements encroached on the land next to the lakes although it was forbidden to settle there. When floods came, it proved impossible to open the gates since it would have caused substantial destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ma|first=Jun|title=China's Water Crisis|publisher=International Rivers Network|pages=55–56|year=2004|isbn=978-1891936272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the lakes partially or completely dried up. For example, [[Baidang Lake]] shrunk from {{convert|100|km2|sp=us}} in the 1950s to {{convert|40|km2|sp=us}} in 2005. [[Zhangdu Lake]] dwindled to one quarter of its original size. Natural fisheries output in the two lakes declined sharply. Only a few large lakes, such as [[Poyang Lake]] and [[Dongting Lake]], remained connected to the Yangtze. Cutting off the other lakes that had served as natural buffers for floods increased the damage done by floods further downstream. Furthermore, the natural flow of migratory fish was obstructed and biodiversity across the whole basin decreased dramatically. Intensive farming of fish in ponds spread using one type of [[carp]] who thrived in [[Eutrophication|eutrophic]] water conditions and who feeds on algae, causing widespread pollution. The pollution was exacerbated by the discharge of waste from pig farms as well as of untreated industrial and municipal sewage.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWF UK&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lakes reunited&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = [[China Daily]] |title = Isolated Yangtze lakes reunited with mother river |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |accessdate = October 25, 2011 |date = July 12, 2005 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140830212154/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200507/12/eng20050712_195638.html |archive-date = August 30, 2014 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, the Yangtze river near Chongqing turned red from pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = [[ABC News]] |title = Yangtze River Turns Red and Turns Up a Mystery |url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |accessdate = October 28, 2012 |date = September 7, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121112170920/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/09/yangtze-river-turns-red-and-turns-up-a-mystery/ |archive-date = November 12, 2012 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The erection of the Three Gorges Dam has created an impassable &quot;iron barrier&quot; that has led to a great reduction in the biodiversity of the river. Yangtze sturgeon use seasonal changes in the flow of the river to signal when is it time to migrate. However, these seasonal changes will be greatly reduced by dams and diversions. Other animals facing immediate threat of extinction are the [[baiji dolphin]], [[narrow-ridged finless porpoise]] and the [[Yangtze alligator]]. These animals numbers went into freefall from the combined effects of accidental catches during fishing, river traffic, habitat loss and pollution. In 2006 the baiji dolphin became extinct; the world lost an entire genus.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Wohl. A World of Rivers, pg 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contribution to ocean pollution ===
The Yangtze River produces more ocean [[plastic pollution]] than any other, according to [[The Ocean Cleanup]], a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution. Together with 9 other rivers, the Yangtze transports 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Almost all plastic in the ocean comes from just 10 rivers – 30.11.2017 | website=DW.COM | url=https://www.dw.com/en/almost-all-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-just-10-rivers/a-41581484 | ref={{sfnref | DW.COM}} | access-date=August 22, 2018 | quote=about 90 percent of all the plastic that reaches the world's oceans gets flushed through just 10 rivers: The Yangtze, the Indus, Yellow River, Hai River, the Nile, the Ganges, Pearl River, Amur River, the Niger, and the Mekong (in that order). | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822181401/https://www.dw.com/en/almost-all-plastic-in-the-ocean-comes-from-just-10-rivers/a-41581484 | archive-date=August 22, 2018 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schmidt | first=Christian | last2=Krauth | first2=Tobias | last3=Wagner | first3=Stephan | title=Export of Plastic Debris by Rivers into the Sea | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume=51 | issue=21 | date=October 11, 2017 | issn=0013-936X | doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b02368 | pmid=29019247 | pages=12246–12253 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconnecting lakes ===
In 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were [[Zhangdu Lake]], [[Honghu Lake]], and [[Tian'e-Zhou]] in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in [[Anhui]] was also reconnected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lakes reunited&quot; /&gt;

Reconnecting the lakes improved water quality and fish were able to migrate from the river into the lake, replenishing their numbers and genetic stock. The trial also showed that reconnecting the lake reduced flooding. The new approach also benefitted the farmers economically. Pond farmers switched to natural fish feed, which helped them breed better-quality fish that can be sold for more, increasing their income by 30%. Based on the successful pilot project, other provincial governments emulated the experience and also reestablished connections to lakes that had previously been cut off from the river. In 2005 a Yangtze Forum has been established bringing together 13 riparian provincial governments to manage the river from source to sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=WWF China |title=The Yangtze Forum |url=http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091933/http://www.wwfchina.org/english/downloads/Yangtze%20Forum.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 China's Ministry of Agriculture made it a national policy to reconnect the Yangtze River with its lakes. As of 2010, provincial governments in five provinces and Shanghai set up a network of 40 effective protected areas, covering {{convert|16500|km2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. As a result, populations of 47 threatened species increased, including the critically endangered Yangtze alligator. In the Shanghai area, reestablished wetlands now protect drinking water sources for the city. It is envisaged to extend the network throughout the entire Yangtze to eventually cover 102 areas and {{convert|185000|km2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The mayor of [[Wuhan]] announced that six huge, stagnating urban lakes including the [[East Lake (Wuhan)]] would be reconnected at the cost of US$2.3&amp;nbsp;billion creating China's largest urban wetland landscape.&lt;ref name=&quot;WWF UK&quot;&gt;WWF UK Case Study 2011 / HSBC:Safeguarding the Yangtze.

==Crossings==
{{Main|Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Yangtze River power line crossings}}
{{GeoGroup|article=Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|articlee=Yangtze River bridges and tunnels}}
Until 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from [[Yibin]] to Shanghai.  For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry.  On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the ''[[Zhong’anlun Monument|Zhong’anlun]]'' disaster (October 15, 1945).

The river stood as a major geographic barrier dividing northern and southern China.  In the first half of the 20th century, rail passengers from Beijing to Guangzhou and Shanghai had to disembark, respectively, at [[Hanyang District|Hanyang]] and [[Pukou]], and cross the river by steam ferry before resuming journeys by train from [[Wuchang Railway Station|Wuchang]] or [[Nanjing West Railway Station|Nanjing West]].

After the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, Soviet engineers assisted in the design and construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], a dual-use [[list of road-rail bridges|road-rail bridge]], built from 1955 to 1957.  It was the first bridge across the Yangtze River.  The second bridge across the river that was built was a single-track railway bridge built upstream in Chongqing in 1959.  The [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], also a road-rail bridge, was the first bridge to cross the lower reaches of the Yangtze, in [[Nanjing]].  It was built after the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and did not receive foreign assistance.  Road-rail bridges were then built in [[Zhicheng]] (1971) and Chongqing (1980).

Bridge-building slowed in the 1980s before resuming in the 1990s and accelerating in the first decade of the 21st century.  The [[Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge]] was built in 1992 as part of the [[Jingjiu railway|Beijing-Jiujiang Railway]].  A [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|second bridge in Wuhan]] was completed in 1995.  By 2005, there were a total of 56 bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze River between Yibin and Shanghai.  These include some of the longest [[suspension bridge|suspension]] and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s in the world on the Yangtze Delta: [[Jiangyin Suspension Bridge]] (1,385 m, opened in 1999), [[Runyang Bridge]] (1,490 m, opened 2005), [[Sutong Bridge]] (1,088 m, opened 2008).  The rapid pace of bridge construction has continued.  The city of Wuhan now has six bridges and one tunnel across the Yangtze.

A number of [[Yangtze River power line crossings|power line crossings]] have also been built across the river.

[[File:Yangtze longitudinal profile upstream.JPG|thumb|right|Diagram showing dams planned for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River]]
As of 2007, there are two dams built on the Yangtze river: [[Three Gorges Dam]] and [[Gezhouba Dam]].
The Three Gorges Dam is the [[List of largest power stations|largest power station in the world]] by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW.
Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the [[Jinsha River]].
Among them, the [[Xiluodu Dam]] is the third largest power stations in the world, and the [[Baihetan Dam]], planned to be commissioned in 2021, will be the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.

==Tributaries==

The Yangtze River has a high [[species richness]], including many [[Endemism|endemics]]. A high percentage of these are seriously threatened by human activities.&lt;ref name=FishDiversity&gt;Ye, S.; Li, Z.; Liu, J;, Zhang, T.; and Xie, S. (2011). ''Distribution, Endemism and Conservation Status of Fishes in the Yangtze River Basin, China.'' pp. 41–66 in: Ecosystems Biodiversity, InTech. {{ISBN|978-953-307-417-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish===
[[File:Acipenser sinensis.JPG|thumb|The two [[sturgeon]] species in the Yangtze (here [[Chinese sturgeon]]) are both seriously threatened]]
{{As of|2011}}, 416 fish species are known from the Yangtze [[Drainage basin|basin]], including 362 that strictly are freshwater species. The remaining are also known from salt or [[brackish]] waters, such as the river's [[estuary]] or the [[East China Sea]]. This makes it one of the most species-rich rivers in Asia and by far the most species-rich in China (in comparison, the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] has almost 300 fish species and the [[Yellow River]] 160).&lt;ref name=FishDiversity/&gt; 178 fish species are endemic to the Yangtze River Basin.&lt;ref name=FishDiversity/&gt; Many are only found in some section of the river basin and especially the upper reach (above [[Yichang]], but below the headwaters in the [[Qinghai-Tibet Plateau]]) is rich with 279 species, including 147 Yangtze endemics and 97 strict endemics (found only in this part of the basin). In contrast, the headwaters, where the average altitude is above {{convert|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, are only home to 14 highly specialized species, but 8 of these are endemic to the river.&lt;ref name=FishDiversity/&gt; The largest orders in the Yangtze are [[Cypriniformes]] (280 species, including 150 endemics), [[Siluriformes]] (40 species, including 20 endemics), [[Perciformes]] (50 species, including 4 endemics), [[Tetraodontiformes]] (12 species, including 1 endemic) and [[Osmeriformes]] (8 species, including 1 endemic). No other order has more than four species in the river and one endemic.&lt;ref name=FishDiversity/&gt;

Many Yangtze fish species have declined drastically and 65 were recognized as [[Threatened species|threatened]] in the 2009 Chinese [[Regional Red List|red list]].&lt;ref name=ThreatenedFish&gt;Wang, S.; and Xie, Y. (2009). ''China species red list''. Vol. II Vertebrates – Part 1.
