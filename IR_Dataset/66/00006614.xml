{{nihongo foot|'''''Chrono Trigger'''''|クロノ・トリガー|Kurono Torigā|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 1995 [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] that began the [[Chrono (series)|''Chrono'' series]]. ''Chrono Trigger''{{'s}} [[Video game development|development]] team included three [[Video game designer|designers]] that Square dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;: [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], the creator of Square's successful ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series; [[Yuji Horii]], a freelance designer and creator of [[Enix]]'s popular ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series; and [[Akira Toriyama]], a [[manga]] artist famed for his work with ''Dragon Quest'' and ''[[Dragon Ball]]''. In addition, Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dream-team-name&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES | quote='''Keizo Kokubo:''' Well then, open the Gates to the Dream Team! ... / '''Developer's Ending:''' Cheers!

''Chrono Trigger'' was a critical and commercial success upon release, and is frequently cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine described aspects of ''Chrono Trigger'' as revolutionary, including its [[multiple endings]], plot-related [[Quest (gaming)|side-quests]] focusing on [[Character arc|character development]], unique battle system, and detailed [[Video game graphics|graphics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |date=July 1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chrono Trigger'' was the third best-selling game of 1995 in Japan,&lt;ref name=&quot;1995 sales&quot; /&gt; and shipped 2.65 million copies worldwide by March 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;square-sales&quot; /&gt;

Square released a ported version by [[Tose (company)|Tose]] in Japan for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999, which was later repackaged with a ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' port as ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'' (2001) for the North American market.

==Gameplay==
''Chrono Trigger'' features standard [[role-playing video game]] gameplay. The player controls the protagonist and his companions in the game's [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fictional universe|fictional world]], consisting of various forests, cities, and dungeons. Navigation occurs via an [[overworld]] map, depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Areas such as forests, cities, and similar places are depicted as more realistic scaled-down maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure [[item (gaming)|items]] and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. ''Chrono Trigger''{{'s}} gameplay deviates from that of traditional Japanese RPGs in that, rather than appearing in [[random encounter]]s, many enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party. Contact with enemies on a field map initiates a battle that occurs directly on the map rather than on a separate battle screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |date=July 1995 |volume=74 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Epic Center: Chrono Trigger |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChronoTriggerInside.PNG|thumb|left|Unlike most other role-playing games at the time, combat in ''Chrono Trigger'' occurs in the same area where general navigation occurs, with all enemies visible on screen.|alt=A wooded area rendered in the Super NES' graphics, two gray status bars (one at the top, one at the bottom of the screen), three &quot;Blue Imp&quot; enemies surrounding the character Crono in the middle of the area, Crono slashing at the topmost imp which has a surprised expression on its face]]

Players and enemies may use physical or magical attacks to wound targets during battle, and players may use items to heal or protect themselves. Each character and enemy has a certain number of [[hit point]]s; successful attacks reduce that character's hit points, which can be restored with potions and spells. When a playable character loses all hit points, they faint; if all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously [[saved game|saved]] chapter, except in specific storyline-related battles that allow or force the player to lose. Between battles, a player can equip their characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories that provide special effects (such as increased attack power or defense against magic), and various consumable items can be used both in and out of battles. Items and equipment can be purchased in shops or found on field maps, often in [[treasure chest (video games)|treasure chests]]. By exploring new areas and fighting enemies, players progress through ''Chrono Trigger''{{'s}} story.

''Chrono Trigger'' uses an [[Conditional Turn-Based Battle|Active Time Battle]] system—a staple of Square's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' game series designed by [[Hiroyuki Ito]] for ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—named &quot;Active Time Battle 2.0.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Battle 2.0&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co. | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES | quote='''Menu screen:''' Active Time Battle 2.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each character can take action in battle once a personal timer dependent on the character's speed [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]] counts to zero. Magic and special physical techniques are handled through a system called &quot;Techs.&quot; Techs deplete a character's [[magic point]]s (a numerical meter similar to hit points), and often have special areas of effect; some spells damage huddled monsters, while others can harm enemies spread in a line. Enemies often change positions during battle, creating opportunities for tactical Tech use. A unique feature of ''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Tech system is that numerous cooperative techniques exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview2&quot; /&gt; Each character receives eight personal Techs which can be used in conjunction with others' to create Double and Triple Techs for greater effect. For instance, Crono's sword-spinning ''Cyclone'' Tech can be combined with [[Lucca Ashtear|Lucca]]'s ''Flame Toss'' to create ''Flame Whirl''. When characters with compatible Techs have enough magic points available to perform their techniques, the game automatically displays the combo as an option.

''Chrono Trigger'' features several other distinct gameplay traits, including time travel. Players have access to seven eras of the game world's history, and past actions affect future events. Throughout history, players find new allies, complete side quests, and search for keynote villains. Time travel is accomplished via portals and pillars of light called &quot;time gates&quot;, as well as a [[time travel|time machine]] named ''Epoch''. The game contains thirteen unique endings; the ending the player receives depends on when and how they reach and complete the game's final battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;nppreview&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| volume=73 |date=June 1995 |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |title=Chrono Trigger: A New Standard for RPGs | pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chrono Trigger DS'' features a new ending that can be accessed from the End of Time upon completion of the final extra dungeon and optional final boss.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot;&gt;{{cite book|year=2009 |editor=Studio BentStuff |title=Chrono Trigger Ultimania |page=581 |language=Japanese |publisher=Square Enix |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Chrono_Trigger_Ultimania |isbn=978-4-7575-2469-9 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119231921/http://chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html |archivedate=November 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chrono Trigger'' also introduces a [[New Game Plus]] option; after completing the game, the player may begin a new game with the same character [[Experience point|levels]], [[Statistic (role-playing games)|techniques]], and equipment, excluding money, with which they ended the previous playthrough. However, certain items central to the storyline are removed and must be found again, such as the sword Masamune. Square has employed the New Game Plus concept in later games including ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', ''[[Parasite Eve (video game)|Parasite Eve]]'', ''[[Vagrant Story]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', and ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]''.

==Plot==

===Setting===
''Chrono Trigger'' takes place in a world similar to Earth, with eras such as the prehistoric age, in which primitive [[human]]s and dinosaurs share the earth; the [[Middle Ages]], replete with knights, monsters, and magic; and the [[apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future, where destitute humans and sentient robots struggle to survive. The characters frequently [[time travel|travel through time]] to obtain allies, gather equipment, and learn information to help them in their quest. The party also gains access to the End of Time (represented as year [[Infinity|∞]]), which serves as a hub to travel back to other time periods. The party eventually acquires a time-machine vehicle known as the ''Wings of Time,'' nicknamed the ''Epoch.'' The vehicle is capable of time travel between any time period without first having to travel to the End of Time.

===Characters===
{{main|Characters of Chrono Trigger}}
''Chrono Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s six playable characters (plus one optional character) come from different eras of history. ''Chrono Trigger'' begins in AD 1000 with [[Crono (Chrono Trigger)|Crono]], [[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]], and [[Lucca Ashtear|Lucca]]. Crono is the silent protagonist, characterized as a fearless young man who wields a [[katana]] in battle. Marle, revealed to be Princess Nadia, lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, at heart, she's a princess who seeks independence from her royal identity. Lucca is a childhood friend of Crono's and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of AD 2300 comes [[Robo (Chrono Trigger)|Robo]], or Prometheus (designation R-66Y), a robot with a near-human personality created to assist humans. Lying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca, and joins the group out of gratitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;characters&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=2001 | title=Final Fantasy Chronicles instruction manual | pages=32–33 | publisher=Square Enix  | id=SLUS-01363}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fiercely confident [[Ayla (Chrono Trigger)|Ayla]] dwells in 65,000,000 BC. Unmatched in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid [[reptile]]s known as Reptites.

The last two playable characters are [[Glenn (Chrono Trigger)|Frog]] and [[Magil|Magus]]. Frog originated in AD 600. He is a former [[squire]] once known as Glenn, who was turned into an [[Kemono|anthropomorphic]] frog by Magus, who also killed his friend Cyrus. Chivalrous but mired in regret, Frog dedicates his life to protecting Leene, the queen of Guardia, and avenging Cyrus. Meanwhile, Guardia in AD 600 is in a state of conflict against the Mystics (known as Fiends in the US/DS port), a race of demons and intelligent animals who wage war against humanity under the leadership of Magus, a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]]. Magus's seclusion conceals a long-lost past; he was formerly known as Janus, the young prince of the Kingdom of Zeal, which was destroyed by Lavos in 12,000 BC. The incident sent him forward through time, and as he ages, he plots revenge against Lavos and broods over the fate of his sister, [[Schala]].&lt;ref name=&quot;characters&quot; /&gt; Lavos, the game's main antagonist who awakens and ravages the world in AD 1999, is an extraterrestrial, parasitic creature that harvests DNA and the Earth's energy for its own growth.

===Story===
In AD 1000, Crono and Marle watch Lucca and her father demonstrate her new [[Teleportation|teleporter]] at the Millennial Fair in the Kingdom of Guardia. When Marle volunteers to be teleported, her pendant interferes with the device and creates a time portal into which she is drawn.&lt;ref name=&quot;portal&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 |platform =Super NES |level=Leene Square |quote='''Taban:''' What's going on Lucca? WHERE IS SHE? / '''Lucca:''' The way she disappeared... It couldn't have been the Telepod! The warp field seemed to be affected by her pendant...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Crono and Lucca separately recreate the portal and find themselves in AD 600, they find Marle only to see her vanish before their eyes. Lucca realizes that this time period's kingdom has mistaken Marle— actually Princess Nadia of Guardia— for Queen Leene, an ancestor of hers who had been kidnapped, thus putting off the recovery effort for her ancestor and creating a [[grandfather paradox]]. Crono and Lucca, with the help of Frog, restore history to normal by rescuing Leene. After the three part ways with Frog and return to the present, Crono is arrested on charges of kidnapping Marle and sentenced to death by the current chancellor of Guardia. Lucca and Marle help Crono to flee, haphazardly using another time portal to escape their pursuers. This portal lands them in AD 2300, where they learn that an advanced civilization has been wiped out by a giant creature known as Lavos that appeared in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;dayoflavos&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES |level=Arris Dome |quote='''Marle:''' Say, what does this button do? / '''Lucca:''' 1999 A.D.?

Is that what's destroying our world?! / '''Marle:''' We must truly be in the future... }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three vow to find a way to prevent the future destruction of their world. After meeting and repairing Robo, Crono and his friends find Gaspar, an old sage at the End of Time, who helps them acquire magical powers and travel through time by way of several pillars of light (from this point onwards, the party is able to challenge Lavos; doing so and emerging victorious will unlock one of twelve different endings, depending on the point in the story at which Lavos is fought, as well as whether or not certain actions are completed beforehand).

Research in AD 1000 tells the party about Magus summoning Lavos into the world. To repair Frog's sword, the Masamune, they travel to prehistoric times and meet Ayla. After returning to AD 600, they challenge Magus, believing him to be the source of Lavos; after the battle, a summoning spell causes a time gate that throws Crono and his friends to the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;lavos-created&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES |level=Heckran Cave |quote='''Heckran:''' If only the great Magus who brought forth Lavos 400 years ago, had destroyed the human race! }}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in prehistory, Ayla joins the group to battle the Reptites and witness the origin of Lavos. They learn that Lavos was an alien being that arrived on the planet millions of years in the past, and began to absorb [[DNA]] and energy from every living creature before arising and razing the planet's surface in 1999 so that it could spawn a new generation. Entering a gate created by the newly-landed Lavos, they go to BC 12,000, an ice age, where the party finds the Kingdom of Zeal, who recently discovered Lavos and seeks to drain its power to achieve immortality through the Mammon Machine. Zeal's leader, Queen Zeal, imprisons Crono and friends on orders of the Prophet, a mysterious figure who has recently begun advising the queen. Though Zeal's daughter Schala frees them, the Prophet forces her to banish them from the realm and seal the time gate they used to travel to the Dark Ages. They return next to AD 2300 to find a time machine called the Wings of Time (or ''Epoch''), which can access any time period without using a time gate. They travel back to BC 12000 to stop Zeal from activating the Mammon Machine in the Ocean Palace. Lavos awakens, disturbed by the Mammon Machine; the Prophet reveals himself to be Magus and unsuccessfully tries to kill the creature.&lt;ref name=&quot;magusrevealed&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES |level=Heckran Cave |quote='''Magus:''' I've waited for this...

My powers are being drained! }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is beaten, and a broken Crono stands up to Lavos before being vaporized by a powerful blast. Schala transports the rest of the party back to the surface before Lavos destroys the Ocean palace and the Kingdom of Zeal.

Crono's friends awaken in a village and find Magus, who confesses that he used to be Prince Janus of Zeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;janus&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES |level=North Cape |quote='''Magus:''' Behold.

I have waited to even the score. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memories, it is revealed that the disaster at the Ocean Palace scattered the Gurus of Zeal across time and sent him to the Middle Ages. Janus took the title of Magus and gained a cult of followers while plotting to summon and kill Lavos in revenge for the death of his sister, Schala. When Lavos appeared after his battle with Crono and his allies, he was cast back to the time of Zeal and presented himself to them as a prophet. At this point, Magus is either killed by the party, killed in a duel with Frog, or spared and convinced to join the party. As Crono's friends depart, the ruined Ocean Palace rises into the air as the Black Omen. The group turns to Gaspar for help, and he gives them a &quot;Chrono Trigger,&quot; an egg-shaped device that allows the group to replace Crono just before the moment of death with a [[Doppelgänger|Dopple Doll]] (doing so is optional, and the game's ending will change depending on the player's decision in this matter).

If Magus joined the party, he departs to search for Schala. If Crono was resurrected before defeating Lavos, his sentence for kidnapping Marle is revoked by her father, King Guardia XXXIII, thanks to testimonies from Marle's ancestors and descendants, whom Crono had helped during his journey.

Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. If resurrected, Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them down to earth. Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.

''Chrono Trigger DS'' added two new scenarios to the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; In the first, Crono and his friends can help a &quot;lost sanctum&quot; of Reptites, who reward powerful items and armor. The second scenario adds ties to ''Trigger''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s sequel, ''Chrono Cross''.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; In a New Game +, the group can explore several temporal distortions to combat shadow versions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca, and to fight Dalton, who promises in defeat to raise an army in the town of Porre to destroy the Kingdom of Guardia.&lt;ref name=&quot;daltonpromise&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=November 25, 2008 | platform =Nintendo DS |level=Twilight Grotto |quote='''Dalton''': If it weren't for you, I'd have been the ruler of an age all my own!

A version of Magus pleads with Schala to resist; though she recognizes him as her brother, she refuses to be helped and sends him away. Schala subsequently erases his memories and Magus awakens in a forest, determined to find what he had lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;magusdsending&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger DS | developer =Square Enix | publisher =Square Enix | date=November 25, 2008 | platform =Nintendo DS |level=Twilight Grotto |quote='''Magus''': Hmph.

==Development==
''Chrono Trigger'' was conceived in 1992 by [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], producer and creator of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series; [[Yuji Horii]], writer, game designer and creator of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series; and [[Akira Toriyama]], character designer of ''Dragon Quest'' and creator of the ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' manga series.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot;&gt;{{cite video|date=1994 |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Alpha_Version_Screenshot.html |title=V-Jump Festival 1994 |medium=VHS tape |location=Japan |publisher=Shueisha |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103204100/http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Alpha_Version_Screenshot.html |archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling to the United States to research computer graphics, the three decided to create something that &quot;no one had done before&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt; After spending over a year considering the difficulties of developing a new game, they received a call from Kazuhiko Aoki, who offered to produce.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt; The four met and spent four days [[brainstorming]] ideas for the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt; Square convened 50–60 developers, including scenario writer [[Masato Kato]], whom Square designated story planner.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; Development started in early 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|date=April 1995|issue=19|page=41|title=Prescreen: Chrono Trigger|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; An uncredited Square employee suggested that the team develop a [[time travel in fiction|time travel]]-themed game, which Kato initially opposed, fearing repetitive, dull gameplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; Kato and Horii then met several hours per day during the first year of development to write the game's plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; Square intended to license the work under the ''[[Seiken Densetsu]]'' franchise and gave it the working title ''Maru Island''; [[Hiromichi Tanaka]] (the future producer of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'') monitored Toriyama's early designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;seiken1&quot;&gt;{{cite video | date=September 14, 2011 |url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/liners/seikendensetsubox.shtml | title=Seiken Densetsu Music Complete Book Liner Notes (translated by Gerardo Iuliani) | publisher=Square Enix|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809061646/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/liners/seikendensetsubox.shtml |archivedate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team hoped to release it on Nintendo's planned Super Famicom Disk Drive; when Nintendo canceled the project, Square reoriented the game for release on a Super Famicom [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] and rebranded it as ''Chrono Trigger''.&lt;ref name=&quot;seiken1&quot; /&gt; Tanaka credited the ROM cartridge platform for enabling seamless transition to battles on the field map.&lt;ref name=&quot;seiken1&quot; /&gt;

Aoki ultimately produced ''Chrono Trigger'', while director credits were attributed to [[Akihiko Matsui]], [[Yoshinori Kitase]] and [[Takashi Tokita]]. Toriyama designed the game's aesthetic, including characters, monsters, vehicles, and the look of each era.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt; Masato Kato also contributed character ideas and designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; Kato planned to feature Gaspar as a playable character and Toriyama sketched him, but he was cut early in development.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjumpplayersguide&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year=1995 | editor=V-Jump | title=Chrono Trigger V-Jump Player's Guide | page=189 | language=Japanese | publisher=V-Jump}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development staff studied the drawings of Toriyama to approximate his style.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Sakaguchi and Horii supervised; Sakaguchi was responsible for the game's overall system and contributed several monster ideas.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjump1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Other notable designers include [[Tetsuya Takahashi]], the graphic director, and [[Yasuyuki Honne]], [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and [[Yusuke Naora]], who worked as field graphic artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;creditscc&quot;&gt;{{cite video game | title =Chrono Trigger (Credits) |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger_Credits.html | developer =Square Co | publisher =Square Soft | date=August 22, 1995 | platform =Super NES }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasuhika Kamata programmed graphics, and cited [[Ridley Scott]]'s visual work in the film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' as an inspiration for the game's lighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot; /&gt; Kamata made the game's luminosity and [[color theory|color choice]] lay between that of ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and the ''Final Fantasy'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot; /&gt; Features originally intended to be used in ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' or ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', also under development at the same time, were appropriated by the ''Chrono Trigger'' team.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEVELint&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Level (magazine)|Level]] |issue=6 |pages=114–121 |language=Swedish |last=Schaulfelberger |first=Frederik |date=September 2006 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | title = Sanningen om Mana}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tanaka, ''Secret of Mana'' (which itself was originally intended to be ''Final Fantasy IV'') was codenamed &quot;''Chrono Trigger''&quot; during development before being called ''[[Seiken Densetsu 2]]'' (''Secret of Mana''), and then the name ''Chrono Trigger'' was adopted for a new project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=インタビュー『ファイナルファンタジーIII』 |url=https://dengekionline.com/soft/interview/ff3/ |website=[[Dengeki]] |year=2006 |archiveurl=https://legendsoflocalization.com/final-fantasy-iv-secret-of-mana-and-chrono-trigger-had-a-connection/ |archivedate=June 21, 2013 |accessdate=18 June 2019 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yuji Horii, a fan of time travel fiction (such as the TV series ''[[The Time Tunnel]]''), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of ''Chrono Trigger'' with input from Akira Toriyama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Yuji Horii interview |url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showGamePage&amp;Game_ID=169 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325111040/http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showGamePage&amp;Game_ID=169 | archivedate=March 25, 2006 | author=Play staff |publisher=[[Play (US magazine)|Play]] online | accessdate=February 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; Horii liked the scenario of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Concerning story planning, Horii commented, &quot;If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details.

Hironobu Sakaguchi likened the development of ''Chrono Trigger'' to &quot;play[ing] around with Toriyama's universe,&quot; citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game that would have been &quot;impossible with something like ''Final Fantasy''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; The game's testers had previously complained that ''Chrono Trigger'' was too difficult; as Horii explained, &quot;It's because we know too much.

Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or &quot;travel through time again&quot; as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: &quot;Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in your behavior caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details&amp;nbsp;... I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfectinterview&quot; /&gt; The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=March 1995 |journal=Gamest |publisher=Shinseisha |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html#Chrono_Trigger_Gamest_Coverage |pages=211–215 |title=Chrono Trigger Development Team Special Talk |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119231921/http://chronocompendium.com/Term/Supporting_Material_Translation.html |archivedate=November 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chrono Trigger'' was scored primarily by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]], with contributions from veteran ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], and one track composed by [[Noriko Matsueda]]. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda was unhappy with his pay and threatened to leave Square if he could not compose music.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerup&quot; /&gt; Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score ''Chrono Trigger'', remarking, &quot;maybe your salary will go up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mitsuda2008&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of pieces composed over the previous two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;dsultimania&quot; /&gt; He reflected, &quot;I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre&amp;nbsp;... music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always talk with him about the setting and the scene before going into writing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;powerup&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain pieces—such as the game's ending theme, ''To Far Away Times''—to inspiring dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;mitsuda2008&quot; /&gt; He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before ''Chrono Trigger'', reflecting that the tune was made in dedication to &quot;a certain person with whom [he] wanted to share a generation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctdsmitsudainterview&quot; /&gt; He also tried to use [[leitmotif]]s of the ''Chrono Trigger'' main theme to create a sense of consistency in the soundtrack.&lt;ref name=&quot;sekitopsx&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda wrote each tune to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square's games at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamest&quot; /&gt; Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks.&lt;ref name=&quot;famitsujuly2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008 |journal=[[Famitsu]] |title=Chrono Trigger DS |url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/July_2008_Weekly_Famitsu_Interview_with_Yasunori_Mitsuda.html |pages=67–70 |language=Japanese |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613004048/http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/July_2008_Weekly_Famitsu_Interview_with_Yasunori_Mitsuda.html |archivedate=June 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Mitsuda contracted [[Peptic ulcer|stomach ulcers]], Uematsu joined the project to compose ten pieces and finish the score.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerup&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | year=2004 | first=Chris |last=Kohler |authorlink=Chris Kohler | title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life | publisher=DK Publishing  | isbn=0-7440-0424-1| title-link=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;famitsujuly2008&quot; /&gt;

At the time of the game's release, the number of tracks and sound effects was unprecedented—the soundtrack spanned three discs in its 1995 commercial pressing.&lt;ref name=&quot;npreview1&quot; /&gt; Square also released a one-disc [[acid jazz]] arrangement called &quot;''[[The Brink of Time]]''&quot; by [[Guido (jazz band)|Guido]] that year.

To be perfectly honest, I find it so hard to believe that songs from 13 years ago are loved this much. Keeping these feelings in mind, I hope to continue composing songs which are powerful, and yet intricate...I hope that the extras like this bonus CD will help expand the world of Chrono Trigger, especially since we did a live recording.

Music from the game was performed live by the [[Tokyo Symphony Orchestra]] in 1996 at the [[Orchestral Game Concert]] in Tokyo, Japan. A suite of music including ''Chrono Trigger'' is a part of the symphonic world-tour with video game music [[Play!

Square released an enhanced [[porting|port]] of ''Chrono Trigger'' developed by [[TOSE|Tose]] in Japan for the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999. Square timed its release before that of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'', the 1999 sequel to ''Chrono Trigger'', to familiarize new players with story leading up to it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; This version included [[anime]] cutscenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's [[Bird Studio]] and animated at [[Toei Animation]], as well as several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cutscenes would illustrate subtle ties to ''[[Chrono Cross]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ultimania&quot; /&gt; The port was released in North America in 2001—along with a newly translated version of ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''—as ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]''.

In contrast to the critical acclaim of ''Chrono Trigger'''s original SNES release, the 2018 Microsoft Windows port of ''Chrono Trigger'' was critically panned. Grievances noted by reviewers included tiling errors on textures, the addition of aesthetically-intrusive sprite filters, an unattractive [[GUI]] carried over from the 2011 mobile release, a lack of graphic customization options, and the inability to remap controls. In describing the port, ''[[Forbes]]'' commented: &quot;From pretty awful graphical issues, such as tiling textures and quite a painful menu system, this port really doesn’t do this classic game justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;forbespc&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Ollie |last=Barder |year=2018 |title=The Classic 'Chrono Trigger' Has Been Ported To PC And It's Not Good At All |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2018/02/28/the-classic-chrono-trigger-has-been-ported-to-pc-and-its-not-good-at-all/#2969645c4158 |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=March 1, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228202114/https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2018/02/28/the-classic-chrono-trigger-has-been-ported-to-pc-and-its-not-good-at-all/ |archivedate=February 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USGamer]]'' characterized the Windows release as carrying &quot;all the markings of a project farmed out to the lowest bidder.
