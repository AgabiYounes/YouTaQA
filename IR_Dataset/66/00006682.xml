A '''clade''' (from {{lang-grc|{{lang|grc|κλάδος}}}}, ''klados'', &quot;branch&quot;), also known as monophyletic group, is a group of [[organism]]s that consists of a common ancestor and all its [[lineage (evolution)|lineal descendants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Assembling the Tree of Life |editor-first=Joel |editor-last=Cracraft |editor2-first=Michael J. |editor2-last=Donoghue |chapter=Introduction |page=1 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-972960-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than the English term, the equivalent [[Latin]] term ''cladus'' (plural ''cladi'') is often used in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] literature.

The common ancestor may be an individual, a [[population]], a [[species]] ([[extinct]] or [[Extant taxon|extant]]), and so on right up to a [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] and further. Clades are nested, one in another, as each branch in turn splits into smaller branches. These splits reflect [[evolutionary history]] as populations diverged and evolved independently. Clades are termed [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] (Greek: &quot;one clan&quot;) groups.

Over the last few decades, the cladistic approach has revolutionized biological classification and revealed surprising evolutionary relationships among organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer, Douglas 2009. p. 13&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evolution: The Story of Life |last=Palmer |first=Douglas |publisher=University of California Press |year=2009 |location=Berkeley |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, taxonomists try to avoid naming [[Taxon|taxa]] that are not clades; that is, taxa that are not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. Some of the relationships between organisms that the molecular biology arm of cladistics has revealed are that [[fungi]] are closer relatives to animals than they are to plants, [[archaea]] are now considered different from [[bacteria]], and multicellular organisms may have evolved from archaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pace |first=Norman R. |date=2006-05-18 |title=Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7091 |pages=289 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..289P |doi=10.1038/441289a |issn=1476-4687 |pmid=16710401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term &quot;clade&quot; was coined in 1957 by the biologist [[Julian Huxley]] to refer to the result of [[cladogenesis]], the evolutionary splitting of a parent species into two distinct species, a concept Huxley borrowed from [[Bernhard Rensch]].&lt;ref name=Dupuis&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dupuis | first=Claude | year=1984 | title=Willi Hennig's impact on taxonomic thought | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=15 | pages=1–24 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.000245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;{{cite journal | last = Huxley | first = J. S. | year =1957 | title = The three types of evolutionary process | journal=Nature | volume=180 | issue = 4584 | pages=454–455 | doi=10.1038/180454a0| bibcode=1957Natur.180..454H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commonly named groups, [[rodent]]s and [[insect]]s for example, are clades because, in each case, the group consists of a common ancestor with all its descendant branches. Rodents, for example, are a branch of [[mammal]]s that split off after the end of the period when the clade [[Dinosaur]]ia stopped being the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s 66 million years ago. The original population and all its descendants are a clade. The rodent clade corresponds to the order Rodentia, and insects to the class Insecta. These clades include smaller clades, such as [[chipmunk]] or [[ant]], each of which consists of even smaller clades. The clade &quot;rodent&quot; is in turn included in the mammal, [[vertebrate]] and animal clades.

== History of nomenclature and taxonomy ==
[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|right|upright|Early phylogenetic tree by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1866. Groups once thought to be more advanced, such as birds (&quot;Aves&quot;), are placed at the top.]]

The idea of a clade did not exist in pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[Linnaean taxonomy]], which was based by necessity only on internal or external [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities between organisms – although as it happens, many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original [[Systema Naturae]] (notably among the [[vertebrate]] groups) do represent clades. The phenomenon of [[convergent evolution]] is, however, responsible for many cases where there are misleading similarities in the morphology of groups that evolved from different lineages.

With the increasing realization in the first half of the 19th century that species had changed and split through the ages, classification increasingly came to be seen as branches on the evolutionary [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. The publication of Darwin's [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] in 1859 gave this view increasing weight. [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], an early advocate of evolutionary theory, proposed a revised taxonomy based on a concept strongly resembling clades&lt;ref name=&quot;original text w/ figures&quot;&gt;Huxley, T.H. (1876): Lectures on Evolution. ''New York Tribune''. Extra. no 36. In Collected Essays IV: pp 46-138 [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE4/LecEvol.html original text w/ figures]&lt;/ref&gt;, although the term ''clade'' itself would not be coined until 1957 by his grandson, [[Julian Huxley]]. For example, the elder Huxley grouped birds with reptiles, based on fossil evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;original text w/ figures&quot;/&gt;

German biologist [[Emil Hans Willi Hennig]] (1913 – 1976) is considered to be the founder of [[cladistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brower, Andrew V. Z.|year=2013|title=Willi Hennig at 100|journal=Cladistics|volume=30|issue=2|pages=224–225|doi=10.1111/cla.12057}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He proposed a classification system that represented repeated branchings of the family tree, as opposed to the previous systems, which put organisms on a &quot;ladder&quot;, with supposedly more &quot;advanced&quot; organisms at the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer, Douglas 2009. p. 13&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;page 10&quot;&gt;”Evolution 101.” [http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 page 10]. Understanding Evolution website. University of California, Berkeley. Retrieved 26 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxonomists have increasingly worked to make the taxonomic system reflect evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;page 10&quot;/&gt; When it comes to [[Nomenclature#Biology|naming]], however, this principle is not always compatible with the traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|rank-based nomenclature]]. In the latter, only taxa associated with a [[Taxonomic rank|rank]] can be named, yet there are not enough ranks to name a long series of nested clades. For these and other reasons, [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has been developed; it is still controversial.

==Definitions==
[[File:Cladogram Crocodilia NL.PNG|thumb|right|upright|Gavialidae, Crocodylidae and Alligatoridae are clade names that are here applied to a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] tree of crocodylians.]]

A clade is by definition [[monophyletic]], meaning that it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a population, or a species) and all its descendants.&lt;ref group=note&gt;
A semantic case has been made that the name should be &quot;holophyletic&quot;, but this term has not acquired widespread use. For more information, see ''[[holophyly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature. Version 4c. Chapter I. Taxa. |url=http://www.ohio.edu/phylocode/art1-3.html|year=2010|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Clades and phylogenetic trees==
{{main article|Phylogenetics|Cladistics}}

The science that tries to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and thus discover clades is called [[phylogenetics]] or [[cladistics]], the latter term coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] (1965), derived from &quot;clade&quot;. The results of phylogenetic/cladistic analyses are tree-shaped diagrams called ''[[cladogram]]s''; they, and all their branches, are phylogenetic hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nixon|first=Kevin C.|author2=Carpenter, James M.|title=On the Other &quot;Phylogenetic Systematics&quot;|journal=Cladistics|date=1 September 2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=298–318|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three methods of defining clades are featured in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]: node-, stem-, and apomorphy-based (see [[Phylogenetic nomenclature#Phylogenetic definitions of clade names|here]] for detailed definitions).

==Terminology==
[[File:Primate cladogram.svg|thumb|left|Cladogram of modern primate groups; all tarsiers are haplorhines, but not all haplorhines are tarsiers; all apes are catarrhines, but not all catarrhines are apes; etc.]]

The relationship between clades can be described in several ways:

* A clade located within a clade is said to be ''nested'' within that clade. In the diagram, the [[Ape|hominoid]] clade, i.e. the apes and humans, is nested within the primate clade.
* Two clades are ''[[Sister group|sisters]]'' if they have an immediate common ancestor. In the diagram, lemurs and lorises are sister clades, while humans and tarsiers are not.
* A clade ''A'' is ''[[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]'' to a clade ''B'' if ''A'' branches off the lineage leading to ''B'' before the first branch leading only to members of ''B''. In the adjacent diagram, the [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]]/[[prosimian]] clade, is basal to the [[Hominoidea|hominoids]]/[[ape]] clade. However, in this example, both Haplorrhine as prosimians should be considered as most basal groupings. It is better to say that the prosimians are the sister group to the rest of the primates.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krell |first=F.-T. |last2=Cranston |first2=P. |year=2004 |title=Which side of the tree is more basal? |journal=Systematic Entomology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=279–281 |doi=10.1111/j.0307-6970.2004.00262.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This way one also avoids unintended and misconceived connotations about evolutionary advancement, complexity, diversity, ancestor status, and ancienity e.g. due to impact of sampling diversity and extinction.{{citation needed|reason=reads as editorial comment|date=March 2019}}&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://for-the-love-of-trees.blogspot.com/2016/09/the-ancestors-are-not-among-us.html|title=For the love of trees: The ancestors are not among us|last=Smith|first=Stacey|date=2016-09-19|website=For the love of trees|access-date=2019-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basal clades should not be confused with stem groupings, as the latter is associated with paraphyletic or unresolved groupings.

==In popular culture==
''Clade'' is the title of a novel by [[James Bradley (Australian writer)|James Bradley]], who chose it both because of its biological meaning and also because of the larger implications of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@PenguinBooksAus/choosing-the-book-title-clade-f4d16baa6e87 |title=Choosing the Book title 'Clade'|publisher=Penguin Group Australia|year=2015| accessdate =20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' was titled &quot;[[List of Elementary episodes#ep38|Dead Clade Walking]]&quot; and dealt with a case involving a rare fossil.
