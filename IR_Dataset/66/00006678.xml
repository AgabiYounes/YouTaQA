The cat is similar in [[Cat anatomy|anatomy]] to the other felid species, has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its [[night vision]] and sense of smell are well developed. [[Cat communication]] includes [[Animal communication|vocalizations]] like meowing, purring, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, growling and grunting as well as [[Cat body language|cat-specific body language]]. It is a solitary hunter, but a [[social species]]. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in [[frequency]] for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.

Domestic cats are bred and shown as registered [[pedigreed cat]]s, a hobby known as [[cat fancy]]. Failure to control breeding of [[pet]] cats by [[spaying]] and [[neutering]], as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird species, and evoking [[Animal population control|population control]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Welfare of Cats |last=Rochlitz |first=I. |date=2007 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |isbn=978-1-4020-6143-1 |series=&quot;Animal Welfare&quot; series |location=Berlin |pages=141–175 |oclc=262679891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and naming==
The origin of the English word 'cat', [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|catt}}, is thought to be the [[Late Latin]] word {{lang|la|cattus}}, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McKnight |first=G.H. |title=English Words and Their Background |publisher=[[D. Appleton and Company]]|location=New York, London |date=1923 |chapter=Words and Archaeology |pages=293–311 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/englishwordsthei00mckn/page/300}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from an [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] precursor of [[Coptic language|Coptic]] {{lang|cop|[[wikt:ϣⲁⲩ|ϣⲁⲩ]]}} {{lang|cop-Latn|šau}}, &quot;tomcat&quot;, or its feminine form suffixed with {{lang|egy-Latn|-t}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=J.-P. |last=Savignac |title=Dictionnaire français-gaulois |chapter=Chat |location=Paris |publisher=Errance |date=2004 |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Late Latin word is also thought to be derived from [[Afro-Asiatic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pictet, A. |year=1859 |title=Les origines indo-européennes ou les Aryas primitifs : essai de paléontologie linguistique |volume=1 |location=Paris |publisher=Joël Cherbuliez |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] word {{lang|nub|kaddîska}} &quot;wildcat&quot; and [[Nobiin language|Nobiin]] {{lang|nub|kadīs}} are possible sources or cognates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Keller, O. |year=1909 |title=Die antike Tierwelt |volume=Säugetiere |location=Leipzig |page=75 |publisher=[[Walther von Wartburg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nubian word may be a loan from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|قَطّ{{lrm}}}} {{lang|ar-Latn|qaṭṭ}} ~ {{lang|ar|قِطّ}} {{lang|ar-Latn|qiṭṭ}}.

The English ''[[wikt:puss#English|puss]]'', extended as ''pussy'' and ''pussycat'', is attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] {{lang|nl|poes}} or from [[Low German]] {{lang|nds|puuskatte}}, related to [[Swedish language|Swedish]] {{lang|sv|kattepus}}, or [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] {{lang|no|pus}}, {{lang|no|pusekatt}}. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian {{lang|lt|puižė}} and [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|puisín}} or {{lang|ga|puiscín}}.

The earliest known indication for a tamed African wildcat was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] close by a human grave in [[Shillourokambos]], southern Cyprus, dating to about 9,200 to 9,500 years before present. As there is no evidence of native mammalian [[fauna]] on Cyprus, the inhabitants of this Neolithic village most likely brought the cat and other wild mammals to the island from the [[Middle East]]ern mainland.&lt;ref name=Vigne_al2004/&gt; Scientists therefore assume that African wildcats were attracted to early human settlements in the [[Fertile Crescent]] by rodents, in particular the [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus''), and were tamed by Neolithic farmers.

Cats have excellent [[night vision]] and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Case&quot; /&gt;{{rp|43}} This is partly the result of cat eyes having a [[tapetum lucidum]], which reflects any light that passes through the [[retina]] back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Comparative Morphology of the ''Tapetum Lucidum'' (among Selected Species) |last1=Ollivier |first1=F.

===Smell===
Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed [[olfactory bulb]] and a large surface of [[olfactory mucosa]], about {{convert|5.8|cm2|in2|abbr=on}} in area, which is about twice that of humans&lt;!-- impossible logic and only 1.7-fold less than the average dog. --&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moulton 1967&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moulton |first=David G. |date=1 August 1967 |title=Olfaction in Mammals |url= https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/7/3/421/244992|journal=American Zoologist |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=421–429 |doi=10.1093/icb/7.3.421 |pmid=6077376 |issn=0003-1569}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats and many other animals have a [[Jacobson's organ]] in their mouths that is used in the behavioral process of [[Flehmen response|flehmening]].

[[File:Kittyply edit1.jpg|thumb|right|The whiskers of a cat are highly sensitive to touch.]]

===Whiskers===
To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable [[vibrissa|whiskers (vibrissae)]] over their body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents; they also trigger protective [[blink reflex]]es to protect the eyes from damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Case&quot; /&gt;{{rp|47}}

===Balance===

Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for sitting in high places, or perching. A higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch. Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. A cat falling from heights of up to 3 meters can right itself and land on its paws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent et al. 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kent |first1=Marc |last2=Platt |first2=Simon R. |title=The neurology of balance: Function and dysfunction of the vestibular system in dogs and cats |journal=The Veterinary Journal |volume=185 |pages=247–249 |date=September 2010 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/j.tvjl.2009.10.029|pmid=19944632}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is known as the [[cat righting reflex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gerathewohl |first1=S. J. |last2=Stallings |first2=H. D. |date=1957 |title=The Labyrinthine Posture Reflex (Righting Reflex] in the Cat during Weightlessness |journal=The Journal of Aviation Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=345–355 |url= https://spacemedicineassociation.org/download/history/history_files_1957/28040345-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An individual cat always rights itself in the same way during a fall, provided it has sufficient time to do so. The height required for this to occur is around {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nguyen 1998&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20010410235503/http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 April 2001 |title=How Does a Cat Always Land on Its Feet? |last=Nguyen |first=H.

Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. The daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. The term &quot;cat nap&quot; for a short rest refers to the cat's tendency to fall asleep (lightly) for a brief period. While asleep, cats experience short periods of [[rapid eye movement sleep]] often accompanied by muscle twitches, which suggests they are dreaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(79)90110-3 |volume=2 |pages=280–282 |last=Jouvet |first=M. |title=What Does a Cat Dream About? |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |date=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. |title=Olfactory Awareness |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and [[growling]] and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, they do not have a social survival strategy, or a [[Herd behavior|pack mentality]] and always hunt alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw&quot; /&gt;

===Communication===
{{main|Cat communication}}
[[File:Domestic Cat Face Shot.jpg|thumb|Vocalizing domestic cat]]
Domestic cats use many [[Animal communication|vocalizations]] for communication, including purring, [[Trill consonant|trilling]], hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing.&lt;ref name=Moelk1944/&gt; Their [[Cat body language|body language]], including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats. A raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. Tail-raising also indicates the cat's position in the group's [[social hierarchy]], with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Cafazzo |first1=S. |last2=Natoli |first2=E. |title=The Social Function of Tail Up in the Domestic Cat (''Felis silvestris catus'') |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=60–66 |date=2009 |pmid=18930121 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2008.09.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feral cats are generally silent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jensen |first=P. |title=The Ethology of Domestic Animals |series=&quot;Modular Text&quot; series |publisher=[[Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International]] |location=Wallingford, England |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-84593-536-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} Nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by [[social grooming]], which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowell-davis2004&quot; /&gt;

Purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signalling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] kittens.

===Grooming===
[[File:Cat tongue macro.jpg|thumb|The hooked [[Lingual papilla|papillae]] on a cat's tongue act like a [[hairbrush]] to help clean and detangle fur.]]
[[File:Housecat Grooming Itself.webm|thumb|A [[tabby cat|tabby]] housecat uses its brush-like tongue to groom itself, licking its fur to straighten it.]]

Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean.&lt;ref name=&quot;hairballs&quot; /&gt; The cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] long, which are called [[Lingual papilla|papillae]]. These contain [[keratin]] which makes them rigid&lt;ref name=&quot;Boshel 1982&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Filiform Papillae of Cat Tongue |last1=Boshel |first1=J. |last2=Wilborn |first2=W.

Some cats, particularly longhaired cats, occasionally regurgitate [[hairball]]s of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming. These clumps of fur are usually sausage-shaped and about {{convert|2|–|3|cm|1|abbr=on}} long. Hairballs can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the [[gut (anatomy)|gut]], as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush.&lt;ref name=&quot;hairballs&quot;&gt;

===Fighting===
[[File:GAto.jpg|thumb|A domestic cat's arched back, raised fur and an open-mouthed hiss are signs of aggression]]
Among domestic cats, males are more likely to fight than females.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindell&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lindell |first=E.

In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male.&lt;ref name=&quot;courtship&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Mating Behaviors, Courtship Rank and Mating Success of Male Feral Cat (''Felis catus'') |first1=A. |last1=Yamane |first2=T. |last2=Doi |first3=Y. |last3=Ono |journal=Journal of Ethology |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=35–44 |date=1996 |doi=10.1007/BF02350090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindell&quot; /&gt; Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to [[sex hormone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Determining the Optimal age for Gonadectomy of Dogs and Cats |doi=10.2460/javma.231.11.1665 |date=2007 |last1=Kustritz |first1=M.

When cats become aggressive, they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting.&lt;ref name=&quot;behaviourguide&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/behavior/bodylanguageintro.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090224154137/http://animal.discovery.com/guides/cats/behavior/bodylanguageintro.html |archive-date=24 February 2009 |title=Cat Behavior: Body Language |work=AnimalPlanet.com |date=2007 |access-date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSUS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20041214181209/http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/cat_behavior_tip_sheets/aggression_between_family_cats.html |url= http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/our_pets_for_life_program/cat_behavior_tip_sheets/aggression_between_family_cats.html |title=Aggression Between Family Cats |work=HSUS.org |archive-date=14 December 2004 |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious damage is rare, as the fights are usually short in duration, with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears. However, fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations. Normally, serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites, though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated. In addition, bites are probably the main route of transmission of [[feline immunodeficiency virus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pederson 1989&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Infection |last1=Pedersen |first1=N.

Free-fed feral cats and house cats consume several small meals in a day. The frequency and size of meals varies between individuals. They select food based on its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats reject novel flavors (a response termed [[neophobia]]) and learn quickly to [[taste aversion|avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant]] in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradshaw&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bradshaw |first1=J.

Perhaps the best-known element of cats' hunting behavior, which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture, is that cats often appear to &quot;play&quot; with prey by releasing it after capture. This [[cat and mouse]] behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Why do cats play with their food? |url= http://azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html |work=Arizona Daily Sun |access-date=15 August 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110319041928/http://www.azdailysun.com/lifestyles/pets/article_46a97775-232d-5e56-b0ea-dd1c8782b062.html |archive-date=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians.

{{See also|Kitten}}
Female cats called queens are [[polyestrous]] with several [[estrus]] cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days. They are usually ready to mate between early February and August.&lt;ref name=Jemmett1977&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jemmett |first1=J. E. |last2=Evans |first2=J. M. |date=1977 |title=A survey of sexual behaviour and reproduction of female cats |journal=Journal of Small Animal Practice |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=31–37 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-5827.1977.tb05821.x |pmid=853730 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several males called tomcat are attracted to a female in heat. They fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's [[penis]] has a band of about 120–150 backward-pointing [[penile spines]], which are about {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's [[vagina]], which acts to [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induce ovulation]]. This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aronson 1967&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Penile Spines of the Domestic Cat: Their Endocrine-behavior Relations |last1=Aronson |first1=L.

After mating, the female cleans her [[vulva]] thoroughly. If a male attempts to mate with her at this point, the female attacks him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;compendium&quot; /&gt;
Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wildt 1980&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Wildt |first1=D.

Data on the reproductive capacity of more than 2,300 free-ranging queens were collected during a study between May 1998 and October 2000. They had one to six kittens per [[Litter (animal)|litter]], with an average of three kittens. They produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents.&lt;ref name=Nutter2004/&gt;
The first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months. This varies depending on breed.&lt;ref name=&quot;compendium&quot;/&gt; Kittens reach [[puberty]] at the age of 9–10 months.&lt;ref name=Jemmett1977/&gt;

Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state. They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot; /&gt; The numbers of feral cats is not known, but estimates of the United States feral population range from twenty-five to sixty million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochlitz&quot; /&gt; Feral cats may live alone, but most are found in large [[feral cat colony|colonies]], which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food.&lt;ref name=&quot;hsus-feral&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |title=What is the difference between a stray cat and a feral cat? |date=2 January 2008 |work=HSUS.org |publisher=[[Humane Society of the United States]] |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501093143/http://www.hsus.org/pets/issues_affecting_our_pets/feral_cats/feral_cats_frequently_asked_questions.html#1_What_is_a_feral_cat |archive-date=1 May 2008 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the [[Colosseum]] and [[Forum Romanum]], with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php |title=Torre Argentina cat shelter. |access-date=17 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090122203413/http://www.romancats.com/index_eng.php |archive-date=22 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public attitudes towards feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to regarding them as vermin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=Humane Society of the United States |isbn=978-0-9658942-7-2 |last1=Rowan |first1=Andrew N. |last2=Salem |first2=Deborah J. |title=The State of the Animals II: 2003 |date=November 2003 |chapter=4 |chapter-url= http://www.hsus.org/web-files/PDF/hsp/SOA_3-2005_Chap4.pdf |format=

Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;hsus-feral&quot; /&gt;

The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and [[immunity (medical)|immune]] status of the person. Humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected, however, those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat [[feces]] and [[parasite]]s exiting the cat's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomel2014&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chomel |first=Bruno |title=Emerging and Re-Emerging Zoonoses of Dogs and Cats |journal=Animals |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=2014 |pages=434–445 |issn=2076-2615 |doi=10.3390/ani4030434 |pmid=26480316 |pmc=4494318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StullBrophy2015&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Stull |first1=J.

{{Main|Cultural depictions of cats|Cats in ancient Egypt}}
In [[ancient Egypt]], cats were [[animal worship|worshipped]], and the goddess [[Bastet]] often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of [[Bubastis]], where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. Herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in Egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malek1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cat in Ancient Egypt |last=Malek |first=J. |date=1997 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=9780812216325 |edition=Revised |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ancient Greeks and Romans kept [[weasel]]s as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killers. The earliest unmistakable evidence of the Greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from [[Magna Graecia]] dating to the mid-fifth century BC showing Iokastos and Phalanthos, the legendary founders of [[Reggio Calabria|Rhegion]] and [[Taranto|Taras]] respectively, playing with their pet cats. The usual ancient Greek word for 'cat' was {{lang|grc-Latn|ailouros}}, meaning 'thing with the waving tail'. Cats are rarely mentioned in [[ancient Greek literature]]. [[Aristotle]] remarked in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' that &quot;female cats are naturally [[Promiscuity|lecherous]].&quot; The Greeks later [[Interpretatio graeca|syncretized]] their own goddess [[Artemis]] with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', when the deities flee to Egypt and take animal forms, the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] turns into a cat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engels2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Engels |first1=D.

Cats are often shown in icons of [[Annunciation]] and of the [[Holy Family]] and, according to [[Folklore of Italy|Italian folklore]], on the same night that Mary gave birth to [[Jesus]], a cat in [[Bethlehem]] gave birth to a kitten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beadle1977&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Beadle |first=M. |title=Cat |date=1977 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0671224516 |chapter=Ups and Downs |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cathistorybiolog00bead/page/75 75–88] |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/?id=tnjgqpNKYksC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=PA75 |url= https://archive.org/details/cathistorybiolog00bead/page/75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the [[Age of Discovery]], as [[Ship's cat|ships' cats]] were carried on [[sailing ship]]s to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.&lt;ref name=Faure2009/&gt;

Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. In Japan, the {{lang|ja-Latn|[[maneki neko]]}} cat is a symbol of good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.darumamagazine.com/new/articles-excerpts/maneki-neko-feline-fact-fiction/ |title=Maneki Neko: Feline Fact &amp; Fiction |first=A. |last=Pate |journal=Daruma Magazine |date=2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130314191210/http://www.darumamagazine.com/new/articles-excerpts/maneki-neko-feline-fact-fiction/ |archive-date=14 March 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norse mythology]], [[Freyja]], the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Faulkes |first=A. |date=1995 |title=Edda |page=24 |isbn=978-0-460-87616-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Legends of the Jews|Jewish legend]], the first cat was living in the house of the first man [[Adam]] as a pet that got rid of [[mice]].

===Superstitions and rituals===
[[File:Close up of a black domestic cat.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Some cultures are superstitious about black cats, ascribing either good or bad luck to them.]]
Many cultures have negative [[superstition]]s about cats. An example would be the belief that a [[black cat]] &quot;crossing one's path&quot; leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' [[familiar spirit|familiars]] used to augment a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval [[Ypres]], [[Belgium]], is commemorated in the innocuous present-day [[Kattenstoet]] (cat parade).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Are Black Cats Really Bad Luck? [Hoax] |url= http://socialnewsdaily.com/58901/are-black-cats-really-bad-luck-hoax/ |work=SocialNewsDaily.com |access-date=19 December 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141607/http://socialnewsdaily.com/58901/are-black-cats-really-bad-luck-hoax/ |archive-date=22 December 2015|date= 29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. According to [[Norman Davies]], the assembled people &quot;shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally [[Carbonization|carbonized]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman |title=Europe: A History |date=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-198-20171-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0/page/543 543] |url= https://archive.org/details/europehistory00davi_0/page/543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;It was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a [[fox]] was burned. The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://www.bartleby.com/196/164.html |title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion |last=Frazer |first=James G. |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2002|isbn=0-486-42492-8 |edition=Abridged |location=Mineola, New York |pages= |oclc=49942157 |orig-year=1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. In many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |date=7 March 2010 |access-date=19 March 2010 |first=Nora |last=Sugobono |language=es |title=Las vidas del gato |work=[[El Comercio (Peru)|El Comercio]] |location=Lima, Peru |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120127052854/http://elcomercio.pe/impresa/notas/vidas-gato/20100307/423959 |archive-date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qual é a origem da lenda de que os gatos teriam sete vidas?|url= http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/qual-e-a-origem-da-lenda-de-que-os-gatos-teriam-sete-vidas |language=pt-BR |work=[[Mundo Estranho]] |publisher=[[Abril Media]] |location=São Paulo, Brazil |access-date=15 November 2015|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031757/http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/qual-e-a-origem-da-lenda-de-que-os-gatos-teriam-sete-vidas|archive-date=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[The Guardian]] |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960 |access-date=18 March 2010 |first=Tim |last=Dowling |title=Tall tails: Pet myths busted |date=19 March 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130909160834/http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2010/mar/18/guide-to-pets-pet-myths?picture=360591960|archive-date=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive [[cat righting reflex|righting reflex]] to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cats.about.com/od/catsafety/a/highrisefalls.htm |title=The ASPCA Warns About High-Rise Falls by Cats: High-Rise Apartments, Windows, Terraces and Fire Escapes Pose Risk to Urban Cats |date=30 June 2005 |author=&lt;!--staff writer(s)--&gt; |publisher=[[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] |via=About.com |access-date=6 June 2018 |location=New York |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120522014805/http://cats.about.com/od/catsafety/a/highrisefalls.htm |archive-date=22 May 2012}} (Press release.)&lt;/ref&gt;
