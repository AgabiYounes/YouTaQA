==Early history==
Cantor Fitzgerald was formed in 1945 by [[B. Gerald Cantor|Bernard Gerald Cantor]] and John Fitzgerald as an investment bank and brokerage business. It later became known for its computer-based bond brokerage, for the quality of its institutional distribution business model, and for being the market's premier dealer of government securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cantor.com/public/aboutus|title=About Us|publisher=Cantor Fitzgerald |accessdate = February 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Cantor Fitzgerald began &quot;large block&quot; sales/trading of equities for institutional customers. It became the world's first electronic marketplace for US government securities in 1972 and in 1983, it was the first to offer worldwide screen brokerage services in US government securities.

In 1991, [[Howard Lutnick]] was named president and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald; he became chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| url =https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=239786&amp;ticker=BGCP |title=Executive Profile Howard W.

At 8:46:46&amp;nbsp;a.m., six seconds after the tower was struck by the plane, a [[Goldman Sachs]] server issued an alert saying that its trading system had gone offline because it was unable to connect with the server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://911.wikileaks.org/files/messages_2001_09_11-08_45_2001_09_11-08_49.html#407 September 11, 2001 08:46:46 Arch [1612975&amp;#93; D ALPHA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egads!

Lutnick's brother was among those killed as the stairwells below them were destroyed or blocked by the plane crash. Lutnick vowed to keep the company alive, and the company was able to bring its trading markets back online within a week.

On September 19, Cantor Fitzgerald made a pledge to distribute 25% of the firm's profits for the next five years, and it committed to paying for ten years of health care for the benefit of the families of its 658 former Cantor Fitzgerald, [[eSpeed]], and TradeSpark employees (profits that would otherwise have been distributed to the Cantor Fitzgerald [[partnership|partners]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.today.com/id/44245075/ns/today-today_news/t/iconic-figures-sept-where-are-they-now/#.WHIQeVuF7IU |title=Iconic 9/11 figures: Where are they now?|last=Diebel |first=Matthew |last2=Cahli |first2=Petra |last3=Navrrao |first3=Bruno |last4=McCartney |first4=Ryan |last5=Bratu |first5=Becky |website=Today.com |publisher=NBC |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the company had completed its promise, having paid a total of $180&amp;nbsp;million (and an additional $17&amp;nbsp;million from a relief fund run by Lutnick's sister, Edie).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/cantor-fitzgerald/ |title=The Encyclopedia of 9/11: Cantor Fitzgerald: The firm that lost the most. |date=August 27, 2011 |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |author=Jessica Pressler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the attacks, Cantor had handled about a quarter of the daily transactions in the multitrillion-dollar [[treasury security]] market. Cantor Fitzgerald has since rebuilt its [[infrastructure]], partly by the efforts of its London office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/cantor-fitzgerald-the-city-firm-that-rose-from-the-911-ashes-6441839.html|title=Cantor Fitzgerald... the City firm that rose from the 9/11 ashes |author= David Cohen|newspaper=[[London Evening Standard]] |date =September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it now has its headquarters in [[Midtown Manhattan]]. The company's effort to regain its footing was the subject of [[Tom Barbash]]'s 2003 book ''On Top of the World: Cantor Fitzgerald, Howard Lutnick, and 9/11: A Story of Loss and Renewal'' as well as a 2012 documentary, ''Out of the Clear Blue Sky''.

On September 2, 2004, Cantor and other organizations filed a [[Lawsuit|civil lawsuit]] against [[Saudi Arabia]] for allegedly providing money to the hijackers and [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3646548.stm WTC agency sues Saudis over 9/11], BBC News Online, September 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; It was later joined in the suit by the [[Port Authority of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1094073283938 Port Authority to Join Suit Against Saudi Arabia Over 9/11 Attack], Associated Press, September 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the claims against Saudi Arabia were dismissed on January 18, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glovin|first=David|title=Saudi Arabia Wins Dismissal From Sept. 11 Lawsuits (Update1)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aFC0nwCtmJyc&amp;refer=top_world_news|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=19 October 2012|date=18 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Cantor Fitzgerald settled its lawsuit against [[American Airlines]] for $135 million. Cantor Fitzgerald had been suing for loss of property and interruption of business by alleging the airline to have been negligent by allowing hijackers to board [[American Airlines Flight 11|Flight 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Cantor Fitzgerald Settles 9/11 Suit Against American Airlines for $135 Million |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/nyregion/cantor-fitzgerald-settles-9-11-lawsuit-for-135-million.html?ref=us |date=December 17, 2013 |work=The New York Times |author=Benjamin Weiser |accessdate=December 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2014, two Cantor Fitzgerald analysts were said to be in the top 25 analysts on [[TipRanks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cantor.com/press_releases/Cantor_Fitzgerald__Co_Research_Analysts_Youssef_Squali_and_Brian_White_Recognized_In_TipRanks.html|title=Cantor Fitzgerald Research Analysts Youssef Squali and Brian White Recognized In TipRanks' Top 25 Analysts on Wall Street Ranking {{!}} Cantor Fitzgerald|website=www.cantor.com|access-date=2017-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210180211/http://www.cantor.com/press_releases/Cantor_Fitzgerald__Co_Research_Analysts_Youssef_Squali_and_Brian_White_Recognized_In_TipRanks.html|archive-date=February 10, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the [[2013 Moore tornado]] struck [[Moore, Oklahoma]], killing 24 people and injuring hundreds, Lutnick pledged to donate $2 million to families affected by the tornado. The donation was given out in the form of $1,000 debit cards given out to families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells|first=Jesse|title=NEW: NY group in 9/11 makes $1000 donations to May 20th storm victims|url=http://kfor.com/2013/09/23/group-to-give-1000-gift-cards-to-moore-families-after-may-tornadoes/|work=KFOR-TV|publisher=KFOR|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=$1000 gift cards given|url=http://newsok.com/1000-gift-cards-given/multimedia/video/2686873982001|work=NewsOK|publisher=NewsOK.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
