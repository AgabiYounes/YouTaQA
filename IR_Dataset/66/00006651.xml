As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 39,260.&lt;ref name=USCB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&amp;prodType=table |title=Population &amp; Housing Occupancy Status 2010 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] American FactFinder |accessdate=August 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721034521/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&amp;prodType=table |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IADC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iowadatacenter.org/archive/2011/02/feb10 |title=Data from the 2010 Census |publisher=State Data Center of Iowa |accessdate=August 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718201045/http://www.iowadatacenter.org/archive/2011/02/feb10 |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is home to the [[University of Northern Iowa]], a public university.

==History==
Cedar Falls was founded in 1845 by William Sturgis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cedar Falls, Iowa|last=Collins|first=Brian|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=1998|isbn=9780738545820|series=Images of America|location=Charleston, SC|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally named '''Sturgis Falls''', for the first family who settled the site and who continued to live in the city for years.  The city was called Sturgis Falls until it was merged with Cedar City (another city on the other side of the Cedar River), creating Cedar Falls. The city's founders are honored each year with a week long community-wide celebration named in their honor – the Sturgis Falls Celebration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sturgisfalls.org/history&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the availability of water power, Cedar Falls developed as a milling and industrial center prior to the Civil War.  The establishment of the Civil War Soldiers' Orphans Home in Cedar Falls changed the direction in which the city developed when, following the war, it became the first building on the campus of the Iowa State Normal School (now the University of Northern Iowa). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.uni.edu/collections/special-collections/university-archives/building-histories/central-hall|title=Central Hall|last=|first=|date=|website=www.library.uni.edu|publisher=Rod Library|language=en|access-date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UNI Lang Hall.JPG|thumb|Lang Hall at University of Northern Iowa (UNI)]]
[[File:Seerley 1.JPG|thumb|Seerley Hall at University of Northern Iowa]]
Besides hosting one of the three Iowa public universities, [[University of Northern Iowa]] (UNI), Cedar Falls is home to two high schools:  Valley Lutheran High School, a private Christian school, and [[Cedar Falls High School]], which is part of the public school district.  The public school district, [[Cedar Falls Community Schools]], includes two junior high schools and seven elementary schools.  There is also a private Catholic elementary school at St. Patrick Catholic Church.  The Malcolm Price Lab School/[[Northern University High School]], was a state-funded K-12 school run by the university.  It closed in 2012 following cuts at UNI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.com/2012/03/01/uni-cuts-would-be-unprecedented-faculty-leaders-say|title=UNI cuts would be 'unprecedented,' faculty leaders say|website=The Gazette|access-date=2019-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utilities and internet access==
The city owns its power, gas and water, and cable TV service. Because of this, [[Cedar Falls Utilities]] provides [[gigabit]] speeds to residents, this became available on January 14, 2015. Cedar Falls has the power to do so because, unlike 19 other states, [[Iowa]] does not prohibit [[municipal broadband]] from competing with the private cable TV [[monopoly]].
