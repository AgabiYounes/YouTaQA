For both countries, the level of trade with the other is at the top of the annual combined import-export total. Tourism and migration between the two nations have increased rapport, but border security was heightened after the [[September 11 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the United States in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Konrad and Heather Nicol, ''Beyond Walls: Re-inventing the Canada-United States Borderlands'' (2008) pp 49, 128&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. is approximately 9.25 times larger in population and has the dominant cultural and economic influence. Starting with the [[American Revolution]], when anti-American Loyalists fled to Canada, a vocal element in Canada has warned against US dominance or annexation. The [[War of 1812]] saw invasions across the border. In 1815, the war ended with the border unchanged and demilitarized, as were the [[Rush–Bagot Treaty|Great Lakes]]. The British ceased aiding Native American attacks on the United States, and the United States never again attempted to invade Canada. Apart from minor raids, it has remained peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;John Herd Thompson, ''Canada and the United States: ambivalent allies'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Britain decided to disengage, fears of an American takeover played a role in the [[Canadian Confederation|formation of the Dominion]] of Canada (1867), and Canada's [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement|rejection of free trade]] (1911). [[Ogdensburg Agreement|Military collaboration was close]] during [[World War II]] and [[Permanent Joint Board on Defense|continued]] throughout the [[Cold War]], bilaterally through [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]] and multilaterally through [[NATO]]. A very high volume of trade and migration continues between the two nations, as well as a heavy overlapping of popular and elite culture, a dynamic which has generated closer ties, especially after the signing of the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] in 1988.

The two nations have the world's longest [[Canada–United States border|shared border]] ({{convert|8,891|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Canada-U.S. border: by the numbers|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/the-canada-u-s-border-by-the-numbers-1.999207|website=cbc.ca|publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada|accessdate=March 23, 2016|date=December 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/long263.html|title=The world's longest border|accessdate=April 1, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704012434/http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/long263.html|archive-date=July 4, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also have significant interoperability within the defense sphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc.ca&quot;/&gt; Recent difficulties have included repeated trade disputes, environmental concerns, [[Keystone Pipeline|Canadian concern for the future of]] [[Petroleum|oil]] exports, and issues of illegal immigration and the threat of [[terrorism]]. Trade has continued to expand, especially following the 1988 FTA and [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in 1994 which has further merged the two economies.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Carla A. &quot;NAFTA's Economic Upsides: The View from the United States.&quot; ''Foreign Affairs'' 93 (2014): 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wilson, &quot;NAFTA's Unfinished Business: The View from Canada.&quot; ''Foreign Affairs'' (2014) 93#1 pp: 128+.&lt;/ref&gt;
Co-operation on many fronts, such as the ease of the flow of goods, services, and people across borders are to be even more extended, as well as the establishment of joint border inspection agencies, relocation of U.S. food inspectors agents to Canadian plants and vice versa, greater sharing of intelligence, and harmonizing regulations on everything from food to manufactured goods, thus further increasing the American-Canadian assemblage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/harper-obama-to-push-for-major-border-deal-1.603708 |title=Harper, Obama to begin security talks &amp;#124; CTV News |website=Ctvnews.ca |date=February 3, 2011 |accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foreign policies of the countries have been closely aligned since the [[Cold War]]. Canada has disagreed with American policies regarding the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Cuba–United States relations|status of Cuba]], the [[Iraq War]], [[National Missile Defence in Canada|Missile Defense]], and the [[War on Terror]]. A diplomatic debate has been underway in recent years on whether the [[Northwest Passage]] is in [[international waters]] or under Canadian sovereignty.

==History==

===Colonial wars===
Before the British conquest of French Canada in 1760, there had been a series of wars between the British and the French which were fought out in the colonies as well as in Europe and the high seas. In general, the British heavily relied on American colonial militia units, while the French heavily relied on their First Nation allies. The Iroquois Nation were important allies of the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas Morgan |first1=William |year=1926 |title=The Five Nations and Queen Anne |journal=Mississippi Valley Historical Review |volume=13 |issue=2|pages=169–189 |doi=10.2307/1891955 |jstor=1891955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the fighting involved ambushes and small-scale warfare in the villages along the border between New England and Quebec. The New England colonies had a much larger population than Quebec, so major invasions came from south to north.

England seized Quebec from 1629 to 1632, and Acadia in 1613 and again from 1654 to 1670; These territories were returned to France by the peace treaties. The major wars were (to use American names), [[King William's War]] (1689–1697); [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702–1713); [[King George's War]] (1744–1748), and the [[French and Indian War]] (1755–1763). In Canada, as in Europe, this era is known as the Seven Years' War.

===Mingling of peoples===
From the 1750s to the 21st century, there has been extensive mingling of the Canadian and American populations, with large movements in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples. Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;

New England [[Yankee]]s settled large parts of [[Nova Scotia]] before 1775, and were neutral during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;John Brebner, ''The Neutral Yankees of Nova Scotia: A Marginal Colony During the Revolutionary Years'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Revolution, about 75,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] moved out of the new United States to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the lands of Quebec, east and south of Montreal. From 1790 to 1812 many farmers moved from New York and New England into Ontario (mostly to Niagara, and the north shore of Lake Ontario). In the mid and late 19th century gold rushes attracted American prospectors, mostly to British Columbia after the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]], [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush]], and later to the Yukon. In the early 20th century, the opening of land blocks in the Prairie Provinces attracted many farmers from the American Midwest. Many Mennonites immigrated from Pennsylvania and formed their own colonies. In the 1890s some Mormons went north to form communities in Alberta after [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] rejected plural marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Lee Hansen, ''The Mingling of the Canadian and American Peoples. Vol. 1: Historical'' (1940); David D. Harvey, ''Americans in Canada: Migration and Settlement since 1840'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw the arrival of about 50,000 draft-dodgers who opposed the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Renee Kasinsky, &quot;Refugees from Militarism: Draft Age Americans in Canada'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, about 900,000 French Canadians moved to the U.S., with 395,000 residents there in 1900. Two-thirds went to mill towns in New England, where they formed distinctive ethnic communities. By the late 20th century, they had abandoned the French language, but most kept the Catholic religion.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Roby, ''The Franco-Americans of New England'' (2004); Elliott Robert Barkan, &quot;French Canadians&quot; in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 389–401&lt;/ref&gt; About twice as many English Canadians came to the U.S., but they did not form distinctive ethnic settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Alan A. Brookes, &quot;Canadians, British&quot; in Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) pp 191ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada was a way-station through which immigrants from other lands stopped for a while, ultimately heading to the U.S. In 1851–1951, 7.1 million people arrived in Canada (mostly from Continental Europe), and 6.6 million left Canada, most of them to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) p 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Revolutionary War===
[[File:The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec December 31 1775.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Death of General Montgomery in the Attack on Quebec, December 31, 1775]]'', by [[John Trumbull]], depicting the failed American [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)]].]]

At the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War]], the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American revolutionaries]] hoped the [[French Canadians]] in Quebec and the Colonists in [[Nova Scotia]] would join their rebellion and they were pre-approved for joining the United States in the [[Articles of Confederation]]. When [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|Canada was invaded]], thousands joined the American cause and formed regiments that fought during the war; however most remained neutral and some joined the British effort. Britain advised the French Canadians that the British Empire already enshrined their rights in the [[Quebec Act]], which the American colonies had viewed as one of the [[Intolerable Acts]]. The American invasion was a fiasco and Britain tightened its grip on its northern possessions; in 1777, a major British invasion into New York led to the surrender of the entire British army at Saratoga, and led France to enter the war as an ally of the U.S. The French Canadians largely ignored France's appeals for solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Mason Wade, ''The French Canadians, 1760–1945'' (1955) p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war Canada became a refuge for about 75,000 [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] who either wanted to leave the U.S., or were compelled by Patriot reprisals to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Allen, ''Tories: Fighting for the King in America's First Civil War'' (2010) p xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the original Loyalists there were 3,500 free African Americans. Most went to Nova Scotia and in 1792, 1200 migrated to [[Sierra Leone]]. About 2000 black slaves were brought in by Loyalist owners; they remained slaves in Canada until the Empire abolished slavery in 1833. Before 1860, about 30,000–40,000 black people entered Canada; many were already free and others were escaped slaves who came through the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Bode, &quot;Upper Canada, 1793: Simcoe and the Slaves,&quot; ''Beaver'' 1993 73(3): 17–19; Paul Robert Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples'' (1999) p 142–3&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of 1812===
{{main|War of 1812}}
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the war, called for British forces to vacate all their forts south of the [[Great Lakes]] border. Britain refused to do so, citing failure of the United States to provide financial restitution for Loyalists who had lost property in the war. The [[Jay Treaty]] in 1795 with Great Britain resolved that lingering issue and the British departed the forts. [[Thomas Jefferson]] saw the nearby British imperial presence as a threat to the [[United States]], and so he opposed the [[Jay Treaty]], and it became one of the major political issues in the United States at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Perkins, ''The First Rapprochement: England and the United States, 1795–1805'' (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Americans immigrated to Upper Canada (Ontario) from 1785 to 1812 to obtain cheaper land and better tax rates prevalent in that province; despite expectations that they would be loyal to the U.S. if a war broke out, in the event they were largely non-political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=George A.|last=Rawlyk|title=The Canada Fire: Radical Evangelicalism in British North America, 1775–1812|url=https://archive.org/details/canadafire0000unse|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/canadafire0000unse/page/122 122]|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9780773512214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions mounted again after 1805, erupting into the [[War of 1812]], when the United States declared war on Britain. The Americans were angered by British harassment of U.S. ships on the high seas and [[Impressment|seizure of 6,000 sailors from American ships]], severe restrictions against neutral American trade with France, and British support for hostile Indian tribes in Ohio and territories the U.S. had gained in 1783. American &quot;honor&quot; was an implicit issue. While the Americans could not hope to defeat the [[Royal Navy]] and control the seas, they could call on an army much larger than the British garrison in Canada, and so a land invasion of Canada was proposed as the most advantageous means of attacking the British Empire. Americans on the western frontier also hoped an invasion would bring an end to British support of [[American Indians in the United States|Native American]] resistance to [[Westward expansion of the United States|American expansion]], typified by [[Tecumseh]]'s coalition of tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, &amp; Indian Allies'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Americans may also have wanted to acquire Canada.{{sfn|Stagg|2012|pp=5–6}}&lt;ref&gt;George F.

Once war broke out, the American strategy was to seize Canada. There was some hope that settlers in western Canada—most of them recent immigrants from the U.S.—would welcome the chance to overthrow their British rulers. However, the American invasions were defeated primarily by British regulars with support from Native Americans and [[Upper Canada]] militia. Aided by the large Royal Navy, a series of British raids on the American coast were highly successful, culminating with an [[Burning of Washington|attack on Washington]] that resulted in the British burning of the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|the Capitol]], and other public buildings. However, the later battles of [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]], [[Battle of Plattsburg|Plattsburg]], and [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] all ended in defeat for the British. At the end of the war, Britain's American Indian allies had largely been defeated, and the Americans controlled a strip of Western Ontario centered on [[Amherstburg|Fort Malden]]. However, Britain held much of Maine, and, with the support of their remaining American Indian allies, huge areas of the Old Northwest, including [[Wisconsin]] and much of [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]]. With the surrender of Napoleon in 1814, Britain ended naval policies that angered Americans; with the defeat of the Indian tribes the threat to American expansion was ended. The upshot was both the United States and Canada asserted their sovereignty, Canada remained under British rule, and London and Washington had nothing more to fight over. The war was ended by the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which took effect in February 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2007) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] perspective.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of postwar agreements further stabilized peaceful relations along the Canadian-US border. Canada reduced American immigration for fear of undue American influence, and built up the Anglican church as a counterweight to the largely American Methodist and Baptist churches.&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Morton, ''The Kingdom of Canada'' (1969) ch 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Anglophone Canadians, especially in Ontario, viewed the War of 1812 as a heroic and successful resistance against invasion and as a victory that defined them as a people. The myth that the Canadian militia had defeated the invasion almost single-handed, known logically as the &quot;militia myth&quot;, became highly prevalent after the war, having been propounded by [[John Strachan]], [[Toronto|Anglican Bishop of York]]. Meanwhile, the United States celebrated victory in its &quot;Second War of Independence,&quot; and war heroes such as [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] headed to the White House.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Langguth, ''Union 1812: The Americans Who Fought the Second War of Independence'' (2006) ch 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative reaction===
In the aftermath of the War of 1812, pro-imperial conservatives led by Anglican Bishop [[John Strachan]] took control in Ontario (&quot;Upper Canada&quot;), and promoted the Anglican religion as opposed to the more republican Methodist and Baptist churches. A small interlocking elite, known as the [[Family Compact]] took full political control. Democracy, as practiced in the US, was ridiculed. The policies had the desired effect of deterring immigration from United States. [[Rebellions of 1837|Revolts in favor of democracy]] in Ontario and Quebec (&quot;Lower Canada&quot;) in 1837 were suppressed; many of the leaders fled to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunning | first1 = Tom | year = 2009 | title = The Canadian Rebellions of 1837 and 1838 as a Borderland War: A Retrospective | url = | journal = Ontario History | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 129–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American policy was to largely ignore the rebellions,&lt;ref&gt;Orrin Edward Tiffany, ''The Relations of the United States to the Canadian Rebellion of 1837–1838'' (1905). [https://www.amazon.com/Relations-United-Canadian-Rebellion-1837-1838/dp/1236388712/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed ignore Canada generally in favor of westward expansion of the [[American Frontier]].

===Civil War===
{{Main|Canada in the American Civil War}}
Great Britain and Canada were neutral in the American Civil War, and about 40,000 Canadian citizens volunteered for the Union Army—many already lived in the U.S., and a few for the South.&lt;ref&gt;Robin W. Winks, &quot;The Creation of a Myth: 'Canadian' Enlistments in the Northern Armies during the American Civil War,&quot; ''Canadian Historical Review,'' 1958 39(1): 24–40.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, hundreds of  Americans who were called up in the draft fled to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Mayers, '' Dixie &amp; the Dominion: Canada, the Confederacy, and the War for the Union'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 the Confederate government tried to use Canada as a base to attack American border towns. [[St. Albans Raid|They raided the town St. Albans Vermont On Oct 19, 1864]], killing an American citizen and robbing three banks of over $200,000 dollars. The three Confederates escaped to Canada where they were arrested, but then released. Many Americans suspected – falsely – that the Canadian government knew of the raid ahead of time. There was widespread anger when the raiders were released by a local court in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Mayers, ''Dixie &amp; the Dominion'' pp 105-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] let the British government know, &quot;it is impossible to consider those proceedings as either legal, just or friendly towards the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Congressional series of United States public documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oEtHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71|year=1870|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alabama claims===
[[File:CanadianAmericaRelationsCartoon1886.gif|thumb|An editorial cartoon on Canada–United States relations, 1886. It reads: Mrs. Britannia.—&quot;Is it possible, my dear, that you have ever given your cousin Jonathan any encouragement?&quot; Miss Canada.—&quot;Encouragement! Certainly not, Mamma. I have told him that we can never be united.&quot;]]
At the end of the Civil War in 1865, Americans were angry at British support for the Confederacy. One result was toleration of [[Fenian raids|Fenian efforts to use the U.S. as a base to attack Canada.]] More serious was the demand for a huge payment to cover the damages caused, on the notion that British involvement had lengthened the war. Senator [[Charles Sumner]], the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, originally wanted to ask for $2 billion, or alternatively the ceding of all of Canada to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jay|last=Sexton|title=Debtor Diplomacy: Finance and American Foreign Relations in the Civil War Era, 1837–1873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TuepT3C0TCsC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=206|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9780199281039}}&lt;/ref&gt; When American Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] with Russia in 1867, he intended it as the first step in a comprehensive plan to gain control of the entire northwest Pacific Coast. Seward was a firm believer in [[Manifest Destiny]], primarily for its commercial advantages to the U.S. Seward expected [[British Columbia]] to seek annexation to the U.S. and thought Britain might accept this in exchange for the ''Alabama'' claims. Soon other elements endorsed annexation, Their plan was to annex [[British Columbia]], [[Red River Colony]] (Manitoba), and [[Nova Scotia]], in exchange for the dropping the damage claims. The idea reached a peak in the spring and summer of 1870, with American expansionists, Canadian separatists, and British anti-imperialists seemingly combining forces. The plan was dropped for multiple reasons. London continued to stall, American commercial and financial groups pressed Washington for a quick settlement of the dispute on a cash basis, growing Canadian nationalist sentiment in British Columbia called for staying inside the British Empire, Congress became preoccupied with Reconstruction, and most Americans showed little interest in territorial expansion. The &quot;[[Alabama Claims]]&quot; dispute went to international arbitration. In one of the first major cases of arbitration, the tribunal in 1872 supported the American claims and ordered Britain to pay $15.5 million. Britain paid and the episode ended in peaceful relations.&lt;ref&gt;Doris W. Dashew, &quot;The Story of An Illusion: The Plan To Trade 'Alabama' Claims For Canada,&quot; ''Civil War History,'' December 1969, Vol. 15 Issue 4, pp 332–348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shi | first1 = David E. | year = 1978 | title = Seward's Attempt to Annex British Columbia, 1865–1869 | journal = Pacific Historical Review | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 217–238 | doi=10.2307/3637972 | jstor=3637972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominion of Canada===
Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867 in internal affairs while Britain controlled diplomacy and defence policy. Prior to Confederation, there was an [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in which the Americans claimed the 54th degree latitude. That issue was resolved by splitting the disputed territory; the northern half became British Columbia, and the southern half the states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. Strained relations with America continued, however, due to a series of small-scale armed incursions named the [[Fenian raids]] by [[Irish American|Irish-American]] Civil War veterans across the border from 1866 to 1871 in an attempt to trade Canada for Irish independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yossi|last=Shain|title=Marketing the American Creed Abroad: Diasporas in the U.S. and Their Homelands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pqj8GFCg7MC&amp;pg=PA53|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=53|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9780521642255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American government, angry at Canadian tolerance of Confederate raiders during the American Civil War, moved very slowly to disarm the [[Fenians]]. The British government, in charge of diplomatic relations, protested cautiously, as Anglo-American relations were tense. Much of the tension was relieved as the Fenians faded away and in 1872 by the settlement of the [[Alabama Claims]], when Britain paid the U.S. $15.5 million for war losses caused by warships built in Britain and sold to the Confederacy.

Disputes over ocean boundaries on [[Georges Bank]] and over fishing, whaling, and sealing rights in the Pacific were settled by international arbitration, setting an important precedent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mark|last=Kurlansky|title=Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World|url=https://archive.org/details/cod00mark|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|page=[https://archive.org/details/cod00mark/page/117 117]|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9781440672873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emigration to and from the United States of America===
{{Further|French American}}
After 1850, the pace of industrialization and urbanization was much faster in the United States, drawing a wide range of immigrants from the North. By 1870, 1/6 of all the people born in Canada had moved to the United States, with the highest concentrations in New England, which was the destination of Francophone emigrants from Quebec and Anglophone emigrants from the Maritimes. It was common for people to move back and forth across the border, such as seasonal lumberjacks, entrepreneurs looking for larger markets, and families looking for jobs in the textile mills that paid much higher wages than in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Bukowczyk et al. ''Permeable Border: The Great Lakes Region as Transnational Region, 1650–1990'' (University of Pittsburgh Press. 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The southward migration slacked off after 1890, as Canadian industry began a growth spurt. By then, the American frontier was closing, and thousands of farmers looking for fresh land moved from the United States north into the Prairie Provinces. The net result of the flows were that in 1901 there were 128,000 American-born residents in Canada (3.5% of the Canadian population) and 1.18 million Canadian-born residents in the United States (1.6% of the U.S. population).&lt;ref&gt;J. Castell Hopkins, ''The Canadian Annual Review of Public Affairs: 1902'' (1903), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alaska boundary===
A short-lived controversy was the [[Alaska boundary dispute]], settled in favor of the United States in 1903. The issue was unimportant until a gold rush brought tens of thousands of men to Canada's Yukon, and they had to arrive through American ports. Canada needed its port and claimed that it had a legal right to a port near the present American town of [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], Alaska. It would provide an all-Canadian route to the rich goldfields. The dispute was settled by arbitration, and the British delegate voted with the Americans—to the astonishment and disgust of Canadians who suddenly realized that Britain considered its relations with the United States paramount compared to those with Canada. The arbitration validated the status quo, but made Canada angry at London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Munro | first1 = John A. | year = 1965 | title = English-Canadianism and the Demand for Canadian Autonomy: Ontario's Response to the Alaska Boundary Decision, 1903 | url = | journal = Ontario History | volume = 57 | issue = 4| pages = 189–203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David G.

1907 saw a minor controversy over [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS ''Nashville'']] sailing into the Great Lakes via Canada without Canadian permission. To head off future embarrassments, in 1909 the two sides signed the [[International Boundary Waters Treaty]] and the [[International Joint Commission]] was established to manage the Great Lakes and keep them disarmed. It was amended in World War II to allow the building and training of warships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Spencer|last=Tucker|title=World War II at Sea: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0nrSWUHx6sC&amp;pg=PA142|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=142|isbn=9781598844573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadian autonomy===
Canada demanded and received permission from London to send its own delegation to the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Talks]] in 1919, with the proviso that it sign the treaty under the British Empire. Canada subsequently took responsibility for its own foreign and military affairs in the 1920s. Its first ambassador to the United States, [[Vincent Massey]], was named in 1927. The United States first ambassador to Canada was [[William Phillips (diplomat)|William Phillips]]. Canada became an active member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], the [[League of Nations]], and the [[Permanent Court of International Justice|World Court]], none of which included the U.S.

In July 1923, as part of his Pacific Northwest tour and a week before his death, US President [[Warren Harding]] visited [[Vancouver]], making him the first head of state of the United States to visit Canada. The then Premier of British Columbia, [[John Oliver (British Columbia politician)|John Oliver]], and then mayor of Vancouver, [[Charles Tisdall]], hosted a lunch in his honor at the [[Hotel Vancouver]].

Relations with the United States were cordial until 1930, when Canada vehemently protested the new [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act]] by which the U.S. raised tariffs (taxes) on products imported from Canada. Canada retaliated with higher tariffs of its own against American products, and moved toward more trade within the British Commonwealth. U.S.–Canadian trade fell 75% as the [[Great Depression]] dragged both countries down.&lt;ref&gt;Richard N. Kottman, &quot;Herbert Hoover and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study,&quot; ''Journal of American History'', Vol. 62, No. 3 (December 1975), pp. 609–635 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2936217 in JSTOR]

Down to the 1920s the war and naval departments of both nations designed hypothetical war game scenarios on paper with the other as an enemy. These were routine training exercises; the departments were never told to get ready for a real war. In 1921, Canada developed [[Defence Scheme No. 1]] for an attack on American cities and for forestalling invasion by the United States until [[British Empire|Imperial]] reinforcements arrived. Through the later 1920s and 1930s, the [[United States Army War College]] developed a plan for a war with the [[British Empire]] waged largely on North American territory, in [[War Plan Red]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/29/AR2005122901412_2.html |work=The Washington Post |first=Peter |last=Carlson |title=Raiding the Icebox |date=December 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, as the roots of [[World War II]] were set in motion, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt gave a public speech at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, declaring that the United States would not sit idly by if another power tried to dominate Canada. Diplomats saw it as a clear warning to Germany not to attack Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. Offner, ''American Appeasement: United States Foreign Policy and Germany, 1933–1938'' (1969) p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Mountie and Trooper 1941.jpg|thumb|left|A Canadian [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mountie]] and a [[Vermont State Police|Vermont State Trooper]] on their respective sides of the Canada–United States ([[Quebec]]–[[Vermont]]) border in 1941]]
The two nations cooperated closely in World War II,&lt;ref&gt;Galen Roger Perras, ''Franklin Roosevelt and the Origins of the Canadian-American Security Alliance, 1933–1945'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; as both nations saw new levels of prosperity and a determination to defeat the [[Axis powers]]. Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] were determined not to repeat the mistakes of their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Jensen, &quot;Nationalism and Civic Duty in Wartime: Comparing World Wars in Canada and America,&quot; ''Canadian Issues / Thèmes Canadiens,'' December 2004, pp 6–10&lt;/ref&gt; They met in August 1940 at Ogdensburg, issuing a declaration calling for close cooperation, and formed the [[Permanent Joint Board on Defense]] (PJBD).

King sought to raise Canada's international visibility by hosting the August 1943 [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quadrant conference]] in Quebec on military and political strategy; he was a gracious host but was kept out of the important meetings by [[Winston Churchill]] and Roosevelt.

Canada allowed the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]] and participated in the building of the atomic bomb. 49,000 Americans joined the RCAF (Canadian) or RAF (British) air forces through the [[Clayton Knight Committee]], which had Roosevelt's permission to recruit in the U.S. in 1940–42.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Lea Heide, &quot;Allies in Complicity: The United States, Canada, and the Clayton Knight Committee's Clandestine Recruiting of Americans for the Royal Canadian Air Force, 1940–1942,&quot; ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association, 2004'', Vol. 15, pp 207–230&lt;/ref&gt;

American attempts in the mid-1930s to integrate British Columbia into a united West Coast military command had aroused Canadian opposition. Fearing a Japanese invasion of Canada's vulnerable coast, American officials urged the creation of a united military command for an eastern Pacific Ocean [[Theater (warfare)|theater of war]]. Canadian leaders feared [[American imperialism]] and the loss of autonomy more than a Japanese invasion. In 1941, Canadians successfully argued within the PJBD for mutual cooperation rather than unified command for the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;Galen Roger Perras, &quot;Who Will Defend British Columbia? Unity of Command on the West Coast, 1934–1942,&quot; ''Pacific Northwest Quarterly,'' Spring 1997, Vol. 88 Issue 2, pp 59–69&lt;/ref&gt;

====Newfoundland====
The United States built large military bases in [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] during World War II. At the time it was a British crown colony, having lost dominion status. The American spending ended the depression and brought new prosperity; Newfoundland's business community sought closer ties with the United States as expressed by the [[Economic Union Party]]. Ottawa took notice and wanted Newfoundland to join Canada, which it did after hotly contested referenda. There was little demand in the United States for the acquisition of Newfoundland, so the United States did not protest the British decision not to allow an American option on the [[1948 Newfoundland referendums|Newfoundland referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McNeil Earle |first1=Karl |year=1998 |title=Cousins of a Kind: The Newfoundland and Labrador Relationship with the United States |journal=American Review of Canadian Studies |volume=28 |issue=4|pages=387–411 |doi=10.1080/02722019809481611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cold War===
Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], working closely with his Foreign Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]], handled foreign relations 1945-48 in cautious fashion. Canada donated money to Britain to help it rebuild; was elected to the UN Security Council; and helped design NATO. However, Mackenzie King rejected free trade with the United States,&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Stacey, ''Canada and the Age of Conflict: A History of Canadian External Policies. Volume 2, 1921–1948: The Mackenzie King Era'' (1982) pp 420-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and decided not to play a role in the Berlin airlift.&lt;ref&gt;Hector Mackenzie,  &quot;Golden Decade (s)? Reappraising Canada's International Relations in the 1940s and 1950s.&quot; ''British Journal of Canadian Studies'' 23.2 (2010): 179-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  Canada had been actively involved in the League of Nations, primarily because it could act separately from Britain. It played a [[Canada and the United Nations|modest role in the postwar formation of the United Nations]], as well as the [[International Monetary Fund]]. It played a somewhat larger role in 1947 in designing the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Don Munton and John Kirton, eds. ''Cases and Readings in Canadian Foreign Policy Since World War II'' (1992) pp 2-18.&lt;/ref&gt; 
As Britain's influence as a global imperial power declined, Canada and the United States became extremely close partners. Canada was a close ally of the United States during the [[Cold War]].

===Nixon Shock 1971===
[[File:President Nixon Addresses a joint session of the Canadian Parliament, in Ottawa, Canada - NARA - 194761.tif|thumb|left|Richard Nixon [[joint address (Canada)|addresses a joint session]] of the Parliament of Canada, 1972]]
The United States had become Canada's largest market, and after the war the Canadian economy became dependent on smooth trade flows with the United States so much that in 1971 when the United States enacted the &quot;[[Nixon Shock]]&quot; economic policies (including a 10% tariff on all imports) it put the Canadian government into a panic. Washington refused to exempt Canada from its 1971 New Economic Policy, so Trudeau saw a solution in closer economic ties with Europe.  Trudeau proposed a  &quot;[[Third Option]]&quot; policy of diversifying Canada's trade and downgrading the importance of the American market.  In a 1972 speech in Ottawa, Nixon declared the &quot;special relationship&quot; between Canada and the United States dead.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Muirhead, &quot;From Special Relationship to Third Option: Canada, the U.S., and the Nixon Shock,&quot; ''American Review of Canadian Studies,'' Vol. 34, 2004 [https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5008438189 online edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations deteriorated on many points in the Nixon years (1969–74), including trade disputes, defense agreements, energy, fishing, the environment, cultural imperialism, and foreign policy. They changed for the better when Trudeau and [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|President Jimmy Carter (1977-1981)]] found a better rapport. The late 1970s saw a more sympathetic American attitude toward Canadian political and economic needs, the pardoning of draft evaders who had moved to Canada, and the passing of old such as Watergate and the Vietnam War. Canada more than ever welcomed American investments during &quot;the stagflation&quot; that hurt both nations.&lt;ref&gt;Lily Gardner Feldman, &quot;Canada and the United States in the 1970s: Rift and Reconciliation.&quot; ''The World Today'' 34.12 (1978): 484-492.

===1990s===
The main issues in Canada–U.S. relations in the 1990s focused on the NAFTA agreement, which was signed in 1994. It created a common market that by 2014 was worth $19 trillion, encompassed 470 million people, and had created millions of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Carla A. &quot;NAFTA's Economic Upsides: The View from the United States.&quot; ''Foreign Affairs'' 93 (2014): 122.

==Anti-Americanism==
{{further|Anti-Americanism#Canada}}
Since the arrival of the Loyalists as refugees from the American Revolution in the 1780s, historians have identified a constant theme of Canadian fear of the United States and of &quot;[[Americanization]]&quot; or a cultural takeover. In the War of 1812, for example, the enthusiastic response by French militia to defend Lower Canada reflected, according to Heidler and Heidler (2004), &quot;the fear of Americanization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Stephen Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' (2004) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have traced this attitude over time in Ontario and Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Granatstein, ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian intellectuals who wrote about the U.S. in the first half of the 20th century identified America as the world center of modernity, and deplored it. Imperialists (who admired the British Empire) explained that Canadians had narrowly escaped American conquest with its rejection of tradition, its worship of &quot;progress&quot; and technology, and its mass culture; they explained that Canada was much better because of its commitment to orderly government and societal harmony. There were a few ardent defenders of the nation to the south, notably liberal and socialist intellectuals such as [[F. R. Scott]] and Jean-Charles Harvey (1891–1967).&lt;ref&gt;Damien-Claude Bélanger, ''Prejudice and Pride: Canadian Intellectuals Confront the United States, 1891–1945'' (University of Toronto Press, 2011), pp 16, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at television, Collins (1990) finds that it is in English Canada that fear of cultural Americanization is most powerful, for there the attractions of the U.S. are strongest.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Collins, ''Culture, Communication, and National Identity: The Case of Canadian Television'' (U. of Toronto Press, 1990) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Meren (2009) argues that after 1945, the emergence of Quebec nationalism and the desire to preserve French-Canadian cultural heritage led to growing anxiety regarding American cultural imperialism and Americanization.&lt;ref&gt;David Meren, &quot;'Plus que jamais nécessaires': Cultural Relations, Nationalism and the State in the Canada-Quebec-France Triangle, 1945–1960,&quot; ''Journal of the Canadian Historical Association'', 2009, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 279–305,&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 surveys showed that 60 percent of Québécois had a fear of Americanization, while other surveys showed they preferred their current situation to that of the Americans in the realms of health care, quality of life as seniors, environmental quality, poverty, educational system, racism and standard of living. While agreeing that job opportunities are greater in America, 89 percent disagreed with the notion that they would rather be in the United States, and they were more likely to feel closer to English Canadians than to Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated114&quot;&gt;Paula Ruth Gilbert, ''Violence and the Female Imagination: Quebec's Women Writers'' (2006) p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is evidence that the elites and Quebec are much less fearful of Americanization, and much more open to economic integration than the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated114&quot; /&gt;

The history has been traced in detail by a leading Canadian historian J.L. Granatstein in ''Yankee Go Home: Canadians and Anti-Americanism'' (1997). Current studies report the phenomenon persists. Two scholars report, &quot;Anti-Americanism is alive and well in Canada today, strengthened by, among other things, disputes related to NAFTA, American involvement in the Middle East, and the ever-increasing Americanization of Canadian culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Barbara S. |last1=Groseclose |first2=Jochen |last2=Wierich |title=Internationalizing the History of American Art: Views |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXqgwtSEupQC&amp;pg=PA105 |year=2009| publisher=Penn State Press |page=105 |accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=978-0271032009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamie Glazov writes, &quot;More than anything else, Diefenbaker became the tragic victim of Canadian anti-Americanism, a sentiment the prime minister had fully embraced by 1962.

Wennersten writes, &quot;But at the heart of Canadian anti-Americanism lies a cultural bitterness that takes an American expatriate unaware.

==Relations between political executives==
The executive of each country is represented differently. The [[President of the United States]] serves as both the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and his &quot;administration&quot; is the executive, while the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] is head of government only, and his or her &quot;government&quot; or &quot;ministry&quot; directs the executive.

On December 7, 2011, Harper flew to Washington, met with Obama and signed an agreement to implement the joint action plans that had been developed since the initial meeting in February. The plans called on both countries to spend more on border infrastructure, share more information on people who cross the border, and acknowledge more of each other's safety and security inspection on third-country traffic. An editorial in ''The Globe and Mail'' praised the agreement for giving Canada the ability to track whether failed refugee claimants have left Canada via the U.S. and for eliminating &quot;duplicated baggage screenings on connecting flights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/editorials/canada-us-border-agreement-a-good-thing/article2263711/ |location=Toronto |work=The Globe and Mail |title=Canada-U.S. border agreement a good thing |date=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement is not a legally binding treaty, and relies on the political will and ability of the executives of both governments to implement the terms of the agreement. These types of executive agreements are routine—on both sides of the Canada–U.S. border.

President Barack Obama and Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] first met formally at the [[APEC Philippines 2015|APEC summit meeting]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] in November 2015, nearly a week after the latter was sworn into the office. Both leaders expressed eagerness for increased cooperation and coordination between the two countries during the course of Trudeau's government with Trudeau promising an &quot;enhanced Canada–U.S. partnership&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jordan|first1=Roger|title=Trudeau promises Obama an enhanced Canada-US partnership|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/11/20/cana-n20.html|accessdate=January 2, 2016|work=[[World Socialist Web Site]]|publisher=[[International Committee of the Fourth International]]|date=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2015, Obama announced the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s rejection of the proposed [[Keystone Pipeline#Phase 4 (cancelled)|Keystone XL pipeline]], the fourth phase of the [[Keystone Pipeline|Keystone]] [[oil pipeline]] system running between Canada and the United States, to which Trudeau expressed disappointment but said that the rejection would not damage Canada–U.S. relations and would instead provide a &quot;fresh start&quot; to strengthening ties through cooperation and coordination, saying that &quot;the Canada–U.S. relationship is much bigger than any one project.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Kathleen|title=Justin Trudeau 'disappointed' with U.S. rejection of Keystone XL|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-keystone-pipeline-trudeau-obama-1.3307458|accessdate=January 2, 2016|work=[[CBC News]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama has since praised Trudeau's efforts to prioritize the reduction of [[climate change]], calling it &quot;extraordinarily helpful&quot; to establish a [[Paris Agreement|worldwide consensus]] on addressing the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Chris|title=Trudeau warmly embraced by Obama, but don't expect concessions from U.S.|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-barack-obama-apec-chris-hall-1.3326179|accessdate=January 2, 2016|work=[[CBC News]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Trudeau has told Obama his plans to withdraw Canada's [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet]] jets [[Operation Impact|assisting]] in the [[Military intervention against ISIL#US-led coalitions|American-led intervention]] against [[ISIL]], Trudeau said that Canada will still &quot;do more than its part&quot; in combating the terrorist group by increasing the number of [[Canadian Special Operations Forces Command|Canadian special forces]] members training and fighting on ground in [[Iraq]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cullen|first1=Catherine|title=Justin Trudeau says Canada to increase number of training troops in Iraq|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-iraq-trainers-military-1.3322288|accessdate=January 2, 2016|work=[[CBC News]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, after Trudeau said that Canadians would not be &quot;pushed around&quot; by the [[Trump tariffs]] on Canada's aluminum and steel, Trump labelled Trudeau as &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;meek&quot;, and accused Trudeau of making &quot;false statements&quot;, although it is unclear which statements Trump was referring to.

The [[Canadian Forces|Canadian military]], like forces of other NATO countries, fought alongside the United States in most major conflicts since [[World War II]], including the [[Korean War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[Kosovo War]], and most recently the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. The main exceptions to this were the Canadian government's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Iraq War]], which caused some brief diplomatic tensions. Despite these issues, military relations have remained close.

==Trade==
{{Main|Canada–United States trade relations}}
Canada and the United States have the world's largest trading relationship, with huge quantities of goods and people flowing across the border each year. Since the 1987 [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]], there have been no [[tariff]]s on most goods passed between the two countries.

In the course of the [[Canada–United States softwood lumber dispute|softwood lumber dispute]], the U.S. has placed tariffs on Canadian [[softwood lumber]] because of what it argues is an unfair Canadian government subsidy, a claim which Canada disputes. The dispute has cycled through several agreements and arbitration cases. Other notable disputes include the [[Canadian Wheat Board]], and Canadian cultural &quot;restrictions&quot; on magazines and television (See [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], and [[National Film Board of Canada]]). Canadians have been criticized about such things as the ban on [[beef]] since a case of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|Mad Cow disease]] was discovered in 2003 in cows from the United States (and a few subsequent cases) and the high American [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]]. Concerns in Canada also run high over aspects of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) such as Chapter 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric|last=Miller|title=The Outlier Sectors: Areas of Non-free Trade in the North American Free Trade Agreement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwit1QwswY0C&amp;pg=PA19|year=2002|publisher=BID-INTAL|page=19|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9789507381287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]] of 1972 is another historic example of joint cooperation in controlling trans-border water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawa.usembassy.gov/content/textonly.asp?section=can_usa&amp;document=environment|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527153939/http://ottawa.usembassy.gov/content/textonly.asp?section=can_usa&amp;document=environment |archivedate=May 27, 2010|title=The Embassy of the U.S.A., Ottawa – United States – Canada Relations|author=GMcKeating|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been some disputes. Most recently, the [[Devil's Lake (North Dakota)|Devil's Lake]] Outlet, a project instituted by North Dakota, has angered Manitobans who fear that their water may soon become polluted as a result of this project.

Beginning in 1986 the Canadian government of Brian Mulroney began pressing the Reagan administration for an &quot;Acid Rain Treaty&quot; in order to do something about U.S. industrial air pollution causing [[acid rain]] in Canada. The Reagan administration was hesitant, and questioned the science behind Mulroney's claims. However, Mulroney was able to prevail. The product was the signing and ratification of the [[Air Quality Agreement]] of 1991 by the first Bush administration. Under that treaty, the two governments consult semi-annually on trans-border air pollution, which has demonstrably reduced acid rain, and they have since signed an annex to the treaty dealing with [[ground level ozone]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progsregs/usca/index.htm|title=Clean Air Markets|accessdate=April 27, 2016|date=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/air/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=83930AC3-1|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada – Air – Canada- United States Air Quality Agreement|accessdate=April 27, 2016|date=January 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/exclusive-interview-brian-mulroney-remembers-his-friend-ronald-reagan|title=Exclusive Interview: Brian Mulroney remembers his friend Ronald Reagan|website=News.nationalpost.com|date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-06/news/mn-139_1 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Kenneth | last1=Freed | first2=James | last2=Gerstenzang | date=April 6, 1987 | title=Mulroney Asks Reagan for Treaty on Acid Rain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, trans-border air pollution remains an issue, particularly in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence watershed during the summer.

Currently neither of the countries' governments support the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which set out time scheduled curbing of greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike the United States, Canada has ratified the agreement. Yet after ratification, due to internal political conflict within Canada, the Canadian government does not enforce the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and has received criticism from environmental groups and from other governments for its climate change positions. In January 2011, the [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Canadian minister of the environment]], [[Peter Kent]], explicitly stated that the policy of his government with regards to greenhouse gas emissions reductions is to wait for the United States to act first, and then try to harmonize with that action – a position that has been condemned by environmentalists and Canadian nationalists, and as well as scientists and government think-tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.canoe.ca/money/business/canada/archives/2011/01/20110128-152706.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110706171230/http://money.canoe.ca/money/business/canada/archives/2011/01/20110128-152706.html |archivedate=July 6, 2011|title=Canada's environment policy to follow the U.S.: Minister|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climateprosperity.ca/eng/studies/canada-us/report/media-release-canada-us-report-eng.php|title=Resources – Climate Prosperity|accessdate=April 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706173124/http://www.climateprosperity.ca/eng/studies/canada-us/report/media-release-canada-us-report-eng.php|archive-date=July 6, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newfoundland fisheries dispute===
The United States and Britain had a long-standing dispute about the rights of Americans fishing in the waters near Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael Rheta Martin|title=Dictionary of American History: With the Complete Text of the Constitution of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqG-B4jsMIAC&amp;pg=PA227|year=1978|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=227|accessdate=November 6, 2015|isbn=9780822601241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1776, there was no question that American fishermen, mostly from Massachusetts, had rights to use the waters off Newfoundland. In the peace treaty negotiations of 1783, the Americans insisted on a statement of these rights. However, France, an American ally, disputed the American position because France had its own specified rights in the area and wanted them to be exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=Orville T. |year=1965 |title=The Comte De Vergennes, The Newfoundland Fisheries And The Peace Negotiation Of 1783: A Reconsideration |journal=Canadian Historical Review |volume=46 |issue=1|pages=32–46 |doi=10.3138/chr-046-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] gave the Americans not rights, but rather &quot;liberties&quot; to fish within the territorial waters of British North America and to dry fish on certain coasts.

After the War of 1812, the Convention of 1818 between the United States and Britain specified exactly what liberties were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Golladay |first1=V.

The [[Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty]] of 1854, and the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington of 1871]] spelled-out the liberties in more detail. However the Treaty of Washington expired in 1885, and there was a continuous round of disputes over jurisdictions and liberties. Britain and the United States sent the issue to the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in The Hague in 1909.

In 2003, the American government became concerned when members of the Canadian government announced plans to [[decriminalization|decriminalize]] [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. David Murray, an assistant to U.S. [[Director of the National Drug Control Policy|Drug Czar]] [[John P.

We would be forced to respond.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/05/02/us_pot_rxn030502.html |title=U.S. warns Canada against easing pot laws |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=May 2, 2003 |accessdate=February 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324005525/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/05/02/us_pot_rxn030502.html |archivedate=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[2006 Canadian federal election|election]] of the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] in early 2006 halted the liberalization of marijuana laws for the foreseeable future.

A 2007 joint report by American and Canadian officials on cross-border drug smuggling indicated that, despite their best efforts, &quot;drug trafficking still occurs in significant quantities in both directions across the border. The principal illicit substances smuggled across our shared border are [[MDMA]] (''Ecstasy''), [[cocaine]], and [[marijuana]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://etacanadaonline.com/ |title = ETA Canada Visa Application - Apply for Canadian E-Visa Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report indicated that Canada was a major producer of ''Ecstasy'' and marijuana for the U.S. market, while the U.S. was a transit country for cocaine entering Canada.

===Views of presidents and prime ministers===
Presidents and prime ministers typically make formal or informal statements that indicate the diplomatic policy of their administration. Diplomats and journalists at the time—and historians since—dissect the nuances and tone to detect the warmth or coolness of the relationship.
* Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]], speaking at the beginning of the [[1891 Canadian federal election|1891 election]] (fought mostly over [[Reciprocity (Canadian politics)|Canadian free trade with the United States]]), arguing against closer trade relations with the U.S. stated &quot;As for myself, my course is clear. A [[British subject]] I was born—a British subject I will die. With my utmost effort, with my latest breath, will I oppose the ‘veiled treason’ which attempts by sordid means and mercenary proffers to lure our people from their allegiance.&quot; (February 3, 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Histor!ca [http://www.histori.ca/prodev/article.do;jsessionid=8D3831D48EE489EBCF46813C8427E685.tomcat1?id=15356 &quot;Election of 1891: A Question of Loyalty&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406092452/http://www.histori.ca/prodev/article.do%3Bjsessionid%3D8D3831D48EE489EBCF46813C8427E685.tomcat1?id=15356 |date=April 6, 2008 }}, James Marsh.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Canada's first Prime Minister also said:
{{quote|It has been said that the United States Government is a failure. I don't go so far. On the contrary, I consider it a marvelous exhibition of human wisdom. It was as perfect as human wisdom could make it, and under it the American States greatly prospered until very recently; but being the work of men it had its defects, and it is for us to take advantage by experience, and endeavor to see if we cannot arrive by careful study at such a plan as will avoid the mistakes of our neighbors. In the first place we know that every individual state was an individual sovereignty—that each had its own army and navy and political organization – and when they formed themselves into a confederation they only gave the central authority certain specific rights appertaining to sovereign powers. The dangers that have risen from this system we will avoid if we can agree upon forming a strong central government—a great Central Legislature—a constitution for a Union which will have all the rights of sovereignty except those that are given to the local governments. Then we shall have taken a great step in advance of the American Republic. (September 12, 1864)}}

Macdonald: The Old Chieftain'' (1955) p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;
* After the World War II years of close military and economic cooperation, President [[Harry S. Truman]] said in 1947 that &quot;Canada and the United States have reached the point where we can no longer think of each other as 'foreign' countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Council on Foreign Relations, ''Documents on American foreign relations'' (1957) Volume 9 p 558&lt;/ref&gt;
* President [[John F. Kennedy]] told Parliament in Ottawa in May 1961 that &quot;Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners.

United States President [[George W. Bush]] was &quot;deeply disliked&quot; by a majority of Canadians according to the ''Arizona Daily Sun''. A 2004 poll found that more than two thirds of Canadians favoured Democrat [[John Kerry]] over Bush in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], with Bush's lowest approval ratings in Canada being in the province of [[Quebec]] where just 11% of the population supported him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azdailysun.com/poll-deep-anti-bush-sentiment-in-canada/article_1c8749cf-9704-5e02-9c7c-159214c9a5f5.html|title=Poll: Deep anti-Bush sentiment in Canada|date=October 20, 2004|work=Arizona Daily Sun|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian public opinion of [[Barack Obama]] was significantly more positive. A 2012 poll found that 65% of Canadians would vote for Obama in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 presidential election]] &quot;if they could&quot; while only 9% of Canadians would vote for his Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]].

====Arctic disputes====
{{See also|Beaufort Sea#Border dispute}}
A long-simmering dispute between Canada and the U.S. involves the issue of Canadian sovereignty over the [[Northwest Passage]] (the sea passages in the [[Arctic]]). Canada's assertion that the Northwest Passage represents internal (territorial) waters has been challenged by other countries, especially the U.S., which argue that these waters constitute an international strait ([[international waters]]). Canadians were alarmed when Americans drove the reinforced oil tanker {{SS|Manhattan|1962|2}} through the Northwest Passage in 1969, followed by the icebreaker [[USCGC Polar Sea (WAGB-11)|Polar Sea]] in 1985, which actually resulted in a [[1985 Polar Sea controversy|minor diplomatic incident]]. In 1970, the Canadian parliament enacted the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act, which asserts Canadian regulatory control over pollution within a 100-mile zone. In response, the United States in 1970 stated, &quot;We cannot accept the assertion of a [[Canadians|Canadian]] claim that the Arctic waters are internal waters of Canada. ... Such acceptance would jeopardize the freedom of navigation essential for United States naval activities worldwide.&quot; A compromise of sorts was reached in 1988, by an agreement on &quot;Arctic Cooperation,&quot; which pledges that voyages of American icebreakers &quot;will be undertaken with the consent of the Government of Canada.&quot; However the agreement did not alter either country's basic legal position. [[Paul Cellucci]], the American ambassador to Canada, in 2005 suggested to Washington that it should recognize the straits as belonging to Canada. His advice was rejected and Harper took opposite positions. The U.S. opposes Harper's proposed plan to deploy military icebreakers in the Arctic to detect interlopers and assert Canadian sovereignty over those waters.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Carnaghan, Allison Goody, [http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/researchpublications/prb0561-e.htm &quot;Canadian Arctic Sovereignty&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304003939/http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/prb0561-e.htm |date=March 4, 2012 }} (Library of Parliament: Political and Social Affairs Division, January 26, 2006); [https://web.archive.org/web/20061215051632/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/01/26/wilkins-harper060126.html 2006 news]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222190522/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20070817/qp_cellucci_070819/ |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |title=Cellucci: Canada should control Northwest Passage |publisher=CTV.ca |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
