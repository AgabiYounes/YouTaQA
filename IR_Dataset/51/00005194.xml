The '''politics of Canada''' function within a framework of [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[federation|federal system]] of [[Parliament of Canada|parliamentary government]] with strong democratic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Canadian Law, 6th ed.

The country has a [[multi-party system]] in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] of and precedents set by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster parliament]] of the United Kingdom. The [[Two-party system|two dominant political parties]] in Canada have historically been the  [[Liberal Party of Canada]] and the [[Conservative Party of Canada]]   (or its [[Conservative Party of Canada#Predecessors|predecessors]]). Smaller parties like 
the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]], the [[Quebec nationalist]] [[Bloc Québécois]] and the [[Green Party of Canada]] have also been able to exert their own influence over the political process.

Canada has evolved variations: [[party discipline]] in Canada is stronger than in the United Kingdom, and more parliamentary votes are considered [[Motion of Confidence|motions of confidence]], which tends to diminish the role of non-[[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] members of parliament (MPs). Such members, in the government [[caucus]], and junior or lower-profile members of [[parliamentary opposition|opposition]] caucuses, are known as [[backbencher]]s. Backbenchers can, however, exert their influence by sitting in parliamentary committees, like the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Accounts|Public Accounts Committee]] or the [[Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security|National Defence Committee]].

==Context==
{{Canada provinces map|align=right|prefix =Politics of|the=the|caption=A map of Canada's provinces and territories}}
Canada's governmental structure was originally established by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] through the ''British North America Act'' (now known as the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''),&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/Const/index.html The ''Constitution Act, 1867''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427011140/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/index.html |date=2006-04-27 }}'', s. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but the federal model and division of powers were devised by Canadian politicians. Particularly after World War I, citizens of the self-governing [[Dominion]]s, such as Canada, began to develop a strong sense of identity, and, in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], the British government expressed its intent to grant full autonomy to these regions.

Thus in 1931, the British Parliament passed the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], giving legal recognition to the autonomy of Canada and other Dominions. Following this, Canadian politicians were unable to obtain consensus on a process for amending the constitution until 1982, meaning amendments to Canada's constitution continued to require the approval of the British parliament until that date. Similarly, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in Britain continued to make the final decision on criminal appeals until 1933 and on civil appeals until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/creation/index-eng.asp The Creation and Beginnings of the Supreme Court of Canada''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430084251/http://www.scc-csc.gc.ca/court-cour/creation/index-eng.asp |date=2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governmental organization==
{{Main|Government of Canada}}

; Type of government : [[Westminster system|Westminster style]] [[Federation|federal]] [[parliamentary democracy]] within a [[constitutional monarchy]].

; Administrative divisions : [[Provinces of Canada|Ten provinces]] and [[Territories of Canada|three territories]]*: [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], [[New Brunswick]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Northwest Territories]]*, [[Nova Scotia]], [[Nunavut]]*, [[Ontario]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Quebec]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Yukon]]*.

; Constitution : [[Westminster system]], based on unwritten [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|conventions]] and written [[Constitution of Canada|legislation]].

; Legal system : [[English law|English]] [[common law]] for all matters within federal jurisdiction and in all provinces and territories except Quebec, which is based on the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], based on the Custom of Paris in pre-revolutionary France as set out in the [[Civil Code of Quebec]]; accepts compulsory [[International Court of Justice]] jurisdiction, with reservations.
{{Further|Law of Canada}}

; Suffrage : Citizens aged 18 years or older. Only two adult citizens in Canada cannot vote: the [[Chief Electoral Officer (Canada)|Chief Electoral Officer]], and the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer. The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is eligible to vote, but abstains due to [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]].

===Monarchy===
; [[Head of state]]: [[Elizabeth II]], [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]] (since February 6, 1952).

; [[Viceroy]]: [[Julie Payette]], [[Governor General of Canada]] (since October 2, 2017).

===Executive power===
[[File:Prime Ministers of Canada to 1963.jpg|right|thumb|[[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|Canada's Prime Ministers]] from 1867 to 1963. The [[Prime Minister of Canada]] serves as the [[head of government]].]]
; [[Head of government]]: Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] (since November 4, 2015).

; Cabinet: [[The Ministry|Ministers]] (usually around thirty) chosen by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Governor General to lead various ministries and agencies, generally with regional representation. Traditionally most, if not all, cabinet ministers will be members of the leader's own party in the House of Commons or Senate (see [[Cabinet of Canada]]); however this is not legally or constitutionally mandated, and occasionally, the Prime Minister will appoint a cabinet minister from another party.

; Elections : The monarchy is hereditary. The Governor-General is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister for a non-specific term, though it is traditionally approximately five years. Following legislative elections, the leader of the majority party in the House of Commons is usually designated by the Governor General to become Prime Minister.
{{Further|Monarchy of Canada|Monarchy in the Canadian provinces|Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|Premier (Canada)|Elections in Canada}}

===Legislative power===
The [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Parliament of Canada]] consists of three parts: the [[Monarchy in Canada|monarch]], the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]], and the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].

Currently, the Senate, which is frequently described as providing &quot;regional&quot; representation, has 105 members appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister to serve until age 75. It was created with equal representation from each of Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime region and the Western Provinces. However, it is currently the product of various specific exceptions, additions and compromises, meaning that regional equality is not observed, nor is representation-by-population. The normal number of senators can be exceeded by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, as long as the additional senators are distributed equally with regard to region (up to a total of eight additional Senators). This power of additional appointment has only been used once, when Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] petitioned [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] to add eight seats to the Senate so as to ensure the passage of the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] legislation.
[[File:Colline du Parlement, Édifice du Centre 04.jpg|thumb|A democratically elected body, the [[House of Commons of Canada]] is one of three components of the [[Parliament of Canada]].]]
The House of Commons currently has 338 members elected in [[single-member district]]s in a [[plurality voting system]] (first past the post), meaning that members must attain only a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] (the most votes of any candidate) rather than a [[majority]] (50 percent plus one). The [[Electoral district (Canada)|electoral districts]] are also known as [[Riding (country subdivision)|ridings]].

Mandates cannot exceed five years; an election must occur by the end of this time. This fixed mandate has been exceeded only once, when Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] perceived the need to do so during World War I. The size of the House and [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]] of seats to each province is revised after every census, conducted every five years, and is based on population changes and approximately on representation-by-population.

===Majority and minority governments===

[[Canadians]] vote for their local Member of Parliament (MP) only.  An MP need not be a member of any political party: such MPs are known as independents.  When a number of MPs share political opinions they may form a body known as a political party.

The ''[[Canada Elections Act]]'' defines a political party as &quot;an organization one of whose fundamental purposes is to participate in public affairs by endorsing one or more of its members as candidates and supporting their election.&quot; Forming and registering a federal political party are two different things. There is no legislation regulating the formation of federal political parties. Elections Canada cannot dictate how a federal political party should be formed or how its legal, internal and financial structures should be established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;dir=pol/bck&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e|title=Registration of Federal Political Parties|first=Elections|last=Canada|website=elections.ca|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201235534/http://elections.ca/content.aspx?section=pol&amp;dir=pol%2Fbck&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e|archivedate=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parties elect their leaders in [[run-off election]]s to ensure that the winner receives more than 50% of the votes. Normally the party leader stands as a candidate to be an MP during an election.  Canada's parliamentary system empowers political parties and their party leaders. Where one party gets a majority of the seats in the House of Commons, that party is said to have a &quot;majority government.&quot; Through party discipline, the party leader, who is elected in only one riding, exercises a great deal of control over the cabinet and the parliament.

Historically the [[prime minister of canada|prime minister]] and senators are selected by the [[governor general of canada|governor general]] as a representative of the Queen, though in modern practice the monarch's duties are ceremonial.  Consequently, the prime minister, while technically selected by the governor general, is for all practical purposes selected by the party with the majority of seats.  That is, the party that gets the most seats normally forms the government, with that party's leader becoming prime minister. The prime minister is not directly elected by the general population, although the prime minister is almost always directly elected as an MP within his or her constituency.  Again senators while technically selected at the pleasure of the monarch, are ceremonially selected by the governor general at the advice (and for most practical purposes authority) of the prime minister.

A [[minority government]] situation occurs when the party that holds the most seats in the House of Commons holds fewer seats than the opposition parties combined. In this scenario usually the party leader whose party has the most seats in the House is selected by the governor general to lead the government, however, to create stability, the leader chosen must have the support of the majority of the House, meaning they need the support of at least one other party.

==Federal-provincial relations==
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Mackenzie King with Ferguson and Taschereau.jpg|thumb|[[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (centre), Prime minister of Canada, between [[Howard Ferguson]] (left), Premier of Ontario, and [[Louis-Alexandre Taschereau]](right), Premier of Quebec, at the [[First Ministers' conference|Dominion-Provincial Conference]], 1927.]]
In Canada, [[Provinces and territories of Canada|the provinces]] are considered co-sovereign; [[sovereignty]] of the provinces is passed on, not by the Governor General or the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]], but through the Crown itself. This means that the Crown is &quot;divided&quot; into 11 legal jurisdictions or 11 &quot;Crowns&quot; – one federal (the Crown in right of Canada, and ten provincial, example being the Crown in right of British Columbia, .

Federal-provincial (or intergovernmental, formerly Dominion-provincial) relations is a regular issue in Canadian politics: Quebec wishes to preserve and strengthen its distinctive nature, western provinces desire more control over their abundant natural resources, especially energy reserves; industrialized Central Canada is concerned with its manufacturing base, and the Atlantic provinces strive to escape from being less affluent than the rest of the country.

In order to ensure that social programs such as health care and education are funded consistently throughout Canada, the &quot;have-not&quot; (poorer) provinces receive a proportionately greater share of federal &quot;[[equalization payments|transfer (equalization) payments]]&quot; than the richer, or &quot;have&quot;, provinces do; this has been somewhat controversial. The richer provinces often favour freezing transfer payments, or rebalancing the system in their favour, based on the claim that they already pay more in taxes than they receive in federal government services, and the poorer provinces often favour an increase on the basis that the amount of money they receive is not sufficient for their existing needs.

Particularly in the past decade, some scholars have argued that the federal government's exercise of its unlimited constitutional spending power has contributed to strained federal-provincial relations. This power, which allows the federal government to spend the revenue it raises in any way that it pleases, allows it to overstep the constitutional division of powers by creating programs that encroach on areas of provincial jurisdiction. The federal spending power is not expressly set out in the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''; however, in the words of the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] the power &quot;can be inferred&quot; from s. 91(1A), &quot;the public debt and property&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2004/2004canlii15104/2004canlii15104.html ''Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. v. Iness''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120712162257/http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2004/2004canlii15104/2004canlii15104.html |date=2012-07-12 }}, 2004 CanLII 15104 at paragraph 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prime example of an exercise of the spending power is the ''[[Canada Health Act]]'', which is a conditional grant of money to the provinces. Regulation of health services is, under the Constitution, a provincial responsibility. However, by making the funding available to the provinces under the ''Canada Health Act'' contingent upon delivery of services according to federal standards, the federal government has the ability to influence health care delivery. This spending power, coupled with Supreme Court rulings—such as [[Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.)]]—that have held that funding delivered under the spending power can be reduced unilaterally at any time, has contributed to strained federal-provincial relations.

===Quebec and Canadian politics===
Except for three short-lived transitional or minority governments, prime ministers from [[Quebec]] led Canada continuously from 1968 to early 2006. Québécois led both [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] and [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] governments in this period.

Monarchs, governors general, and prime ministers are now expected to be at least functional, if not fluent, in both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[French language in Canada|French]]. In selecting leaders, political parties give preference to candidates who are fluently bilingual.

Also, by law, three of the nine positions on the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] must be held by judges from Quebec. This representation makes sure that at least three judges have sufficient experience with the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system to treat cases involving Quebec laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014 SCC 21&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Reference re Supreme Court Act, ss. 5 and 6|url=https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2014/2014scc21/2014scc21.html|website=CanLII|accessdate=August 5, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140505164818/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2014/2014scc21/2014scc21.html|archivedate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National unity==
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2018}}
Canada has a long and storied history of secessionist movements (see [[Secessionist movements of Canada]]). National unity has been a major issue in Canada since the forced union of [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] in 1840.

The predominant and lingering issue concerning Canadian national unity has been the ongoing conflict between the French-speaking majority in Quebec and the English-speaking majority in the rest of Canada. Quebec's continued demands for recognition of its &quot;[[distinct society]]&quot; through special political status has led to attempts for constitutional reform, most notably with the failed attempts to amend the constitution through the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and the [[Charlottetown Accord]] (the latter of which was rejected through a national [[referendum]]).

Since the [[Quiet Revolution]], sovereigntist sentiments in Quebec have been variably stoked by the [[Canada Act 1982|patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982]] (without Quebec's consent) and by the failed attempts at constitutional reform. Two provincial referenda, in [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] and [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]], rejected proposals for sovereignty with majorities of 60% and 50.6% respectively. Given the narrow federalist victory in 1995, a reference was made by the [[Jean Chrétien|Chrétien]] government to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 1998 regarding the [[Re Secession of Quebec|legality of unilateral provincial secession]]. The court decided that a unilateral declaration of secession would be unconstitutional. This resulted in the passage of the ''[[Clarity Act]]'' in 2000.

The [[Bloc Québécois]], a sovereigntist party which runs candidates exclusively in [[Quebec]], was started by a group of MPs who left the Progressive Conservative (PC) party (along with several disaffected Liberal MPs), and first put forward candidates in the 1993 federal election. With the collapse of the PCs in that election, the Bloc and Liberals were seen as the only two viable parties in Quebec. Thus, prior to the 2006 election, any gain by one party came at the expense of the other, regardless of whether national unity was really at issue. The Bloc, then, benefited (with a significant increase in seat total) from the impressions of corruption that surrounded the Liberal Party in the lead-up to the 2004 election. However, the newly unified Conservative party re-emerged as a viable party in Quebec by winning 10 seats in the 2006 election.  In the 2011 election, the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] succeeded in winning 59 of Quebec's 75 seats, successfully reducing the number of seats of every other party substantially. The NDP surge nearly destroyed the Bloc, reducing them to 4 seats, far below the minimum requirement of 12 seats for [[Official party status]].

[[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is also a problem regarding national unity. As the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was a self-governing country equal to Canada until 1949, there are large, though unco-ordinated, feelings of Newfoundland nationalism and anti-Canadian sentiment among much of the population. This is due in part to the perception of chronic [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|federal mismanagement of the fisheries]], [[Resettlement (Newfoundland)|forced resettlement]] away from isolated settlements in the 1960s, the government of Quebec still drawing inaccurate political maps whereby [[Labrador#Boundary dispute|they take parts of Labrador]], and to the perception that mainland Canadians look down upon Newfoundlanders. In 2004, the [[Newfoundland and Labrador First Party]] contested provincial elections and in 2008 in federal ridings within the province. In 2004, then-premier [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]] ordered all federal flags removed from government buildings as a result of lost offshore revenues to equalization clawbacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970|title=Maple Leaf flags removed in offshore feud &amp;#124; CBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084310/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970|archivedate=2014-08-19|url-status=live|accessdate=2014-08-16}}{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970|title=Maple Leaf flags removed in offshore feud|website=CBC News|publisher=CBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084310/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-leaf-flags-removed-in-offshore-feud-1.494970|archivedate=19 August 2014|url-status=live|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 23, 2004, premier Williams made this statement to reporters in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]],

{{quote| &quot;They basically slighted us, they are not treating us as a proper partner in Confederation. It's intolerable and it's insufferable and these flags will be taken down indefinitely. It's also quite apparent to me that we were dragged to Manitoba in order to punish us, quite frankly, to try to embarrass us, to bring us out there to get no deal and send us back with our tail between our legs.&quot;|sign=Premier [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc.ca&quot;/&gt;}}

[[Western alienation]] is another national-unity-related concept that enters into Canadian politics. Residents of the four western provinces, particularly Alberta, have often been unhappy with a lack of influence and a perceived lack of understanding when residents of Central Canada consider &quot;national&quot; issues. While this is seen to play itself out through many avenues (media, commerce, and so on.), in politics, it has given rise to a number of political parties whose base constituency is in western Canada. These include the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], who first won federal seats in 1917, the [[Progressive Party of Canada|Progressives]] (1921), the [[Social Credit Party of Canada|Social Credit Party]] (1935), the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (1935), the [[Reconstruction Party]] (1935), [[New Democracy (Canada)|New Democracy]] (1940) and most recently the [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] (1989).

The Reform Party's slogan &quot;The West Wants In&quot; was echoed by commentators when, after a successful merger with the PCs, the successor party to both parties, the Conservative Party won the 2006 election. Led by Stephen Harper, who is an MP from Alberta, the electoral victory was said to have made &quot;The West IS In&quot; a reality. However, regardless of specific electoral successes or failures, the concept of western alienation continues to be important in Canadian politics, particularly on a provincial level, where opposing the federal government is a common tactic for provincial politicians. For example, in 2001, a group of prominent Albertans produced the [[Alberta Agenda]], urging Alberta to take steps to make full use of its constitutional powers, much as Quebec has done.

==Political conditions==
{{More citations needed section|date=October 2018}}
Canada is considered by most sources to be a very stable democracy. In 2006, ''[[The Economist]]'' ranked Canada the third-most democratic nation in its [[Democracy Index]], ahead of all other nations in the Americas and ahead of every nation more populous than itself. In 2008, Canada was ranked World No. 11 and again ahead of all countries more populous and ahead of other states in the Americas. (In 2008, the United States was ranked World No. 18, Uruguay World No. 23, and Costa Rica World No. 27.)

The [[Liberal Party of Canada]], under the leadership of Paul Martin,&lt;ref&gt;Aucoin, Peter. ''The democratic deficit: Paul Martin and parliamentary reform'', Canadian Public Administration, Jan 1, 2003, Vol. 46, No. 4 (Winter 2003), p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; won a minority victory in the June [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 general elections]]. In December 2003, Martin had succeeded fellow Liberal Jean Chrétien, who had, in 2000, become the first prime minister to lead three consecutive majority governments since 1945. However, in 2004 the Liberals lost seats in Parliament, going from 172 of 301 parliamentary seats to 135 of 308, and from 40.9% to 36.7% in the popular vote. The [[Canadian Alliance]], which did well in western Canada in the 2000 election but was unable to make significant inroads in the East, merged with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] to form the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] in late 2003.

They proved to be moderately successful in the 2004 campaign, gaining seats from a combined Alliance-PC total of 78 in 2000 to 99 in 2004. However, the new Conservatives lost in popular vote, going from 37.7% in 2000 down to 29.6%. In 2006, the Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper, won a minority government with 124 seats. They improved their percentage from 2004, garnering 36.3% of the vote. During this election, the Conservatives also made major breakthroughs in Quebec. They gained 10 seats here, whereas in 2004 they had no seats.

At the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 federal election]], the Conservatives won a majority government with 167 seats. For the first time, the NDP became the Official Opposition, with 102 seats; the Liberals finished in third place with 34 seats. This was the first election in which the Green Party won a seat, that of leader [[Elizabeth May]]; the Bloc won 4 seats, losing official party status.

===Realignment: Conservatives in power===

[[File:GoverningPoliticalPartyByProvince.png|right|250px|thumb|The governing political party(s) in each Canadian province. Multicolored provinces are governed by a coalition or minority government consisting of more than one party.]]

The Liberal Party, after dominating Canadian politics since the 1920s, was in decline in early years of the 21st century. As [[Eugene Lang (minister)|Lang]] (2010) concluded, they lost their majority in Parliament in the 2004 election, were defeated in 2006, and in 2008 became little more than a &quot;rump&quot;, falling to their lowest seat count in decades and a mere 26% of the popular vote. Furthermore, said Lang (a Liberal himself), its prospects &quot;are as bleak as they have ever been.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Lang, &quot;Whither the Liberals? Current State and Prospects of the Liberal Party of Canada,&quot; ''The Journal for International Relations and Global Trends,'' (2010) p. 195 [http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/ipg/ipg-2010-4/lang.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309234018/http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/ipg/ipg-2010-4/lang.pdf |date=2012-03-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 election, the Liberals suffered a crushing defeat, managing to secure only 18.9% of the vote share and only 34 seats.  As a result, the Liberals lost their status as official opposition to the NDP.

In explaining those trends, Behiels (2010) synthesized major studies and reported that &quot;a great many journalists, political advisors, and politicians argue that a new political party paradigm is emerging&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Behiels cites Tom Flanagan, ''Harper's Team: Behind the Scenes in the Conservative Rise to Power'' (2nd ed. McGill-Queens U.P., 2009); Chantal Hébert, ''French Kiss: Stephen Harper's Blind Date with Quebec'' (Knopf Canada, 2007); William Johnson, ''Stephen Harper and the Future of Canada'' (2nd ed. McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2006); Lloyd Mackay, ''Stephen Harper: The Case for Collaborative Governance'' (ECW Press, 2006); Bob Plamondon, ''Full Circle: Death and Resurrection in Canadian Conservative Politics'' (Key Porter Books, 2006); and Paul Wells, ''Right Side Up: The Fall of Paul Martin and the Rise of Stephen Harper's New Conservatism'' (Douglas Gibson Books, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed they saw a new power configuration based on a right-wing political party capable of sharply changing the traditional role of the state (federal and provincial) in the twenty-first-century. Behiels said that, unlike [[Brian Mulroney]] who tried but failed to challenge the long-term dominance of the Liberals, Harper's attempt had proven to be more determined, systematic and successful.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Behiels, &quot;Stephen Harper's Rise to Power: Will His 'New' Conservative Party Become Canada’s 'Natural Governing Party' of the Twenty-First Century?,&quot; ''American Review of Canadian Studies'' Vol. 40, No. 1, March 2010, 118–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators thought it signalled a major realignment. The ''Economist'' said, &quot;the election represents the biggest realignment of Canadian politics since 1993.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Economist'' May 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawrence Martin, commentator for the ''Globe and Mail'' said, &quot;Harper has completed a remarkable reconstruction of a [[Canadians|Canadian]] political landscape that endured for more than a century.

Despite the grim outlook and poor early poll numbers, when the 2015 election was held, the Liberals under [[Justin Trudeau]] had an unprecedented comeback and the realignment was proved only temporary. Gaining 148 seats, they won a majority government for the first time since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Coyne, &quot;Liberal comeback unprecedented in Canadian history&quot; [http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrew-coyne-liberal-comeback-unprecedented-in-canadian-history ''National Post'' Oct 25 2015]  {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151021005809/http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrew-coyne-liberal-comeback-unprecedented-in-canadian-history |date=2015-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Toronto Star]]'' claimed the comeback was &quot;headed straight for the history books&quot; and that Harper's name would &quot;forever be joined with that of his Liberal nemesis in Canada’s electoral annals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chantal Hébert, &quot;Liberal comeback headed for history books&quot; [https://www.thestar.com/news/federal-election/2015/10/20/liberal-comeback-headed-for-history-books-hbert.html ''Toronto Star'' Oct 20 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024000551/http://www.thestar.com/news/federal-election/2015/10/20/liberal-comeback-headed-for-history-books-hbert.html |date=2015-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer McKay for the ''National Post'' suggested that &quot;maybe we’ve witnessed a revival of Canada’s 'natural governing party'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer McKay, &quot;The Great Liberal Comeback&quot; [http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/spencer-mckay-the-great-liberal-comeback ''National Post'' Oct 29 2015]  {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151119074616/http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/spencer-mckay-the-great-liberal-comeback |date=2015-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party funding reform===
Funding changes were made to ensure greater reliance on personal contributions. Personal donations to federal parties and campaigns benefit from tax credits, although the amount of tax relief depends on the amount given. Also only people paying income taxes receive any benefit from this.

A good part of the reasoning behind the change in funding was that union or business funding should not be allowed to have as much impact on federal election funding as these are not contributions from citizens and are not evenly spread out between parties. They are still allowed to contribute to the election but only in a minor fashion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The new rules stated that a party had to receive 2% of the vote nationwide in order to receive the general federal funding for parties. Each vote garnered a certain dollar amount for a party (approximately $1.75) in future funding. For the initial disbursement, approximations were made based on previous elections. The NDP received more votes than expected (its national share of the vote went up) while the new Conservative Party of Canada received fewer votes than had been estimated and was asked to refund the difference. [[Quebec]] was the first province to implement a similar system of funding many years before the changes to funding of federal parties.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[Federal political financing in Canada|Federal funds]] are disbursed quarterly to parties, beginning at the start of 2005. For the moment, this disbursement delay leaves the NDP and the Green Party in a better position to fight an election, since they rely more on individual contributors than federal funds. The Green Party now receives federal funds, since it for the first time received a sufficient share of the vote in the 2004 election.&lt;ref name=&quot;debates&quot;&gt;[http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAN1039064420080910 ''Greens win spot in TV election debates'', Reuters Canada, September 10, 2008] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223141558/http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAN1039064420080910 |date=February 23, 2011 }}, (accessed September 10, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, news emerged of a funding loophole that &quot;could cumulatively exceed the legal limit by more than $60,000,&quot; through anonymous recurrent donations of $200 to every riding of a party from corporations or unions. At the time, for each individual, the legal annual donation limit was $1,100 for each party, $1,100 combined total for each party's associations, and in an election year, an additional $1,100 combined total for each party's candidates. All three limits increase on 1 April every year based on the inflation rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thetyee.ca/Views/2007/08/13/DemoSale/ |title=Our Democracy for Sale, Still |accessdate=August 16, 2007 |last=Conacher |first=Duff |date=August 13, 2007 |work=The Tyee |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017135000/http://thetyee.ca/Views/2007/08/13/DemoSale/ |archivedate=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FRTGAM.20070802.wdonations02%2FBNStory%2FNational%2Fhome%2Fangle&amp;ord=20544885 |title=Ottawa refuses to close donation loophole |accessdate=August 16, 2007 |last=Leblanc |first=Daniel |author2=Jane Taber |date=August 2, 2007 |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |archiveurl=http://nationalcitizens.ca/cgi-bin/news.cgi?rm=display&amp;articleID=1186055872&amp;search=&amp;category=3&amp;order=&amp;page=1 |archivedate=August 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070801.wdonationsloophole01/BNStory/National/home |title=Loophole tears lid off political donations |accessdate=August 16, 2007 |last=Leblanc |first=Daniel |date=August 1, 2007 |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders’ debates in Canada consist of two debates, one English and one French,&lt;ref name=&quot;TarasWaddell2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Taras|author2=Christopher Waddell|title=How Canadians Communicate IV: Media and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bdw1VFSQuoC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2012|publisher=Athabasca University Press|isbn=978-1-926836-81-2|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt; both produced by a consortium of Canada's five major television broadcasters ([[CBC Television|CBC]]/[[Ici Radio-Canada Télé|SRC]], [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[TVA (Canada)|TVA]]) and usually consist of the leaders of all parties with representation in the House of Commons.

These debates air on the networks of the producing consortium as well as the public affairs and parliamentary channel [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]] and the American public affairs network [[C-SPAN]].

==Judiciary==
{{Main|Supreme Court of Canada}}
{{See also|Court system of Canada|Law of Canada}}
[[File:Ottawa - ON - Oberster Gerichtshof von Kanada.jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] is the highest court in the [[Canadian justice system]].]]
The highest court in Canada is the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and is the final court of appeal in the [[Canadian justice system]]. The court is composed of nine judges: eight [[Puisne Justice]]s and the [[Chief Justice of Canada]]. Justices of the Supreme Court of Canada are appointed by the Governor-in-Council. The ''[[Supreme Court Act]]'' limits eligibility for appointment to persons who have been judges of a superior court, or members of the [[Bar association|bar]] for ten or more years. Members of the bar or superior judge of Quebec, by law, must hold three of the nine positions on the Supreme Court of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/S-26/ ''Supreme Court Act''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130025611/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/S-26/ |date=2006-01-30 }}'', s. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government departments and structure==
The Canadian government operates the public service using departments, smaller agencies (for example, commissions, tribunals, and boards), and crown corporations. There are two types of departments: central agencies such as Finance, Privy Council Office, and Treasury Board Secretariat have an organizing and oversight role for the entire public service; line departments are departments that perform tasks in a specific area or field, such as the departments of Agriculture, Environment, or Defence.

*Significant departments include [[Department of Finance (Canada)|Finance]], [[Canada Revenue Agency|Revenue]], [[Human Resources and Skills Development Canada|Human Resources and Skills Development]], [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|National Defence]], [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada|Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness]], and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Foreign Affairs]]/[[Department of International Trade (Canada)|International Trade]].

Scholar Peter Aucoin, writing about the Canadian Westminster system, raised concerns in the early 2000s about the centralization of power; an increased number, role and influence of partisan-political staff; personal-politicization of appointments to the senior public service; and the assumption that the public service is promiscuously partisan for the government of the day.&lt;ref&gt;Aucoin, Peter (2008). ''New Public Management and the Quality of Government: Coping with the New Political Governance in Canada'', Conference on &quot;New Public Management and the Quality of Government&quot;, SOG and the Quality of Government Institute, University of Gothenburg, Sweden, 13–15 November 2008, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration==
In 1967, Canada established a point-based system to determine if immigrants should be eligible to enter the country, using meritorious qualities such as the applicant's ability to speak both [[French people|French]] and [[English language|English]], their level of education, and other details that may be expected of someone raised in Canada. This system was considered ground-breaking at the time since prior systems were slanted on the basis of ethnicity. However, many foreign nationals still found it challenging to secure work after emigrating, resulting in a higher unemployment rate amongst the immigrant population. After winning power at the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal election]], the [[Conservative Party (Canada)|Conservative Party]] sought to curb this issue by placing weight on whether or not the applicant has a standing job offer in Canada. The change has been a source of some contention as opponents argue that businesses use this change to suppress wages, with corporate owners leveraging the knowledge that an immigrant should hold a job to successfully complete the immigration process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/americas/21638191-canada-used-prize-immigrants-who-would-make-good-citizens-now-people-job-offers-have|title=No country for old men|date=2015-01-08|journal=The Economist|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725151331/http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21638191-canada-used-prize-immigrants-who-would-make-good-citizens-now-people-job-offers-have|archivedate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
