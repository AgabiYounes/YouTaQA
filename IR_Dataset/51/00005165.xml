{{short description|Region that is identified as a distinct entity in political geography}}
[[File:Political Map of the World, June 2019.pdf|thumb|upright=2|2019 map showing countries with full recognition and some [[List of states with limited recognition|UN non-member states]]; some [[List of territorial disputes|disputed territories]] are not shown]]

The term '''country''' refers to a political state or nation or its territory. It is often referred to as the land of an individual's birth, residence, or citizenship.

A country may be an independent [[sovereign state]] or part of a larger state,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, J. (1964). ''What Makes a Country? Human Events'', '''24'''(31), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; as a non-[[sovereignty|sovereign]] or formerly sovereign [[political division]], a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated [[nation|people]] with distinct political characteristics. It is not inherently sovereign.

''Countries'' can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|912|1997|litigants=Tjhe Kwet Koe v Minister for Immigration &amp;amp; Ethnic Affairs |date=8 September 1997 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while other times it can refer only to [[State (polity)|states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/cs/politicalgeog/a/statenation.htm| title=Geography: Country, State, and Nation |accessdate=2008-11-12 |last=Rosenberg |first=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'' uses the word in its &quot;Country name&quot; field to refer to &quot;a wide variety of dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, [[uninhabited islands]], and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/notesanddefs.html#T |title=The World Factbook |publisher=CIA|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup id=Note_1&gt;[[#Notes|[Note 1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

The largest country in the world is [[Russia]], while the most populated is [[China]]. The newest country is [[South Sudan]].

==Etymology and usage==
&lt;!-- ''Basically a country has a particular boundary on the surface of the earth through which one country can be separated from the other.'' Removed this addition: &quot;Do not seek narrowly to define the word country without first considering the range of dictionary definitions such as OED and Chambers (British); Macquarie (Australian); Webster (American).&quot; --&gt;

The word ''country'' comes from [[Old French]] ''contrée'', which derives from [[Vulgar Latin]] (''terra'') ''contrata'' (&quot;(land) lying opposite&quot;; &quot;(land) spread before&quot;), derived from ''contra'' (&quot;against, opposite&quot;). It most likely entered the English language after the [[Norman invasion of England|Franco-Norman invasion]] during the 11th century.

In English the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions, so that one sense, associated with the [[indefinite article]] – &quot;a country&quot; – through misuse and subsequent conflation is now a [[synonym]] for state, or a former [[sovereign state]], in the sense of sovereign territory or &quot;district, native land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], Country&lt;/ref&gt; Areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the [[West Country]] in England, the [[Black Country]] (a heavily industrialized part of England), &quot;[[Constable Country]]&quot; (a part of [[East Anglia]] painted by [[John Constable]]), the &quot;big country&quot; (used in various contexts of the [[American West]]), &quot;coal country&quot; (used of parts of the US and elsewhere) and many other terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| editor = John Simpson, Edmund Weiner | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary| edition = 1971 compact | publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford, England| isbn = 978-0-19-861186-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent terms in French and other [[Romance language]]s (''[[Pays (France)|pays]]'' and variants) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the English &quot;country&quot;, instead derived from, [[pagus]], which designated the territory controlled by a medieval [[count]], a title originally granted by the Roman Church. In many European countries the words are used for sub-divisions of the national territory, as in the [[States of Germany|German Bundesländer]], as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state. France has very many &quot;pays&quot; that are officially recognized at some level, and are either [[natural region]]s, like the [[Pays de Bray]], or reflect old political or economic entities, like the [[Pays de la Loire]].

A version of &quot;country&quot; can be found in the modern [[French language]] as ''contrée'', based on the word ''cuntrée'' in [[Old French]],&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot; /&gt; that is used similarly to the word &quot;pays&quot; to define non-state regions, but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases. The modern Italian ''contrada'' is a word with its meaning varying locally, but usually meaning a [[Ward (country subdivision)|ward]] or similar small division of a town, or a village or hamlet in the countryside.

==Sovereignty status==
{{See also|List of sovereign states}}

The term &quot;country&quot; can refer to a [[sovereign state]]. There is no universal agreement on the number of &quot;countries&quot; in the world since a number of states have [[List of states with limited recognition|disputed sovereignty status]]. By one application of the [[declarative theory of statehood]] and [[constitutive theory of statehood]], there are [[List of sovereign states|206 sovereign states]]; of which 193 are members of the [[United Nations]], two have observer status at the UN (the [[Holy See]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]), and 11 others are neither a member nor observer at the UN. The latest proclaimed state is [[South Sudan]] since 2011.

The degree of autonomy of non-sovereign countries varies widely. Some are possessions of sovereign states, as several states have overseas territories (such as [[French Polynesia]] or the [[British Virgin Islands]]), with citizenry at times identical and at times distinct from their own. Such territories, with the exception of distinct [[dependent territories]], are usually listed together with [[sovereign]] states on lists of countries, but may nonetheless be treated as a separate &quot;[[country of origin]]&quot; in international trade, as [[Hong Kong]] is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|title=Made In The British Crown Colony|work=Thuy-Tien Crampton|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407075644/http://thuytiencrampton.com/2010/07/07/made-in-the-british-crown-colony/|archivedate=2014-04-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|title = Matchbox label, made in Hong Kong|work = delcampe.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://archive.today/20140401162502/http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,41342017,var,MATCHBOX-LABEL-MADE-IN-HONG-KONG,language,E.html%23.UzroWH3LfK5#.Uzrl3vmSwZg|archive-date = 1 April 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contractortalk.com/f40/carrhart-made-hong-kong-27324/|title=Carrhart Made In Hong Kong?|work=ContractorTalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few states consist of a union of smaller polities which are considered countries:

* The [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] includes four separate countries: [[Netherlands]], [[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], and [[Sint Maarten]].
* The [[United Kingdom]] includes [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Crown Dependencies]], which are not part of the UK itself, are also sometimes referred to as countries.
* The [[The unity of the Realm|Kingdom of Denmark]] includes three separate countries: [[Denmark]], [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]].

==Country classification==
Several organizations seek to identify trends in order to produce country classifications. Countries are often distinguished as [[Developing country|developing countries]] or [[Developed country|developed countries.]]

'''The United Nations'''

The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs annually produces the ''World Economic Situation and Prospects'' report that classified states as developed countries, economies in transition, or developing countries. The report classifies country development based on per capita gross national income. Within the broad categories, the United Nations identified subgroups based on geographical location or ad hoc criteria. The UN outlines the geographical regions for developing economies as Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The 2019 report recognizes only developed countries in North America, Europe, and Asia and the Pacific. The majority of economies in transition and developing countries are found in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. 

The UN additionally recognizes multiple trends that impact the developmental status of countries in the ''World Economic Situation and Prospects''. The report highlights fuel-exporting and fuel-importing countries, as well as small island developing states and landlocked developing countries. It also identifies heavily indebted poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Economic and Situation Prospects 2019 |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/WESP2019_BOOK-web.pdf |website=The United Nations |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=18 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The World Bank'''

The World Bank also classifies countries based on GNI per capita. Using the ''World Bank Atlas method'', it classifies countries as low-income economies, lower-middle-income economies, upper-middle-income economies, or high-income economies. For the 2020 fiscal year, the World Bank defines low-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $1,025 or less in 2018; lower middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $1,026 and $3,995; upper middle-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375; high-income economies as countries with a GNI per capita of $12,376 or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How does the World Bank classify countries? |url=https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378834-how-does-the-world-bank-classify-countries |website=The World Bank |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=18 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also identifies regional trends. The World Bank defines its regions as East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Lastly, the World Bank distinguishes countries based on the operational policies of the World Bank. The three categories include International Development Association (IDA) countries, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) countries, and Blend countries.
