Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of the island of [[Zealand]]; another small portion of the city is located on [[Amager]], and it is separated from [[Malmö]], Sweden, by the strait of [[Øresund]]. The [[Øresund Bridge]] connects the two cities by rail and road.

Originally a [[Vikings|Viking]] fishing village established in the 10th century in the vicinity of what is now [[Gammel Strand]],  Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. Beginning in the 17th century it consolidated its position as a regional centre of power with its institutions, defences and armed forces. During the renaissance the city served as the de facto capital being the seat of government of the [[Kalmar Union]], governing the entire present day [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] region in a personal union with [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] ruled by the Danish monarch serving as the head of state. The city flourished as the cultural and economic center of [[Scandinavia]] under the union for well over 120 years, starting in the 15th century up until the beginning of the 16th century when the union was dissolved with Sweden leaving the union through a rebellion. After [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|a plague outbreak]] and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] and founding of such cultural institutions as the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]]. After further disasters in the early 19th century when [[Horatio Nelson]] attacked the Dano-Norwegian fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the [[Danish Golden Age]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the [[Second World War]], the [[Finger Plan]] fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.

Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the [[Culture of Denmark|cultural]], [[Economy of Denmark|economic]] and [[Politics of Denmark|governmental]] centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]]. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the [[service sector]], especially through initiatives in [[information technology]], [[pharmaceuticals]] and [[clean technology]]. Since the completion of the [[Øresund Bridge]], Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of [[Scania]] and its largest city, Malmö, forming the [[Øresund Region]]. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as [[Tivoli Gardens]], ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue, the [[Amalienborg]] and [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]] palaces, [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens]], [[Frederik's Church]], and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. The largest lake of Denmark, [[Arresø]], lies around 27 miles (43 kilometers) northwest of the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]].

Copenhagen is home to the [[University of Copenhagen]], the [[Technical University of Denmark]], [[Copenhagen Business School]] and the [[IT University of Copenhagen]]. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark. Copenhagen is home to the [[F.C. Copenhagen|FC København]] and [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] football clubs. The annual [[Copenhagen Marathon]] was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.

The [[Copenhagen Metro]] launched in 2002 serves central Copenhagen. Additionally the [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-train]], the [[Lokaltog]] ([[:da:Privatbane|private railway]]) and the [[Coast Line (Denmark)|Coast Line]] network serves and connects central Copenhagen to outlying boroughs. Serving roughly two million passengers a month, [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup]], is the busiest airport in the [[Nordic countries]].

==Etymology==
Copenhagen's name reflects its origin as a harbour and a place of commerce. The original designation in [[Old Norse]], from which Danish descends, was '''Kaupmannahǫfn''' [ˡkaupmanːahɒvn] (cf. modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''Kaupmannahöfn'' [ˡkʰøyhpmanːahœpn], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Keypmannahavn''), meaning &quot;merchants' harbour&quot;. By the time [[Old Danish]] was spoken, the capital was called '''Køpmannæhafn''', with the current name deriving from centuries of subsequent regular [[sound change]]. An exact English equivalent would be &quot;[[Chapmen|chapman]]'s [[Harbor|haven]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eremit.dk/ebog/khb/1/khb1_2.html|first=Oluf|last=Nielsen|title=Kjøbenhavn i Middelalderen|publisher=G.E.C. Gad|year=1877|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the English term for the city was adapted from its [[Low German]] name, ''Kopenhagen''.
(English ''chapman'', German ''Kaufmann'', Dutch ''koopman'', Swedish ''köpman'', Danish ''købmand'', Icelandic ''kaupmaður'': in all these words, the first syllable comes ultimately from Latin ''caupo'', &quot;tradesman&quot;.) Copenhagen's Swedish name is ''Köpenhamn'', a direct translation of the mutually intelligible Danish name.

==History==
{{Main|History of Copenhagen|Timeline of Copenhagen}}
[[File:København1500.jpg|right|thumb|Reconstruction of Copenhagen {{circa|1500}}]]

===Early history===
Although the earliest historical records of Copenhagen are from the end of the 12th century, recent [[archaeological]] finds in connection with work on the city's metropolitan rail system revealed the remains of a large merchant's mansion near today's [[Kongens Nytorv]] from c. 1020. Excavations in [[Pilestræde]] have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where [[Strøget]] meets [[Rådhuspladsen]].

These finds indicate that Copenhagen's origins as a city go back at least to the 11th century. Substantial discoveries of [[flint]] tools in the area provide evidence of human settlements dating to the [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videnskab.dk/kultur-samfund/arkaeologer-graver-ny-teori-om-kobenhavn-op-af-mulden|title=Arkæologer graver ny teori om København op af mulden|publisher=Videnskab.dk|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=12 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians believe the town dates to the late [[Viking Age]], and was possibly founded by [[Sweyn Forkbeard|Sweyn I Forkbeard]].{{sfn|Cunningham|2013|p=35}} 
The natural harbour and good [[herring]] stocks seem to have attracted fishermen and merchants to the area on a seasonal basis from the 11th century and more permanently in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=khdsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie|title=København – historie|website=Den Store Danske |access-date=12 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first habitations were probably centred on [[Gammel Strand]] (literally &quot;old shore&quot;) in the 11thcentury or even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|title=Gammel Strand|publisher=Københavns Museum|accessdate=24 November 2013|language=Danish|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131124104344/http://www.copenhagen.dk/dk/kulturmiljo/historier_om_kbenhavn/gammel_strand1/|archivedate=24 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written mention of the town was in the 12th century when [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in [[Gesta Danorum]] referred to it as ''Portus Mercatorum'', meaning Merchants' Harbour or, in the [[Danish language|Danish]] of the time, ''Købmannahavn''.&lt;ref name=metro1415&gt;Skaarup; Jensen (2002), pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Copenhagen's founding has been dated to [[Absalon|Bishop Absalon]]'s construction of a modest fortress on the little island of [[Slotsholmen]] in 1167 where [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands today.{{sfn|Davies|1944|p=365}} The construction of the fortress was in response to attacks by [[Wends|Wendish]] pirates who plagued the coastline during the 12th century.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} Defensive ramparts and moats were completed and by 1177 St. Clemens Church had been built. Attacks by the Germans continued, and after the original fortress was eventually destroyed by the marauders, islanders replaced it with [[Copenhagen Castle]].{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}}

===Middle Ages===

In 1186, a letter from [[Pope Urban III]] states that the castle of ''Hafn'' (Copenhagen) and its surrounding lands, including the town of Hafn, were given to Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde 1158–1191 and Archbishop of Lund 1177–1201, by King [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]]. On Absalon's death, the property was to come into the ownership of the [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|Bishopric of Roskilde]].&lt;ref name=khdsd/&gt; Around 1200, the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]] was constructed on higher ground to the northeast of the town, which began to develop around it.&lt;ref name=khdsd/&gt;

As the town became more prominent, it was repeatedly attacked by the [[Hanseatic League]], and in 1368 successfully invaded during the [[Second Danish-Hanseatic War]]. As the fishing industry thrived in Copenhagen, particularly in the trade of [[herring]], the city began expanding to the north of Slotsholmen.{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1254, it received a charter as a city under Bishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Copenhagen1898&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Copenhagen|first=Dansk turistforening|title=Copenhagen, the Capital of Denmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJPVAAAAMAAJ|year=1898|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; who garnered support from the local fishing merchants against the king by granting them special privileges.{{sfn|Booth|2003|p=9}} In the mid 1330s, the first land assessment of the city was published.{{sfn|Booth|2003|p=9}}

With the establishment of the [[Kalmar Union]] (1397–1523) between [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], by about 1416 Copenhagen had emerged as the capital of Denmark when [[Eric of Pomerania]] moved his seat to Copenhagen Castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ingebritsen2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Christine|last=Ingebritsen|title=Scandinavia in World Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1VRPBAF9NcC&amp;pg=PA7|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-0966-5|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}} The University of Copenhagen was inaugurated on 1 June 1479 by King [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]], following approval from Pope [[Sixtus IV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;histuni&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://introduction.ku.dk/presentation/history/|title=History of the University|publisher=University of Copenhagen|accessdate=12 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023034930/http://introduction.ku.dk/presentation/history/|archive-date=23 October 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it the oldest university in Denmark and [[List of medieval universities|one of the oldest in Europe]]. Originally controlled by the [[Catholic Church]], the university's role in society was forced to change during the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation in Denmark]] in the late 1530s.&lt;ref name=&quot;histuni&quot;/&gt;

In disputes prior to the Reformation of 1536, the city which had been faithful to [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]], who was Catholic, was successfully besieged in 1523 by the forces of [[Frederik I of Denmark|Frederik I]], who supported [[Lutheranism]]. Copenhagen's defences were reinforced with a series of towers along the city wall. After an extended siege from July 1535 to July 1536, during which the city supported Christian II's alliance with [[Malmö]] and [[Lübeck]], it was finally forced to capitulate to [[Christian III of Denmark|Christian III]]. During the second half of the century, the city prospered from increased trade across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] supported by Dutch shipping. [[Christoffer Valkendorff]], a high-ranking statesman, defended the city's interests and contributed to its development.&lt;ref name=khdsd/&gt; The Netherlands had also become primarily Protestant, as were northern German states.

During the reign of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] between 1588 and 1648, Copenhagen had dramatic growth as a city. On his initiative at the beginning of the 17th century, two important buildings were completed on [[Slotsholmen]]: the [[Tøjhus Museum|Tøjhus Arsenal]] and [[Børsen]], the stock exchange. To foster international trade, the [[Danish East India Company|East India Company]] was founded in 1616. To the east of the city, inspired by Dutch planning, the king developed the district of [[Christianshavn]] with canals and ramparts. It was initially intended to be a fortified trading centre but ultimately became part of Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=kher&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Historie_-_Efter_Reformationen)|title=Københavns historie efter Reformationen|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian IV also sponsored an array of ambitious building projects including [[Rosenborg Slot]] and the [[Rundetårn]].{{sfn|Harding|2009|p=38}} In 1658–59, the city withstood a siege by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] under [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden|Charles X]] and successfully repelled [[Assault on Copenhagen (1659)|a major assault]].&lt;ref name=kher/&gt;

By 1661, Copenhagen had asserted its position as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, as was the fleet and most of the army. The defences were further enhanced with the completion of the [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Citadel]] in 1664 and the extension of [[Christianshavns Vold]] with its bastions in 1692, leading to the creation of a new base for the fleet at [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Nyholm]].&lt;ref name=kher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Milit%C3%A6r/S%C3%B8v%C3%A6rnet/Holmen|title=Holmen|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=23 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century===
[[File:Amalienborg Palace (8132069805).jpg|thumb|A mansion at Amalienborg in [[Frederiksstaden]], part of the [[Amalienborg Palace]]]]

Copenhagen lost around 22,000 of its population of 65,000 to the [[The plague during the Great Northern War|plague]] in 1711.{{sfn|Woodward|1998|p=10}} The city was also struck by two major fires which destroyed much of its infrastructure.{{Sfn|Christopher|2006|p=78}} The [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728]] was the largest in the history of Copenhagen. It began on the evening of 20 October, and continued to burn until the morning of 23 October, destroying approximately 28% of the city, leaving some 20% of the population homeless. No less than 47% of the medieval section of the city was completely lost. Along with the [[Copenhagen fire of 1795|1795 fire]], it is the main reason that few traces of the old town can be found in the modern city.&lt;ref&gt;Raabyemagle, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lauring|first=Kåre|title=Byen brænder|pages=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A substantial amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of [[Christiansborg Palace (1st)|Christiansborg Palace]] which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of [[Frederiksstaden]] was initiated. Designed by [[Nicolai Eigtved]] in the [[Rococo]] style, its centre contained the mansions which now form [[Amalienborg|Amalienborg Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=1921|title=Frederiksstaden, København|publisher=arkark.dk|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410025306/http://arkark.dk/building.aspx?buildingid=1921|archive-date=10 April 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major extensions to the naval base of [[Holmen Naval Base|Holmen]] were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the [[Royal Danish Theatre|Royal Theatre]] and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Københavns historie 1728-1914&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_-_historie/K%c3%b8benhavns_historie_1728-1914 |title=Københavns historie 1728–1914|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=14 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 18th century, Copenhagen benefited from Denmark's neutrality during the wars between Europe's main powers, allowing it to play an important role in trade between the states around the Baltic Sea. After Christiansborg was destroyed by fire in 1794 and another fire caused serious damage to the city in 1795, work began on the classical Copenhagen landmark of [[Højbro Plads]] while [[Nytorv]] and [[Gammel Torv]] were converged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Københavns historie 1728-1914&quot; /&gt;

===19th century===
On 2 April 1801, a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet under the command of [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Admiral Sir Hyde Parker]] attacked and defeated the neutral [[Denmark–Norway|Danish-Norwegian]] [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|fleet]] anchored near Copenhagen. Vice-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] led the main attack.{{Sfn|Nelson|2005|p=247}} He famously disobeyed Parker's order to withdraw, destroying many of the Dano-Norwegian ships before a truce was agreed.{{sfn|Cowie|1990|p=130}} Copenhagen is often considered to be Nelson's hardest-fought battle, surpassing even the heavy fighting at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].{{Sfn|Pocock|1994|p=229}} It was during this battle that Lord Nelson was said to have &quot;put the telescope to the blind eye&quot; in order not to see Admiral Parker's signal to [[Ceasefire|cease fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/court_and_social/article2372230.ece|title=Copenhagen's second battle remembered – 200 years on |work=The Times |first=Peter|last=Davies|date=3 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Second Battle of Copenhagen]] (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 5 September 1807) was from a British point of view a [[preemptive war|preemptive attack]] on Copenhagen, targeting the civilian population in order to yet again seize the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Dano-Norwegian fleet]].{{Sfn|Smith|1998|p=204}} But from a Danish point of view the battle was a terror bombardment on their capital. Particularly notable was the use of incendiary [[Congreve rocket]]s (containing phosphorus, which cannot be extinguished with water) that randomly hit the city. Few houses with straw roofs remained after the bombardment. The largest church, ''[[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Vor frue kirke]]'', was destroyed by the sea artillery. Several historians consider this battle the first [[Terrorism|terror attack]] against a major European city in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishbattles.com/waterloo/battle-copenhagen.htm |title=The Battle of Copenhagen|publisher=BritishBattles.com|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danmark_1536-1849/K%C3%B8benhavns_bombardement?highlight=K%C3%B8benhavns%20bombardement|title=Københavns bombardement|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British landed 30,000 men, they surrounded Copenhagen and the attack continued for the next three days, killing some 2,000 civilians and destroying most of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experiences of war and nationality in Denmark-Norway, 1807-1815|last=Glenthj̜, Rasmus|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9781137313898|location=New York, New York|pages=|oclc=912332684}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devastation was so great because Copenhagen relied on an [[Fortifications of Copenhagen|old defence-line]] whose limited range could not reach the British ships and their [[Range of a projectile|longer-range]] artillery.{{sfn|Hinde|1973|p=168}}

Despite the disasters of the early 19th century, Copenhagen experienced a period of intense cultural creativity known as the [[Danish Golden Age]]. Painting prospered under [[C.W. Eckersberg]] and his students while [[C.F. Hansen]] and [[Gottlieb Bindesbøll]] brought a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] look to the city's architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guldalder.dk/|title=Guide til Dansk Guldalder|publisher=Golden Days|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020127000149/http://www.guldalder.dk/|archive-date=27 January 2002|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1850s, the ramparts of the city were opened to allow new housing to be built around [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|The Lakes]] ({{lang-da|Søerne}}) that bordered the old defences to the west. By the 1880s, the districts of [[Nørrebro]] and [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] developed to accommodate those who came from the provinces to participate in the city's industrialization. This dramatic increase of space was long overdue, as not only were the old ramparts out of date as a defence system but bad [[sanitation]] in the old city had to be overcome. From 1886, the west rampart (Vestvolden) was flattened, allowing major extensions to the harbour leading to the establishment of the [[Freeport of Copenhagen]] 1892–94.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavns_Havn|title=Københavns Havn|work=Den Store Danske |language=Danish |accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electricity came in 1892 with electric trams in 1897. The spread of housing to areas outside the old ramparts brought about a huge increase in the population. In 1840, Copenhagen was inhabited by approximately 120,000 people. By 1901, it had some 400,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Københavns historie 1728-1914&quot;/&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:København fra luften Dmr topkbh k 07121.jpg|thumb|Central Copenhagen in 1939]]
By the beginning of the 20th century, Copenhagen had become a thriving industrial and administrative city. With its new [[Copenhagen City Hall|city hall]] and [[Copenhagen Central Station|railway station]], its centre was drawn towards the west.&lt;ref name=&quot;Københavns historie 1728-1914&quot;/&gt; New housing developments grew up in [[Brønshøj]] and [[Valby]] while [[Frederiksberg]] became an enclave within the city of Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Danmarks_kommuner/Frederiksberg_Kommune/Frederiksberg_Kommune_(Historie)|title=Frederiksberg Kommune – historie|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern part of [[Amager]] and Valby were also incorporated into the City of Copenhagen in 1901–02.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/khsd/1900/1900.html|first=Steffen|last=Linvald|title=Københavns hvornår skete det|publisher=København|accessdate=24 November 2013|language=Danish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230607/http://kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/khsd/1900/1900.html|archive-date=2 December 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of Denmark's neutrality in the [[First World War]], Copenhagen prospered from trade with both Britain and Germany while the city's defences were kept fully manned by some 40,000 soldiers for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dendigitalebyport.byhistorie.dk/monumenter/artikel.aspx?xid=denmark_and_southern_jutland |first=Jan|last=Baltzersen|title=Denmark and Southern Jutland during the First World War|publisher=Dansk Center for Byhistorie|accessdate= November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s there were serious shortages of goods and housing. Plans were drawn up to demolish the old part of Christianshavn and to get rid of the worst of the city's slum areas.{{sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=161}} However, it was not until the 1930s that substantial housing developments ensued,&lt;ref name=&quot;Københavns historie siden 1914&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn/K%C3%B8benhavn_-_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie_siden_1914?highlight=k%C3%B8benhavns%20historie |title=Københavns historie siden 1914|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the demolition of one side of Christianhavn's [[Torvegade]] in order to build five large blocks of flats.{{sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=161}}

[[Denmark in World War II|In Denmark during World War II]], Copenhagen was [[Occupation of Denmark|occupied by German troops]] along with the rest of the country from 9 April 1940 until 4 May 1945. German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] hoped that Denmark would be &quot;a model [[protectorate]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henning Poulsen, &quot;Dansk Modstand og Tysk Politik&quot; (&quot;Danish opposition and German Politics&quot;) in ''Jyske Historiker'' 71(1995), p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; and initially the [[Nazism|Nazi]] authorities sought to arrive at an understanding with the Danish government. The [[1943 Danish Folketing election|1943 Danish parliamentary election]] was also allowed to take place, with only the [[Communist Party of Denmark|Communist Party]] excluded. But in August 1943, after the government's collaboration with the occupation forces collapsed, several ships were sunk in Copenhagen Harbor by the [[Royal Danish Navy]] to prevent their use by the Germans. Around that time the Nazis [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|started to arrest Jews]], although most managed to escape to [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=occupation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/en/society/history/occupation/|title=The Occupation of Denmark|publisher=Denmark.dk|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 [[Ole Lippman]], leader of the Danish section of the [[Special Operations Executive]], invited the British [[Royal Air Force]] to assist their operations by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, [[Air vice-marshal|Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Basil Embry|Sir Basil Embry]] drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] and [[Gestapo]] building, the former offices of the [[Shell Oil Company]]. Political prisoners were kept in the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb the lower levels of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;milhist.dk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/shell/shell.html|title=The Bombing of the Shellhus on March 21, 1945|first=Klaus|last=Velschow|publisher=Dansk Militærhistorie|date=21 March 1945|accessdate=9 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410023949/http://www.milhist.dk/besattelsen/shell/shell.html|archive-date=10 April 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack, known as &quot;[[Operation Carthage]]&quot;, came on 22 March 1945, in three small waves. In the first wave, all six planes (carrying one bomb each) hit their target, but one of the aircraft crashed near Frederiksberg Girls School. Because of this crash, four of the planes in the two following waves assumed the school was the military target and aimed their bombs at the school, leading to the death of 123 civilians (of which 87 were schoolchildren).&lt;ref name=&quot;milhist.dk&quot;/&gt; However, 18 of the 26 political prisoners in the Shell Building managed to escape while the Gestapo archives were completely destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;milhist.dk&quot;/&gt;

On 8 May 1945 Copenhagen was officially liberated by British troops commanded by [[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] who supervised the surrender of 30,000 Germans situated around the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Occupation of Denmark|url=http://Denmark.dk/en/society/history/occupation/|work=Denmark.dk|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-war decades====
Shortly after the end of the war, an innovative urban development project known as the [[Finger Plan]] was introduced in 1947, encouraging the creation of new housing and businesses interspersed with large green areas along five &quot;fingers&quot; stretching out from the city centre along the [[S-train]] routes.&lt;ref name=&quot;OECD2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Regional Development Policies in OECD Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SK4Pg3zEHUC&amp;pg=PA357|date=4 November 2010|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-08722-4|page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cervero|1998|p=132}} With the expansion of the welfare state and women entering the work force, schools, nurseries, sports facilities and hospitals were established across the city. As a result of student unrest in the late 1960s, the former Bådsmandsstræde Barracks in [[Christianshavn]] was occupied, leading to the establishment of [[Freetown Christiania]] in September 1971.&lt;ref name=kkkh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/om-kommunen/fakta-og-statistik/historie-og-udvikling/koebenhavns-historie |title=Københavns historie |publisher=Københavns Kommune |accessdate=15 November 2013 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222905/http://www.kk.dk/da/om-kommunen/fakta-og-statistik/historie-og-udvikling/koebenhavns-historie |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motor traffic in the city grew significantly and in 1972 the trams were replaced by buses. From the 1960s, on the initiative of the young architect [[Jan Gehl]], pedestrian streets and cycle tracks were created in the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/national/%E2%80%98copenhagenizing%E2%80%99-world-one-city-time|first=Elise|last=Beacom|title='Copenhagenizing' the world, one city at a time|publisher=the Copenhagen post|date=10 November 2012|accessdate=24 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727022413/http://cphpost.dk/news/national/%E2%80%98copenhagenizing%E2%80%99-world-one-city-time|archive-date=27 July 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activity in the port of Copenhagen declined with the closure of the Holmen Naval Base.

Since the summer of 2000, Copenhagen and the Swedish city of [[Malmö]] have been connected by the [[Øresund Bridge]], which carries rail and road traffic. As a result, Copenhagen has become the centre of a larger metropolitan area spanning both nations. The bridge has brought about considerable changes in the public [[transport network|transport system]] and has led to the extensive redevelopment of [[Amager]].&lt;ref name=kkkh/&gt; The city's service and trade sectors have developed while a number of banking and financial institutions have been established. Educational institutions have also gained importance, especially the [[University of Copenhagen]] with its 35,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/koebenhavn/|title=København|publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk|accessdate=15 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important development for the city has been the [[Copenhagen Metro]], the railway system which opened in 2002 with additions until 2007, transporting some 54 million passengers by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/copenhagen/|title=Copenhagen Metro, Denmark|publisher=railwaytechnology.com|accessdate=23 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen faces the [[Øresund]] to the east, the strait of water that separates Denmark from [[Sweden]], and which connects the [[North Sea]] with the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] towns of [[Malmö]] and [[Landskrona]] lie on the Swedish side of the sound directly across from Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/travel/copenhagen-19.html|title=Copenhagen (København), Denmark|publisher=Danishnet.com|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By road, Copenhagen is {{convert|42|km}} northwest of [[Malmö]], Sweden, {{convert|85|km}} northeast of [[Næstved]], {{convert|164|km}} northeast of [[Odense]], {{convert|295|km}} east of [[Esbjerg]] and {{convert|188|km}} southeast of [[Aarhus]] by sea and road via [[Sjællands Odde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google maps | url =https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Copenhagen&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ei=USGSUuWnH_KA7QaTz4CYBA&amp;ved=0CAoQ_AUoAg  | accessdate =24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city centre lies in the area originally defined by the old [[rampart (fortification)|rampart]]s, which are still referred to as the [[Fortification Ring, Copenhagen|Fortification Ring]] (''Fæstningsringen'') and kept as a partial green band around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/parker/indre-by |title=Parker I Indre By |language=Danish |publisher=Copenhagen Municipality |accessdate=25 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023035646/http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/parker/indre-by |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then come the late-19th- and early-20th-century residential neighbourhoods of [[Østerbro]], [[Nørrebro]], [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] and [[Amagerbro]].

The central area of the city consists of relatively low-lying flat ground formed by [[moraine]]s from the last ice age while the hilly areas to the north and west frequently rise to {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The slopes of [[Valby]] and [[Brønshøj]] reach heights of over {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}}, divided by valleys running from the northeast to the southwest.

Copenhagen rests on a subsoil of flint-layered limestone deposited in the [[Danian]] period some 60 to 66 million years ago. Some [[greensand (geology)|greensand]] from the [[Selandian]] is also present. There are a few faults in the area, the most important of which is the Carlsberg fault which runs northwest to southeast through the centre of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocenter.dk/xpdf/geoviden-4-2005.pdf|author1=Lars Nielsen |author2=Alexander Lassen |author3=Hans Thybo |title=Carlsbergforkastningen|publisher=Geoviden|issue=4|pages=8–11|year=2005|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the last ice age, glaciers eroded the surface leaving a layer of moraines up to {{convert|15|m|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn/K%c3%b8benhavn_(Geologi)|title=København – geologi|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beaches===
[[File:Amager Strandpark - kite surfers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Amager Strandpark]]]]
[[File:Kopenhagen, Kalvebod Bølge.jpg|thumb|Kalvebod Bølge - public beach within the city]]
[[Amager Strandpark]], which opened in 2005, is a {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} long [[artificial island]], with a total of {{convert|4.6|km|1|abbr=on}} of beaches.

===Climate===
[[File:Frederiksberg Palace from above (winter).JPG|left|thumb|[[Frederiksberg Palace]] in winter]]
Copenhagen is in the [[oceanic climate]] zone ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb&amp;#x202f;'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/climate/Denmark.htm|title=Denmark|publisher=Weather Online|accessdate=17 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its weather is subject to [[low pressure area|low-pressure systems]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Apart from slightly higher rainfall from July to September, precipitation is moderate. While snowfall occurs mainly from late December to early March, there can also be rain, with average temperatures around the freezing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,copenhagen,Denmark|title=Average weather in Copenhagen, Denmark|publisher=World Weather and Climate Information|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

June is the sunniest month of the year with an average of about eight hours of sunshine a day. July is the warmest month with an average daytime high of 21&amp;nbsp;°C. By contrast, the average hours of sunshine are less than two per day in November and only one and a half per day from December to February. In the spring, it gets warmer again with four to six hours of sunshine per day from March to May. February is the driest month of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/arkiver/normaler-og-ekstremer/klimanormaler-dk/|title=Klimanormaler|publisher=Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut|accessdate=1 February 2014|language=Danish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130804083803/http://www.dmi.dk/vejr/arkiver/normaler-og-ekstremer/klimanormaler-dk/|archive-date=4 August 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptional weather conditions can bring as much as 50&amp;nbsp;cm of snow to Copenhagen in a 24-hour period during the winter months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cph.dk/CPH/DK/MAIN/Foer+afrejse/Vejr+og+flyvning/Kl%C3%A6dt+p%C3%A5+til+vinteren.htm |title=Københavns Lufthavn er klædt på til vinteren |publisher=CPH |accessdate=17 November 2013 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111045859/http://www.cph.dk/CPH/DK/MAIN/Foer%2Bafrejse/Vejr%2Bog%2Bflyvning/Kl%C3%A6dt%2Bp%C3%A5%2Btil%2Bvinteren.htm |archivedate=11 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while summer temperatures have been known to rise to heights of {{convert|33|°C|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.dk/danmark/varmeste-dag-i-37-aar|title=Exceptionel varm sommerdag i København|publisher=BT|date=21 September 2012|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Copenhagen's northern latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight. There is therefore a difference of 10 hours and 31 minutes in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torbenhermansen.dk/almanak/almanak.php#|title=Sol op/ned |publisher=Almanak|accessdate=17 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Statistics Denmark]], the [[urban area of Copenhagen]]  ({{lang|da|Hovedstadsområdet}}) consists of the [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] of [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]], [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]], [[Albertslund Municipality|Albertslund]], [[Brøndby Municipality|Brøndby]], [[Gentofte Municipality|Gentofte]], [[Gladsaxe Municipality|Gladsaxe]], [[Glostrup Municipality|Glostrup]], [[Herlev Municipality|Herlev]], [[Hvidovre Municipality|Hvidovre]], [[Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality|Lyngby-Taarbæk]], [[Rødovre Municipality|Rødovre]], [[Tårnby Municipality|Tårnby]] and [[Vallensbæk Municipality|Vallensbæk]] as well as parts of [[Ballerup Municipality|Ballerup]], [[Rudersdal Municipality|Rudersdal]] and [[Furesø Municipality|Furesø]] municipalities, along with the cities of [[Ishøj]] and [[Greve Strand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pop1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;urban&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/pukora/epub/Nyt/2007/NR415.pdf|publisher=Danmarks Statistik|title=Byopgørelse 1. januar 2007 (Largest cities of Denmark 2007)|language=Danish|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are located in the [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]] ({{lang|da|Region Hovedstaden}}). Municipalities are responsible for a wide variety of [[public service]]s, which include land-use planning, environmental planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, and social security. Municipal administration is also conducted by a [[mayor]], a council, and an executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Danish Local Government System|url=http://www.kl.dk/ImageVaultFiles/id_38221/cf_202/Background_Paper_-_Local_Government_in_Denmark.PDF|website=kl.dk|publisher=Local Government Denmark|accessdate=22 April 2016|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen Municipality is by far the largest municipality, with the historic city at its core. The seat of Copenhagen's municipal council is the [[Copenhagen City Hall]] (''{{lang|da|Rådhus}}''), which is situated on [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]]. The second largest municipality is Frederiksberg, an enclave within Copenhagen Municipality.

Copenhagen Municipality is divided into [[Districts of Copenhagen|ten districts]] (''bydele''):&lt;ref name=&quot;Københavns bydele&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/om-kommunen/fakta-og-statistik/statistik-og-historie/saadan-er-byen-inddelt/bydele |title=Københavns bydele |publisher=Københavns Kommune |accessdate=31 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904010537/http://www.kk.dk/da/om-kommunen/fakta-og-statistik/statistik-og-historie/saadan-er-byen-inddelt/bydele |archivedate=4 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indre By]], [[Østerbro]], [[Nørrebro]], [[Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave]], [[Valby]], [[Vanløse]], [[Brønshøj-Husum]], [[Bispebjerg]], [[Amager Øst]], and [[Amager Vest]].

===Law and order===
Most of Denmark's top legal courts and institutions are based in Copenhagen. A modern style [[court|court of justice]], ''Hof- og Stadsretten'', was introduced in Denmark, specifically for Copenhagen, by [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Jura/Retshistorie/Hof-_og_Stadsretten|title=Hof- og Stadsretten|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now known as the [[Copenhagen Court House|City Court of Copenhagen]] (''Københavns Byret''), it is the largest of the 24 city courts in Denmark with jurisdiction over the municipalities of Copenhagen, [[Dragør]] and [[Tårnby]]. With its 42 judges, it has a Probate Division, an Enforcement Division and a Registration and Notorial Acts Division while bankruptcy is handled by the [[Maritime and Commercial Court (Denmark)|Maritime and Commercial Court of Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domstol.dk/KobenhavnsByret/Pages/TheCityCourtofCopenhagen.aspx|title=The City Court of Copenhagen|publisher=Danmarks Domstole: Københavns Byret|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1862, the Maritime and Commercial Court (''Sø- og Handelsretten'') also hears commercial cases including those relating to trade marks, marketing practices and competition for the whole of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.domstol.dk/om/otherlanguages/english/thedanishjudicialsystem/maritimeandcommercialcourt/Pages/default.aspx|title=The Copenhagen Maritime and Commercial Court |publisher=Danmarks Domstole |accessdate=29 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark's [[Supreme Court of Denmark|Supreme Court]] (''Højesteret''), located in [[Christiansborg Palace]] on Prins Jørgens Gård in the centre of Copenhagen, is the country's final court of appeal. Handling civil and criminal cases from the subordinate courts, it has two chambers which each hear all types of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Jura/Retspleje_og_domstole/H%C3%B8jesteret?highlight=h%C3%B8jester%20ret|title=Højesteret|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=29 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Danish National Police]] and Copenhagen Police headquarters is situated in the Neoclassical-inspired [[Copenhagen Police Headquarters|Politigården]] building built in 1918–24 under architects [[Hack Kampmann]] and [[Holger Jacobsen|Holger Alfred Jacobsen]]. The building also contains administration, management, emergency department and radio service offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/police-headquarters-gdk559779|title=Police headquarters|publisher=Visitcopenhagen.com|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001650/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/police-headquarters-gdk559779|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their efforts to deal with drugs, the police have noted considerable success in the two special drug consumption rooms opened by the city where [[addict]]s can use sterile needles and receive help from nurses if necessary. Use of these rooms does not lead to prosecution; the city treats drug use as a public health issue, not a criminal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2013_10_30/Britain-eyes-Denmarks-safe-drug-room-experience-4408/|title=Britain eyes Denmark's safe drug room experience|publisher=The Voice of Russia, BBC|date=30 October 2013|accessdate=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen aims to be [[carbon-neutral]] by 2025. Commercial and residential buildings are to reduce electricity consumption by 20 percent and 10 percent respectively, and total heat consumption is to fall by 20 percent by 2025. Renewable energy features such as solar panels are becoming increasingly common in the newest buildings in Copenhagen. [[District heating]] will be carbon-neutral by 2025, by waste [[incineration]] and biomass. New buildings must now be constructed according to Low Energy Class ratings and in 2020 near net-zero energy buildings. By 2025, 75% of trips should be made on foot, by bike, or by using public transit. The city plans that 20–30% of cars will run on electricity or [[biofuel]] by 2025. The investment is estimated at $472 million public funds and $4.78 billion private funds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/12/copenhagen-push-carbon-neutral-2025 Copenhagen's ambitious push to be carbon-neutral by 2025] Guardian 12 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's urban planning authorities continue to take full account of these priorities. Special attention is given both to climate issues and efforts to ensure maximum application of [[Low-energy house|low-energy standards]]. Priorities include [[sustainable drainage system]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nordvand.dk/klimatilpasning/Sider/default.aspx We make room for the rainwater] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150729044059/http://nordvand.dk/klimatilpasning/Sider/default.aspx |date=29 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water conservation|recycling rainwater]], [[green roof]]s and efficient [[waste management]] solutions.

These solutions support operations covered by the city administration to improve e.g. public health, district heating, urban mobility and waste management systems. Smart city operations in Copenhagen are maintained by [https://cphsolutionslab.dk/en Copenhagen Solutions Lab], the city's official smart-city development unit under the Technical and Environmental Administration.

Copenhagen is the most populous city in Denmark and one of the [[List of urban areas in the Nordic countries|most populous in the Nordic countries]]. For statistical purposes, [[Statistics Denmark]] considers the [[City of Copenhagen]] (''Byen København'') to consist of the [[Copenhagen Municipality|Municipality of Copenhagen]] plus three adjacent municipalities: [[Dragør Municipality|Dragør]], [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]], and [[Tårnby Municipality|Tårnby]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dst.dk&quot;/&gt; Their combined population stands at 763,908 ({{as of|2016|12|lc=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The Municipality of Copenhagen is by far the most populous [[municipalities of Denmark|in the country]] and one of the [[List of the most populated municipalities in the Nordic countries|most populous Nordic municipalities]] with 601,448 inhabitants ({{as of|2016|12|lc=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;pop1&quot; /&gt; There was a demographic boom in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, largely due to [[immigration to Denmark]]. According to figures from the first quarter of 2016, approximately 76% of the municipality's population was of [[Danes|Danish]] descent,&lt;ref name=&quot;countryoforigin&quot; /&gt; defined as having at least one parent who was born in Denmark and has Danish citizenship. Much of the remaining 24% were of a foreign background, defined as immigrants (18%) or descendants of recent immigrants (6%).&lt;ref name=&quot;countryoforigin&quot; /&gt; There are no official statistics on [[ethnic group]]s. The adjacent table shows the most common countries of birth of Copenhagen residents.

According to Statistics Denmark, Copenhagen's urban area has a larger population of 1,280,371 ({{As of|2016|01|01|lc=y}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;pop1&quot; /&gt; The urban area consists of the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg plus 16 of the 20 municipalities of the former counties [[Copenhagen County|Copenhagen]] and [[Roskilde County|Roskilde]], though five of them only partially.&lt;ref name=&quot;urban&quot; /&gt; [[Copenhagen metropolitan area|Metropolitan Copenhagen]] has a total of 2,016,285 inhabitants ({{as of|2016|lc=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;pop1&quot; /&gt; The area of Metropolitan Copenhagen is defined by the [[Finger Plan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fingerplan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Finger Plan: A Strategy for the Development of the Greater Copenhagen Area|url=https://danishbusinessauthority.dk/sites/default/files/fp-eng_31_13052015.pdf|publisher=Danish Ministry of the Environment|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the opening of the [[Øresund Bridge]] in 2000, commuting between [[Zealand]] and [[Scania]] in Sweden has increased rapidly, leading to a wider, integrated area. Known as the Øresund Region, it has 3.8 million inhabitants (of whom 2.5 million live in the Danish part of the region).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orestat.se/da/node/99|title=Befolkning: Befolkningsvækst|publisher=ÖresundsStatistik och analyser|accessdate=6 December 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{See also|List of churches in Copenhagen|Religion in Denmark}}
[[File:Vor Frue Kirke Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]], situated on [[Frue Plads]]]]

A majority (56.9%) of those living in Copenhagen are members of the Lutheran [[Church of Denmark]] which is 0.6% lower than one year earlier according to 2019 figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/kirkestatistik/folkekirkens-medlemstal/ |title=Folkekirkens medlemstal |publisher=Kirkeministeriet |accessdate=3 June 2019 |language=Danish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413042049/http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/kirkestatistik/folkekirkens-medlemstal/ |archive-date=13 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Cathedral, the [[Church of Our Lady (Copenhagen)|Church of Our Lady]], is one of the dozens of churches in Copenhagen. There are also several other Christian communities in the city, of which the largest is [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katolsk.dk/fileadmin/katolsk/User_oploads/dokumenter_bispekontoret/Noegletal_2010_Sogneoekonomi.pdf|title=Nøgletal for sognene|publisher=Katolsk.dk|accessdate=26 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign migration to Copenhagen, rising over the last three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the [[Grand Mosque of Copenhagen]], the first in Denmark, opened in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hooper|first1=Simon|title=Denmark's first mosque opens amid controversy|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/denmark-first-mosque-opens-amid-controversy-2014620122224383831.html|accessdate=15 April 2016|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]] is the second largest religion in Copenhagen, accounting for approximately 10% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nydell&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Nydell|first=Margaret K.|title=Understanding Arabs: a contemporary guide to Arab society|publisher=Intercultural Press|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-0-9839558-0-1|page=132|quote=In 2011 they constituted 25 percent of Rotterdam, Marseilles, and Amsterdam; 20% of Malmö; 15 percent of Brussels and Birmingham; and 10 percent of London, Paris, Copenhagen, and Vienna. &lt;br/&gt; Muslims in Western Europe originate from both Arab and non-Arab countries.

===Quality of living===
For a number of years, Copenhagen has ranked high in international surveys for its [[quality of life]]. Its stable economy together with its education services and level of social safety make it attractive for locals and visitors alike. Although it is one of the world's most expensive cities, it is also one of the most liveable with its public transport, facilities for cyclists and its environmental policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110906-living-in-copenhagen|first=Sunshine|last=Flint|title=Living in Copenhagen|publisher=BBC|date=September 2011|access-date=30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In elevating Copenhagen to &quot;most liveable city&quot; in 2013, ''[[Monocle (media company)|Monocle]]'' pointed to its open spaces, increasing activity on the streets, city planning in favour of cyclists and pedestrians, and features to encourage inhabitants to enjoy city life with an emphasis on community, culture and cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monocle.com/film/affairs/most-liveable-city-copenhagen/|title=Most liveable city: Copenhagen|publisher=Monocle|access-date=30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have ranked Copenhagen high for its business environment, accessibility, restaurants and environmental planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/prestigious-titles-and-rankings-copenhagen|title=Prestigious titles and rankings to Copenhagen|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|date=6 September 2013|access-date=30 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001204/http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/prestigious-titles-and-rankings-copenhagen|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Copenhagen ranks only 39th for [[student]] friendliness in 2012. Despite a top score for quality of living, its scores were low for employer activity and affordability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universitypost.dk/article/copenhagen-high-quality-life-price|first=Polina|last=Chebotareva|title=Copenhagen is high quality of life, but at a price|publisher=University Post|date=15 February 2012|access-date=30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Copenhagen is the major economic and [[financial centre]] of Denmark. The city's economy is based largely on services and commerce. Statistics for 2010 show that the vast majority of the 350,000 workers in Copenhagen are employed in the [[service sector]], especially transport and communications, trade, and finance, while less than 10,000 work in the [[manufacturing|manufacturing industries]]. The [[public sector]] workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://subsite.kk.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/CityOfCopenhagen/SubsiteFrontpage/Press/FactsOnCopenhagen/Statistics/Labor%20market/WorkplacesByIndustry.aspx|title=Workplaces in Copenhagen by industry and residence of the employed, 1 January 2010|publisher=City of Copenhagen|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223959/https://subsite.kk.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/CityOfCopenhagen/SubsiteFrontpage/Press/FactsOnCopenhagen/Statistics/Labor%20market/WorkplacesByIndustry.aspx|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2011, the economy grew by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damvad.com/media/82689/erhvervsdata_kk-endelig.pdf |title=Udvalgte indikatorer for Københavns erhvervsmæssige præstationer og rammevilkår |publisher=DAMVAD |date=14 November 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2013 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203030344/http://www.damvad.com/media/82689/erhvervsdata_kk-endelig.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the wider [[Capital Region of Denmark]] had a [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of €120 billion, and the 15th largest [[GDP per capita]] of regions in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional GDP per capita in the EU in 2010|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/1-21032013-AP/EN/1-21032013-AP-EN.PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403140856/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/1-21032013-AP/EN/1-21032013-AP-EN.PDF|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 April 2013|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=14 April 2016|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Krystallen (Nykredit).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[The Crystal, Copenhagen|The Crystal]], headquarters of [[Nykredit]] bank]]
Several financial institutions and banks have headquarters in Copenhagen, including [[Alm. Brand]], [[Danske Bank]], [[Nykredit]] and [[Nordea Bank Danmark]]. The [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] (CSE) was founded in 1620 and is now owned by [[Nasdaq, Inc.]]. Copenhagen is also home to a number of international companies including [[Maersk|A.P.

[[Biology|Life science]] is a key sector with extensive [[research and development]] activities. [[Medicon Valley]]  is a leading bi-national life sciences cluster in Europe, spanning the Øresund Region. Copenhagen is rich in companies and institutions with a focus on [[research and development]] within the field of biotechnology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copcap.com/BusinessOpportunities/Life%20science/background |title=Life Science in the Øresund Region |publisher=Copenhagen Capacity |accessdate=23 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112173601/http://www.copcap.com/BusinessOpportunities/Life%20science/background |archivedate=12 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Medicon Valley initiative aims to strengthen this position and to promote cooperation between companies and academia. Many major Danish companies like Novo Nordisk and [[Lundbeck]], both of which are among the [[List of pharmaceutical companies|50 largest pharmaceutical and biotech companies in the world]], are located in this business cluster.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/marketplace/ibi/copenhagen.htm |title=Copenhagen – Overview|publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=19 May 2009 |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shipping is another import sector with Maersk, the world's largest [[List of ship companies|shipping company]], having their world headquarters in Copenhagen. The city has an industrial harbour, [[Copenhagen Port]]. Following decades of stagnation, it has experienced a resurgence since 1990 following a merger with [[Malmö]] harbour. Both ports are operated by [[Copenhagen Malmö Port]] (CMP). The central location in the Øresund Region allows the ports to act as a hub for freight that is transported onward to the [[Baltic countries]]. CMP annually receives about 8,000 ships and handled some 148,000 [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://annualreport2012.cmport.com/archive/files/19811/CMP%20Annual%20Report%202012.pdf.aspx |title=Copenhagen Malmö Port Annual Report 2012 |publisher=Copenhagen Malmö Port |format=PDF |accessdate=15 April 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017112214/http://annualreport2012.cmport.com/archive/files/19811/CMP%20Annual%20Report%202012.pdf.aspx |archivedate=17 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen has some of the highest gross wages in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/richest_cities.html |title=World's richest cities |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; High taxes mean that wages are reduced after mandatory deduction. A ''beneficial researcher scheme'' with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for [[Immigration|foreign labour]]. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/expensive_cities_eiu.html |title=World's most expensive cities (EIU) |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/economics/expensive_cities2.html |title=World's most expensive cities – Ranking |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark's [[Flexicurity]] model features some of the most flexible hiring and firing legislation in Europe, providing attractive conditions for [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] and international companies looking to locate in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copcap.com/invest-in-greater-copenhagen/10-good-reasons |title=Reasons to invest in Greater Copenhagen |publisher=Copenhagen Capacity |accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dansk Industri]]'s 2013 survey of employment factors in the ninety-six municipalities of Denmark, Copenhagen came in first place for educational qualifications and for the development of private companies in recent years, but fell to 86th place in local companies' assessment of the employment climate. The survey revealed considerable dissatisfaction in the level of dialogue companies enjoyed with the municipal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://di.dk/DI/Regionalt/Hovedstaden/Nyt%20fra%20DI%20Hovedstaden/Pages/PressemeddelelseKoebenhavnsvirksomhederefterlyserbedreerhvervsklima.aspx |title=Pressemeddelelse: Københavns virksomheder efterlyser bedre erhvervsklima |publisher=Dansk Industri |date=4 September 2013 |accessdate=18 November 2013 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210160559/http://di.dk/DI/Regionalt/Hovedstaden/Nyt%20fra%20DI%20Hovedstaden/Pages/PressemeddelelseKoebenhavnsvirksomhederefterlyserbedreerhvervsklima.aspx |archivedate=10 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
{{See also|Tourism in Denmark}}
Tourism is a major contributor to Copenhagen's economy, attracting visitors due to the city's harbour, cultural attractions and award-winning restaurants. Since 2009, Copenhagen has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan destinations in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourismstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Copenhagen – a city of growth|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/global-connected/copenhagen/copenhagen-city-growth|publisher=Wonderful Copenhagen / Global Connected|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hotel capacity in the city is growing significantly. From 2009 to 2013, it experienced a 42% growth in international bed nights (total number of nights spent by tourists), tallying a rise of nearly 70% for Chinese visitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourismstats&quot; /&gt; The total number of bed nights in the Capital Region surpassed 9 million in 2013, while international bed nights reached 5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourismstats&quot; /&gt;

In 2010, it is estimated that [[wikt:city break|city break]] tourism contributed to DKK 2 billion in turnover. However, 2010 was an exceptional year for city break tourism and turnover increased with 29% in that one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copenhagen City Break Strategy 2012–2014|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.dk/sites/default/files/asp/visitcopenhagen/Corporate/PDF-filer/Analyser/Citybreak/strategi_final.pdf|publisher=VisitDenmark / Wonderful Copenhagen|accessdate=15 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424010933/http://www.visitcopenhagen.dk/sites/default/files/asp/visitcopenhagen/Corporate/PDF-filer/Analyser/Citybreak/strategi_final.pdf|archive-date=24 April 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; 680,000 cruise passengers visited the port in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press room|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/cruise/copenhagen/press-room-1|publisher=Cruise Copenhagen Network|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2019 Copenhagen was ranked first among Lonely Planet's top ten cities to visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/lonely-planet-top-10-cities-2019/index.html|title=Lonely Planet's top 10 cities to visit in 2019|last=Hetter|first=Katia|date=2018-10-22|website=CNN Travel|language=en|access-date=2018-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cityscape==
{{wideimage|Copenhagen skyline.jpg|600px|The city skyline features many towers and spires.}}
The city's appearance today is shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the [[bike path|bicycle paths]] that line most streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/koebenhavn/arkitektur/koebenhavns-forskellige-bydele|title=Københavns forskellige bydele|publisher=Visit Denmark|accessdate=18 November 2013|language=Danish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213023020/http://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/koebenhavn/arkitektur/koebenhavns-forskellige-bydele|archive-date=13 December 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest section of Copenhagen's [[inner city]] is often referred to as ''Middelalderbyen'' (the [[medieval]] city).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guides.dk/Turforslag/Bytur-i-Koebenhavn.html|title=København – byen ved vandet&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=Guides.dk|language=Danish|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the city's most distinctive district is [[Frederiksstaden]], developed during the reign of [[Frederick V of Denmark|Frederick V]]. It has the [[Amalienborg|Amalienborg Palace]] at its centre and is dominated by the dome of [[Frederik's Church]] (or the Marble Church) and several elegant 18th-century [[Rococo]] mansions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verdensarv.dk/english/candidates/frederiksstad-with-amalienborg/ |title=Frederiksstad with Amalienborg |publisher=Kultur Styrelsen |accessdate=20 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214204614/http://www.verdensarv.dk/english/candidates/frederiksstad-with-amalienborg/ |archivedate=14 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner city includes [[Slotsholmen]], a little island on which [[Christiansborg Palace]] stands and [[Christianshavn]] with its canals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/sightseeing/copenhagen-city-centre|title=Copenhagen city centre|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Børsen]] on Slotsholmen and [[Frederiksborg Palace]] in Hillerød are prominent examples of the [[Dutch Renaissance]] style in Copenhagen. Around the historical city centre lies a band of congenial residential boroughs ([[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]], [[Nørrebro|Inner Nørrebro]], [[Indre Østerbro|Inner Østerbro]]) dating mainly from late 19th century. They were built outside the old ramparts when the city was finally allowed to expand beyond its fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noerrebrolokalhistorie.dk/historie.php|title=Lidt Nørrebro-historie|publisher=Nørrebro Lokalhistoriske Forening og Arkiv|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes referred to as &quot;the City of Spires&quot;, Copenhagen is known for its horizontal skyline, broken only by the spires and towers of its churches and castles. Most characteristic of all is the [[Baroque]] spire of the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its narrowing external spiral stairway that visitors can climb to the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker/Vor_Frelsers_Kirke|title=Vor Frelsers Kirke (København)|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=21 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important spires are those of [[Christiansborg Palace]], the [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and the former Church of St. Nikolaj that now houses a [[modern art]] venue. Not quite so high are the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] spires of [[Rosenborg Castle]] and the &quot;dragon spire&quot; of [[Børsen|Christian IV's former stock exchange]], so named because it resembles the intertwined tails of four dragons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Kapper Hansen|title=Tårne, spir og kupler: om Københavns og Frederiksbergs karakteristiske tårnlandskab|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5hqGQAACAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Tårngruppen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen is recognised globally as an exemplar of best practice [[urban planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Urban Planning in Copenhagen|url=http://www.scandinaviastandard.com/a-brief-look-at-urban-planning-in-copenhagen/|website=Scandinavia Standard|accessdate=9 May 2017|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its thriving mixed use city centre is defined by striking contemporary architecture, engaging public spaces and an abundance of human activity. These design outcomes have been deliberately achieved through careful replanning in the second half of the 20th century.

Recent years have seen a boom in modern architecture in Copenhagen&lt;ref name=&quot;baumeister1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baumeister.de/|title=B1 Kopenhagen entdecken|publisher=Baumeister – Zeitschrift für Architektur|year=2009|language=German|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; both for [[Architecture of Denmark|Danish architecture]] and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but since the turn of the millennium the city and its immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine ''[[Monocle (2007 magazine)|Monocle]]'' named Copenhagen the ''World's best design city 2008''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/copenhagen-probably-the-best-city-in-the-world-842782.html|title=World's best design city 2008|work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Emily|last=Dugan|date=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen's urban development in the first half of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted [[Fordism]] and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=New City Spaces|last=Gehl|first=Jan|publisher=Danish Architectural Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copenhagen's spatial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New City Spaces|last=Gehl|first=Jan|publisher=Danish Architectural Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boom in urban development and [[modern architecture]] has brought some changes to the city's skyline. A political majority has decided to keep the historical centre free of high-rise buildings, but several areas will see or have already seen massive urban development. [[Ørestad]] now has seen most of the recent development. Located near [[Copenhagen Airport]], it currently boasts one of the largest malls in Scandinavia and a variety of office and residential buildings as well as the [[IT University of Copenhagen|IT University]] and a high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orestad.dk/~/media/Orestad/pdf/Copenhagen-Growing_web.ashx|title=Copenhagen growing|publisher=By&amp;Havn|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks, gardens and zoo===
{{Main|Parks and open spaces in Copenhagen}}
[[File:Rosenborg - park setting.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rosenborg Castle]] and park in central Copenhagen]]
Copenhagen is a green city with many parks, both large and small. [[Rosenborg Castle Gardens|King's Garden]] (''{{lang|da|Kongens Have}}''), the garden of [[Rosenborg Castle]], is the oldest and most frequented of them all.&lt;ref name=&quot;www1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ses.dk/392755f0|title=King's Garden|publisher=Slots- og Ejeondomsstyrelsen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329224035/http://www.ses.dk/392755f0|archivedate=29 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] who first developed its landscaping in 1606. Every year it sees more than 2.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/kongens-have|title=Kongens Have|publisher=AOK|author=Else Marie Brakchi|date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the summer months it is packed with sunbathers, picnickers and ballplayers. It serves as a [[sculpture garden]] with both a permanent display and temporary exhibits during the summer months.&lt;ref name=&quot;www1&quot;/&gt; Also located in the city centre are the [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden|Botanical Gardens]] noted for their large complex of 19th-century greenhouses donated by [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] founder [[J. C. Jacobsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlsbergdanmark.dk/omos/Historie/IJacobsensfodspor/Kobenhavn/Pages/BotaniskHave.aspx|title=Botanisk Have|publisher=Carlsberg}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fælledparken]] at {{convert|58|ha|abbr=on}} is the largest park in Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/faelledparken |title=Fælledparken|publisher=AOK|author=Af Kasper Olsen|date=15 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is popular for sports fixtures and hosts several annual events including a free opera concert at the opening of the opera season, other open-air concerts, [[carnival]] and Labour Day celebrations, and the [[Copenhagen Historic Grand Prix]], a race for [[antique car]]s. A historical [[green belt|green space]] in the northeastern part of the city is [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]], a well-preserved Renaissance [[citadel]] that now serves mainly as a park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kastelletsvenner.dk/index.php?page=kastellet |title=Kastellets historie |publisher=Kastellets Venner &amp; Historiske Sampling |accessdate=21 November 2013 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203034650/http://kastelletsvenner.dk/index.php?page=kastellet |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another popular park is the [[Frederiksberg Gardens]], a 32-hectare [[romanticism|romantic]] [[landscape garden|landscape park]]. It houses a colony of tame [[grey heron]]s and other [[waterfowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slke.dk/kongelige-haver/frederiksberg-have-og-soendermarken/frederiksberg-have/ |title=Frederiksberg Have |publisher=Slotte &amp; Kulture-Ejendomme |accessdate=21 November 2013 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225335/http://www.slke.dk/kongelige-haver/frederiksberg-have-og-soendermarken/frederiksberg-have/ |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The park offers views of the elephants and the elephant house designed by world-famous British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] of the adjacent [[Copenhagen Zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcspace.com/features/norman-foster--partners/elephant-house/|title=Elephant House: Norman Foster &amp; Partners|publisher=arcspace-com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708031057/http://arcspace.com/features/norman-foster--partners/elephant-house/|archive-date=8 July 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Langelinie]], a park and promenade along the inner [[Øresund]] coast, is home to one of Copenhagen's most-visited tourist attractions, the [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|Little Mermaid statue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/langelinie-gdk414235|title=Langelinie|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Copenhagen, many [[cemetery|cemeteries]] double as parks, though only for the more quiet activities such as sunbathing, reading and meditation. [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]], the burial place of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], is an important green space for the district of [[Nørrebro|Inner Nørrebro]] and a Copenhagen institution. The lesser known [[Vestre Cemetery|Vestre Kirkegaard]] is the largest cemetery in Denmark ({{convert|54|ha|abbr=on}}) and offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown [[tomb]]s, monuments, tree-lined avenues, lakes and other [[List of garden features|garden feature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde |title=Kirkegårde |publisher=Københavns Kommune |language=Danish |accessdate=21 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023034448/http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is official municipal policy in Copenhagen that by 2015 all citizens must be able to reach a park or beach on foot in less than 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dac.dk/da/dac-cities/baeredygtige-byer/alle-cases/groen-by/koebenhavn-lommeparker--groenne-aandehuller-i-byen/|title=København: Lommeparker – Grønne Åndehuller i Byen|publisher=DAC &amp; Cities|accessdate=21 November 2013|language=Danish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031201244/http://www.dac.dk/da/dac-cities/baeredygtige-byer/alle-cases/groen-by/koebenhavn-lommeparker--groenne-aandehuller-i-byen/|archive-date=31 October 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this policy, several new parks, including the innovative [[Superkilen]] in the Nørrebro district, have been completed or are under development in areas lacking green spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2008/10/05/suk-project-by-big-architects/|title=Superkilen by Bjarke Ingels Group|publisher=Dezeen|accessdate=5 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landmarks by district===

====Indre By====
The historic centre of the city, [[Indre By]] or the Inner City, features many of Copenhagen's most popular monuments and attractions. The area known as [[Frederiksstaden]], developed by [[Frederik V of Denmark|Frederik V]] in the second half of the 18th century in the [[Rococo]] style, has the four mansions of [[Amalienborg]], the royal residence, and the wide-domed [[Frederik's Church|Marble Church]] at its centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/K%C3%B8benhavns_historie/Frederiksstaden|title=Frederiksstaden|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directly across the water from Amalienborg, the recently completed [[Copenhagen Opera]] stands on the island of [[Holmen, Copenhagen|Holmen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faktalink.dk/titelliste/open|author1=Charlotte Haase |author2=Susanne Nørgaard |title=Operaen|publisher=Faktalink|accessdate=27 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south of Frederiksstaden, the [[Nyhavn]] canal is lined with colourful houses from the 17th and 18th centuries, many now with lively restaurants and bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/cph-nyhavn.asp|title=Nyhavn|publisher=Copenhagenet.dk|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The canal runs from the harbour front to the spacious square of [[Kongens Nytorv]] which was laid out by [[Christian V]] in 1670. Important buildings include [[Charlottenborg Palace]], famous for its art exhibitions, the [[Embassy of France, Copenhagen|Thott Palace]] (now the French embassy), the [[Royal Danish Theatre]] and the [[Hotel D'Angleterre]], dated to 1755.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/kings-new-square-gdk428111|title=King's New Square|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other landmarks in Indre By include the parliament building of [[Christiansborg]], the [[Copenhagen City Hall|City Hall]] and [[Rundetårn]], originally an observatory. There are also several museums in the area including [[Thorvaldsen Museum]] dedicated to the 18th-century sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.usnews.com/Copenhagen_Denmark/Neighborhoods/|title=Copenhagen Neighborhoods and Towns|publisher=U.S. News Travel|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed to traffic since 1964, [[Strøget]], the world's oldest and longest pedestrian street, runs the {{convert |3.2|km|abbr=on}} from Rådhuspladsen to Kongens Nytorv. With its speciality shops, cafés, restaurants, and [[buskers]], it is always full of life and includes the old squares of [[Gammel Torv]] and [[Amagertorv]], each with a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/CPH-Pedestrian.asp|title=The Pedestrian Street -'Strøget'|publisher=Copenhagenet.dk|accessdate=1 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosenborg Castle]] on [[Øster Voldgade]] was built by Christian IV in 1606 as a summer residence in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style. It houses the Danish crown jewels and [[Danish Crown Regalia|crown regalia]], the [[Throne Chair of Denmark|coronation throne]] and tapestries illustrating Christian V's victories in the [[Scanian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/rosenborg-castle-gdk410582|title=Rosenborg Castle|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=6 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianshavn====
[[File:Christianshavns Kanal boats.jpg|thumb|[[Christianshavn]] Canal]]
[[Christianshavn]] lies to the southeast of [[Indre By]] on the other side of the harbour. The area was developed by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] in the early 17th century. Impressed by the city of [[Amsterdam]], he employed Dutch architects to create canals within its [[Christianshavns Vold|ramparts]] which are still well preserved today.&lt;ref name=kher/&gt; The canals themselves, branching off the central [[Christianshavns Kanal|Christianshavn Canal]] and lined with house boats and pleasure craft are one of the area's attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.travtasy.com/2018/04/copenhagen-itinerary-5-days-denmark.html|title=5 Days in Copenhagen Itinerary &amp; What To Do|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another interesting feature is [[Freetown Christiania]], a fairly large area which was initially occupied by squatters during student unrest in 1971. Today it still maintains a measure of autonomy. The inhabitants openly sell drugs on &quot;Pusher Street&quot; as well as their arts and crafts. Other buildings of interest in Christianshavn include the [[Church of Our Saviour, Copenhagen|Church of Our Saviour]] with its spiralling steeple and the magnificent Rococo [[Christian's Church, Copenhagen|Christian's Church]]. Once a warehouse, the [[North Atlantic House]] now displays culture from Iceland and Greenland and houses the [[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]] restaurant, known for its Nordic cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/maritime-christianshavn-holmen|title=Maritime Christianshavn &amp; Holmen|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-christianshavn|title=Guide to Christianshavn|publisher=AOK|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vesterbro====
[[File:Halmtorvet seen from Øksnehallen.jpg|thumb|[[Halmtorvet]] in [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]]]]
[[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]], to the southwest of Indre By, begins with the [[Tivoli Gardens]], the city's top tourist attraction with its fairground atmosphere, its [[Pantomimeteatret|Pantomime Theatre]], its [[Tivolis Koncertsal|Concert Hall]] and its many rides and restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/cph-map/cph-tivoli.asp|title=Tivoli|publisher=Copanhagenet.dk|accessdate=27 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Carlsberg (district)|Carlsberg]] neighbourhood has some interesting vestiges of the old brewery of the same name including the [[Elephant Gate and Tower, Carlsberg|Elephant Gate]] and the [[Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/heritage/Pages/footprints.aspx |title=In the Footprints of Carlsberg's founders |publisher=Carlsberg Group |accessdate=27 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202225237/http://www.carlsberggroup.com/Company/heritage/Pages/footprints.aspx |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tycho Brahe Planetarium]] is located on the edge of [[The Lakes, Copenhagen|Skt.

====Nørrebro====
[[File:Nørrebrogade - beginning.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dronning Louises Bro]] leading into [[Nørrebrogade]]]]
[[Nørrebro]] to the northwest of the city centre has recently developed from a working-class district into a colourful cosmopolitan area with antique shops, non-Danish food stores and restaurants. Much of the activity is centred on [[Sankt Hans Torv]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byliv/guide-to-noerrebro|title=Guide to: Nørrebro|publisher=AOK|accessdate=28 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and around [[Rantzausgade]]. Copenhagen's historic cemetery, [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Kirkegård]] halfway up Nørrebrogade, is the resting place of many famous figures including [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Niels Bohr]], and [[Hans Christian Andersen]] but is also used by locals as a park and recreation area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde/assistens-kirkegaard |title=Assistens Kirkegård |publisher=Københavns Kommune |accessdate=28 November 2013 |language=Danish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023051043/http://www.kk.dk/da/brugbyen/brug-steder-i-byen/groenne-omraader/kirkegaarde/assistens-kirkegaard |archivedate=23 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Østerbro====
[[File:Gefion Fountain, Copenhagen, Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|The [[Gefion Fountain]]]]
Just north of the city centre, [[Østerbro]] is an upper middle-class district with a number of fine mansions, some now serving as embassies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/K%C3%B8benhavn/%C3%98sterbro|title=Østerbro|encyclopedia=Den Store Danske|accessdate=28 November 2013 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district stretches from Nørrebro to the waterfront where ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' statue can be seen from the promenade known as [[Langelinie]]. Inspired by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale, it was created by [[Edvard Eriksen]] and unveiled in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenpictures.dk/mermaid.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991128173940/http://copenhagenpictures.dk/mermaid.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 November 1999|title=The Little Mermaid|publisher=Copenhagen Pictures|accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not far from the Little Mermaid, the old [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Citadel]] (''Kastellet'') can be seen.

====Frederiksberg====
[[File:Frederiksberg Slot set fra plænen.jpg|thumb|[[Frederiksberg Palace]]]]
[[Frederiksberg]], a separate municipality within the [[urban area of Copenhagen]], lies to the west of Nørrebro and Indre By and north of Vesterbro. Its landmarks include [[Copenhagen Zoo]] founded in 1869 with over 250 species from all over the world and [[Frederiksberg Palace]] built as a summer residence by [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]] who was inspired by Italian architecture. Now a military academy, it overlooks the extensive landscaped [[Frederiksberg Gardens]] with its [[follies]], waterfalls, lakes and decorative buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danishnet.com/info.php/travel/frederiksberg-attractions-360.html|title=Frederiksberg Tourist Attractions|publisher=Danishnet.com|accessdate=1 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide tree-lined avenue of [[Frederiksberg Allé]] connecting [[Vesterbrogade]] with the Frederiksberg Gardens has long been associated with theatres and entertainment. While a number of the earlier theatres are now closed, the [[Betty Nansen Teatret|Betty Nansen Theatre]] and Aveny-T are still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oplev.frederiksberg.dk/turister-top/museer-og-teatre-paa-frederiksberg|title=Museer og teatre på Frederiksberg|publisher=Oplev Frederiksberg|accessdate=2 December 2013|language=Danish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020941/http://oplev.frederiksberg.dk/turister-top/museer-og-teatre-paa-frederiksberg|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amagerbro====
Amagerbro (also known as Sønderbro) is the district located immediately south-east of [[Christianshavn]] at northernmost [[Amager]]. The old city moats and their surrounding parks constitute a clear border between these districts. The main street is [[Amagerbrogade]] which after the harbour bridge [[Langebro]], is an extension of [[H. C. Andersens Boulevard]] and has a number of various stores and shops as well as restaurants and pubs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amagercentret.dk/butikker/&lt;/ref&gt; Amagerbro was built up during the two first decades of the twentieth century and is the city's northernmost block built area with typically 4-7 floors. Further south follows the Sundbyøster and Sundbyvester districts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hovedstadshistorie.dk/amagerbro/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hellerup====
[[File:Strandvejen ved Callisensvej.jpg|thumb|right|The street Strandvejen through the northern Copenhagen district Hellerup]]
[[Hellerup]] is the city's northernmost district with a central city feeling. It's located north of [[Østerbro]] and is known to be the perhaps most fashionable part of Copenhagen. Along [[Strandvejen]] (a street and further north a road leading to [[Elsinore]]) various shops, stores and restaurants are located. And by its crossing streets plenty of large villas are found. Hellerup is not a part of Copenhagen municipality, but constitutes the eastern parts of [[Gentofte]]. Hellerup is nevertheless a typical city environment without any notable bound towards the south.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visitcopenhagen.dk/da/kobenhavn/hellerup-og-omegn&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other districts====
Not far from [[Copenhagen Airport]] on the [[Kastrup]] coast, [[National Aquarium Denmark|The Blue Planet]] completed in March 2013 now houses the national aquarium. With its 53 aquariums, it is the largest facility of its kind in Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denblaaplanet.dk/en/about-the-blue-planet/|title=About The Blue Planet|publisher=Den Blå Planet|accessdate=7 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grundtvig's Church]], located in the northern suburb of [[Bispebjerg]], was designed by [[P.V. Jensen Klint]] and completed in 1940. A rare example of [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionist]] church architecture, its striking [[westwork|west façade]] is reminiscent of a church organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyznik.com/analysis/grundtvigs/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717125340/http://www.tyznik.com/analysis/grundtvigs/|archivedate=17 July 2011|first=Michael|last=Tyznik|title=Grundtvigs Kirke|publisher=Web Archive: Michael Tyznik design portfolio|accessdate=7 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{For|a broader look at this topic|Danish cuisine}}
[[File:Noma entrance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]] is an example of Copenhagen's renowned experimental restaurants, and has gained two [[Michelin stars]].]]

{{As of|2014}}, Copenhagen has 15 [[Michelin Guide|Michelin-starred]] restaurants, the most of any Scandinavian city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/gastronomy/michelin-starred-restaurants|title=Michelin-starred restaurants|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is increasingly recognized internationally as a gourmet destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/holiday_type/breaks/article5370597.ece|title= The Top 10 cities to visit in 2009|author=|date=|work=timesonline.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Den Røde Cottage, Formel B Restaurant, Grønbech &amp; Churchill, Søllerød Kro, Kadeau, Kiin Kiin (Denmark's first Michelin-starred Asian gourmet restaurant), the French restaurant Kong Hans Kælder, Relæ, Restaurant AOC, [[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]] (short for Danish: ''no''rdisk ''ma''d, English: Nordic food) with two Stars and [[Geranium (restaurant)|Geranium]] with three.

Apart from the selection of upmarket restaurants, Copenhagen offers a great variety of Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving [[open sandwich]]es, known as [[smørrebrød]] – a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/gastronomy/top-10-traditional-danish-lunch|title=Top 10 traditional Danish lunch|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=22 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danish pastry]] can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found in all parts of the city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, ''Conditori La Glace'', was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from [[Flensburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kbh-bagerlaug.dk/Om-lauget.aspx |title=Historien om Københavns bagerlaug |publisher=Kbh-bagerlaug.dk |language=Danish|accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen has long been associated with beer. [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises on the border between the [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] and [[Valby]] districts since 1847 and has long been almost synonymous with [[Beer in Denmark|Danish beer]] production. However, recent years have seen an explosive growth in the number of [[microbrewery|microbreweries]] so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like ''Nørrebro Bryghus'' also act as [[brewpubs]] where it is also possible to eat on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dev-bryggeriforeningen.dk/default.asp?pid=191&amp;show=12 |title=Nyeste artikler fra Bryggeriforeningen |publisher=Dev-bryggeriforeningen.dk|language=Danish |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/nightlife/top-10-beer|title=Top 10 beer|publisher=Visit Copenhagen|accessdate=22 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nightlife and festivals===
[[File:Copenhagen Pride 2008 i.JPG|thumb|right|Copenhagen [[Pride Parade]], 2008]]
Copenhagen has one of the highest number of restaurants and bars per capita in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scandinavia: Copenhagen, the alternative side|url=https://www.worldhotels.com/travel-stories/scandinavia-copenhagen-the-alternative-side|website=worldhotels.com|publisher=Worldhotels|accessdate=16 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504234056/https://www.worldhotels.com/travel-stories/scandinavia-copenhagen-the-alternative-side|archive-date=4 May 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nightclubs and bars stay open until 5 or 6 in the morning, some even longer. Denmark has a very liberal alcohol culture and a strong tradition for beer breweries, although binge drinking is frowned upon and the Danish Police take [[driving under the influence]] very seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=143400 |title=Færdselsloven – Bekendtgørelse af færdselsloven |publisher=retsinformation.dk |accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inner city areas such as [[Istedgade]] and [[Enghave Plads]] in Vesterbro, [[Sankt Hans Torv]] in Nørrebro and certain places in Frederiksberg are especially noted for their [[nightlife]].

Copenhagen has several recurring community festivals, mainly in the summer. [[Copenhagen Carnival]] has taken place every year since 1982 during the [[Whitsun]] Holiday in [[Fælledparken]] and around the city with the participation of 120 bands, 2,000 dancers and 100,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenet.dk/CPH-History.htm|title=History of Copenhagen-In Brief|publisher=Copenhagan Portal.dk|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2010, the old B&amp;W Shipyard at [[Refshaleøen]] in the harbour has been the location for [[Copenhell]], a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] rock music festival. [[Copenhagen Pride]] is a [[gay pride|gay pride festival]] taking place every year in August. The Pride has a series of different activities all over Copenhagen, but it is at the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] that most of the celebration takes place. During the Pride the square is renamed Pride Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copenhagen pride|url=http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/copenhagen-pride/|website=Denmark.dk|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Copenhagen Distortion]] has emerged to be one of the biggest street festivals in Europe with 100.000 people joining to parties in the beginning of June every year.

[[Dyrehavsbakken]], a fair-ground and pleasure-park established in 1583, is located in [[Klampenborg]] just north of Copenhagen in a forested area known as [[Jægersborg Dyrehave|Dyrehaven]]. Created as an amusement park complete with rides, games and restaurants by [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]], it is the oldest surviving amusement park in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;www3&quot;/&gt; [[Pierrot#Denmark|Pierrot]] ({{lang-da|links=no|Pjerrot}}), a nitwit dressed in white with a scarlet grin wearing a boat-like hat while entertaining children, remains one of the park's key attractions. In Danish, Dyrehavsbakken is often abbreviated as ''Bakken''. There is no entrance fee to pay and [[Klampenborg Station]] on the [[C (S-train)|C-line]], is situated nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakken.dk/english |title=The history of Dyrehavsbakken |publisher=Bakken |accessdate=22 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105211658/http://www.bakken.dk/english |archivedate=5 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tivoli Gardens]] is an amusement [[park]] and pleasure [[garden]] located in central Copenhagen between the [[The City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] and the [[Copenhagen Central Station|Central Station]]. It opened in 1843, making it the second oldest amusement park in the world.

It is connected to the city centre by metro and main line railway services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightstats.com/go/Airport/airportDetails.do?airportCode=CPH|title=CPH Copenhagen Airport|publisher=FlightStats.com|accessdate=25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; October 2013 was a record month with 2.2 million passengers, and November 2013 figures reveal that the number of passengers is increasing by some 3% annually, about 50% more than the European average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moodiereport.com/document.php?doc_id=37359|first=Dermot|last=Davitt|title=Copenhagen Airport posts solid increase in passenger traffic|publisher=The Moodie Report|accessdate=25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road, rail and ferry===
Copenhagen has an extensive road network including motorways connecting the city to other parts of Denmark and to Sweden over the [[Øresund Bridge]].&lt;ref name=nt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://subsite.kk.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/CityOfCopenhagen/SubsiteFrontpage/~/media/BF3A66B079AB4ACAA6CA167ECF151EB3.ashx|title=Traffic in Copenhagen 2009|first=Niels|last=Tørsløv|date=May 2010|publisher=Copenhagen Traffic Department|accessdate=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202221625/https://subsite.kk.dk/sitecore/content/Subsites/CityOfCopenhagen/SubsiteFrontpage/~/media/BF3A66B079AB4ACAA6CA167ECF151EB3.ashx|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car is still the most popular form of transport within the city itself, representing two-thirds of all distances travelled. This can however lead to serious congestion in rush hour traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/local/committee-presents-ideas-reducing-copenhagens-congestion|first=Peter|last=Stanners|title=Committee presents ideas for reducing Copenhagen's congestion|newspaper=The Copenhagen Post|accessdate=25 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527195658/http://cphpost.dk/news/local/committee-presents-ideas-reducing-copenhagens-congestion|archive-date=27 May 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Øresund train links Copenhagen with Malmö  24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
Copenhagen is also served by a daily ferry connection to [[Oslo]] in Norway.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/dfds-seaways|title=DFDS Seaways|publisher=AOK|accessdate=25 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Copenhagen Harbour handled 372 cruise ships and 840,000 passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferry&quot; /&gt;

The [[S-train (Copenhagen)|Copenhagen S-Train]], [[Copenhagen Metro]] and the regional train networks are used by about half of the city's passengers, the remainder using bus services. [[Nørreport Station]] near the city centre serves passengers travelling by main-line rail, [[S-train]], regional train, metro and bus. Some 750,000 passengers make use of public transport facilities every day.&lt;ref name=nt/&gt; [[Copenhagen Central Station]] is the hub of the [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]] railway network serving Denmark and international destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsb.dk/om-dsb/in-english/|title=Travelling in Denmark|publisher=DSB|accessdate=25 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copenhagen Metro is scheduled to expand radically with the opening of the City-ring line during fall 2019, the new line will connect all inner boroughs of the city by metro, including The Central Station, and will open up 17 new stations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.dk/rejser/m3-cityringen/#!/kundeservice|title=M3 Cityringen - Metroen|website=m.dk|language=en|access-date=2019-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Copenhageners. The new metro line is a part of the city's strategy to transform mobility towards sustainable modes of transport such as [[public transport]] and [[cycling]] as opposed to automobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://byudvikling.kk.dk/artikel/mobilitet-i-koebenhavn-0|title=Mobilitet i København|website=byudvikling.kk.dk|language=da|access-date=2019-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen is cited by urban planners for its exemplary integration of [[public transport]] and urban development.  In implementing its [[Finger Plan]], Copenhagen is considered the world's first example of a [[transit metropolis]]{{sfn|Cervero|1998|p=132}} and areas around S-Train stations like [[Ballerup]] and [[Brøndby Strand]] are among the earliest examples of [[transit-oriented development]].

[[File:Rigshospitalet Copenhagen 2005-11.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rigshospitalet]] is one of the largest hospitals in Denmark.]]

Promoting health is an extremely important issue for Copenhagen's municipal authorities. Central to its sustainability mission is its &quot;Long Live Copenhagen&quot; (''Længe Leve København'') scheme in which it has the goal of increasing the life expectancy of citizens, improving quality of life through better standards of health, and encouraging more productive lives and equal opportunities.&lt;ref name=kkhealth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laengelevekbh.kk.dk/|title=Vi vil forbedre københavnernes sundhed|publisher=Københavns Kommune|language=Danish|accessdate=17 January 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121022936/http://www.laengelevekbh.kk.dk/|archivedate=21 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has targets to encourage people to exercise regularly and to reduce the number who smoke and consume alcohol.&lt;ref name=kkhealth/&gt;

[[Copenhagen University Hospital]] forms a conglomerate of several hospitals in [[Region Hovedstaden]] and [[Region Sjælland]], together with the faculty of [[health sciences]] at the University of Copenhagen; [[Rigshospitalet]] and [[Bispebjerg Hospital]] in Copenhagen belong to this group of university hospitals.{{sfn|Kjaer|Krogsgaard|Magnusson|2008|p=11}} Rigshospitalet began operating in March 1757 as Frederiks Hospital,{{sfn|Schaldemose|2005|p=107}} and became state-owned in 1903. With 1,120 beds, Rigshospitalet has responsibility for 65,000 inpatients and approximately 420,000 outpatients annually. It seeks to be the number one specialist hospital in the country, with an extensive team of researchers into cancer treatment, surgery and radiotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigshospitalet.dk/RHenglish/Menu/Research/ |title=Research |publisher=Rigshospitalet |accessdate=24 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203024058/http://www.rigshospitalet.dk/RHenglish/Menu/Research/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to its 8,000 personnel, the hospital has training and hosting functions.
