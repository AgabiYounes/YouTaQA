A '''chordate''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔːr|d|eɪ|t}}) is an [[animal]] of the [[phylum]] '''Chordata'''. During some period of their life cycle, chordates possess a [[notochord]], a [[dorsal nerve cord]], [[pharyngeal slit]]s, an [[endostyle]], and a post-anal [[tail]]: these five anatomical features define this phylum.  Chordates are also [[bilateral symmetry|bilaterally symmetric]], and have a [[coelom]], [[Metameric|metameric segmentation]], and [[circulatory system]].  

The Chordata and [[Ambulacraria]] together form the [[superphylum]] [[Deuterostomia]]. Chordates are divided into three [[subphyla]]: [[vertebrate|Vertebrata]] ([[fish]], [[amphibian]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s); [[Tunicate|Tunicata]] or [[Urochordate|Urochordata]] ([[sea squirt]]s, [[salps]]); and [[Cephalochordate|Cephalochordata]] (which includes [[lancelet]]s). There are also extinct taxa such as the [[Vetulicolia]]. [[Hemichordate|Hemichordata]] (which includes the [[acorn worm]]s) has been presented as a fourth chordate subphylum, but now is treated as a separate phylum: hemichordates and [[Echinoderm]]ata form the [[Ambulacraria]], the sister phylum of the Chordates. Of the more than 65,000 living species of chordates, about half are bony fish that are members of the [[Superclass (biology)|superclass]] [[Fish#Taxonomy|Pisces]], class [[Osteichthyes]].

Chordate [[fossil]]s have been found from as early as the [[Cambrian explosion]], 541 million years ago. [[Cladistically]]  ([[phylogenetically]]), [[vertebrate]]s – chordates with the notochord replaced by a [[vertebral column]] during development – are considered to be a subgroup of the [[clade]] [[Craniate|Craniata]], which consists of chordates with a [[skull]]. The Craniata and Tunicata compose the clade [[Olfactores]]. (See diagram under Phylogeny.)

==Anatomy==
[[File:Kryptopterus 2.jpg|thumb|right|The glass catfish (''[[Kryptopterus vitreolus]]'') is one of the few chordates with a visible [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. The [[spinal cord]] is housed within its backbone.]]
Chordates form a [[phylum]] of animals that are defined by having at some stage in their lives all of the following anatomical features:&lt;ref name=&quot;RychelSmithShimamotoSwalla2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

*A notochord, a fairly stiff rod of [[cartilage]] that extends along the inside of the body. Among the vertebrate sub-group of chordates the notochord develops into the [[Vertebral column|spine]], and in wholly aquatic species this helps the animal to swim by flexing its tail.
*A [[dorsa]]l [[neural tube]]. In fish and other [[vertebrate]]s, this develops into the [[spinal cord]], the main communications trunk of the [[nervous system]].
*[[Pharyngeal slit]]s. The [[pharynx]] is the part of the [[throat]] immediately behind the mouth. In [[fish]], the slits are modified to form [[gill]]s, but in some other chordates they are part of a [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] system that extracts particles of food from the water in which the animals live.
*Post-anal tail. A muscular tail that extends backwards behind the [[anus]].
*An [[endostyle]]. This is a groove in the [[ventral]] wall of the pharynx. In [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] species it produces [[mucus]] to gather food particles, which helps in transporting food to the [[esophagus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruppert2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ruppert, E. | journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology | volume=83 | pages=8–23 | date=January 2005 | doi=10.1139/Z04-158 | title=Key characters uniting hemichordates and chordates: homologies or homoplasies? | url=http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/RPAS/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet&amp;articleFile=z04-158.pdf&amp;journal=cjz&amp;volume=83 | accessdate=2008-09-22 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209232008/http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/RPAS/RPViewDoc?_handler_=HandleInitialGet&amp;articleFile=z04-158.pdf&amp;journal=cjz&amp;volume=83 | archive-date=9 December 2012 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also stores [[iodine]], and may be a precursor of the vertebrate [[thyroid]] gland.&lt;ref name=&quot;RychelSmithShimamotoSwalla2006&quot; /&gt;

There are soft constraints that separate chordates from certain other biological lineages, but are not part of the formal definition:
* All chordates are [[deuterostomes]]. This means that, during the embryo development stage, the anus forms before the mouth.
* All chordates are based on a [[bilateral symmetry|bilateral]] [[body plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

There is still much ongoing differential (DNA sequence based) comparison research that is trying to separate out the simplest forms of chordates. As some lineages of the 90% of species that lack a backbone or notochord might have lost these structures over time, this complicates the classification of chordates. Some chordate lineages may only be found by DNA analysis, when there is no physical trace of any chordate-like structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Why we have a spine when over 90% of animals don't|publisher=BBC|author=Josh Gabbatiss|date=15 August 2016|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160812-why-we-have-a-spine-when-over-90-of-animals-dont}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to work out the evolutionary relationships of the chordates have produced several hypotheses. The current consensus is that chordates are [[monophyletic]], meaning that the Chordata include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, which is itself a chordate, and that [[craniate]]s' nearest relatives are tunicates.

All of the earliest chordate [[fossil]]s have been found in the Early [[Cambrian]] [[Chengjiang fauna]], and include two species that are regarded as [[fish]], which implies that they are vertebrates. Because the fossil record of early chordates is poor, only [[molecular phylogenetics]] offers a reasonable prospect of dating their emergence. However, the use of molecular phylogenetics for dating evolutionary transitions is controversial.

It has also proved difficult to produce a detailed classification within the living chordates. Attempts to produce evolutionary &quot;[[phylogenetic tree|family trees]]&quot; shows that many of the traditional [[class (biology)|classes]] are [[paraphyletic]].

The evolutionary relationships between the chordate groups and between chordates as a whole and their closest deuterostome relatives have been debated since 1890.

Since early chordates have left a poor fossil record, attempts have been made to calculate the key dates in their evolution by [[molecular phylogenetics]] techniques—by analyzing biochemical differences, mainly in RNA. One such study suggested that deuterostomes arose before {{ma|900}} and the earliest chordates around {{ma|896}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlairHedges2005&quot;/&gt; However, molecular estimates of dates often disagree with each other and with the fossil record,&lt;ref name=&quot;BlairHedges2005&quot; /&gt; and their assumption that the [[molecular clock]] runs at a known constant rate has been challenged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ayala1999MolClockMirages&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Ayala, F.

Traditionally, Cephalochordata and Craniata were grouped into the proposed clade &quot;Euchordata&quot;, which would have been the sister group to Tunicata/Urochordata. More recently, Cephalochordata has been thought of as a sister group to the &quot;Olfactores&quot;, which includes the craniates and tunicates. The matter is not yet settled.

===Hemichordates===
{{main|Hemichordate}}

[[Hemichordate]]s (&quot;half chordates&quot;) have some features similar to those of chordates: branchial openings that open into the [[pharynx]] and look rather like gill slits; stomochords, similar in composition to [[notochord]]s, but running in a circle round the &quot;collar&quot;, which is ahead of the mouth; and a [[dorsa]]l nerve cord—but also a smaller [[ventral]] nerve cord.

There are two living groups of hemichordates. The solitary [[enteropneust]]s, commonly known as &quot;acorn worms&quot;, have long [[proboscis]]es and worm-like bodies with up to 200 branchial slits, are up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} long, and burrow though seafloor [[sediment]]s. [[Pterobranch]]s are [[colony (biology)|colonial]] animals, often less than {{convert|1|mm|in}} long individually, whose dwellings are interconnected. Each [[filter feeding|filter feeds]] by means of a pair of branched tentacles, and has a short, shield-shaped proboscis. The extinct [[graptolite]]s, colonial animals whose fossils look like tiny [[hacksaw]] blades, lived in tubes similar to those of pterobranchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chordata/hemichordata.html|accessdate=2008-09-22|title=Introduction to the Hemichordata|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Echinoderms===

{{main|Echinoderm}}
[[Echinoderm]]s differ from chordates and their other relatives in three conspicuous ways: they possess [[bilateral symmetry]] only as larvae - in adulthood they have [[radial symmetry]], meaning that their body pattern is shaped like a wheel; they have [[tube feet]]; and their bodies are supported by [[skeleton]]s made of [[calcite]], a material not used by chordates. Their hard, calcified shells keep their bodies well protected from the environment, and these skeletons enclose their bodies, but are also covered by thin skins. The feet are powered by another unique feature of echinoderms, a [[water vascular system]] of canals that also functions as a &quot;lung&quot; and surrounded by muscles that act as pumps. [[Crinoid]]s look rather like flowers, and use their feather-like arms to filter food particles out of the water; most live anchored to rocks, but a few can move very slowly. Other echinoderms are mobile and take a variety of body shapes, for example [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumbers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CowenHistLifeEd3P412&quot;&gt;{{cite book

==History of name==
Although the name Chordata is attributed to [[William Bateson]] (1885), it was already in prevalent use by 1880. [[Ernst Haeckel]] described a taxon comprising tunicates, cephalochordates, and vertebrates in 1866. Though he used the German vernacular form, it is allowed under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN code]] because of its subsequent latinization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
