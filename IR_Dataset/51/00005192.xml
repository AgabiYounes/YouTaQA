[[Taiga|Boreal forests]] prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in [[Northern Canada|northerly Arctic regions]] and through the [[Rocky Mountains]], and the relatively flat [[Canadian Prairies]] in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;McColl2005&quot;/&gt; The [[Great Lakes]] feed the [[St. Lawrence River]] (in the southeast) where lowlands host much of Canada's population.

===Appalachian Mountains===

The [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountain range]] extends from [[Alabama]] through the [[Gaspé Peninsula]] and the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic Provinces]], creating rolling hills indented by river valleys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haggett2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Haggett|title=Encyclopedia of World Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbBzHuDQssMC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=22 November 2011|date=July 2001|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7289-6|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also runs through parts of southern [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Haggett2001&quot;/&gt;

The Appalachian mountains (more specifically the [[Chic-Choc Mountains]], [[Notre Dame Mountains|Notre Dame]], and [[Long Range Mountains]]) are an old and eroded range of mountains, approximately 380 million years in age. Notable mountains in the Appalachians include [[Mount Jacques-Cartier]] (Quebec, {{convert|1268|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Mount Carleton]] (New Brunswick, {{convert|817|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[The Cabox]] (Newfoundland, {{convert|814|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;DiPietro2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph A.

===Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Lowlands===

[[File:Sub-basins Great Lakes Basin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A map of the Great Lakes Basin showing the five sub-basins within. Left to right they are: [[Lake Superior|Superior]], including [[Lake Nipigon|Nipigon]]'s basin, (magenta); [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]] (cyan); [[Lake Huron|Huron]] (pale green); [[Lake Erie|Erie]] (yellow); [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]] (light coral).]]
The southern parts of Quebec and Ontario, in the section of the [[Great Lakes]] (bordered entirely by [[Ontario]] on the Canadian side) and St. Lawrence basin (often called [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]]), is another particularly rich sedimentary plain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pezzi2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hIcwB82K8UC&amp;pg=PA32|title=The St. Lawrence Lowlands|author=Bryan Pezzi|first=|publisher=[[Weigl Educational Publishers Limited]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-55388-152-0|location=|page=32|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its [[colonization]] and heavy [[urban sprawl]] of the 20th century, this [[Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests]] area was home to large [[mixed forest]]s covering a mostly flat area of land between the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Canadian Shield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GradyFoundation2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wayne Grady|author2=David Suzuki Foundation|title=The Great Lakes: the natural history of a changing region|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnvZ1XrRTGIC&amp;pg=PA17|date=26 September 2007|publisher=Greystone/David Suzuki Fdtn|isbn=978-1-55365-197-0|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this forest has been cut down through agriculture and logging operations, but the remaining forests are for the most part heavily protected. In this part of Canada the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] is one of the world's largest [[estuary]] (see [[Gulf of St. Lawrence lowland forests]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Wangersky2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J.

While the relief of these lowlands is particularly flat and regular, a group of [[batholite]]s known as the [[Monteregian Hills]] are spread along a mostly regular line across the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;MandarinoAnderson1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joseph Anthony Mandarino |authorlink= Joseph A.

These hills are known for a great richness in precious [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MandarinoAnderson1989&quot;/&gt;

===Canadian Shield===
[[File:Canada geological map.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Canadian Shield]] is a broad region of Precambrian rock (pictured in shades of red)]]
The northeastern part of Alberta, northern parts of [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], Ontario, and Quebec, as well as most of [[Labrador]] (the mainland portions of the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]), are located on a vast rock base known as the [[Canadian Shield]]. The Shield mostly consists of eroded hilly terrain and contains many lakes and important rivers used for [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] production, particularly in northern Quebec and Ontario. The shield also encloses an area of [[wetlands]], the [[Hudson Bay]] lowlands. Some particular regions of the Shield are referred to as [[mountain range]]s, including the [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat]] and [[Laurentian Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SonPress2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Philip and Son|author2=Oxford University Press|title=Encyclopedic World Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UD0kOEb1XIC&amp;pg=PA68|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-521920-3|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shield cannot support intensive [[agriculture]], although there is subsistence agriculture and small dairy farms in many of the river valleys and around the abundant lakes, particularly in the southern regions. [[Boreal forest]] covers much of the shield, with a mix of [[conifers]] that provide valuable timber resources in areas such as the [[Central Canadian Shield forests]] [[ecoregion]] that covers much of [[Northern Ontario]]. The region is known for its extensive mineral reserves.&lt;ref name=&quot;SonPress2002&quot;/&gt;

The Canadian Shield is known for its vast minerals, such as emeralds, diamonds and copper. The Canadian shield is also called the mineral house.

===Canadian Interior Plains===

[[File:Palliser's Triangle map.png|thumb|upright =1.4|[[Palliser's Triangle]], delineating prairie soil types in the Prairie provinces]]

The [[Canadian Prairies]] are part of a vast [[sedimentary]] [[Great Plains|plain]] covering much of [[Alberta]], southern Saskatchewan, and southwestern Manitoba, as well as much of the region between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Great Slave Lake|Great Slave]] and [[Great Bear Lake|Great Bear]] lakes in [[Northwest Territories]]. The plains generally describes the expanses of (largely flat) arable agricultural land which sustain extensive grain farming operations in the southern part of the provinces. Despite this, some areas such as the [[Cypress Hills (Canada)|Cypress Hills]] and the Alberta Badlands are quite hilly and the prairie provinces contain large areas of forest such as the [[Mid-Continental Canadian forests]]. The size is roughly ~{{convert|1900000|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}.

===Western Cordillera===

The [[Canadian Cordillera]], contiguous with the [[American cordillera]], is bounded by the Rocky Mountains to the east and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west.

The [[Canadian Rockies]] are part of a major [[continental divide]] that extends north and south through western North America and western [[South America]]. The [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and the [[Fraser River]]s have their headwaters in the Canadian Rockies and are the second and third largest rivers respectively to drain to the west coast of North America.  To the west of their headwaters, across the [[Rocky Mountain Trench]], is a second belt of mountains, the [[Columbia Mountains]], comprising the [[Selkirk Mountains|Selkirk]], [[Purcell Mountains|Purcell]], [[Monashee Mountains|Monashee]] and [[Cariboo Mountains]] sub-ranges.
[[File:Canadian Rockies HartRanges.png|thumb|upright =1.4|Map of the [[Hart Ranges]] in British Columbia]]
Immediately west of the Columbia Mountains is a large and rugged [[Interior Plateau]], encompassing the [[Chilcotin District|Chilcotin]] and [[Cariboo]] regions in central [[British Columbia]] (the [[Fraser Plateau]]), the [[Nechako Plateau]] further north, and also the [[Thompson Plateau]] in the south. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] Valley in northeastern British Columbia is Canada's most northerly agricultural region, although it is part of the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]]. The dry, temperate climate of the [[Okanagan]] Valley in south central British Columbia provides ideal conditions for fruit growing and a flourishing wine industry; the semi-arid belt of the Southern Interior also includes the [[Fraser Canyon]], and [[Thompson Country|Thompson]], [[Nicola Country|Nicola]], [[Similkameen Country|Similkameen]], [[Shuswap Country|Shuswap]] and [[Boundary Country|Boundary regions]] and fruit-growing is common in these areas also, and also in the [[Kootenays|West Kootenay]]. Between the plateau and the coast is the province's largest mountain range, the [[Coast Mountains]]. The Coast Mountains contain some of the largest temperate-latitude [[icefield]]s in the world.

On the south coast of British Columbia, [[Vancouver Island]] is separated from the mainland by the continuous [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|Juan de Fuca]], [[Strait of Georgia|Georgia]], and [[Johnstone Strait]]s. Those straits include a large number of islands, notably the [[Gulf Islands]] and [[Discovery Islands]]. North, near the [[Alaska]]n border, [[Haida Gwaii]] lies across [[Hecate Strait]] from the [[Coast of British Columbia|North Coast region]] and to its north, across [[Dixon Entrance]] from [[Southeast Alaska]]. Other than in the plateau regions of the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior]] and its many river valleys, most of British Columbia is coniferous forest. The only [[temperate rain forests]] in Canada are found along the Pacific Coast in the Coast Mountains, on Vancouver Island, and on Haida Gwaii, and in the [[Cariboo Mountains]] on the eastern flank of the Plateau.

The Western Cordillera continues northwards past the [[Liard River]] in northernmost British Columbia to include the [[Mackenzie Mountains|Mackenzie]] and [[Selwyn Range (Canada)|Selwyn Range]]s which lie in the far western [[Northwest Territories]] and the eastern [[Yukon Territory]].  West of them is the large [[Yukon Plateau]] and, west of that, the [[Yukon Ranges]] and [[Saint Elias Mountains]], which include Canada's and British Columbia's highest summits, [[Mount Saint Elias]] in the [[Kluane]] region and [[Mount Fairweather]] in the [[Tatshenshini-Alsek]] region.  The headwaters of the [[Yukon River]], the largest and longest of the rivers on the [[Pacific Slope]], lie in northern British Columbia at [[Atlin Lake|Atlin]] and [[Teslin Lake]]s.

===Volcanoes===
{{Main|Volcanology of Canada}}
[[File:Young volcanoes of western Canada.png|thumb|right|Map of young  [[Volcanology of Canada#Western Canada|volcanoes in Western Canada]]]]
[[Western Canada]] has many volcanoes and is part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], a system of volcanoes found around the margins of the Pacific Ocean. There are over 200 young volcanic centres that stretch northward from the [[Cascade Range]] to [[Yukon]]. They are grouped into five [[volcanic belt]]s with different volcano types and [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] settings. The [[Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province]] was formed by [[Fault (geology)|faulting]], cracking, [[rift]]ing, and the interaction between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]]. The [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]] was formed by [[subduction]] of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] beneath the North American Plate. The [[Anahim Volcanic Belt]] was formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding westward over the [[Anahim hotspot]]. The [[Chilcotin Group]] is believed to have formed as a result of [[back-arc basin|back-arc extension]] behind the [[Cascadia subduction zone]]. The [[Wrangell Volcanic Field]] formed as a result of subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate at the easternmost end of the [[Aleutian Trench]]. The volcanic eruption of the [[Tseax Cone]] in 1775 was among Canada's worst natural disasters, killing an estimated 2,000 [[Nisga'a people]] and destroying their village in the [[Nass River]] valley of northern British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/canadas-worst-natural-disasters-all-time |title=Canada's Worst Natural Disasters of All Time |first=Adam |last=Shoalts |publisher=Canadian Geographic |year=2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923150031/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/article/canadas-worst-natural-disasters-all-time |archivedate=September 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eruption produced a {{convert|22.5|km|adj=on}} [[lava]] flow, and, according to Nisga'a legend, blocked the flow of the Nass River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jessop |first=A |title=Geological Survey of Canada, Open File 5906 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7IL9hO-_6cC&amp;pg=PA18 |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |pages=18– |id=GGKEY:6DLTQFWQ9HG |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412182124/https://books.google.com/books?id=z7IL9hO-_6cC&amp;pg=PA18 |archivedate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcanism has also occurred in the [[Canadian Shield]]. It contains over 150 volcanic belts (now deformed and eroded down to nearly flat [[plain]]s) that range from 600 million to 2.8 billion years old. Many of Canada's major [[ore]] deposits are associated with [[Precambrian]] volcanoes. There are [[pillow lava]]s in the [[Northwest Territories]] that are about 2.6 billion years old and are preserved in the [[Cameron River Volcanic Belt]]. The pillow lavas in rocks over 2 billion years old in the Canadian Shield signify that great oceanic volcanoes existed during the early stages of the formation of the Earth's crust. Ancient volcanoes play an important role in estimating Canada's mineral potential. Many of the volcanic belts bear ore deposits that are related to the volcanism.

===Canadian Arctic===
{{Main|Northern Canada}}
[[File:Major habitat type CAN.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Barren Grounds]] and [[tundra]] are shown in light blue, and the [[boreal forest of Canada|taiga and boreal forest]] in dark blue.]]
While the largest part of the Canadian Arctic is composed of seemingly endless permafrost and [[tundra]] north of the [[tree line]], it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the [[Arctic Cordillera]] (with the [[British Empire Range]] and the [[United States Range]] on [[Ellesmere Island]]) contains the northernmost mountain system in the world. The [[Arctic Lowlands]] and Hudson Bay lowlands comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often designated as the Canadian Shield (in contrast to the sole geologic area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of [[permafrost]], making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.

The Arctic, when defined as everything north of the tree line, covers most of [[Nunavut]] and the northernmost parts of Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Labrador.

==Hydrography==

Canada holds vast reserves of water: its rivers discharge nearly 9% of the world's renewable water supply,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/freshwater/distribution/1 | author= Atlas of Canada | title= Distribution of Freshwater |date=February 2004 | accessdate=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; it contains a quarter of the world's wetlands, and it has the third largest amount of [[glacier]]s (after [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]]). Because of extensive [[glaciation]], Canada hosts more than two million lakes: of those that are entirely within Canada, more than 31,000 are between {{convert|3|and|100|km2|sqmi|1}} in area, while 563 are larger than {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/lakes.html |author=Atlas of Canada |title=Facts about Canada – Lakes |date=April 2004 |accessdate=2007-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410230512/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/learningresources/facts/lakes.html |archivedate=April 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivers===
{{See also|List of rivers of Canada}}
[[Image:Longest_Rivers_of_Canada.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Rivers  of Canada]]
Canada's two longest rivers are the Mackenzie, which empties into the Arctic Ocean and drains a large part of northwestern Canada, and the St. Lawrence, which drains the Great Lakes and empties into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Mackenzie is over {{convert|4200|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length while the St. Lawrence is over {{convert|3000|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. Rounding out the ten longest rivers within Canada are the [[Nelson River|Nelson]], [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill]], Peace, Fraser, [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]], [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]], [[Athabasca River|Athabasca]] and Yukon rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/eau-water/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=45BBB7B8-1#canada | title=Rivers: Longest rivers in Canada | publisher=[[Environment Canada]] | date=July 22, 2013 | accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drainage basins===

The Atlantic watershed drains the entirety of the [[Atlantic provinces]] (parts of the Quebec-Labrador border are fixed at the Atlantic Ocean-Arctic Ocean [[Laurentian Divide|continental divide]]), most of inhabited Quebec and large parts of southern Ontario. It is mostly drained by the economically important St. Lawrence River and its tributaries, notably the [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]], [[Manicouagan River|Manicouagan]] and Ottawa rivers. The Great Lakes and [[Lake Nipigon]] are also drained by the St. Lawrence. The [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] and [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] are other important elements of the Atlantic watershed in Canada.&lt;ref name=canadian&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Canada-Drainage.png|right|upright=1.4|Drainage basins of Canada|thumb]]
The Hudson Bay watershed drains over a third of Canada. It covers Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, southwestern Nunavut and the southern half of [[Baffin Island]]. This basin is most important in fighting [[drought]] in the [[Canadian Prairies|prairies]] and producing hydroelectricity, especially in Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec. Major elements of this watershed include [[Lake Winnipeg]], Nelson River, the North Saskatchewan and [[South Saskatchewan River]]s, [[Assiniboine River]], and [[Nettilling Lake]] on Baffin Island. [[Wollaston Lake]] lies on the boundary between the Hudson Bay and Arctic Ocean watersheds and drains into both. It is the largest lake in the world that naturally drains in two directions.&lt;ref name=canadian/&gt;

The [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]] in the Rockies separates the Pacific watershed in British Columbia and Yukon from the Arctic and Hudson Bay watersheds. This watershed irrigates the agriculturally important areas of inner British Columbia (such as the [[Okanagan River|Okanagan]] and [[Kootenay River|Kootenay]] valleys), and is used to produce hydroelectricity. Major elements are the Yukon, [[Columbia River|Columbia]] and Fraser rivers.&lt;ref name=canadian/&gt;

The northern parts of Alberta, Manitoba and British Columbia, most of Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and parts of Yukon are drained by the Arctic watershed. This watershed has been little used for hydroelectricity, with the exception of the [[Mackenzie River]], the longest river in Canada. The [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], Athabasca and [[Liard River]]s, as well as Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake (respectively the largest and second largest lakes wholly enclosed by Canada) are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie, thereby draining the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.&lt;ref name=canadian/&gt;

The southernmost part of Alberta drains into the Gulf of Mexico through the [[Milk River (Montana-Alberta)|Milk River]] and its tributaries. The Milk River originates in the Rocky Mountains of [[Montana]], then flows into Alberta, then returns into the United States, where it is drained by the [[Missouri River]]. A small area of southwestern Saskatchewan is drained by [[Battle Creek (Milk River)|Battle Creek]], which empties into the Milk River.&lt;ref name=canadian/&gt;

[[File:Canada by percent of Forest Cover.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Forest cover percentage of Canadian provinces and territories.]]
Canada has produced a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] in response to the 1992 international accord; the plan addresses conservation of [[endangered species]] and certain habitats. The main [[biome]]s of Canada are:

* [[Tundra]]
* [[Boreal forest]]
* [[Mixed forest]]
* [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|Broadleaf forest]]
* [[Prairie]]s
* [[Rocky Mountains]], vegetation includes various types of tundra and forests.
* [[Temperate coniferous forests]], of which the [[Temperate rain forest]]s of coastal British Columbia is an example.

[[File:Political map of Canada.png|upright=1.8|thumb|right|alt=Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories|A political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories|link=Provinces and territories of Canada]]

Canada is divided into [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]]. According to [[Statistics Canada]], 72.0 percent of the population is concentrated within {{convert|150|km|mi}} of the nation's southern border with the United States, 70.0% live south of the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], and over 60 percent of the population lives along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River between [[Windsor, Ontario]] and [[Quebec City]]. This leaves the vast majority of Canada's territory as sparsely populated wilderness; Canada's population density is 3.5 people/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (9.1/mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), among the lowest in the world. Despite this, 79.7 percent of Canada's population resides in [[Urban area|urban]] areas, where population densities are increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo62a-eng.htm|title=Population, urban and rural, by province and territory (Canada)|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada shares with the U.S. the world's [[Canada–United States border|longest undefended border]] at {{convert|8893|km|mi}}; {{convert|2477|km|mi}} are with [[Alaska]]. The [[Denmark|Danish]] island dependency of [[Greenland]] lies to Canada's northeast, separated from the [[Canadian Arctic islands]] by [[Baffin Bay]] and [[Davis Strait]]. The [[France|French]] islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] lie off the southern coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and have a maritime territorial enclave within Canada's [[exclusive economic zone]]. Canada also shares a land border with Denmark, as maps released in December 2006 show that the agreed upon boundaries run through the middle of [[Hans Island]].&lt;ref name=Hans&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[The Canadian Press]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/07/26/hans-technology.html |title=Satellite imagery moves Hans Island boundary: report |work=[[CBC News]] |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's geographic proximity to the United States has historically bound the two countries together in the political world as well. Canada's position between the [[Soviet Union]] (now [[Russia]]) and the U.S. was strategically important during the [[Cold War]] since the route over the North Pole and Canada was the fastest route by air between the two countries and the most direct route for [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s.  Since the end of the Cold War, there has been growing speculation that [[Canadian Arctic|Canada's Arctic]] maritime claims may become increasingly important if [[global warming]] melts the ice enough to open the [[Northwest Passage]].

Similarly, the disputed—and tiny—[[Hans Island]] (with Denmark), in the [[Nares Strait]] between [[Ellesmere Island]] and northern Greenland, may be a flashpoint for challenges to overall claims of Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic.&lt;ref name=Hans/&gt;

==Natural resources==
{{see also|History of the petroleum industry in Canada}}
[[File:Canada Exports Treemap 2017.svg|upright=1.4|thumb|alt=Chart of exports of Canada by value with percentages|Tree-map of Canada's goods exports in 2017]]

Canada's abundance of [[natural resource]]s is reflected in their continued importance in the [[economy of Canada]]. Major resource-based industries are [[Fishery|fisheries]], [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[petroleum product]]s and [[mining]].

The fisheries industry has historically been one of Canada's strongest. Unmatched [[cod]] stocks on the [[Grand Banks]] of Newfoundland launched this industry in the 16th century. Today these stocks are nearly depleted, and their conservation has become a preoccupation of the [[Atlantic Provinces]]. On the West Coast, [[tuna]] stocks are now restricted. The less depleted (but still greatly diminished) [[salmon]] population continues to drive a strong fisheries industry. Canada claims {{convert|12|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of territorial sea, a contiguous zone of {{convert|24|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|5,599,077|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} with {{convert|200|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} and a continental shelf of {{convert|200|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} or to the edge of the continental margin.

Forestry has long been a major industry in Canada. Forest products contribute to one fifth of the nation's exports. The provinces with the largest forestry industries are British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Fifty-four percent of Canada's land area is covered in forest. The boreal forests account for four-fifths of Canada's forestland.

[[Image:Grain Elevator 047.jpg|thumb|right|Albertan [[grain elevator]]s]]
Five per cent of Canada's land area is arable, none of which is for permanent crops. Three per cent of Canada's land area is covered by permanent pastures. Canada has 7,200 square kilometres (2,800&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of irrigated land (1993 estimate). Agricultural regions in Canada include the Canadian Prairies, the [[Lower Mainland]] and various regions within the [[British Columbia Interior|Interior of British Columbia]], the [[St. Lawrence Basin]] and the Canadian [[Maritimes]]. Main crops in Canada include [[flax]], [[oat]]s, [[wheat]], [[maize]], [[barley]], [[sugar beet]]s and [[rye]] in the prairies; flax and maize in [[Western Ontario]]; Oats and [[potato]]es in the Maritimes. [[Fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s are grown primarily in the [[Annapolis Valley]] of Nova Scotia, [[Southwestern Ontario]], the [[Golden Horseshoe]] region of Ontario, along the south coast of [[Georgian Bay]] and in the [[Okanagan]] Valley of British Columbia. [[Cattle]] and [[domestic sheep|sheep]] are raised in the valleys and plateaus of British Columbia. Cattle, sheep and [[Hog (swine)|hog]]s are raised on the prairies, cattle and hogs in Western Ontario, sheep and hogs in Quebec, and sheep in the Maritimes. There are significant [[dairy]] regions in central Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick, the St. Lawrence Valley, [[northeastern Ontario]], southwestern Ontario, the [[Red River of the North|Red River]] valley of Manitoba and the valleys in the [[British Columbia Interior]], on [[Vancouver Island]] and in the [[Lower Mainland]].
[[Image:Canada geological map-WCSB.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|The bulk of oil and gas production occurs in the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]] (mostly light green), which stretches from southwestern [[Manitoba]] to northeastern [[British Columbia]]. ]]
Fossil fuels are a more recently developed resource in Canada, with [[petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] being extracted from deposits in the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin]] since the mid 1900s. While Canada's [[crude oil]] deposits are fewer, technological developments in recent decades have opened up oil production in Alberta's [[Oil Sands]] to the point where Canada now has some of the largest reserves of oil in the world. In other forms, Canadian industry has a long history of extracting large [[coal]] and natural gas reserves.

Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[lead]], [[molybdenum]], and [[uranium]] reserves. Large [[diamond]] concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. The nearby, but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]] has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.&lt;ref name=&quot;GH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |website=Geological Survey of Canada |url=http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |title=3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly |publisher=Natural Resources Canada |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711184237/http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |archive-date=2009-07-11 |access-date=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important [[logging]] industry.

Canada's many rivers have afforded extensive development of hydroelectric power. Extensively developed in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador, the many dams have long provided a clean, dependable source of energy.

==Natural hazards==
{{See also|Drought in Canada|Drought Research Initiative}}
Continuous [[permafrost]] in the north is a serious obstacle to development. Cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east of the mountains.
