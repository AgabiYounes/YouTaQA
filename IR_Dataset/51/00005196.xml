[[File:All Red Line.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[All Red Line]] cable for the [[British Empire]]. Canada as an interconnection-point. c.a. 1903]]
The history of [[telegraphy]] in Canada dates back to the [[Province of Canada]].  While the first telegraph company was the Toronto, Hamilton and Niagara Electro-Magnetic Telegraph Company, founded in 1846, it was the [[Montreal Telegraph Company]], controlled by [[Hugh Allan]] and founded a year later, that dominated in Canada during the technology's early years.&lt;ref name=&quot;canencyclo&quot;/&gt;

Following the 1852 Telegraph Act, Canada's first permanent transatlantic telegraph link was a submarine cable built in 1866 between Ireland and Newfoundland.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRTC&quot;/&gt; [[Telegram]]s were sent through networks built by [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific]] and [[Canadian National]].

In 1868 Montreal Telegraph began facing competition from the newly established Dominion Telegraph Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;canencyclo&quot;/&gt; 1880 saw the Great North Western Telegraph Company established to connect Ontario and Manitoba but within a year it was taken over by Western Union, leading briefly to that company's control of almost all telegraphy in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;canencyclo&quot;/&gt; In 1882, Canadian Pacific transmitted its first commercial telegram over telegraph lines they had erected alongside its tracks,&lt;ref name=&quot;CPRail&quot;/&gt; breaking Western Union's monopoly. Great North Western Telegraph, facing bankruptcy, was taken over in 1915 by Canadian Northern.&lt;ref name=&quot;canencyclo&quot;/&gt;

By the end of [[World War II]], Canadians communicated by telephone, more than any other country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Canada Says Hello: The First Century of the Telephone|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the CP and CN networks were merged to form [[CNCP Telecommunications]].

As of 1951, approximately 7000 messages were sent daily from the United States to Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutr1951&quot;/&gt;  An agreement with [[Western Union]] required that U.S. company to route messages in a specified ratio of 3:1, with three telegraphic messages transmitted to Canadian National for every message transmitted to Canadian Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutr1951&quot;/&gt; The agreement was complicated by the fact that some Canadian destinations were served by only one of the two networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutr1951&quot;/&gt;

== Call signs ==
{{see also|Call signs in Canada}}
[[ITU prefix]]es: Letter combinations available for use in Canada as the first two letters of a television or radio station's call sign are '''CF, CG, CH, CI, CJ, CK, CY, CZ, VA, VB, VC, VD, VE, VF, VG, VO, VX, VY, XJ, XK, XL, XM, XN''' and '''XO'''. Only '''CF, CH, CI, CJ''' and '''CK''' are currently in common use,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} although four radio stations in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] retained call letters beginning with '''VO''' when Newfoundland joined [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1949. Stations owned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] use '''CB''' through a special agreement with the government of [[Chile]]. Some codes beginning with '''VE''' and '''VF''' are also in use to identify radio repeater transmitters.

These commercial stations account for over three quarters of radio stations in Canada.

== Administration and Government ==
Federally, telecommunications are overseen by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] ({{lang-fr|Conseil de la Radiodiffusion et des Télécommunications Canadiennes}})&amp;ndash;CRTC as outlined under the provisions of both the [[Telecommunications Act (Canada)|Telecommunications Act]] and [[Radiocommunication Act]]s.  CRTC further works with [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada]] (formerly Industry Canada) on various technical aspects including: allocating frequencies and call signs, managing the broadcast spectrum, and regulating other technical issues such as interference with electronics equipment. As Canada comprises a part of the [[North American Numbering Plan]] for area codes, the [[Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium]] within Canada is responsible for allocating and managing area codes in Canada.
