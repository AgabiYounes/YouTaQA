[[Christians]] believe that [[Jesus]] is the [[messiah]] foretold in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the Christian [[Old Testament]]. Although the conceptions of the messiah in each religion are similar, for the most part they are distinct from one another due to the [[split of early Christianity and Judaism]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]].

Although the original [[Disciple (Christianity)|followers of Jesus]] believed Jesus to be the Jewish messiah, e.g. in the [[Confession of Peter]], Jesus was usually referred to as &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; or &quot;Jesus, son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Jesus Christ | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=23 May 2013 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303091/Jesus-Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus came to be called &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; (meaning &quot;Jesus the ''Khristós''&quot;, i.e. &quot;Jesus the Messiah&quot; or &quot;Jesus the Anointed&quot;) by later Christians, who believe that his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] fulfill the [[Messiah|messianic prophecies]] of the Old Testament.

==Etymology==
Christ comes from the Greek word {{lang|grc|χριστός}} (''chrīstós''), meaning &quot;[[anointing|anointed]] one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LiddellScott&quot;&gt;{{citation|last1=Liddell|first1=Henry George|last2=Scott|first2=Robert|date=1940|chapter=χριστός|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|chapter-url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=xristo/s|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the Greek verb {{lang|grc|χρίω}} (''chrī́ō''), meaning &quot;to anoint.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LiddellScott&quot;/&gt; In the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Septuagint]], ''christos'' was used to translate the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] מָשִׁיחַ (''Mašíaḥ,'' messiah), meaning &quot;[one who is] anointed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bible Study Tools&quot;&gt;[https://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/messiah/ Messiah] Retrieved February 4, 2020&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Old Testament]], anointing was reserved to the [[Kings of Israel and Judah#List of Kings|Kings of Israel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Judges|Judges]] 9:8–15; [[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 5:3; 1 Kings 1:39; Psalms 89:20, and who were given the title ‘the Lord’s anointed’ (e.g., 1 Samuel 2:10; 1 Samuel 12:3; 2 Samuel 23:1; [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] 2:2; Psalms 20:6; Psalms 132:17; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4:20&lt;/ref&gt;, to the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 29:7, [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]] 4:3–16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Leviticus-Chapter-4_Original-1611-KJV |title= 1611 King James Bible, Book of Leviticus, chapter 4 |language= en |access-date= Sep 17, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150524213620/https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Leviticus-Chapter-4_Original-1611-KJV |archive-date= May 24, 2015 |url-status= live }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and to the [[biblical prophets|prophets]] ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 19:16)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ucg.org/bible-study-tools/booklets/jesus-christ-the-real-story/what-do-messiah-and-jesus-christ-mean | title = What Do 'Messiah' and 'Jesus Christ' Mean?.

According to the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]], in the singular case of Jesus, the word ''Christ'' has a twofold meaning, which stands for &quot;both the Godhead anointing and the manhood anointed&quot;. It derives from the twofold human-divine nature of Christ ([[dyophysitism]]): the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of man]] is anointed in consequence of His incarnated flesh, as well as the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]] is anointing in consequence of the &quot;[[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]] which He has with the Father&quot; (ST ''III'', q. 16, a. 5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Thomas Aquinas | translator = Fathers of the English Dominican Province | url = https://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/TP/TP016.html | title = English translation of the &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, with Latin text | publisher = [[Benziger Bros]] | year = 1947 | access-date = 26 July 2019 | website = dhspriory.org | language = la, en | archive-url = https://archive.today/20141021180357/https://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/TP/TP016.html | archive-date = 21 October 2014 | url-status = live}}, with a quotation form the Epistle to Palestinians of [[Pope Leo I]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Christ'' (and similar spellings) appears in English and in most European [[languages|language]]s. English-speakers now often use &quot;Christ&quot; as if it were a name, one part of the name &quot;Jesus Christ&quot;, though it was originally a title (&quot;the Messiah&quot;). Its usage in &quot;Christ Jesus&quot; emphasizes its nature as a title.&lt;ref name=Pannenberg&gt;{{cite book|title= Jesus God and Man |first= Wolfhart |last= Pannenberg | authorlink= Wolfhart Pannenberg |year= 1968 |isbn= 0-664-24468-8 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zWfvlpURwiIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA30|pages= 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miriam &gt;{{cite book|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions |first= Wendy |last= Doniger | authorlink= Wendy Doniger |year=2000 |isbn= 0-87779-044-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA212|page= 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare the usage &quot;the Christ&quot;.

The spelling ''Christ'' in English became [[standardization|standardized]] in the 18th century, when, in the spirit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the spelling of certain words changed to fit their [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin]] origins. Prior to this, scribes writing in [[Old English|Old]] and [[Middle English]] usually used the spelling ''Crist'' - the ''i'' being pronounced either as {{IPAc-en|iː}}, preserved in the names of churches such as [[St Katherine Cree]], or as a short {{IPAc-en|ɪ}}, preserved in the modern pronunciation of &quot;[[Christmas]]&quot;. The spelling &quot;Christ&quot; in English is attested from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern and ancient usage, even in secular terminology, &quot;Christ&quot; usually refers to Jesus, based on the centuries-old tradition of such usage. Since the [[Apostolic Age]], the&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] use of the definite article before the word Christ and its gradual development into a proper name show the Christians identified the bearer with the promised Messias of the Jews.&lt;ref name=CathencChrist&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Ancient Greek]] text of the [[deuterocanonical books]], the term &quot;Christ&quot; (Χριστός, [[Romanization of Greek|translit.]] Christós) is found in [[2 Maccabees]] 1:10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/2-Maccabees-Chapter-1_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible, Second Book of Maccabees, chapter 1, verse 10 | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=2Mc&amp;ch=1&amp;interlin=on | title = Greek Septuagint and Wiki English Translation, Second Book of Maccabees, chapter 1 | website = katabiblon.com | language = en, el |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004145007/http://www.en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=2Mc&amp;ch=1&amp;interlin=on |archive-date=2018-10-04 |url-status=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to the [[High Priest of Israel#Consecration|anointed High Priest of Israel]]) and in the [[Sirach|Book of Sirach]] 46:19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Ecclesiasticus-Chapter-46_Original-1611-KJV/ | title = 1611 King James Bible, Book of Sirach, chapter 46, verse 19 | website = kingjamesbibleonline.org | language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=Sir&amp;ch=46 | title = Greek Septuagint and Wiki English Translation, Book of Sirach, chapter 46 | website = katabiblon.com | language = en, el |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005112315/http://en.katabiblon.com/us/index.php?text=LXX&amp;book=Sir&amp;ch=46 |archive-date=2018-10-05 |url-status=unfit}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in relation to [[Samuel#Biblical account#Calling|Samuel]], prophet and institutor of the kingdom under Saul.

==Background and New Testament references==
[[File:Sargis Pitsak.jpg|thumb|left|130px|First page of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], by [[Sargis Pitsak]] (14th century): &quot;''The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God''&quot;.]]

At the time of Jesus, there was no single form of [[Second Temple Judaism]], and there were significant political, social, and religious differences among the various Jewish groups.&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 &gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity |first=Donald W. |last=Ekstrand |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-60477-929-5 |pages=147–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for centuries the Jews had used the term ''moshiach'' (&quot;anointed&quot;) to refer to their expected deliverer.&lt;ref name= CathencChrist /&gt; The [[New Testament]] states that the long-awaited messiah had come and describes this savior as &quot;the Christ&quot;. In {{bibleref|Matt|16:16}}, the apostle Peter said, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century, &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ekstrand147 /&gt;

[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleref2|Mark|1:1|KJV|1:1}} (&quot;The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God&quot;) identifies Jesus as both Christ and the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]]. {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:1}} uses Christ as a name and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|1:16|4=1:16}} explains it again with: &quot;Jesus, who is called Christ&quot;. The use of the [[Article (grammar)#Definite article|definite article]] before the word &quot;Christ&quot; and its gradual development into a proper name show that the Christians identified Jesus with the promised messiah of the Jews who fulfilled all the [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic predictions]] in a fuller and a higher sense than had been given them by the [[rabbis]].&lt;ref name=CathencChrist&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Gospels of Mark and Matthew begin by calling Jesus both Christ and the Son of God, but these are two distinct attributions. They develop in the New Testament along separate paths and have distinct theological implications. At the time in [[Roman Judaea]], the Jews had been awaiting the &quot;Messiah&quot;, and many people were wondering who it would be. When John the Baptist appeared and began preaching, he attracted disciples who assumed that he would be announced as the messiah, or &quot;the one&quot; that they had been awaiting. 

In {{bibleref2|John|11:27|NIV;KJV}} Martha told Jesus, &quot;you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world&quot;, signifying that both titles were generally accepted (yet considered distinct) among the followers of Jesus before the [[raising of Lazarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity |first=Donald W. |last=Ekstrand |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-60477-929-5 |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the trial of Jesus before the [[Sanhedrin]] and [[Pontius Pilate]], it might appear from the narratives of Matthew and Luke that Jesus at first refused a direct reply to the high priest's question: &quot;Art thou the Christ?&quot;, where his answer is given merely as &quot;''su eipas&quot;'' (&quot;thou hast said it&quot;). The Gospel of Mark, however, states the answer as &quot;''ego eimi&quot;'' (&quot;I am&quot;), and there are instances from [[Jewish literature]] in which the expression &quot;thou hast said it&quot; is equivalent to &quot;you are right&quot;.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; The Messianic claim was less significant than the claim to divinity, which caused the [[High Priest of Israel|high priest]]'s horrified accusation of [[blasphemy]] and the subsequent call for the death sentence. Before Pilate, on the other hand, it was merely the assertion of his [[Kingship and kingdom of God|royal]] dignity which gave grounds for his condemnation.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah &gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Messiah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word &quot;Christ&quot; is closely associated with Jesus in the [[Pauline epistles]], which suggests that there was no need for the [[early Christians]] to claim that Jesus is Christ because it was considered widely accepted among them. Hence [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] can use the term ''Khristós'' with no confusion as to whom it refers, and he can use expressions such as &quot;in Christ&quot; to refer to the followers of Jesus, as in {{bibleref2|1 Corinthians|4:15|KJV}} and {{bibleref2|Romans|12:5|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity |first=Larry W. |last=Hurtado | authorlink=Larry Hurtado |year=2005 |isbn=0-8028-3167-2 |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul proclaimed him as the [[Last Adam]], who restored through obedience what [[Adam]] lost through disobedience.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of theology: A concise Sacramentum mundi |first=Karl |last=Rahner |authorlink=Karl Rahner |year=2004 |isbn=0-86012-006-6 |pages=730–739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pauline epistles are a source of some key Christological connections; e.g., {{bibleref2|Ephesians|3:17–19|9}} relates the [[love of Christ]] to the [[knowledge of Christ]], and considers the love of Christ as a necessity for knowing him.&lt;ref name=WBarc152&gt;{{cite book|title=The letters to the Galatians and Ephesians |first=William |last=Barclay | authorlink=William Barclay (theologian) |year=2002 |isbn=0-664-22559-4 |pages=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also implicit claims to him being the Christ in the words and actions of Jesus.&lt;ref name= CathencMessiah /&gt; Episodes in the life of Jesus and statements about what he accomplished during his public ministry are found throughout the [[New Testament]].

==Christology==
{{Main|Christology}}
Christology, literally &quot;the understanding of Christ,&quot;{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=108}} is the study of the nature (person) and work (role in salvation) of [[Jesus in Christianity]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=171}}{{sfn|O'Collins|2009|p=1-3}}{{sfn|Ramm|1993|p=15}}{{sfn|Bird|Evans|Gathercole|2014|p=134, n.5}} It studies Jesus Christ's humanity and divinity, and the relation between these two aspects;{{sfn|Ehrman|2014|p=ch.6-9}} and the role he plays in [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]].

The earliest Christian writings gave several titles to Jesus, such as [[Son of Man]], [[Son of God]], [[Messiah]], and [[Kyrios]], which were all derived from the Hebrew scriptures. These terms centered around two themes, namely &quot;Jesus as a [[Pre-existence of Christ|preexistent figure]] who [[Incarnation (Christianity)|becomes human]] and then [[Session of Christ|returns to God]],&quot; and &quot;Jesus as a creature elected and '[[Adoptionism|adopted]]' by God.&quot;

From the second to the fifth centuries, the relation of the human and divine nature of Christ was a major focus of debates in the [[Early centers of Christianity|early church]] and at the [[first seven ecumenical councils]]. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 issued a formulation of the [[hypostatic union]] of the two natures of Christ, one human and one divine, &quot;united with neither confusion nor division&quot;.{{sfn|Davis|1990|p=342}} Most of the major branches of Western Christianity and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] subscribe to this formulation,{{sfn|Davis|1990|p=342}} while many branches of [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] reject it,{{sfn|Armentrout|Boak Slocum|2005|p=81}}{{sfn|Espín|Nickoloff|2007|p=217}}{{sfn|Beversluis|2000|p=21–22}} subscribing to [[miaphysitism]].

==Symbols==
{{See also|Christogram|Xian (abbreviation)}}

[[File:Simple Labarum2.svg|thumb|80px|The ''[[Chi-Rho]]'']]

The use of &quot;Χ&quot;, derived from Chi, the [[Greek alphabet]] initial, as an abbreviation for Christ (most commonly in the abbreviation &quot;[[Χmas]]&quot;) is often misinterpreted as a modern secularization of the term. Thus understood, the centuries-old English word Χmas, is actually a shortened form of CHmas, which is, itself, a shortened form for Christmas. Christians are sometimes referred to as &quot;Xians&quot;, with the 'X' replacing 'Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very early Christogram is the ''[[Chi Rho]]'' symbol formed by superimposing the first two Greek letters in Christ ({{lang|grc|&quot;Χριστός&quot;}}), [[chi (letter)|chi]] = ch and [[rho (letter)|rho]] = r, to produce &lt;big&gt;☧&lt;/big&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Symbols of the Christian faith |first=Alva William |last=Steffler |year=2002 |isbn=0-8028-4676-9 |page = 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
