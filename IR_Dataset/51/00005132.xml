==Career==
===Beginnings (1991–1996)===
Although seeing herself as a dancer,&lt;ref name=CharAngel /&gt; at age 16 Theron won a one-year modelling contract&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; at a local competition in [[Salerno]]&lt;ref name=CharAngel /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2000/settembre/18/Charlize_Theron_Salerno_Potrei_innamorarmi_co_0_00091811394.shtml|title=Charlize Theron at Salerno &quot;I could fall in love with Allen|accessdate=8 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905092659/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2000/settembre/18/Charlize_Theron_Salerno_Potrei_innamorarmi_co_0_00091811394.shtml|archive-date=5 September 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved with her mother to [[Milan]], Italy.&lt;ref name=usaweekend&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/sex-relationships/story/2011-12-14/The-amazing-low-key-life-of-Charlize-Theron/51898844/1 |work=[[USA Today|USA Weekend]] |title=The Amazing, Low-Key Life of Charlize Theron |first=Mark |last=Morrison |date=9–11 December 2011 |accessdate=20 December 2011 |archivedate=5 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130205081925/http://yourlife.usatoday.com/sex-relationships/story/2011-12-14/The-amazing-low-key-life-of-Charlize-Theron/51898844/1 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Theron spent a year modelling throughout Europe, she and her mother moved to the US, both New York City and [[Miami]].&lt;ref name=usaweekend /&gt; In New York, she attended the [[Joffrey Ballet School]], where she trained as a ballet dancer until a knee injury closed this career path.&lt;ref name=CharAngel&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/style/tmagazine/24coverlynn.html |title=Charlize Angel |accessdate=24 February 2008 |first=Lynn |last=Hirschberg |date=24 February 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] T Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225162841/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/style/tmagazine/24coverlynn.html |archivedate=25 February 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Theron recalled in 2008:

{{quote|I went to New York for three days to model, and then I spent a winter in New York in a friend's windowless basement apartment.

My mom came over from South Africa and said, &quot;Either you figure out what to do next or you come home, because you can sulk in South Africa&quot;.&lt;ref name=CharAngel /&gt;}}

In 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,1857161,00.html |title=Play It Tough |accessdate=23 February 2008 |first=Charlotte |last=Higgins |date=24 August 2006 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |archivedate=4 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504152822/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/aug/24/cuba |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theron flew to [[Los Angeles]], on a one-way ticket her mother bought for her, intending to work in the film industry.&lt;ref name=CharAngel /&gt; During the initial months there, she went to a [[Hollywood Boulevard]] bank to cash a cheque her mother had sent to help with the rent.&lt;ref name=indielondon /&gt; When the teller refused to cash it, Theron engaged in a shouting match with him.&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; Upon seeing this, [[talent agent]] John Crosby,&lt;ref name=indielondon /&gt; waiting behind her, handed her his business card and subsequently introduced her to casting agents and also an acting school.&lt;ref name=indielondon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/in-the-valley-of-elah-charlize-theron-interview |title=In the Valley of Elah: Charlize Theron interview |accessdate=23 February 2008 |first=Jack |last=Foley |publisher=IndieLondon.co.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113184755/http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/in-the-valley-of-elah-charlize-theron-interview |archivedate=13 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/celebrities/movie-celebs/face-to-face-with-charlize-theron/article.html |title=Charlize Theron Interview |accessdate=23 February 2008 |first=Sara |last=Davidson |date=October 2005 |work=[[Reader's Digest]] |archivedate=25 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325213620/http://www.rd.com/celebrities/movie-celebs/face-to-face-with-charlize-theron/article.html |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; She later fired him as her manager after he kept sending her scripts for films similar to ''[[Showgirls]]'' and ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2008/06/charlize_theron?printable=true |title=Charlize |accessdate=23 May 2008 |first=Gabriel |last=Snyder |date=June 2008 |magazine=[[W (magazine)|W]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210125754/http://www.wmagazine.com/celebrities/2008/06/charlize_theron?printable=true |archivedate=10 February 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several months in the city, Theron made her film debut with a non-speaking role in the [[horror film]] ''[[Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; Her first speaking role was that of a hitwoman in ''[[2 Days in the Valley]]'' (1996).&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; Though it was a small role, a lingerie-clad Theron was prominently featured on the movie poster, and film offers for hot-chick parts quickly followed. But Theron turned them down. &quot;A lot of people were saying, 'You should just hit while the iron's hot'&quot;, she remarked. &quot;But playing the same part over and over doesn't leave you with any longevity. And I knew it was going to be harder for me, because of what I look like, to branch out to different kinds of roles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/charlize-theron |title=Charlize Theron |first=Gabriel |last=Snyder |date=1 June 2008 |work=[[W Magazine]] |access-date=26 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027061651/https://www.wmagazine.com/story/charlize-theron |archive-date=27 October 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise to fame (1997–2002)===
Larger roles in widely released Hollywood films followed, and her career expanded by the end of the 1990s. In the horror drama ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' (1997), which is credited to be her break-out film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/charlize-theron-i-trained-for-five-hours-a-day-for-three-months-to-get-stunts-right-36019620.html|title=Charlize Theron: 'I trained for five hours a day for three months to get stunts right'|newspaper=Belfast Telegraph|date=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theron starred alongside [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Al Pacino]] as the haunted wife of an unusually successful lawyer. She subsequently starred in the adventure film ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1998) as the friend and protecter of a giant mountain gorilla, and in the drama ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'' (1999), as a woman who seeks an abortion in World War II-era [[Maine]].&lt;ref name=tca /&gt; While ''Mighty Joe Young'' flopped at the box office,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mightyjoeyoung.htm |title=Mighty Joe Young |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=26 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026064638/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mightyjoeyoung.htm |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Devil's Advocate'' and ''The Cider House Rules'' were commercially successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=devilsadvocate.htm |title=The Devil's Advocate |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=26 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026064624/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=devilsadvocate.htm |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ciderhouserules.htm |title=The Cider House Rules |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date=26 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026064611/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ciderhouserules.htm |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was on the cover of the January 1999 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' as the &quot;White Hot Venus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe J.

By the early 2000s, Theron continued to steadily take on roles in films such as ''[[Reindeer Games]]'' (2000), ''[[The Yards]]'' (2000), ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (2000), ''[[Men of Honor]]'' (2000), ''[[Sweet November (2001 film)|Sweet November]]'' (2001), ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]'' (2001), and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), all of which, despite achieving only limited commercial success, helped to establish her as an actress. On this period in her career, Theron remarked: &quot;I kept finding myself in a place where directors would back me but studios didn't. [I began] a love affair with directors, the ones I really, truly admired. I found myself making really bad movies, too. ''Reindeer Games'' was not a good movie, but I did it because I loved [director] [[John Frankenheimer]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnathan Van Meter (October 2004).

In the critically acclaimed drama ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]'' (2005), Theron portrayed a single mother and an [[iron mine]] worker experiencing sexual harassment. David Rooney of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: &quot;The film represents a confident next step for lead Charlize Theron.

===Hiatus and return to acting (2009–2011)===
Her film releases in 2009 were the post-apocalyptic drama ''[[The Road (2009 film)|The Road]]'', in which she briefly appeared in [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], and the animated film ''[[Astro Boy (film)|Astro Boy]]'', providing her voice for a character. On 4 December 2009, Theron co-presented the draw for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, accompanied by several other celebrities of South African nationality or ancestry. During rehearsals she drew an [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] ball instead of [[France national football team|France]] as a joke at the expense of FIFA, referring to [[Thierry Henry]]'s handball controversy in the [[France vs Republic of Ireland (2010 FIFA World Cup Play-Off)|play-off match]] between France and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/theron-has-a-ball-at-fifas-expense-1962410.html |title=Theron has a ball at FIFA's expense |first= Jason |last= O'Brien |work=[[The Irish Independent]]|date=3 December 2009|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=354&amp;fArticleId=5273884 Charlize puts Ireland in the finals]. 4 December 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429033910/http://tonight.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=354&amp;fArticleId=5273884 |date=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stunt alarmed FIFA enough for it to fear she might do it again in front of a live global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcentral.com/sport/FIFA-shock-as-Charlize-Theron-picks-Ireland-as-first-team-for-World-Cup-78329492.html |title=FIFA shock as Charlize Theron picks Ireland as first team in World Cup draw, Hollywood star pulls stunt on World Cup officials in South Africa |publisher=Irishcentral.com |accessdate=8 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303172637/http://www.irishcentral.com/sport/FIFA-shock-as-Charlize-Theron-picks-Ireland-as-first-team-for-World-Cup-78329492.html |archive-date=3 March 2010 |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a two-year hiatus from the big screen, Theron returned to the spotlight in 2011 with the black comedy ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]''. Directed by Jason Reitman, the film earned critical acclaim, in particular for her performance as a depressed divorced, alcoholic 37-year-old ghost writer. [[Richard Roeper]] awarded the film an A grade, stating &quot;Charlize Theron delivers one of the most impressive performances of the year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/youngadult.aspx |title= Young Adult Review |first= Richard |last= Roeper |authorlink= Richard Roeper |publisher= Richard Roeper &amp; The Movies / [[Reelz Channel]] |accessdate= 21 April 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120419074420/http://www.richardroeper.com/reviews/youngadult.aspx |archive-date= 19 April 2012 |url-status=live |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and several other awards. In 2011, describing her process to portray a character on screen, she said:
{{quote|When I'm figuring out a character, for me it's easy, since once I say yes to something, I become super-obsessed about it – and I have an obsessive nature in general. How I want to play it starts at that moment. It's a very lonely, internal experience. I think about [the character] all the time – I observe things, I see things and file things [in my head], everything geared to what I'm going to do. I'm obsessed with the human condition. You read the script and become obsessed with [a character's] nature, her habits. When the camera rolls, it's time to do my job, to do the honest truth. You can't do that part of the [character-creation] work when you're [in the middle of] making the film. At least I can't.&lt;ref name=fji&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3i2d8a79547a92e6e74e5bfa2ce3ab7012|title=High School Disunion: Charlize Theron, Diablo Cody &amp; Jason Reitman on 'Young Adult'|work=[[Film Journal International]]|authorlink=Frank Lovece|first=Frank|last=Lovece|date=30 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130180408/http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/movies/e3i2d8a79547a92e6e74e5bfa2ce3ab7012|archivedate=30 November 2011|url-status=dead|access-date=30 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
