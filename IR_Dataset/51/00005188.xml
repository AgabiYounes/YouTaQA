==Historical perspective==
===Middle Ages and early modern era===
Elements of cultural unity for Northwestern, Southwestern and Central Europe were [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[Latin]]. However Eastern Europe, which remained [[Eastern Orthodox]], was the area of Graeco-Byzantine cultural influence; after the [[East-West Schism]] (1054), Eastern Europe developed cultural unity and resistance to the Catholic (and later also Protestant) Western world within the framework of [[Orthodox Church]], [[Church Slavonic]] language and the [[Cyrillic alphabet]].{{sfn|Magocsi|2002|loc=chapter 11}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Greyerz&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion and Culture in Early Modern Europe |author=Kasper von Greyerz |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmEpMnfYZ-oC&amp;q=%22all+of+central+Europe%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22all%20of%20central%20Europe%22&amp;f=false |isbn=0-19-804384-8 |pages=38– |date=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sedlar&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000–1500 |author=Jean W Sedlar |publisher=University of Washington Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3o5lrvuwOVwC&amp;q=%22estrangement+to+be+permanent%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22estrangement%20to%20be%20permanent%22&amp;f=false |isbn=0-295-97291-2 |pages=161– |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shape of europe&quot; /&gt;

According to Hungarian historian [[Jenő Szűcs]], foundations of Central European history at the first millennium were in close connection with Western European development. He explained that between the 11th and 15th centuries not only Christianization and its cultural consequences were implemented, but well-defined social features emerged in Central Europe based on Western characteristics. The keyword of Western social development after millennium was the spread of liberties and autonomies in Western Europe. These phenomena appeared in the middle of the 13th century in Central European countries. There were self-governments of towns, counties and parliaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/1162/1/Zsinka_2013b.pdf|author=László Zsinka|title=Similarities and Differences in Polish and Hungarian History|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1335, under the rule of the King [[Charles I of Hungary]], the castle of [[Visegrád]], the seat of the [[King of Hungary|Hungarian monarchs]] was the scene of the royal summit of the [[King of Poland|Kings of Poland]], [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and Hungary.&lt;ref name=Halman /&gt; They agreed to cooperate closely in the field of politics and commerce, inspiring their post-[[Cold War]] successors to launch a successful [[Visegrád Group|Central European initiative]].&lt;ref name=Halman&gt;{{cite book|last=Halman|first=Loek|author2=Wilhelmus Antonius Arts|title=European values at the turn of the millennium|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=2004|page=120|isbn=978-90-04-13981-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, countries in Central Europe adopted [[Magdeburg rights]].

===Before World War I===
[[File:Central Europe 1902.PNG|thumb|A view of Central Europe dating from the time before the [[First World War]] (1902):&lt;ref&gt;Source: Geographisches Handbuch zu [[Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas|Andrees Handatlas]], vierte Auflage, Bielefeld und Leipzig, Velhagen und Klasing, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; {{legend|#FF0000|Central European countries and regions: Germany and Austria-Hungary (without [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina]] and [[Dalmatia]])}}{{legend|#FB607F|Regions located at the transition between Central Europe and Southeastern/Eastern Europe: [[Romania]]}}]]
Before 1870, the industrialization that had started to develop in Northwestern and Central Europe and the United States did not extend in any significant way to the rest of the world. Even in [[Eastern Europe]], industrialization lagged far behind. [[Russia]], for example, remained largely rural and agricultural, and its autocratic rulers kept the peasants in serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson J. Spielvogel: ''Western Civilization: Alternate Volume: Since 1300''. p. 618.&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of Central Europe was already known at the beginning of the 19th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;essex.ac.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/events/graduateconference/barcelona/papers/681.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217051750/http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/events/graduateconference/barcelona/papers/681.pdf|archivedate=17 December 2008 |title=&quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; is a multi-facetted concept and difficult to handle |format=PDF |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its real life began in the 20th century and immediately became an object of intensive interest. However, the very first concept mixed science, politics and economy – it was strictly connected with intensively growing German economy and its aspirations to dominate a part of European continent called ''Mitteleuropa''. The German term denoting Central Europe was so fashionable that other languages started referring to it when indicating territories from [[Rhine]] to [[Vistula]], or even [[Dnieper]], and from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Balkans]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Podraza, ''Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny'', 17th Congress of Polish Historians, [[Jagiellonian University]] 2004&lt;/ref&gt; An example of that-time vision of Central Europe may be seen in J. Partsch's book of 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Franz Maria Partsch, Clementina Black, Halford John Mackinder, ''Central Europe'', New York 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 January 1904, ''Mitteleuropäischer Wirtschaftsverein'' (Central European Economic Association) was established in [[Berlin]] with economic integration of Germany and Austria–Hungary (with eventual extension to [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]]) as its main aim. Another time, the term Central Europe became connected to the German plans of political, economic and cultural domination. The &quot;bible&quot; of the concept was [[Friedrich Naumann]]'s book ''Mitteleuropa''&lt;ref&gt;F. Naumann, ''Mitteleuropa'', Berlin: Reimer, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; in which he called for an economic federation to be established after World War I. Naumann's idea was that the federation would have at its centre Germany and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] but would also include all European nations outside the [[Triple Entente]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11015/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Central-versus-Eastern-Europe.html |title=Regions and Eastern Europe Regionalism – Central Versus Eastern Europe |publisher=Science.jrank.org |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept failed after the German defeat in [[World War I]] and the [[dissolution of Austria-Hungary]]. The revival of the idea may be observed during the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler era]].

===Interwar period===

According to [[Emmanuel de Martonne]], in 1927 the Central European countries included: Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Switzerland. The author uses both Human and Physical Geographical features to define Central Europe, but he doesn't take into account the legal development, or the social, cultural, economic, infrastructural developments in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img73.imageshack.us/img73/5269/file0039ao0.jpg], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4384/martonne1.jpg] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100212050523/http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/1867/martonne2a.jpg]; ''Géographie universelle'' (1927), edited by [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] and [[Lucien Gallois]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[interwar period]] (1918–1939) brought a new geopolitical system, as well as economic and political problems, and the concept of Central Europe took on a different character. The centre of interest was moved to its eastern part – the countries that have (re)appeared on the map of Europe: [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]]. Central Europe ceased to be the area of German aspiration to lead or dominate and became a territory of various integration movements aiming at resolving political, economic and national problems of &quot;new&quot; states, being a way to face German and Soviet pressures. However, the conflict of interests was too big and neither [[Little Entente]] nor [[Intermarium]] (''Międzymorze'') ideas succeeded.

The interwar period brought new elements to the concept of Central Europe. Before World War I, it embraced mainly German states (Germany, [[Austria]]), non-German territories being an area of intended German penetration and domination – German leadership position was to be the natural result of economic dominance.&lt;ref name=&quot;essex.ac.uk&quot; /&gt; After the war, the Eastern part of Central Europe was placed at the centre of the concept. At that time the scientists took an interest in the idea: the International Historical Congress in [[Brussels]] in 1923 was committed to Central Europe, and the 1933 Congress continued the discussions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehr.oxfordjournals.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deak|first1=I. |title=The Versailles System and Central Europe|doi=10.1093/ehr/cej100 |page=338|volume=CXXI |year=2006 |journal=The English Historical Review|issue=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungarian historian Magda Ádám wrote in her study ''Versailles System and Central Europe'' (2006): &quot;Today we know that the bane of Central Europe was the [[Little Entente]], military alliance of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia), created in 1921 not for Central Europe's cooperation nor to fight German expansion, but in a wrong perceived notion that a completely powerless Hungary must be kept down&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ehr.oxfordjournals.org&quot; /&gt;

The avant-garde movements of Central Europe were an essential part of modernism's evolution, reaching its peak throughout the continent during the 1920s. The ''Sourcebook of Central European avantgards'' (Los Angeles County Museum of Art) contains primary documents of the avant-gardes in [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], and [[Poland]] from 1910 to 1930.&lt;ref name=&quot;Between Worlds – The MIT Press&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8958 |title=Between Worlds – The MIT Press |publisher=Mitpress.mit.edu |accessdate=31 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922195357/https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8958 |archivedate=22 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifestos and magazines of Western European radical art circles are well known to Western scholars and are being taught at primary universities of their kind in the western world.

===Mitteleuropa===
''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' may refer to an historical concept, or to a contemporary German definition of Central Europe. As an historical concept, the German term ''Mitteleuropa'' (or alternatively its literal translation into English, ''Middle Europe''{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=165}}) is an ambiguous German concept.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=165}} It is sometimes used in English to refer to an area somewhat larger than most conceptions of 'Central Europe'; it refers to territories under Germanic [[cultural hegemony]] until World War I (encompassing Austria–Hungary and Germany in their pre-war formations but usually excluding the [[Baltic countries]] north of [[East Prussia]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} According to [[Fritz Fischer]] ''Mitteleuropa'' was a scheme in the era of the [[German Empire|Reich of 1871–1918]] by which the old imperial elites had allegedly sought to build a system of German economic, military and political domination from the northern seas to the Near East and from the Low Countries through the steppes of Russia to the Caucasus.{{sfn|Hayes|1994|p=16}}  Later on, professor Fritz Epstein argued the threat of a Slavic &quot;Drang nach Westen&quot; (Western expansion) had been a major factor in the emergence of a ''Mitteleuropa'' ideology before the Reich of 1871 ever came into being.{{sfn|Hayes|1994|p=17}}

In Germany the connotation was also sometimes linked to the pre-war German provinces east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The term &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; conjures up negative historical associations among some elderly people, although the Germans have not played an exclusively negative role in the region.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=6}} Most Central European Jews embraced the enlightened German humanistic culture of the 19th century.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=7}} German-speaking Jews from turn of the 20th century [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] became representatives of what many consider to be Central European culture at its best, though the Nazi version of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; destroyed this kind of culture instead.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=7, 165, 170}} However, the term &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; is now widely used again in German education and media without negative meaning, especially since the end of communism. In fact, many people from the [[new states of Germany]] do not identify themselves as being part of [[Western Europe]] and therefore prefer the term &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot;.

===Central Europe behind the Iron Curtain===
[[File:Politically independent Central European states during Cold war.png|thumb|upright|{{legend|#9966CC|Politically independent CE states during [[Cold War]]: [[Finland]], [[Austria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor29&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Central Europe: Mitteleuropa: Europe Centrale: An Analysis of a Geographical Term|jstor = 621131|journal = Transactions and Papers (Institute of British Geographers)|date = 1 January 1954|pages = 15–39|issue = 20|doi = 10.2307/621131|first = Karl A.|last = Sinnhuber}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}]]
Following [[World War II]], large parts of Europe that were culturally and historically Western became part of the [[Eastern bloc]]. Czech author [[Milan Kundera]] (emigrant to France) thus wrote in 1984 about the &quot;Tragedy of Central Europe&quot; in the [[New York Review of Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ises.hu/webimages/files/Kundera_tragedy_of_Central_Europe.pdf|title=Kundera's article in PDF format}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the English term ''Central Europe'' was increasingly applied only to the westernmost former Warsaw Pact countries (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary) to specify them as communist states that were culturally tied to Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11015/Regions-Regionalism-Eastern-Europe-Central-versus-Eastern-Europe.html|title=Central versus Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage continued after the end of the Warsaw Pact when these countries started to undergo transition.

The post-World War II period brought blocking of research on Central Europe in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, as its every result proved the dissimilarity of Central Europe, which was inconsistent with the [[Stalinist]] doctrine. On the other hand, the topic became popular in Western Europe and the United States, much of the research being carried out by immigrants from Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;One of the main representatives was Oscar Halecki and his book ''The limits and divisions of European history'', London and New York 1950&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of communism, publicists and historians in Central Europe, especially the anti-communist opposition, returned to their research.&lt;ref&gt;A. Podraza, Europa Środkowa jako region historyczny, 17th Congress of Polish Historians, Jagiellonian University 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl A. Sinnhuber (''Central Europe: Mitteleuropa: Europe Centrale: An Analysis of a Geographical Term'')&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor29&quot; /&gt; most Central European states were unable to preserve their political independence and became Soviet Satellite Europe. Besides [[Austria]], only the marginal European states of [[Finland]] and [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]] preserved their political sovereignty to a certain degree, being left out of any military alliances in Europe.

===Roles===
According to American professor [[Ronald Tiersky]], the 1991 summit held in [[Visegrád]], [[Hungary]] and attended by the [[Poland|Polish]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] presidents was hailed at the time as a major breakthrough in Central European cooperation, but the [[Visegrád Group]] became a vehicle for coordinating Central Europe's road to the European Union, while development of closer ties within the region languished.{{sfn|Tiersky|2004|p=472}}

Katzenstein]] described Central Europe as a way station in a Europeanization process that marks the transformation process of the [[Visegrád Group]] countries in different, though comparable ways.{{sfn|Katzenstein|1997|p=6}} According to him, in Germany's contemporary public discourse &quot;Central European identity&quot; refers to the civilizational divide between Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.{{sfn|Katzenstein|1997|p=6}} He says there's no precise, uncontestable way to decide whether the Baltic states, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria are parts of Central Europe or not.{{sfn|Katzenstein|1997|p=4}}

==Definitions==
[[File:Geopolitical Challenges.jpg|thumb|Geopolitical Challenges - Panel on the Future of Europe]]
Rather than a physical entity, Central Europe is a concept of shared history which contrasts with that of the surrounding regions. The issue of how to name and define the Central European region is subject to debates. Very often, the definition depends on the nationality and historical perspective of its author.

The main proposed regional definitions, gathered by Polish historian [[Jerzy Kłoczowski]], include:&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerzy Kłoczowski]], Actualité des grandes traditions de la cohabitation et du dialogue des cultures en Europe du Centre-Est, in: L'héritage historique de la Res Publica de Plusieurs Nations, Lublin 2004, pp. 29–30 {{ISBN|83-85854-82-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* West-Central and [[East-Central Europe]] – this conception, presented in 1950,&lt;ref&gt;[[Oskar Halecki]], The Limits and Divisions of European History, Sheed &amp; Ward: London and New York 1950, chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes two regions in Central Europe: German West-Centre, with imperial tradition of the ''[[Reich]]'', and the East-Centre covered by variety of nations ''from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]]'', placed between great empires of [[Scandinavia]], Germany, [[Italy]] and the [[Soviet Union]].
* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] – [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]], [[Belarus]]ian and [[Lithuania]]n historians, in cooperation (since 1990) with [[Poland|Polish]] historians, insist on the importance of the concept.
* Central Europe as a region connected to the [[western world|Western civilisation]] for a very long time, including countries such as the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], later [[German Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Crown of Bohemia]]. Central Europe understood in this way borders on [[Russia]] and [[South-Eastern Europe]], but the exact frontier of the region is difficult to determine.
[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Austria-Hungary|Habsburg-ruled lands]]]]
* Central Europe as the area of cultural heritage of the Habsburg Empire (later [[Austria-Hungary]]) – a concept which is popular in regions along the [[Danube River]]: [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], large parts of [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]], also smaller parts of [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]. In [[Hungary]], the narrowing of Central Europe into former Habsburg lands is not popular.
* A concept underlining the links connecting [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]] and [[Ukraine]] with [[Russia]] and treating the [[Russian Empire]] together with the whole [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population as one entity – this position is taken by the [[Russia]]n historiography.
* A concept putting the accent on links with the West, especially from the 19th century and the grand period of liberation and formation of Nation-states – this idea is represented by the [[South-Eastern Europe|South-Eastern]] states, which prefer the enlarged concept of the &quot;East Centre&quot; expressing their links with [[Western culture]].

Former University of Vienna professor Lonnie R. Johnson points out criteria to distinguish Central Europe from [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeast Europe]]:{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=?}}
* One criterion for defining Central Europe is the frontiers of medieval empires and kingdoms that largely correspond to the religious frontiers between the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] West and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox East]].{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=4}} The pagans of Central Europe were converted to Catholicism while in [[Southeastern Europe|Southeastern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] they were brought into the fold of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=4}}
* Multinational empires were a characteristic of Central Europe.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=4}} [[Hungary]] and [[Poland]], small and medium-size states today, were empires during their early histories.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=4}} The historical [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was until 1918 three times larger than Hungary is today,{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=4}} while Poland was the largest state in Europe in the 16th century.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=4}} Both these kingdoms housed a wide variety of different peoples.{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=4}}

He also thinks that Central Europe is a dynamic historical concept, not a static spatial one. For example, [[Lithuania]], a fair share of [[Belarus]] and western [[Ukraine]] are in [[Eastern Europe]] today, but {{roundup|{{age|format=raw|1791|5|3}}|-1}} years ago they were in [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{sfn|Johnson|1996|p=4}}&lt;br /&gt; Johnson's study on Central Europe received acclaim and positive reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1997-05-01/central-europe-enemies-neighbors-friends|title=Central Europe: Enemies, Neighbors, Friends|last=Legvold|first=Robert|date=May–June 1997|work=[[Foreign Affairs]]|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/InternationalStudies/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195148251&amp;view=usa |title=Selected as &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; of the History Book Club |work=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=20 May 2009 }}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the scientific community. However, according to Romanian researcher [[Maria Bucur]] this very ambitious project suffers from the weaknesses imposed by its scope (almost 1600 years of history).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=1030|title=The Myths and Memories We Teach By|last=Bucur|first=Maria|date=June 1997|work=[[Indiana University]]|publisher=HABSBURG|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encyclopedias, gazetteers, dictionaries ===

''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' defines Central Europe as: Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] |title=Europe |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The World Factbook]]&lt;ref name=Fact /&gt; uses a similar definition and adds also Slovenia. [[Encarta Encyclopedia]] and [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] do not clearly define the region, but Encarta places the same countries into Central Europe in its individual articles on countries, adding Slovenia in &quot;south central Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Slovenia |work=[[Encarta]] |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571128/Slovenia.html |accessdate=1 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028131206/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761571128/Slovenia.html |archivedate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Encyclopaedia ''Meyers Grosses Taschenlexikon'' (''Meyers Big Pocket Encyclopedia''), 1999, defines Central Europe as the central part of Europe with no precise borders to the East and West. The term is mostly used to denominate the territory between the [[Schelde]] to [[Vistula River|Vistula]] and from the [[Danube]] to the [[Moravian Gate]]. Usually the countries considered to be Central European are [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Switzerland]]; in the broader sense [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]] too, occasionally also [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Luxembourg]].

According to ''Meyers Enzyklopädisches Lexikon'',&lt;ref&gt;Band 16, Bibliographisches Institut Mannheim/Wien/Zürich, Lexikon Verlag 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Central Europe is a part of Europe composed of [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Switzerland]], and northern marginal regions of [[Italy]] and Yugoslavia (northern states – [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Slovenia]]), as well as northeastern [[France]].

The German {{lang|de|[[:de:Ständiger Ausschuss für geographische Namen|Ständige Ausschuss für geographische Namen]]}} (Standing Committee on Geographical Names), which develops and recommends rules for the uniform use of geographical names, proposes two sets of boundaries. The first follows  international borders of current countries. The second subdivides and includes some countries based on cultural criteria. In comparison to some other definitions, it is broader, including Luxembourg, Croatia, the [[Baltic states]], and in the second sense, parts of Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Italy, and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jordan 2005&quot; /&gt;

=== Geographical ===

There is no general agreement either on what geographic area constitutes Central Europe, nor on how to further subdivide it geographically.{{sfn|Magocsi|2002|p=20}}

At times, the term &quot;Central Europe&quot; denotes a geographic definition as the [[Danube]] region in the heart of the continent, including the language and culture areas which are today included in the states of [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]] and usually also [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], but ''never'' Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union towards the Ural mountains.{{Sfn|Zepetnek|2011|p=24}}

=== Governmental and standards organisations ===

The terminology EU11 countries refer the Central, [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Baltic states|Baltic European]] member states which accessed in 2004 and after: in 2004 the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and the Slovak Republic; in 2007 Bulgaria, Romania; and in 2013 Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vértesy|first=László|date=2018|title=Macroeconomic Legal Trends in the EU11 Countries|url=https://www.dialogcampus.hu/users/default/dialogcampus/uploads/elektronikus_konyvek/pga2018_01_09_vertesy.pdf|journal=Public Governance, Administration and Finances Law Review|volume= 3.

The [[Baltic states]], geographically in [[Northern Europe]], have been considered part of Central Europe in the German tradition of the term, ''[[Mitteleuropa]]''. [[Benelux]] countries are generally considered a part of Western Europe, rather than Central Europe. Nevertheless, they are occasionally mentioned in the Central European context due to cultural, historical and linguistic ties.

The following states or some of their regions may sometimes be included in Central Europe:
*[[Italy]] ([[South Tyrol]], [[Trentino]], [[Trieste]] and [[Gorizia]], [[Friuli]], [[Lombardy]] occasionally [[Veneto]] or all of [[Northern Italy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATzXAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=NORTHERN+ITALY+MITTELEUROPA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=56I0Dd9422&amp;sig=yr3YZO5JF-rc1KMMH-QdKeRHbKo&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwCjgKahUKEwjH3NGFs7fIAhWKwBQKHeVOB8o|title=Accidental Occidental: Economics and Culture of Transition in Mitteleuropa, the Baltic and the Balkan Area|first=Lajos|last=Bokros|date=15 January 2013|publisher=Central European University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Geography defines Central Europe's natural borders with the neighbouring regions to the north across the [[Baltic Sea]], namely [[Northern Europe]] (or [[Scandinavia]]), and to the south across the [[Alps]], the [[Apennine peninsula]] (or [[Italy]]), and the [[Balkan peninsula]]{{sfn|Magocsi|2002|p=20}} across the [[Soča]]-[[Krka (Sava)|Krka]]-[[Sava]]-Danube line. The borders to [[Western Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]] are geographically less defined, and for this reason the [[Culture|cultural]] and historical boundaries migrate more easily west–east than south–north. The [[Rhine]] river, which runs south–north through Western Germany, is an exception.{{original research inline|date=November 2013}}

===Infrastructure===
Industrialisation occurred early in Central Europe. That caused construction of rail and other types of infrastructure.

====Rail====
[[File:Rail density map.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Rail network density.]]
Central Europe contains the continent's earliest railway systems, whose greatest expansion was recorded in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[German Empire|German]] territories between 1860-1870s.{{sfn|Magocsi|2002|p=1758}} By the mid-19th century Berlin, Vienna, and Buda/Pest were focal points for network lines connecting industrial areas of Saxony, Silesia, Bohemia, Moravia and Lower Austria with the Baltic (Kiel, Szczecin) and Adriatic (Rijeka, Trieste).{{sfn|Magocsi|2002|p=?}} Rail infrastructure in Central Europe remains the densest in the world. Railway density, with total length of lines operated (km) per 1,000 km2, is the highest in the Czech Republic (198.6), Poland (121.0), Slovenia (108.0), Germany (105.5), Hungary (98.7), Serbia (87.3), Slovakia (73.9) and Croatia (72.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaypro.com/wp/launch-of-railway-projects-puts-serbia-among-eu-member-states/|title=Launch of railway projects puts Serbia among EU member states|publisher=Railway Pro|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.internationaltransportforum.org/statistics/investment/Country-responses/Serbia.pdf|title=Response to questionnaire for: Assessment of strategic plans and policy measures on Investment and Maintenance in Transport Infrastructure Country: Serbia|work=internationaltransportforum.org|accessdate=15 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924035757/http://www.internationaltransportforum.org/statistics/investment/Country-responses/Serbia.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when compared with most of Europe and the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Inland_transport_infrastructure_at_regional_level|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508143341/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Inland_transport_infrastructure_at_regional_level|archivedate=8 May 2013|title=Inland transport infrastructure at regional level – Statistics Explained|publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu|date= |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/quickstatistics/readtable.asp?qs_id=47|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022173535/http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/quickstatistics/readtable.asp?qs_id=47|archivedate=22 October 2014 |title=Statistical Database – United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |publisher=W3.unece.org |date=29 December 1980 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====River transport and canals====
Before the first railroads appeared in the 1840s, river transport constituted the main means of communication and trade.{{sfn|Magocsi|2002|p=?}} Earliest canals included Plauen Canal (1745), Finow Canal, and also [[Begej|Bega Canal]] (1710) which connected [[Timișoara]] to [[Novi Sad]] and [[Belgrade]] via Danube.{{sfn|Magocsi|2002|p=?}} The most significant achievement in this regard was the facilitation of navigability on Danube from the Black sea to Ulm in the 19th century.

===Branches===
Compared to most of Europe, the economies of Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland tend to demonstrate [[List of countries by economic complexity|high complexity]].

Central European countries are mostly [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] (Austria, Croatia, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia) or mixed Catholic and [[Protestant]], (Germany and Switzerland).  Large Protestant groups include [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]. Significant populations of [[Eastern Catholicism]] and [[Old Catholic]]ism are also prevalent throughout Central Europe. Central Europe has been a centre of Protestantism in the past; however, it has been mostly eradicated by the [[Counterreformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.hrw.com/hrw.nd/gohrw_rls1/pKeywordResults?ST9%20Eur%20Religions%201600%7ctitle=GO.HRW.COM%7c |title=pError |publisher=Go.hrw.com |date= |accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wps.ablongman.com/wps/media/objects/262/268312/art/figures/KISH_13_309.gif|title=Map: The Religious Divisions of Europe ca. 1555|publisher=Pearson|date=|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emersonkent.com/map_archive/europe_religion_1560.htm|title=Map of Europe in 1560: Religion|publisher=Emersonkent.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech Republic (Bohemia) was historically the first Protestant country, then violently recatholised, and now overwhelmingly non-religious, nevertheless the largest number of religious people are Catholic (10.3%). [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]] are mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] with significant [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] minorities.

Before the [[Holocaust]] (1941–45), there was also a sizeable [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] community in the region, numbering approximately 16.7 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;JVIL2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html|title=The Jewish Population of the World (2010)|work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}, based on {{cite book |title=American Jewish Year Book|publisher=[[American Jewish Committee]]|url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/main.php?GroupingId=10142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some of these countries, there is a number of [[atheist]]s, undeclared and [[irreligion|non-religious]] people: the Czech Republic (non-religious 34.2% and undeclared 45.2%), Germany (non-religious 38%), Slovenia (atheist 14.7%&lt;ref name=&quot;EB2018&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Eurobarometer 90.4 (December 2018): Attitudes of Europeans towards Biodiversity, Awareness and Perceptions of EU customs, and Perceptions of Antisemitism|work=[[Eurobarometer|Special Eurobarometer]] |year=2019 |url=http://zacat.gesis.org/webview/index.jsp?headers=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA7556_V204&amp;v=2&amp;stubs=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA7556_V11&amp;weights=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfVariable%2FZA7556_V440&amp;V204slice=1&amp;study=http%3A%2F%2F193.175.238.79%3A80%2Fobj%2FfStudy%2FZA7556&amp;charttype=null&amp;tabcontenttype=row&amp;V11slice=1&amp;V204subset=1+-+10%2C11%2C12+-+13%2C14&amp;mode=table&amp;top=yes |accessdate=9 August 2019|publisher=[[European Commission]] |location=[[European Union]]|via=[[GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences|GESIS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Luxembourg (23.4 non-religious&lt;ref name=EB2018&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;), Switzerland (20.1%), Hungary (27.2% undeclared, 16.7% &quot;non-religious&quot; and 1.5% atheists), Slovakia (atheists and non-religious 13.4%, &quot;not specified&quot; 10.6%) Austria (19.7% of &quot;other or none&quot;), Liechtenstein (10.6% with no religion), Croatia (4%) and Poland (3% of non-believers/agnostics and 1% of undeclared).

===Cuisine===
[[Central European cuisine]] has evolved through centuries due to social and political change. Most countries share many dishes. The most popular dishes typical to Central Europe are sausages and cheeses, where the earliest evidence of cheesemaking in the archaeological record dates back to 5,500 BCE ([[Kujawy]], Poland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/art-of-cheese-making-is-7-500-years-old-1.12020|title=Art of cheese-making is 7,500 years old|work=Nature News &amp; Comment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other foods widely associated with Central Europe are [[goulash]] and [[beer]]. [[List of countries by beer consumption per capita]] is led by the [[Czech Republic]], followed by [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. [[Poland]] comes 5th, [[Croatia]] 7th and [[Slovenia]] 13th.

===Human rights===
====History====
Human rights have a long tradition in Central Europe. In 1222 Hungary defined for the first time the rights of the nobility in its &quot;Golden Bull&quot;. In 1264 the Statute of Kalisz and the General Charter of Jewish Liberties introduced numerous rights for the Jews in Poland, granting them de facto autonomy. In 1783 for the first time, Poland forbid corporal punishment of children in schools. In the same year, a German state of Baden banned slavery.

On the other hand, there were also major regressions, such as &quot;Nihil novi&quot; in Poland in 1505 which forbade peasants from leaving their land without permission from their feudal lord.

====Present====
Generally, the countries in the region are progressive on the issue of human rights: death penalty is illegal in all of them, corporal punishment is outlawed in most of them and people of both genders can vote in elections. Nevertheless, Central European countries struggle to adopt new generations of human rights, such as [[same-sex marriage]]. Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland also have a history of participation in the CIA's extraordinary rendition and detention program, according to the [[Open Society Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/globalizing-torture|title=CIA Secret Detention and Torture|work=Open Society Foundations|accessdate=24 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925221248/https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/projects/globalizing-torture|archivedate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transcend.org/tms/2013/02/the-latin-american-exception-how-a-washington-global-torture-gulag-was-turned-into-the-only-gulag-free-zone-on-earth/|title=TRANSCEND MEDIA SERVICE|work=TRANSCEND Media Service|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|List of central European countries by development indexes#Democracy}}
[[File:Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy index.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] Democracy index map for 2016, with greener colours representing more democratic countries]]
Central Europe is a home to some of world's oldest democracies. However, most of them have been impacted by [[totalitarianism]], particularly [[Fascism]] and [[Nazism]]. Germany and Italy occupied all Central European countries, except Switzerland. In all occupied countries, the [[Axis powers]] suspended democracy and installed puppet regimes loyal to the occupation forces. Also, they forced conquered countries to aplly racial laws and formed military forces for helping German and Italian struggle against Communists. After [[World War II]], almost the whole of Central Europe (the Eastern and Middle part) was occupied by [[Communism|Communists]]. Communism also banned democracy and free elections, and human rights did not exist in Communist countries. Most of Central Europe had been occupied and later allied with the [[Soviet Union]], often against their will through forged referendum (e.g., [[1946 Polish people's referendum|Polish people's referendum in 1946]]) or force (northeast Germany, Poland, Hungary et alia). Nevertheless, these experiences have been dealt in most of them. Most of Central European countries score very highly in the [[Democracy Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |url=https://portoncv.gov.cv/dhub/porton.por_global.open_file?p_doc_id=1034 |title=Democracy index 2012: Democracy at a standstill: A report from The Economist Intelligence Unit |work=The Economist |date=2013 |accessdate=15 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103104154/https://portoncv.gov.cv/dhub/porton.por_global.open_file?p_doc_id=1034 |archivedate=3 January 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Central Europe is mentioned in 35th episode of [[Lovejoy]], entitled &quot;The Prague Sun&quot;, filmed in 1992. While walking over the famous [[Charles Bridge]], the main character, Lovejoy says: &quot; I've never been to Prague before. Well, it is one of the great unspoiled cities in Central Europe. Notice: I said: &quot;Central&quot;, not &quot;Eastern&quot;! The Czechs are a bit funny about that, they think of Eastern Europeans as ''turnip heads''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lovejoy – Season 3, Episode 13: The Prague Sun – TV.com|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/lovejoy/the-prague-sun-78515/|website=TV.com|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
