'''Dimmu Borgir''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|ɪ|m|uː|_|ˈ|b|ɔːr|ɡ|ɪər}}) is a Norwegian [[symphonic black metal]] band from [[Oslo, Norway]], formed in 1993. The name is derived from [[Dimmuborgir]], a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means &quot;dark cities&quot; or &quot;dark castles/fortresses&quot; in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Old Norse]]. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; vocalist [[Shagrath]] and rhythm guitarist [[Silenoz]] are the only original members who still remain, with lead guitarist [[Galder]] being a longstanding member.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic.com&quot;&gt;Bradley Torreano: [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dimmu-borgir-p207278 Dimmu Borgir].

== Biography ==
=== ''For All Tid'' and ''Stormblåst'' period ===
[[File:Dimmu Borgir - Wacken Open Air 2018-3400.jpg|thumb|Dimmu Borgir live at [[Wacken Open Air]] 2018]]
Dimmu Borgir was founded in 1993 by [[Shagrath]], [[Silenoz]] and [[Tjodalv]]; the band released an EP in 1994 entitled ''[[Inn i evighetens mørke]]'' (&quot;''Into Eternal Darkness''&quot; in English). This short EP sold out within weeks, and the band followed up with the 1994 full-length album ''[[For All Tid]]'' (&quot;''For All Time''&quot; in English). This album featured vocal contributions by Vicotnik of [[Ved Buens Ende]] and [[Dødheimsgard]] and Aldrahn of [[Dødheimsgard]] and [[Zyklon-B (band)|Zyklon-B]]. The initial line-up consisted of Shagrath playing drums with Tjodalv on guitar and Silenoz contributing lead vocals. This line-up changed before the release of ''[[Stormblåst]]'' (&quot;''Stormblown''&quot; in English) on [[Cacophonous Records]] in 1996, an album considered by many to be their finest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Deneu, Max |title=''Stormblast'' review |url=http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=846&amp;fid1=19736&amp;csid1=78 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709153001/http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=846&amp;fid1=19736&amp;csid1=78 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-09 |magazine=[[Exclaim!]] |accessdate=2010-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the last album which features all lyrics written and sung in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=1019306 Dimmu Borgir – For All Tid CD Album].

=== ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'' period ===
After ''Stormblåst'', [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] [[Stian Aarstad]] left the band due to his obligation to serve in the Norwegian army, thus being unable to participate in the 1996 recording of ''[[Devil's Path (Dimmu Borgir EP)|Devil's Path]]''. That period was also marked by the departure of bassist Brynjard Tristan and the arrival of [[Stian Arnesen|Nagash]]. Stian Aarstad returned for the recording of 1997's ''[[Enthrone Darkness Triumphant]]''. He had trouble attending rehearsals and was unable to tour. He was then subsequently fired and replaced by [[Kimberly Goss]] for their 1997/1998 world tour. ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'' was a huge success for the band, and was their first release signed to [[Nuclear Blast]], a German [[record label]]. The album was recorded in the Abyss Studios, owned by [[Hypocrisy (band)|Hypocrisy]]'s frontman [[Peter Tägtgren]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Peter+T%C3%A4gtgren Peter Tägtgren – Bio, CDs and Vinyl at Discogs].

=== ''Spiritual Black Dimensions'' and ''Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia'' period ===
After the tour for ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'', the band recruited new members [[Mustis]] on keyboards and [[Astennu (musician)|Astennu]] on lead guitar. Dimmu Borgir's following full-length albums ''[[Spiritual Black Dimensions]]'' in 1999 and 2001's ''[[Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia]]'', both met critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Huey, Steve |title=''Spiritual Black Dimensions'' review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r399101|pure_url=yes}} |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=O'Neill, Brian |title=''Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia'' review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r524537|pure_url=yes}} |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Palmerston, Sean |title=''Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia'' review |url=http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=846&amp;fid1=9126&amp;csid1=16 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708051851/http://exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=846&amp;fid1=9126&amp;csid1=16 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |magazine=[[Exclaim!]] |accessdate=12 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another line-up change occurred between the two albums; Nagash quit and was replaced by new bassist/singer [[ICS Vortex]], and Tjodalv left due to his family commitments, and to form the subsequent band [[Susperia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Dimmu-Borgir-Biography/F7463D23088CA61748256CEA000DDA9C|title=Dimmu Borgir Biography|publisher=Sing365.com|accessdate=11 June 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927192641/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Dimmu-Borgir-Biography/F7463D23088CA61748256CEA000DDA9C|archivedate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to be replaced with [[Nicholas Barker]] of [[Cradle of Filth]].

=== ''Death Cult Armageddon'' and ''Stormblåst MMV'' period ===
Despite the regular video play on [[MTV2]] and [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] that their follow-up album would receive, the band stated that they were not &quot;commercially-oriented,&quot; and instead, they 'simply wished to spread their message to more people'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/interview.php?interview_id=2 Dimmu Borgir interview (09/2003)]. Metalstorm.net. Retrieved on 2011-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Dimmu Borgir recorded ''[[Death Cult Armageddon]]''. ''Death Cult Armageddon'' was recorded with the Prague Philarmonic Orchestra, conducted by Adam Klemens. All orchestrations were arranged by [[Gaute Storaas]] (who had previously worked with Dimmu Borgir on the album ''[[Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia]]''). In 2004, Dimmu Borgir performed on the mainstage at [[Ozzfest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozzfest History|url=http://www.ozzfest.com/history.html|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the band did a complete re-recording of the ''[[Stormblåst MMV|Stormblåst]]'' album, featuring [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]] of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] fame as the session drummer. The album also featured a DVD with a live performance from the 2004 [[Ozzfest]] tour.

===''In Sorte Diaboli'' period===
Dimmu Borgir's eighth studio album, ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'', was released on 24 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=7398161 Dimmu Borgir – In Sorte Diaboli CD Album].

The album artwork was released on 14 February 2007 on a promotional webpage for the album. This album features once more the drumming of [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]] of [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]. Blomberg left the band in mid-tour in 2007 because of a neck injury that resulted in limited movement of his right arm. With the release of this album, Dimmu Borgir became the first black metal band with a number one album on the charts in their native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/index.php?Action=showDynamicPage&amp;artistname=DIMMU+BORGIR&amp;id=11&amp;ident=artistsfull#DIMMU%20BORGIR |title=No.1 Heavy Metal Online-Shop, Metal-Shirts T-Shirts, CDs, Vinyl – Nuclear Blast |website=Nuclearblast.de |accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2008, they released their second live DVD set titled [[The Invaluable Darkness]], which was based on several shows during the world tour supporting 'In Sorte Diaboli'.

In 2009, members ICS Vortex and Mustis independently announced their departure from Dimmu Borgir. Mustis released a statement claiming his disfavor with the band, stating that he was not properly credited for his writing contributions to the band's music, mentioning possibly taking legal action.&lt;ref name=blabbermouthsplit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=126138 |title=Dimmu Borgir Splits With Keyboardist Mustis, Bassist/Vocalist Vortex |date=30 August 2009 |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |accessdate=5 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919103804/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=126138 |archivedate=19 September 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimmu Borgir soon after confirmed the pair's dismissal from the band, releasing a statement explaining why the two were fired.&lt;ref name=&quot;blabbermouthstatement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=126340|title=Dimmu Borgir: 'We Have Put Up With Unprofessionalism And Bad Live Performances For Years'|date=2 September 2009|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=5 February 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shagrath, Silenoz and Galder wrote: &quot;Funny then, how the new album is half-way finished written already by the rest of us without any of these guys' input, still having all those elements we're known for.&quot;&lt;ref name=blabbermouthstatement/&gt; The band's decision has received a very mixed response from fans.

===''Abrahadabra'' period===
{{Main|Abrahadabra (album)}}
Dimmu Borgir's ninth studio album, ''[[Abrahadabra (album)|Abrahadabra]]'', was released on 24 September 2010 in Germany, 27 September 2010 for the rest of Europe and 12 October 2010 in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=134349 |title=DIMMU BORGIR Working On 'Grand, Huge, Epic And Primal' New Album |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=31 January 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205081101/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=134349 |archivedate=5 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silenoz explained that the growing periods of time between albums was because the band had stopped writing music while touring, which was affecting the quality of the music. He described the new album as having an &quot;eerie and haunting feel to it&quot;, adding that the material is &quot;epic&quot;, &quot;primal&quot;, atmospheric and ambient. A promotional image released with the statement showed Shagrath returning to the keyboards.&lt;ref name=newalbum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=134349 |title=Dimmu Borgir Working On 'Grand, Huge, Epic And Primal' New Album |date=31 January 2010 |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |accessdate=5 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205081101/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=134349 |archivedate=5 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features an ensemble orchestra, the ''[[Kringkastingsorkestret]]'' (the Norwegian Broadcasting Orchestra), as well as the [[Schola Cantorum (Norwegian choir)|Schola Cantorum choir]], totaling more than 100 musicians and singers.

[[Gaute Storaas]], composer of the orchestral arrangements, released a statement on his role in working on the album. &quot;Their music is epic, thematic and symphonic already from the creation; they are clearly having an orchestral approach to composing. My role in this is sometimes just to transcribe their themes, sometimes to take their ideas, tear them apart and build them back up in ways that are true to the band's intentions. The music must also be both interesting and playable for the musicians, and hopefully, meet the quality standards of the orchestral world.&quot;

On 8 July the band confirmed that they had tapped Swedish multi-instrumentalist [[Snowy Shaw]] ([[Therion (band)|Therion]], [[Dream Evil]]) to replace bassist/clean vocalist ICS Vortex on their then-upcoming album, ''Abrahadabra'', and world tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=145008 |title=It's Official: SNOWY SHAW Is The New Bassist/Clean Vocalist For DIMMU BORGIR |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=24 August 2010 |accessdate=24 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827160324/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=145008 |archivedate=27 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August it was announced that Snowy Shaw had left Dimmu Borgir to rejoin Therion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=145074 |title=SNOWY SHAW 'Quits' DIMMU BORGIR, Rejoins THERION |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=25 August 2010 |accessdate=24 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828102003/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=145074 |archivedate=28 August 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September 2010 Dimmu Borgir released the song &quot;Born Treacherous&quot; from ''Abrahadabra'' on their official Myspace page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''New Dimmu Borgir Song Streaming''|url=http://www.metalcallout.com/metal-news/new-dimmu-borgir-song-streaming.html |publisher=Metal CallOut |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 24 September the band announced they would stream ''Abrahadabra'' in its entirety until 7 p.m. EST that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dimmu Borgir- Abrahadabra: Entire New Album Streaming|url=http://www.metalcallout.com/metal-news/dimmu-borgir-abrahadabra-entire-new-album-streaming.html|publisher=Metal CallOut |accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboards and bass are currently played by [[Geir Bratland|Gerlioz]] from [[Apoptygma Berzerk]] and Cyrus of [[Susperia]] respectively, and the clean vocals are sampled.

28 May 2011 saw Dimmu Borgir, for the very first time in the band's career, perform live with a full symphony orchestra and choir in a one-off show with the Norwegian Broadcasting Orchestra and Schola Cantorum Choir (who collaborated on ''Abrahadabra'' the previous year) at the Oslo Spectrum entitled &quot;Forces of the Northern Night&quot;. This was broadcast live on Norway's main national TV carrier NRK. The setlist for this show consisted of tracks from the band's recent transfiguration ''Abrahadabra'', leading tracks &quot;Vredysbyrd&quot; and &quot;Progenies of the Great Apocalypse&quot; from ''Death Cult Armageddon'', as well as newly updated versions of tracks from their standard back catalog; &quot;The Serpentine Offering&quot;, &quot;Kings of the Carnival Creation&quot;, and &quot;Mourning Palace&quot; which were re-orchestrated by Gaute Storaas. The band played a similar show the following year at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival, having yet performed a second live show with a symphony orchestra and choir. This time, they were accompanied by the Czech National Orchestra with the same choir, being the second band in the festival's history to play with a live orchestra and choir (next to German [[power metal]] band [[Rage (German band)|Rage]]'s 2007 performance). The show was broadcast live on Germany's Kultur TV arts channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTB1YXElyYM |title=Dimmu Borgir Interview (Bloodstock 2012) |publisher=YouTube |date=6 September 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silenoz has also said in several recent interviews that both live sets have been fully mixed and will be accompanied by a feature-length documentary and bonus material when released.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}  In late 2011-2012 the band went on a special tour for fans in various European countries, including playing in some small, intimate venues celebrating their 1997 album [[Enthrone Darkness Triumphant]] by playing the album in its entirety, alongside an additional set of various fan favourite tracks, following a poll to fans directly, asking which of their first 3 albums would they want to see played in full on their next European tour.

Silenoz recently revealed that the band is in the mixing stage of the follow-up to ''[[Abrahadabra (album)|Abrahadabra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dimmu-borgir-guitarist-on-upcoming-album-every-song-stands-perfectly-on-its-own-feet/&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten songs will feature on the next album and they have said it has since been completed.  On 18 December 2017 it was announced that the first single from the new album will be initially released on a 7-inch vinyl E.P, and will be titled ‘Interdimensional Summit’, and was released on 23 February 2018. The new album was titled ''[[Eonian]]'' and was released on 4 May through Nuclear Blast, and marked the band’s first new release of original material in almost 8 years. A second song from the new album, ‘Council of Wolves and Snakes’ was made available for streaming online on 30 March. On 28 May, it was announced that Victor Brandt ([[Entombed A.D.]], [[Firespawn]]) had officially joined as the band's new bassist.

Dimmu Borgir's older releases (since 1994 to 1999) are, according to ''Allmusic'' journalist Bradley Torreano, strongly influenced by [[Darkthrone]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], and [[Iron Maiden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic.com&quot;/&gt; The band became more progressive and symphonic through the years; many black metal purists consider the band's second album, ''Stormblåst'', to be &quot;the act's last true contribution to black metal.&quot;&lt;ref name=musicmight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/norway/oslo/dimmu+borgir |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128042016/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/norway/oslo/dimmu%2Bborgir |archivedate=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Enthrone Darkness Triumphant'', Dimmu Borgir's third album, &quot;distinguished itself in two important areas, firstly forgoing their native language for English and secondly for its dramatic increase in synthesizer content.&quot;&lt;ref name=musicmight/&gt; Significant experimentation began with 1999's ''[[Spiritual Black Dimensions]]'' (due to the addition of [[ICS Vortex|Vortex]]'s clean vocals, and the variety of musical ideas from then-new member [[Mustis]]), as well as ''[[Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; due to addition of influences from composers such as [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Enya]], [[Richard Wagner]], and [[Frédéric Chopin]].&lt;ref&gt;Serba, John. (2003-09-09) [http://www.allmusic.com/album/death-cult-armageddon-r655155 Death Cult Armageddon – Dimmu Borgir]. AllMusic. Retrieved on 2011-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; As the music strongly differed from the older, rawer black metal style, Jon &quot;Metalion&quot; Kristiansen called ''Spiritual Black Dimensions'' &quot;a fine case of melodic, over-produced symphonic metal. If you like this melodic style I can't really think of anyone doing it better [...]. No, I wouldn't call this black metal. Read the interview with [[Funeral Mist]] for the right definition of black metal.&quot;&lt;ref name=slayer419&gt;''The Great Rock &amp; Roll Swindle!''.
