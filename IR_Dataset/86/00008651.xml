&lt;!--Before changing percentages please note that 85% here refers to that of matter /excluding/ dark energy--&gt;
'''Dark matter''' is a form of [[matter]] thought to account for approximately 85% of the matter in the [[universe]] and about a quarter of [[Universe#Composition|its total energy density]]. Its presence is implied in a variety of [[astrophysical]] observations, including [[gravitation]]al effects that cannot be explained by accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seen. For this reason, most experts think that dark matter is abundant in the universe and that it has had a strong influence on its structure and evolution. Dark matter is called dark because it does not appear to interact with observable [[electromagnetic radiation]], such as [[light]], and so it is undetectable by existing [[List of astronomical instruments|astronomical instruments]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CERN Dark Matter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.cern/about/physics/dark-matter |title=Dark Matter |website=CERN Physics |date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because dark matter has not yet been observed directly, if it exists, it must barely interact with ordinary [[baryonic]] matter and radiation, except through gravity. Most dark matter is thought to be non-[[baryon]]ic in nature; it may be composed of some as-yet undiscovered [[subatomic particle]]s.&lt;ref group=&quot;lower-alpha&quot;&gt;A small portion of dark matter could be baryonic and / or [[neutrino]]s. See [[Baryonic dark matter]].&lt;/ref&gt; The primary candidate for dark matter is some new kind of [[elementary particle]] that has [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|not yet been discovered]], in particular, [[weakly-interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs).&lt;ref name=&quot;Copi 1995&quot; /&gt; Many experiments to directly detect and study dark matter particles are being actively undertaken, but none have yet succeeded.&lt;ref name=&quot;bertone hooper silk&quot; /&gt; Dark matter is classified as &quot;cold&quot;, &quot;warm&quot;, or &quot;hot&quot; according to its [[velocity]] (more precisely, its [[Free streaming|free streaming length]]). Current models favor a [[cold dark matter]] scenario, in which [[structure formation|structures emerge]] by gradual accumulation of particles.

In 1933, Swiss astrophysicist [[Fritz Zwicky]], who studied [[groups and clusters of galaxies|galaxy clusters]] while working at the California Institute of Technology, made a similar inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |date=1933 |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |trans-title=The red shift of extragalactic nebulae |journal=[[Helvetica Physica Acta]] |volume=6 |pages=110–127 |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=F. |authorlink=Fritz Zwicky |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=86 |page=217 |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1933AcHPh...6..110Z |title=Die Rotverschiebung von extragalaktischen Nebeln |date=1933 |journal=Helvetica Physica Acta |volume=6 |pages=110–127}} See also {{Citation |last=Zwicky |first=F. |bibcode=1937ApJ....86..217Z |title=On the Masses of Nebulae and of Clusters of Nebulae |date=1937 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=86 |page=217 |doi=10.1086/143864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky applied the [[virial theorem]] to the [[Coma Cluster]] and obtained evidence of unseen mass he called ''dunkle Materie'' ('dark matter'). Zwicky estimated its mass based on the motions of galaxies near its edge and compared that to an estimate based on its brightness and number of galaxies. He estimated the cluster had about 400 times more mass than was visually observable. The gravity effect of the visible galaxies was far too small for such fast orbits, thus mass must be hidden from view. Based on these conclusions, Zwicky inferred some unseen matter provided the mass and associated gravitation attraction to hold the cluster together.&lt;ref&gt;Some details of Zwicky's calculation and of more modern values are given in {{Citation |first=M. |last=Richmond |title=Using the virial theorem: the mass of a cluster of galaxies |url=http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/gal_clus/gal_clus.html |accessdate=10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zwicky's estimates were off by more than an order of magnitude, mainly due to an obsolete value of the [[Hubble constant]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Katherine |last=Freese |title=The cosmic cocktail: Three parts dark matter |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=c2B8AgAAQBAJ}} |year=2014 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-5007-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same calculation today shows a smaller fraction, using greater values for luminous mass. Nonetheless, Zwicky did correctly conclude from his calculation the bulk of the matter was dark.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;/&gt;

Further indications the [[mass-to-light ratio]] was not unity came from measurements of galaxy rotation curves. In 1939, [[Horace W. Babcock]] reported the rotation curve for the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda nebula]] (known now as the Andromeda Galaxy), which suggested the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases radially.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1939LicOB..19...41B |doi=10.5479/ADS/bib/1939LicOB.19.41B |title=The rotation of the Andromeda Nebula |journal=Lick Observatory Bulletins |volume=19 |pages=41–51 |year=1939 |last1=Babcock |first1=Horace W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed it to either light absorption within the galaxy or modified dynamics in the outer portions of the spiral and not to the missing matter he had uncovered.

At the same time Rubin and Ford were exploring optical rotation curves, radio astronomers were making use of new radio telescopes to map the 21&amp;nbsp;cm line of atomic hydrogen in nearby galaxies. The radial distribution of interstellar atomic hydrogen ([[H I region|H-I]]) often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible by optical studies, extending the sampling of rotation curves – and thus of the total mass distribution – to a new dynamical regime.

A stream of observations in the 1980s supported the presence of dark matter, including [[gravitational lensing]] of background objects by [[galaxy cluster]]s,{{sfn|Randall|2015|pp=14–16}} the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters, and the pattern of anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]].

== Technical definition ==
{{see also|Friedmann equations}}
In standard cosmology, matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]], i.e., {{nowrap|''ρ'' ∝ ''a''{{sup|−3}}.}} This is in contrast to radiation, which scales as the inverse fourth power of the scale factor {{nowrap|''ρ'' ∝ ''a''{{sup|−4}},}} and a [[cosmological constant]], which is independent of ''a''. These scalings can be understood intuitively: For an ordinary particle in a cubical box, doubling the length of the sides of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of 8 (=&amp;nbsp;2{{sup|3}}). For radiation, the energy density decreases by a factor of 16 (=&amp;nbsp;2{{sup|4}}), because any act whose effect increases the scale factor must also cause a proportional [[redshift]]. A cosmological constant, as an intrinsic property of space, has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf |title=Cosmology: Part&amp;nbsp;III |department=Mathematical Tripos |publisher=Cambridge University |first=Daniel |last=Baumann |pages=21–22 |access-date=24 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202065045/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2017 |url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[Dark energy]] is a term often used nowadays as a substitute for cosmological constant. It is basically the same except that dark energy might depend on scale factor in some unknown way rather than necessarily being constant.&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, &quot;dark matter&quot; means all components of the universe which are not visible but still obey {{nowrap|''ρ'' ∝ ''a''{{sup|−3}}.}} In practice, the term &quot;dark matter&quot; is often used to mean only the non-baryonic component of dark matter, i.e., excluding &quot;[[missing baryon problem|missing baryons]].&quot; Context will usually indicate which meaning is intended.

=== Galaxy rotation curves ===
{{Main|Galaxy rotation curve}}
[[File:GalacticRotation2.svg|thumb|[[Galaxy rotation curve|Rotation curve]] of a typical spiral galaxy: predicted ('''A''') and observed ('''B'''). Dark matter can explain the 'flat' appearance of the velocity curve out to a large radius.]]The arms of [[spiral galaxies]] rotate around the galactic center. The luminous mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the center to the outskirts. If luminous mass were all the matter, then we can model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it, similar to the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This is a consequence of the [[shell theorem]] and the observation that spiral galaxies are spherically symmetric to a large extent (in 2D).&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Kepler's Second Law]], it is expected that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the center, similar to the Solar System. This is not observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Corbelli, E. |author2=Salucci, P. |title=The extended rotation curve and the dark matter halo of M33|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2000 |volume=311 |issue=2 |pages=441–447 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03075.x |arxiv=astro-ph/9909252 |bibcode=2000MNRAS.311..441C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distance from the center increases.

If Kepler's laws are correct, then the obvious way to resolve this discrepancy is to conclude the mass distribution in spiral galaxies is not similar to that of the Solar System. In particular, there is a lot of non-luminous matter (dark matter) in the outskirts of the galaxy.

=== Velocity dispersions ===
{{main|Velocity dispersion}}
Stars in bound systems must obey the [[virial theorem]]. The theorem, together with the measured velocity distribution, can be used to measure the mass distribution in a bound system, such as elliptical galaxies or globular clusters. With some exceptions, velocity dispersion estimates of elliptical galaxies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Faber |first1=S.M. |last2=Jackson |first2=R.E. |date=1976 |title=Velocity dispersions and mass-to-light ratios for elliptical galaxies |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=204 |pages=668–683 |bibcode=1976ApJ...204..668F |doi=10.1086/154215}}&lt;/ref&gt; do not match the predicted velocity dispersion from the observed mass distribution, even assuming complicated distributions of stellar orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Binny |first1=James |last2=Merrifield |first2=Michael |year=1998 |title=Galactic Astronomy |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=712–713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with galaxy rotation curves, the obvious way to resolve the discrepancy is to postulate the existence of non-luminous matter.

=== Galaxy clusters ===
[[Galaxy clusters]] are particularly important for dark matter studies since their masses can be estimated in three independent ways:
* From the scatter in radial velocities of the galaxies within clusters
* From [[X-ray]]s emitted by hot gas in the clusters. From the X-ray energy spectrum and flux, the gas temperature and density can be estimated, hence giving the pressure; assuming pressure and gravity balance determines the cluster's mass profile.
* [[Gravitational lens]]ing (usually of more distant galaxies) can measure cluster masses without relying on observations of dynamics (e.g., velocity).

Generally, these three methods are in reasonable agreement dark matter outweighs visible matter by approximately 5 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cosmological Parameters from Clusters of Galaxies |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=409–470 |doi=10.1146/annurev-astro-081710-102514 |arxiv=1103.4829 |bibcode=2011ARA&amp;A..49..409A |year=2011 |last1=Allen |first1=Steven W. |last2=Evrard |first2=August E. |last3=Mantz |first3=Adam B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the consequences of [[general relativity]] is massive objects (such as a [[galaxy cluster|cluster of galaxies]]) lying between a more distant source (such as a [[quasar]]) and an observer should act as a lens to bend the light from this source. The more massive an object, the more lensing is observed.

Strong lensing is the observed distortion of background galaxies into arcs when their light passes through such a gravitational lens. It has been observed around many distant clusters including [[Abell 1689]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=A.N. |display-authors=etal |date=1998 |title=Gravitational lens magnification and the mass of Abell&amp;nbsp;1689 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=501 |issue=2 |pages=539–553 |arxiv=astro-ph/9801158 |bibcode=1998ApJ...501..539T |doi=10.1086/305827}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring the distortion geometry, the mass of the intervening cluster can be obtained.

[[Weak gravitational lensing]] investigates minute distortions of galaxies, using statistical analyses from vast [[redshift survey|galaxy surveys]].

=== Cosmic microwave background ===
{{Main|Cosmic microwave background}}
Although both dark matter and ordinary matter are matter, they do not behave in the same way. In particular, in the early universe, ordinary matter was ionized and interacted strongly with radiation via [[Thomson scattering]]. Dark matter does not interact directly with radiation, but it does affect the CMB by its gravitational potential (mainly on large scales), and by its effects on the density and velocity of ordinary matter. Ordinary and dark matter perturbations, therefore, evolve differently with time and leave different imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

The cosmic microwave background is very close to a perfect blackbody but contains very small temperature anisotropies of a few parts in 100,000. A sky map of anisotropies can be decomposed into an angular power spectrum, which is observed to contain a series of acoustic peaks at near-equal spacing but different heights.
The series of peaks can be predicted for any assumed set of cosmological parameters by modern computer codes such as CMBFast and CAMB, and matching theory to data, therefore, constrains cosmological parameters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wayne Hu&quot;&gt;The details are technical. For an intermediate-level introduction, see {{cite web |author=Hu, Wayne |title=Intermediate Guide to the Acoustic Peaks and Polarization |url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/intermediate.html |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first peak mostly shows the density of baryonic matter, while the third peak relates mostly to the density of dark matter, measuring the density of matter and the density of atoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wayne Hu&quot; /&gt;

The CMB anisotropy was first discovered by [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] in 1992, though this had too coarse resolution to detect the acoustic peaks.
After the discovery of the first acoustic peak by the balloon-borne [[BOOMERanG]] experiment in 2000, the power spectrum was precisely observed by [[WMAP]] in 2003–2012, and even more precisely by the [[Planck spacecraft]] in 2013–2015. The results support the Lambda-CDM model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinshaw2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hinshaw |first1=G. |display-authors=etal |year=2009 |title=Five-year Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe (WMAP) observations: Data processing, sky maps, and basic results |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement |volume=180 |issue=2 |pages=225–245 |arxiv=0803.0732 |bibcode=2009ApJS..180..225H |doi=10.1088/0067-0049/180/2/225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Planck15&quot; /&gt;

The observed CMB angular power spectrum provides powerful evidence in support of dark matter, as its precise structure is well fitted by the [[Lambda-CDM model]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Planck15&quot;/&gt; but difficult to reproduce with any competing model such as [[modified Newtonian dynamics]] (MOND).&lt;ref name=&quot;Planck15&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ade |first1=P.A.R. |display-authors=etal |title=Planck 2015 results.

Structure formation refers to the period after the Big Bang when density perturbations collapsed to form stars, galaxies, and clusters. Prior to structure formation, the [[FRW metric|Friedmann solutions]] to general relativity describe a homogeneous universe. Later, small anisotropies gradually grew and condensed the homogeneous universe into stars, galaxies and larger structures. Ordinary matter is affected by radiation, which is the dominant element of the universe at very early times. As a result, its density perturbations are washed out and unable to condense into structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffe&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Jaffe, A.H. |title=Cosmology 2012: Lecture Notes |url=http://astro.imperial.ac.uk/sites/default/files/cosmology.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there were only ordinary matter in the universe, there would not have been enough time for density perturbations to grow into the galaxies and clusters currently seen.

Dark matter provides a solution to this problem because it is unaffected by radiation. Therefore, its density perturbations can grow first. The resulting gravitational potential acts as an attractive [[potential well]] for ordinary matter collapsing later, speeding up the structure formation process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Constraints on the composite photon theory |author=Low, L.F. |doi=10.1142/S021773231675002X |journal=Modern Physics Letters A |volume=31 |issue=36 |pages=1675002 |date=12 October 2016 |bibcode=2016MPLA...3175002L|url=https://zenodo.org/record/896052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sky surveys and baryon acoustic oscillations ===
{{Main|Baryon acoustic oscillations}}
Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are fluctuations in the density of the visible [[baryonic]] matter (normal matter) of the universe on large scales. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid of the early universe, and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred length scale for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (≈1&amp;nbsp;percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147&amp;nbsp;Mpc, compared to those separated by 130–160&amp;nbsp;Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] and the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;

=== Redshift-space distortions ===
Large galaxy [[redshift survey]]s may be used to make a three-dimensional map of the galaxy distribution. These maps are slightly distorted because distances are estimated from observed [[redshift]]s; the redshift contains a contribution from the galaxy's so-called peculiar velocity in addition to the dominant Hubble expansion term. On average, superclusters are expanding more slowly than the cosmic mean due to their gravity, while voids are expanding faster than average. In a redshift map, galaxies in front of a supercluster have excess radial velocities towards it and have redshifts slightly higher than their distance would imply, while galaxies behind the supercluster have redshifts slightly low for their distance. This effect causes superclusters to appear squashed in the radial direction, and likewise voids are stretched. Their angular positions are unaffected. This effect is not detectable for any one structure since the true shape is not known, but can be measured by averaging over many structures. It was predicted quantitatively by Nick Kaiser in 1987, and first decisively measured in 2001 by the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peacock |first1=J. |display-authors=etal |title=A measurement of the cosmological mass density from clustering in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey |journal=Nature |year=2001 |volume=410 |issue=6825 |pages=169–173 |arxiv=astro-ph/0103143 |bibcode=2001Natur.410..169P |doi=10.1038/35065528 |pmid=11242069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results are in agreement with the [[Lambda-CDM model]].

=== Lyman-alpha forest ===
{{Main|Lyman-alpha forest}}
In [[astronomical spectroscopy]], the Lyman-alpha forest is the sum of the [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] arising from the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] transition of [[Hydrogen line|neutral hydrogen]] in the spectra of distant [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[quasar]]s.

Dark matter can refer to any substance which interacts predominantly via gravity with visible matter (e.g., stars and planets). Hence in principle it need not be composed of a new type of fundamental particle but could, at least in part, be made up of standard baryonic matter, such as protons or neutrons.{{refn|name=BaryonicFootnote01|group=lower-alpha|Astronomers define the term ''[[baryonic matter]]'' to refer to ordinary matter made of [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s and [[electron]]s, including [[neutron stars]] and [[black holes]] from the collapse of ordinary matter. Strictly speaking, electrons are [[lepton]]s not [[baryon]]s; but since their number is equal to the protons while their mass is far smaller, electrons give a negligible contribution to the average density of baryonic matter. Baryonic matter excludes other known particles such as [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s. Hypothetical primordial black holes are also generally defined as non-baryonic, since they would have formed from radiation, not matter.&lt;ref name=BaryonicSource01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/B/Baryonic+Matter |title=Baryonic Matter |website=COSMOS – The SAO Encyclopedia of Astronomy |publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]]|access-date=9 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists think the dark matter is dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown fundamental particle (or similar exotic state).

=== Baryonic matter ===
{{Distinguish|Missing baryon problem}}
[[Baryon]]s ([[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s) make up ordinary stars and planets. However, baryonic matter also encompasses less common non-primordial [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s, faint old [[white dwarf]]s and [[brown dwarf]]s, collectively known as [[massive compact halo object]]s (MACHOs), which can be hard to detect.{{sfn|Randall|2015|p=286}}

However, multiple lines of evidence suggest the majority of dark matter is not made of baryons:
* Sufficient diffuse, baryonic gas or dust would be visible when backlit by stars.
* The theory of [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] predicts the observed [[abundance of the chemical elements]]. If there are more baryons, then there should also be more helium, lithium and heavier elements synthesized during the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weiss, Achim |url=http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN |title=Big bang nucleosynthesis: Cooking up the first light elements |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206021217/http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/BBN |archive-date=6 February 2013  |website=Einstein Online |volume=2 |year=2006 |page=1017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raine |first=D. |last2=Thomas |first2=T. |date=2001 |title=An Introduction to the Science of Cosmology |page=30 |publisher=[[IOP Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7503-0405-4 |oclc=864166846 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement with observed abundances requires that baryonic matter makes up between 4–5% of the universe's [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]]. In contrast, [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] and other observations indicate that the total matter density is about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name=&quot;planckesa2015&quot; /&gt;
* Astronomical searches for [[gravitational microlensing]] in the [[Milky Way]] found at most only a small fraction of the dark matter may be in dark, compact, conventional objects (MACHOs, etc.); the excluded range of object masses is from half the Earth's mass up to 30&amp;nbsp;solar masses, which covers nearly all the plausible candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tisserand |first1=P. |last2=Le&amp;nbsp;Guillou |first2=L. |last3=Afonso |first3=C. |last4=Albert |first4=J.N. |last5=Andersen |first5=J. |last6=Ansari |first6=R. |last7=Aubourg |first7=É. |last8=Bareyre |first8=P. |last9=Beaulieu |first9=J.P. |last10=Charlot |first10=X. |last11=Coutures |first11=C. |last12=Ferlet |first12=R. |last13=Fouqué |first13=P. |last14=Glicenstein |first14=J.F. |last15=Goldman |first15=B. |last16=Gould |first16=A. |last17=Graff |first17=D. |last18=Gros |first18=M. |last19=Haissinski |first19=J. |last20=Hamadache |first20=C. |last21=De Kat |first21=J. |last22=Lasserre |first22=T. |last23=Lesquoy |first23=É. |last24=Loup |first24=C. |last25=Magneville |first25=C. |last26=Marquette |first26=J.B. |last27=Maurice |first27=É. |last28=Maury |first28=A. |last29=Milsztajn |first29=A. |last30=Moniez |first30=M. |display-authors=6 |title=Limits on the Macho content of the Galactic Halo from the EROS-2 Survey of the Magellanic Clouds |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=469 |issue=2 |pages=387–404 |year=2007 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20066017 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41714676 |arxiv=astro-ph/0607207 |bibcode=2007A&amp;A...469..387T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Graff |first1=D.S. |last2=Freese |first2=K. |title=Analysis of a ''Hubble Space Telescope'' Search for Red Dwarfs: Limits on Baryonic Matter in the Galactic Halo |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=456 |issue=1996 |page=L49 |year=1996 |arxiv=astro-ph/9507097 |bibcode=1996ApJ...456L..49G |doi=10.1086/309850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najita |first1=J.R. |last2=Tiede |first2=G.P. |last3=Carr |first3=J.S. |doi=10.1086/309477 |title=From Stars to Superplanets: The Low‐Mass Initial Mass Function in the Young Cluster IC 348 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=541 |issue=2 |pages=977–1003 |year=2000 |arxiv=astro-ph/0005290 |bibcode=2000ApJ...541..977N}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1106.2925 |title=The OGLE View of Microlensing towards the Magellanic Clouds.

=== Non-baryonic matter ===
Candidates for non-baryonic dark matter are hypothetical particles such as [[axion]]s, [[sterile neutrino]]s, [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs), [[gravitationally-interacting massive particles]] (GIMPs), [[supersymmetric]] particles, or [[primordial black holes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Overduin |first1=J.

Unlike baryonic matter, nonbaryonic matter did not contribute to the formation of the [[Chemical element|elements]] in the early universe ([[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Copi 1995&quot; /&gt; and so its presence is revealed only via its gravitational effects, or [[weak lensing]]. In addition, if the particles of which it is composed are supersymmetric, they can undergo [[annihilation]] interactions with themselves, possibly resulting in observable by-products such as [[gamma rays]] and neutrinos (indirect detection).&lt;ref name=&quot;bertone merritt&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bertone |first1=G. |last2=Merritt |first2=D. |title=Dark Matter Dynamics and Indirect Detection |year=2005 |journal=[[Modern Physics Letters A]] |volume=20 |issue=14 |pages=1021–1036 |arxiv=astro-ph/0504422 |bibcode=2005MPLA...20.1021B |doi=10.1142/S0217732305017391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter aggregation and dense dark matter objects===
If dark matter is composed of weakly-interacting particles, an obvious question is whether it can form objects equivalent to [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, or [[black hole]]s. Historically, the answer has been it cannot,&lt;ref name=&quot;curio&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/95-the-universe/galaxies/general-questions/508-are-there-any-dark-stars-or-dark-galaxies-made-of-dark-matter-advanced |date=1 February 2018 |title=Synopsis: A Way to Cool Dark Matter |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=051102 |quote=One widely held belief about dark matter is it cannot cool off by radiating energy. If it could, then it might bunch together and create compact objects in the same way baryonic matter forms planets, stars, and galaxies. Observations so far suggest dark matter doesn't do that – it resides only in diffuse halos ... As a result, it is extremely unlikely there are very dense objects like stars made out of entirely (or even mostly) dark matter. |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.051102 |pmid=29481169 |last1=Buckley |first1=Matthew R. |last2=Difranzo |first2=Anthony |arxiv=1707.03829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;siegel&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |author-link=Ethan Siegel |author=Siegel, Ethan |date=28 October 2016 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/10/28/why-doesnt-dark-matter-form-black-holes/#4e5014943de1 |title=Why doesn't dark matter form black holes? |magazine=Forbes }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of two factors:
;It lacks an efficient means to lose energy&lt;ref name=&quot;curio&quot; /&gt;: Ordinary matter forms dense objects because it has numerous ways to lose energy. Losing energy would be essential for object formation, because a particle that gains energy during compaction or falling &quot;inward&quot; under gravity, and cannot lose it any other way, will heat up and increase [[velocity]] and [[momentum]]. Dark matter appears to lack means to lose energy, simply because it is not capable of interacting strongly in other ways except through gravity. The [[virial theorem]] suggests that such a particle would not stay bound to the gradually forming object – as the object began to form and compact, the dark matter particles within it would speed up and tend to escape.
;It lacks a range of interactions needed to form structures&lt;ref name=&quot;siegel&quot; /&gt;: Ordinary matter interacts in many different ways. This allows the matter to form more complex structures. For example, stars form through gravity, but the particles within them interact and can emit energy in the form of [[neutrino]]s and [[electromagnetic radiation]] through [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] when they become energetic enough. [[Proton]]s and [[neutron]]s can bind via the [[strong interaction]] and then form [[atom]]s with [[electron]]s largely through [[electromagnetic interaction]]. But there is no evidence that dark matter is capable of such a wide variety of interactions, since it seems to only interact through gravity (and possibly through some means no stronger than the [[weak interaction]], although until dark matter is better understood, this is only hopeful speculation).

In 2015–2017 the idea dense dark matter was composed of [[primordial black hole]]s, made a comeback&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Adrian |title=Is dark matter made of black holes? |journal=Science |date=9 February 2017 |doi=10.1126/science.aal0721}}&lt;/ref&gt; following results of [[Gravitational wave|gravitation wave]] measurements which detected the merger of intermediate mass black holes. Black holes with about 30&amp;nbsp;solar masses are not predicted to form by either stellar collapse (typically less than 15&amp;nbsp;solar masses) or by the merger of black holes in galactic centers (millions or billions of solar masses). It was proposed the intermediate mass black holes causing the detected merger formed in the hot dense early phase of the universe due to denser regions collapsing. However this was later ruled out by a survey of about a thousand supernova which detected no gravitational lensing events, although about 8 would be expected if intermediate mass primordial black holes accounted for the majority of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astronomy.com/news/2018/10/can-black-holes-explain-dark-matter  |title=Black holes can't explain dark matter |publisher=astronomy.com |date=18 October 2018 |accessdate=7 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility atom-sized primordial black holes account for a significant fraction of dark matter was ruled out by measurements of positron and electron fluxes outside the Sun's heliosphere by the Voyager&amp;nbsp;1 spacecraft.

== Classification of dark matter: cold, warm, or hot ==
Dark matter can be divided into ''cold'', ''warm'', and ''hot'' categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Silk |title=The Big Bang: Third Edition |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XLwe1lUmz5kC |page=82}} |date=2000 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |isbn=978-0-8050-7256-3 |chapter=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories refer to velocity rather than an actual temperature, indicating how far corresponding objects moved due to random motions in the early universe, before they slowed due to cosmic expansion – this is an important distance called the ''[[free streaming]] length'' (FSL). Primordial density fluctuations smaller than this length get washed out as particles spread from overdense to underdense regions, while larger fluctuations are unaffected; therefore this length sets a minimum scale for later structure formation.

The categories are set with respect to the size of a [[protogalaxy]] (an object that later evolves into a [[dwarf galaxy]]): Dark matter particles are classified as cold, warm, or hot according to their FSL; much smaller (cold), similar to (warm), or much larger (hot) than a protogalaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=N. |last1=Vittorio |author2=J. Silk |date=1984 |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters |volume=285 |pages=L39–L43 |title=Fine-scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |doi=10.1086/184361 |bibcode=1984ApJ...285L..39V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Masayuki |last1=Umemura |author2=Satoru Ikeuchi |title=Formation of Subgalactic Objects within Two-Component Dark Matter |date=1985 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=299 |pages=583–592 |doi=10.1086/163726 |bibcode=1985ApJ...299..583U}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mixtures of the above are also possible: a theory of [[mixed dark matter]] was popular in the mid-1990s, but was rejected following the discovery of [[dark energy]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Cold dark matter leads to a bottom-up formation of structure with galaxies forming first and galaxy clusters at a latter stage, while hot dark matter would result in a top-down formation scenario with large matter aggregations forming early, later fragmenting into separate galaxies;{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} the latter is excluded by high-redshift galaxy observations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bertone hooper silk&quot; /&gt;

=== Alternative definitions ===
These categories also correspond to [[fluctuation spectrum]] effects and the interval following the Big Bang at which each type became non-relativistic. Davis ''et al.'' wrote in 1985:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=M. |author2=Efstathiou, G. |author3=Frenk, C.S. |author4=White, S.D.M. |title=The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=292 |date=15 May 1985 |pages=371–394 |doi=10.1086/163168 |bibcode=1985ApJ...292..371D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Candidate particles can be grouped into three categories on the basis of their effect on the [[Mixed dark matter|fluctuation spectrum]] (Bond ''et al.'' 1983). If the dark matter is composed of abundant light particles which remain relativistic until shortly before recombination, then it may be termed &quot;hot&quot;. The best candidate for hot dark matter is a neutrino ... A second possibility is for the dark matter particles to interact more weakly than neutrinos, to be less abundant, and to have a mass of order 1&amp;nbsp;keV. Such particles are termed &quot;warm dark matter&quot;, because they have lower thermal velocities than massive neutrinos ... there are at present few candidate particles which fit this description. [[Gravitino]]s and [[photino]]s have been suggested (Pagels and Primack 1982; Bond, Szalay and Turner 1982) ... Any particles which became nonrelativistic very early, and so were able to diffuse a negligible distance, are termed &quot;cold&quot; dark matter (CDM). There are many candidates for CDM including supersymmetric particles. |M. Davis, G. Efstathiou, C.S. Frenk, and S.D.M. White |The evolution of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by cold dark matter}}

Another approximate dividing line is warm dark matter became non-relativistic when the universe was approximately 1&amp;nbsp;year old and 1&amp;nbsp;millionth of its present size and in the [[radiation-dominated era]] (photons and neutrinos), with a photon temperature 2.7&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;Kelvins. Standard physical cosmology gives the [[particle horizon]] size as 2&amp;nbsp;''c&amp;nbsp;t'' (speed of light multiplied by time) in the radiation-dominated era, thus 2&amp;nbsp;light-years. A region of this size would expand to 2&amp;nbsp;million light-years today (absent structure formation). The actual FSL is approximately 5&amp;nbsp;times the above length, since it continues to grow slowly as particle velocities decrease inversely with the scale factor after they become non-relativistic. In this example the FSL would correspond to 10&amp;nbsp;million light-years, or 3&amp;nbsp;mega[[parsec]]s, today, around the size containing an average large galaxy.

The 2.7&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin (unit)|K]] photon temperature gives a typical photon energy of 250&amp;nbsp;electron-volts, thereby setting a typical mass scale for warm dark matter: particles much more massive than this, such as GeV–TeV mass [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]], would become non-relativistic much earlier than one year after the Big Bang and thus have FSLs much smaller than a protogalaxy, making them cold. Conversely, much lighter particles, such as neutrinos with masses of only a few eV, have FSLs much larger than a protogalaxy, thus qualifying them as hot.

=== Cold dark matter ===
{{Main|Cold dark matter}}
[[Cold dark matter]] offers the simplest explanation for most cosmological observations. It is dark matter composed of constituents with an FSL much smaller than a protogalaxy. This is the focus for dark matter research, as hot dark matter does not seem capable of supporting galaxy or galaxy cluster formation, and most particle candidates slowed early.

The constituents of cold dark matter are unknown. Possibilities range from large objects like MACHOs (such as black holes&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=M.R.S. |title=The case for primordial black holes as dark matter |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18890.x |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=415 |issue=3 |pages=2744–2757 |year=2011 |arxiv=1106.3875 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.415.2744H}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Preon star]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Phys.Lett.B616,1(2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hansson |first1=J. |last2=Sandin |first2=F. |year=2005 |title=Preon stars: a new class of cosmic compact objects |journal=[[Physics Letters B]] |volume=616 |issue= 1–2|pages=1–7 |arxiv=astro-ph/0410417 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2005.04.034 |bibcode=2005PhLB..616....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or [[Robust associations of massive baryonic objects|RAMBOs]] (such as clusters of brown dwarfs), to new particles such as [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]] and [[axion]]s.

The 1997 [[DAMA/NaI]] experiment and its successor [[DAMA/LIBRA]] in 2013, claimed to directly detect dark matter particles passing through the Earth, but many researchers remain skeptical, as negative results from similar experiments seem incompatible with the DAMA results.

=== Warm dark matter ===
{{Main|Warm dark matter}}
[[Warm dark matter]] comprises particles with an FSL comparable to the size of a protogalaxy. Predictions based on warm dark matter are similar to those for cold dark matter on large scales, but with less small-scale density perturbations. This reduces the predicted abundance of dwarf galaxies and may lead to lower density of dark matter in the central parts of large galaxies. Some researchers consider this a better fit to observations. A challenge for this model is the lack of particle candidates with the required mass ≈&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;eV to 3000&amp;nbsp;eV.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

No known particles can be categorized as warm dark matter. A postulated candidate is the [[sterile neutrino]]: A heavier, slower form of neutrino that does not interact through the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], unlike other neutrinos. Some modified gravity theories, such as [[scalar–tensor–vector gravity]], require &quot;warm&quot; dark matter to make their equations work.

=== Hot dark matter ===
{{Main|Hot dark matter}}
[[Hot dark matter]] consists of particles whose FSL is much larger than the size of a protogalaxy. The [[neutrino]] qualifies as such particle. They were discovered independently, long before the hunt for dark matter: they were postulated in 1930, and [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment|detected in 1956]]. Neutrinos' [[Neutrino mass|mass]] is less than 10{{sup|−6}} that of an [[electron]]. Neutrinos interact with normal matter only via gravity and the [[Weak interaction|weak force]], making them difficult to detect (the weak force only works over a small distance, thus a neutrino triggers a weak force event only if it hits a nucleus head-on). This makes them 'weakly interacting light particles' (WILPs), as opposed to WIMPs.

The three known [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavours]] of neutrinos are the ''electron'', ''muon'', and ''tau''. Their masses are slightly different. Neutrinos oscillate among the flavours as they move. It is hard to determine an exact [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]] on the collective average mass of the three neutrinos (or for any of the three individually). For example, if the average neutrino mass were over 50&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]]/c{{sup|2}} (less than 10{{sup|−5}} of the mass of an electron), the universe would collapse. CMB data and other methods indicate that their average mass probably does not exceed 0.3&amp;nbsp;eV/c{{sup|2}}. Thus, observed neutrinos cannot explain dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/neutrinos.html |title=Neutrinos as dark matter |publisher=Astro.ucla.edu |date=21 September 1998 |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because galaxy-size density fluctuations get washed out by free-streaming, hot dark matter implies the first objects that can form are huge [[supercluster]]-size pancakes, which then fragment into galaxies. [[List of deep fields|Deep-field observations]] show instead that galaxies formed first, followed by clusters and superclusters as galaxies clump together.

== Detection of dark matter particles ==
If dark matter is made up of sub-atomic particles, then millions, possibly billions, of such particles must pass through every square centimeter of the Earth each second.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaitskell 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gaitskell |first=Richard J. |title=Direct Detection of Dark Matter |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |volume=54 |pages=315–359 |bibcode=2004ARNPS..54..315G |date=2004 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.54.070103.181244|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d08621a644452daa37b264eba1a825a9b266efe5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Number per second&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Neutralino Dark Matter |url=http://www.picassoexperiment.ca/dm_neutralino.php |accessdate=26 December 2011}}

Although [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]] are popular search candidates,&lt;ref name=&quot;bertone hooper silk&quot; /&gt; the [[Axion Dark Matter Experiment]] (ADMX) searches for [[axion]]s. Another candidate is heavy [[hidden sector]] particles which only interact with ordinary matter via gravity.

These experiments can be divided into two classes: direct detection experiments, which search for the scattering of dark matter particles off atomic nuclei within a detector; and indirect detection, which look for the products of dark matter particle annihilations or decays.&lt;ref name=&quot;bertone merritt&quot; /&gt;

=== Direct detection ===
{{details|Weakly interacting massive particles#Direct detection}}
Direct detection experiments aim to observe low-energy recoils (typically a few [[keV]]s) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are passing through the Earth. After such a recoil the nucleus will emit energy in the form of [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] light or [[phonon]]s, as they pass through sensitive detection apparatus. To do this effectively, it is crucial to maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from [[cosmic ray]]s. Examples of underground laboratories with direct detection experiments include the [[Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory|Stawell mine]], the [[Soudan mine]], the [[SNOLAB]] underground laboratory at [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], the [[Gran Sasso National Laboratory]], the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]], the [[Boulby Underground Laboratory]], the [[Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory]] and the [[China Jinping Underground Laboratory]].

These experiments mostly use either cryogenic or noble liquid detector technologies. Cryogenic detectors operating at temperatures below 100&amp;nbsp;mK, detect the heat produced when a particle hits an atom in a crystal absorber such as [[germanium]]. [[Noble gas|Noble liquid]] detectors detect [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] produced by a particle collision in liquid [[xenon]] or [[argon]]. Cryogenic detector experiments include: [[Cryogenic Dark Matter Search|CDMS]], [[Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting Thermometers|CRESST]], [[EDELWEISS]], [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]]. Noble liquid experiments include ZEPLIN, [[XENON]], [[DEAP]], [[ArDM]], [[WIMP Argon Programme|WARP]], [[DarkSide]], [[PandaX]], and LUX, the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment]]. Both of these techniques focus strongly on their ability to distinguish background particles (which predominantly scatter off electrons) from dark matter particles (that scatter off nuclei). Other experiments include [[SIMPLE (dark matter)|SIMPLE]] and [[PICASSO (dark matter)|PICASSO]].

Currently there has been no well-established claim of dark matter detection from a direct detection experiment, leading instead to strong upper limits on the mass and interaction cross section with nucleons of such dark matter particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drees |first1=M. |last2=Gerbier |first2=G. |title=Dark Matter |journal=Chin.

For example, in regions of high dark matter density (e.g., the [[Galactic Center|centre of our galaxy]]) two dark matter particles could [[Annihilation|annihilate]] to produce [[gamma ray]]s or Standard Model particle-antiparticle pairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bertone2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Gianfranco |last=Bertone |title=Particle Dark Matter: Observations, Models and Searches |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkUgAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;pg=PA83 |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=83–104 |chapter=Dark Matter at the Centers of Galaxies |arxiv=1001.3706 |isbn=978-0-521-76368-4 |bibcode=2010arXiv1001.3706M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, if the dark matter particle is unstable, it could decay into Standard Model (or other) particles.

A few of the dark matter particles passing through the Sun or Earth may scatter off atoms and lose energy. Thus dark matter may accumulate at the center of these bodies, increasing the chance of collision/annihilation. This could produce a distinctive signal in the form of high-energy [[neutrino]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0370-2693(86)90349-7 |author=Freese, K. |title=Can Scalar Neutrinos or Massive Dirac Neutrinos be the Missing Mass? |journal=Physics Letters B |volume=167 |issue=3 |pages=295–300 |date=1986 |bibcode=1986PhLB..167..295F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a signal would be strong indirect proof of WIMP dark matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;bertone hooper silk&quot; /&gt; High-energy neutrino telescopes such as [[Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array|AMANDA]], [[IceCube]] and [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] are searching for this signal.{{sfn|Randall|2015|p=298}}

Many experimental searches have been undertaken to look for such emission from dark matter annihilation or decay, examples of which follow.
The [[Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope]] observed more gamma rays in 2008 than expected from the [[Milky Way]], but scientists concluded this was most likely due to incorrect estimation of the telescope's sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The likely cause of the EGRET GeV anomaly and its implications |journal=Astroparticle Physics |volume=29 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=25–29 |doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2007.11.002 |arxiv=0705.4311 |first1=F.W. |last1=Stecker |last2=Hunter |first2=S. |last3=Kniffen |first3=D. |bibcode=2008APh....29...25S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collider searches for dark matter ===
An alternative approach to the detection of dark matter particles in nature is to produce them in a laboratory. Experiments with the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) may be able to detect dark matter particles produced in collisions of the LHC [[proton]] beams. Because a dark matter particle should have negligible interactions with normal visible matter, it may be detected indirectly as (large amounts of) missing energy and momentum that escape the detectors, provided other (non-negligible) collision products are detected.&lt;ref name=&quot;kane watson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kane, G. |author2=Watson, S. |title=Dark Matter and LHC:. what is the Connection? |journal=Modern Physics Letters A |year=2008 |volume=23 |pages=2103–2123 |doi=10.1142/S0217732308028314 |bibcode=2008MPLA...23.2103K |arxiv=0807.2244 |issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constraints on dark matter also exist from the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider|LEP]] experiment using a similar principle, but probing the interaction of dark matter particles with electrons rather than quarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=P.J. |last2=Harnik |first2=R. |last3=Kopp |first3=J. |last4=Tsai |first4=Y. |title=LEP Shines Light on Dark Matter |journal=Phys.

== Alternative hypotheses ==
{{More|Alternatives to general relativity}}
Because dark matter has not yet been conclusively identified, many other hypotheses have emerged aiming to explain the observational phenomena that dark matter was conceived to explain. The most common method is to modify general relativity. General relativity is well-tested on solar system scales, but its validity on galactic or cosmological scales has not been well proven. A suitable modification to general relativity can conceivably eliminate the need for dark matter. The best-known theories of this class are [[MOND]] and its relativistic generalization [[tensor-vector-scalar gravity]] (TeVeS),&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The failures of the Standard Model of Cosmology require a new paradigm |author1=Kroupa, Pavel |display-authors=etal |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |date=December 2012 |volume=21 |issue=4 |page=1230003 |doi=10.1142/S0218271812300030 |arxiv=1301.3907 |bibcode=2012IJMPD..2130003K}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[f(R) gravity]],&lt;ref&gt;For a review, see: {{cite journal |title=The dark matter problem from f(R) gravity viewpoint |author=Salvatore Capozziello |author2=Mariafelicia De Laurentis |journal=Annalen der Physik |date=October 2012 |volume=524 |issue=9–10 |page=545 |doi=10.1002/andp.201200109 |bibcode = 2012AnP...524..545C}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[negative mass]] [[dark fluid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2018-12-05-bringing-balance-universe | title=Bringing balance to the Universe |publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-12-universe-theory-percent-cosmos.html | title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |publisher=Phys.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Farnes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. | title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified ΛCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |volume=620 |page=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&amp;A...620A..92F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[entropic gravity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;physorgnewtheory&quot;&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Delta Institute for Theoretical Physics |title=New theory of gravity might explain dark matter |url=https://phys.org/news/2016-11-theory-gravity-dark.html |website=phys.org |date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternatives to general relativity|Alternative theories]] abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Alternatives to dark matter and dark energy |first=Phillip D. |last=Mannheim |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=340–445 |doi=10.1016/j.ppnp.2005.08.001 |arxiv=astro-ph/0505266 |date=April 2006 |bibcode=2006PrPNP..56..340M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Beyond the Cosmological Standard Model |first1=Austin |last1=Joyce |display-authors=etal |journal=Physics Reports |date=March 2015 |volume=568 |pages=1–98 |doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2014.12.002 |arxiv=1407.0059 |bibcode=2015PhR...568....1J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem with alternative hypotheses is observational evidence for dark matter comes from so many independent approaches (see the &quot;observational evidence&quot; section above). Explaining any individual observation is possible but explaining all of them is very difficult. Nonetheless, there have been some scattered successes for alternative hypotheses, such as a 2016 test of gravitational lensing in entropic gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html |title=Verlinde's new theory of gravity passes first test |date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=First test of Verlinde's theory of Emergent Gravity using Weak Gravitational Lensing measurements |first1=Margot M. |last1=Brouwer |display-authors=etal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume= 466|issue=to appear |date=11 December 2016 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw3192 |arxiv=1612.03034 |pages=2547–2559 |bibcode = 2017MNRAS.466.2547B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2116446-first-test-of-rival-to-einsteins-gravity-kills-off-dark-matter/ |title=First test of rival to Einstein's gravity kills off dark matter |date=15 December 2016 |accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing opinion among most astrophysicists is while modifications to general relativity can conceivably explain part of the observational evidence, there is probably enough data to conclude there must be some form of dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2012/05/09/dark-matter-vs-modified-gravity-a-trialogue/ |title=Dark matter vs. modified gravity: A trialogue |author-link=Sean M.

==In philosophy of science==
In [[philosophy of science]], dark matter is an example of an auxiliary hypothesis, an [[Ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc]] postulate added to a theory in response to observations which [[falsifiability|falsify]] it. It has been argued the dark matter hypothesis is a [[conventionalism#Epistemology|conventionalist]] hypothesis, that is, a hypothesis which adds no empirical content and hence is unfalsifiable in the sense defined by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Merritt |first1=David |title=Cosmology and convention |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |date=February 2017 |volume=57 |issue=2017 |pages=41–52 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2016.12.002 |arxiv=1703.02389 |bibcode=2017SHPMP..57...41M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
