'''Dalhousie University''' (commonly known as '''Dal''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, with three campuses in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], a fourth in [[Bible Hill, Nova Scotia|Bible Hill]], and medical teaching facilities in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]]. Dalhousie offers more than 4,000 courses, and 180 degree programs in twelve undergraduate, graduate, and professional faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dalhousie University|url=http://www.aucc.ca/canadian-universities/our-universities/dalhousie-university-2/|access-date=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115305/http://www.aucc.ca/canadian-universities/our-universities/dalhousie-university-2/|archive-date=26 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is a member of the [[U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities|U15]], a group of research-intensive universities in Canada.

Dalhousie was established as a [[nonsectarian]] college in 1818 by the eponymous [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]], [[George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie]]. The college did not hold its first class until 1838, until then operating sporadically due to financial difficulties. It reopened for a third time in 1863 following a reorganization that brought a change of name to &quot;The Governors of Dalhousie College and University&quot;. The university formally changed its name to &quot;Dalhousie University&quot; in 1997 through the same provincial legislation that merged the institution with the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]].

There are currently two [[students' union|student unions]] that represent student interests at the university: the [[Dalhousie Student Union]] and the Dalhousie Association for Graduate Students. Dalhousie's varsity teams, the Tigers, compete in the [[Atlantic University Sport]] conference of [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]]. Dalhousie's Faculty of Agriculture varsity teams are called the Dalhousie Rams, and compete in the [[Atlantic Collegiate Athletic Association|ACAA]] and [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association|CCAA]]. Dalhousie is a [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] university with more than 18,000 students and 130,000 alumni around the world. The university's notable alumni include a Nobel Prize winner, 91 [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]], and a range of other top government officials, academics, and business leaders.

==History==
Dalhousie was founded as the [[Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia]] [[George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie]] desired a non-denominational college in Halifax. Financing largely came from customs duties collected by a previous Lieutenant Governor, [[John Coape Sherbrooke]], during the [[War of 1812]] occupation of [[Castine, Maine]];{{efn|The British named the colony [[New Ireland (Maine)|New Ireland]].}} Sherbrooke invested [[Pound sterling|GBP£]]7,000 as an initial endowment and reserved £3,000 for the physical construction of the college.{{sfn|Waite|1997|p=10}} The college was established in 1818, though it faltered shortly after as Ramsay left Halifax to serve as the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General of British North America]].&lt;ref name=dalhis&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/about/history_tradition.html|title=History &amp; Tradition|publisher=Dalhousie University|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was structured upon the principles of the [[University of Edinburgh]], where lectures were open to all, regardless of religion or nationality. The University of Edinburgh was located near Ramsay's home in Scotland.{{sfn|Waite|1994|p=18}}

In 1821 Dalhousie College was officially incorporated by the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] under the 1821 Act of Incorporation.{{sfn|Waite|1997|p=23}} The college did not hold its first class until 1838; operation of the college was intermittent and no degrees were awarded.&lt;ref name=dalhis /&gt; In 1841 an Act of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly conferred university powers on Dalhousie.{{sfn|Murray|2010|p=3}}
[[File:Dalhousie Square, Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|left|Dalhousie Square. A winter scene depicting men and women in their sleighs in front of Dalhousie College, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1851.]]
In 1863 the college opened for a third time and was reorganized by another legislative act, which added &quot;University&quot; to the school's name: &quot;The Governors of Dalhousie College and University&quot;.{{sfn|Waite|1994|p=95}}&lt;ref name=dalsta&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boardofgovernors.dal.ca/Files/Unoff_Consol-Statutes.pdf|title=Summary and unofficial consolidation of the statutes relating to Dalhousie University|publisher=Dalhousie University|date=February 2005|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dalhousie reopened with six professors and one tutor.  When it awarded its first degrees in 1866 the student body consisted of 28 students working toward degrees and 28 occasional students.&lt;ref name=dalhis /&gt; The first female graduate was Margaret Florence Newcome from [[Grafton, Nova Scotia]], who earned her degree in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=6649&amp;pid=0\ Cornwallis Reformed Presbyterian Covenanter Church, ''Canada's Historic Places Initiative'']&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reorganization and an increase in students, money continued to be a problem for the institution. In 1879, amid talks of closure due to the university's dire financial situation, [[George Munro (philanthropist)|George Munro]], a wealthy New York publisher with Nova Scotian roots, began to donate to the university; Munro was brother-in-law to Dalhousie's Board of Governors member [[John Forrest (Canadian clergyman)|John Forrest]]. As such, Munro is credited with rescuing Dalhousie from closure. In honour of his contributions, Dalhousie observes a university holiday called George Munro Day on the first Friday of each February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/about/history_tradition/george_munro_day.html|title=George Munro Day|publisher=Dalhousie University|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally located at the space now occupied by [[Halifax City Hall]], the college moved in 1886 to Carleton Campus and spread gradually to Studley Campus.&lt;ref name=dalhis /&gt; Dalhousie grew steadily during the 20th century. From 1889 to 1962 the [[Maritime Conservatory of Performing Arts|Halifax Conservatory]] was affiliated with and awarded degrees through Dalhousie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002215|title=Maritime Conservatory of Performing Arts|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=The Historica Dominion Institute|year=2011|accessdate=30 June 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608173821/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002215|archivedate=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 several buildings were destroyed by fire on the campus of the [[University of King's College]] in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]]. Through a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], King's College relocated to Halifax and entered into a partnership with Dalhousie that continues to this day.&lt;ref name=kinhi&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ukings.ca/campus-community/about-kings/history/ |title=History |publisher=University of King's College |accessdate=March 24, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalhousie expanded on April 1, 1997 when provincial legislation mandated an amalgamation with the nearby [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]]. This merger saw reorganization of faculties and departments to create the [[Faculty of Engineering, Dalhousie University|Faculty of Engineering]], [[Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University|Faculty of Computer Science]] and the Faculty of Architecture and Planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.dal.ca/About%20Us/History.php|title=Notes on Engineering and the Origins of the Nova Scotia Technical College|publisher=Dalhousie University|date=7 October 2005|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2000, the Technical University of Nova Scotia operated as a constituent college of Dalhousie called Dalhousie Polytechnic of Nova Scotia (DalTech) until the collegiate system was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.dal.ca/DUASC/FindingAids/UA_10/|title=The Archives of the Technical University of Nova Scotia: A Guide|publisher=Dalhousie University|date=April 2005|accessdate=1 June 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130407141225/http://www.library.dal.ca/DUASC/FindingAids/UA_10/|archive-date=7 April 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation that merged the two schools also formally changed the name of the institution to its present form, Dalhousie University.&lt;ref name=&quot;nslegislature.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/daltech.htm|title=Dalhousie-Technical University Amalgamation Act|publisher=Office of the Legislative Counsel, Nova Scotia House of Assembly|date=8 June 1998|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 September 2012 the [[Nova Scotia Agricultural College]] merged into Dalhousie to form a new [[Faculty of Agriculture, Dalhousie University|Faculty of Agriculture]], located in [[Bible Hill, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dal name hailed in Bible Hill&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/132032-dal-name-hailed-in-bible-hill|title=Dal name hailed in Bible Hill|publisher=Chronicle Herald|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2011/05/20/ns-dalhousie-agricultural-merger.html|title=Dalhousie, Agricultural College discuss merger|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
[[File:Dalhousie University Medjuck Building.jpg|thumbnail|The Faculty of Architecture and Planning building is located at Sexton Campus. Sexton was the former campus of the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] before its merger with Dalhousie in 1997.]]
Dalhousie has three campuses within the [[Halifax Peninsula]] and a fourth, the Agricultural Campus, in Bible Hill, Nova Scotia.

Studley Campus in Halifax serves as the primary campus; it houses the majority of the university's academic buildings such as faculties, athletic facilities, and the university's Student Union Building.&lt;ref name=camp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/about/halifax-campuses.html|title=Halifax Campuses|publisher=Dalhousie University|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus is largely surrounded by residential neighbourhoods.

[[Robie Street]] divides it from the adjacent Carleton Campus, which houses the faculties of dentistry, medicine, and other health profession departments. The campus is adjacent to two large teaching hospitals affiliated with the school: the [[IWK Health Centre]] and the [[Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre]].&lt;ref name=camp /&gt;

Sexton Campus in [[Downtown Halifax]] hosts the engineering, architecture and planning faculties. Sexton Campus served as the campus of the Technical University of Nova Scotia prior to amalgamation.&lt;ref name=camp /&gt; The Agricultural Campus in Bible Hill, a suburban community of [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]], served as the campus for the Nova Scotia Agricultural College prior to its merger with Dalhousie in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/about/agricultural-campus/about.html|title=About - Agricultural Campus|publisher=Dalhousie University|accessdate=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university presently operates the largest academic library system in [[Atlantic Canada]], and hosts the headquarters for the [[Ocean Tracking Network]].

The buildings at Dalhousie vary in age from Hart House, which was completed in 1864, to the Collaborative Health Education Building, completed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.dal.ca/duasc/buildings/chron.htm|title=The Buildings of Dalhousie University|accessdate=10 May 2013|publisher=Dalhousie University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127154720/http://www.library.dal.ca/duasc/buildings/chron.htm|archive-date=27 January 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reeder|first1=Matt|title=A hub to support health care's collaborative future|url=https://www.dal.ca/news/2015/12/02/a-space-to-support-health-care-s-collaborative-future.html|work=Dal News|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original building of Dalhousie University was completed in 1824 on Halifax's [[Grand Parade (Halifax)|Grand Parade]].&lt;ref name=orib&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.dal.ca/duasc/buildings/DalCollege.htm|title=Dalhousie College, Original (Grand Parade)|publisher=Dalhousie University|accessdate=10 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218120839/http://www.library.dal.ca/duasc/buildings/DalCollege.htm|archive-date=18 February 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was demolished in 1885 when the university outgrew the premises, and the City of Halifax sought possession of the entire Grand Parade. [[Halifax City Hall]] presently occupies the site of the original Dalhousie College.&lt;ref name=orib /&gt;

University governance is conducted through the Board of Governors and the Senate, both of which were given much of their present power in the Unofficial Consolidation of an Act for the Regulation and Support of Dalhousie College in Chapter 24 of the Acts of 1863. This statute replaced ones from 1820, 1823, 1838, 1841 and 1848, and has since been supplemented 11 times, most recently in 1995.&lt;ref name=dalsta /&gt; The Board is responsible for conduct, management, and control of the university and of its property, revenues, business, and affairs. Board members, known as Governors of the Board, include the university's chancellor, president, and 25 other members. Members include people from within the university community such as four approved representatives from Dalhousie Student Union, and those in the surrounding community, such as the [[Mayor of Halifax]].&lt;ref name=dalsta /&gt; The Senate is responsible for the university's academics, including standards for admission and qualifications for degrees, diplomas, and certificates.&lt;ref name=dalsta /&gt; The Senate consists of 73 positions granted to the various faculty representatives, academic administrators, and student representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.dal.ca/Membership/Senators.php|title=2011 - 2012 Membership Senators|publisher=Dalhousie University|date=13 July 2011|accessdate=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Affiliated institutions===
[[File:Panorama Kings 2.jpg|thumb|left|The campus of [[University of King's College]], located adjacent to Dalhousie's Studley campus. The institution has been affiliated with Dalhousie since the 1920s.]]
[[University of King's College]] is a post-secondary institution in Halifax affiliated with Dalhousie. The institution's campus is located adjacent to Dalhousie's Studley campus. Established in 1789, it was the first post-secondary institution in [[English Canada]] and the oldest English-speaking Commonwealth university outside the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=kinhi/&gt; The University of King's College was formerly an independent institution located in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]], until 1920, when a fire ravaged its campus. To continue operation, the University of King's College accepted a generous grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], although the terms of the grant required that it move to Halifax and enter into association with Dalhousie.&lt;ref name=kinhi /&gt; Under the agreement, King's agreed to pay the salaries of a number of Dalhousie professors, who in turn were to help in the management and academic life of the college. 

Students at King's have access to all of the amenities Dalhousie, and academic programs at King's would fold into the College of Arts and Sciences at Dalhousie according to the agreement.&lt;ref name=kinhi /&gt; Presently, students of both institutions are allowed to switch between the two throughout their enrolment. In spite of the shared academic programs and facilities, the University of King's College maintains its own scholarships, bursaries, athletics programs, and student residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukings.ca/kings-dalhousie|title=King's and Dalhousie - University of King's College|publisher=University of King's College|year=2013|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2018 Dalplex, Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.jpg|left|thumb|Dalplex is the largest fitness and recreational centre operated by the university.]]

As of 2010, through the efforts of alumni and devoted volunteers, the Dalhousie Football Club was reinstated.  Playing in the [[Atlantic Football League]] (AFL), the team operates on donations and registration from its players.  The team plays its home games at Wickwire Field. Additionally, the university boasts the first [[Muggle quidditch|quidditch]] team in Atlantic Canada. As of 2014, the Dalhousie Tigers Quidditch varsity club is the top-ranked team in the area and, though still developing, is showing great promise for regional and national bids in the future.

== Insignia and other representations ==

===Seal===
The Dalhousie seal is based on the [[Coat of arms|heraldic achievement]] of the [[Clan Ramsay]] of Scotland, of which founder George Ramsay was clan head. The heraldic achievement consists of five parts: shield, coronet, crest, supporters, and motto. One major difference between the Ramsay coat of arms and the university seal is that the Ramsay seal features a [[griffin]] and [[greyhound]], and the Dalhousie seal has two dragons supporting the eagle-adorned shield.&lt;ref name=seal&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/about/mission_vision.html|title=Mission &amp; Vision|publisher=Dalhousie University|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Ramsay coat of arms was used to identify Dalhousie, but the seal has evolved with the amalgamations the university has undergone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dal.ca/academics/convocation/ceremonies/tradition_history.html|title=Traditions and History|publisher=Dalhousie University|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seal was originally silver-coloured, but in 1950, the university's Board of Governors changed it to gold to match the university's colours, gold and black.  These colours were adopted in 1887, after the rugby team led the debate about college colours for football jerseys.{{sfn|Waite|1997|p=128}} The shield and eagle of Dalhousie's seal have been used as the logo since 1987, with the present incarnation in use since 2003, which includes the tagline &quot;inspiring minds&quot;.&lt;ref name=seal /&gt;

===Motto and song===
The university motto {{lang|la|Ora et Labora}} translates from Latin as &quot;pray and work&quot;; it adopted in 1870 from the [[Earl of Dalhousie]]'s motto to replace the university's original one, which the administration believed did not convey confidence.{{sfn|Waite|1997|p=98}} The original motto was {{lang|la|Forsan}}, which translates as ''Perhaps'', and first appeared in the first ''Dalhousie Gazette'' of 1869. It was from [[Virgil]]'s [[Epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Aeneid]]'', Book&amp;nbsp;1, line 203, {{lang|la|Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit}}, which translates as &quot;Perhaps the time may come when these difficulties will be sweet to remember&quot;.{{sfn|Waite|1997|p=128}}

A number of songs are commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement, convocation, and athletic contests, including &quot;Carmina Dalhousiana&quot;, written in Halifax in 1882.  The Dalhousie University songbook was compiled by Charles B. Weikel in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000759SUBReadings|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822034612/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000759SUBReadings|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 August 2007|title=College Songs and Songbooks|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|last=Green|first=Rebecca|publisher=The Historica Foundation of Canada|year=2012|accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
