It is listed as [[Endangered]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] as populations are decreasing and are estimated at fewer than 2,500 adults. Factors contributing to this decline include habitat loss, loss of prey, competition with other species, persecution due to livestock predation and disease transfer from [[domestic dog]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;iucn&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology and naming==
The [[etymology]] of &quot;dhole&quot; is unclear. The possible earliest written use of the word in English occurred in 1808 by soldier Thomas Williamson, who encountered the animal in [[Ramgarh district|Ramghur district]]. He stated that ''dhole'' was a common local name for the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Williamson, T. |year=1808 |title=Oriental field sports: being a complete, detailed, and accurate description of the wild sports of the East|volume=II|publisher=Orme |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BlcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, [[Charles Hamilton Smith]] claimed that it was derived from a language spoken in 'various parts of the East'.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith1827&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, C.

Two years later, Smith connected this word with {{lang-tr|[[wikt:deli#Turkish|deli]]}} 'mad, crazy', and erroneously compared the Turkish word with {{lang-osx|[[wikt:dol#Old English|dol]]}} and {{lang-nl|[[wikt:dol#Dutch|dol]]}} (cfr. also {{lang-en|[[wikt:dull#English|dull]]}}; {{lang-de|[[wikt:toll#German|toll]]}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;smith1839&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, C.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

&lt;!-- The species was first described in European literature in 1794 by the Russian traveler and surveyor Pesterev, who encountered dholes during his travels in the [[Russian Far East]]. He described the animal as being a regular pack hunter of [[Alpine ibex]], and of bearing many similarities with the [[golden jackal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pesterev |first1=E. |year=1794 |title= |journal=Journ. von Russland |volume= |issue= |page=24 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not relevant for taxonomy--&gt;
''Canis alpinus'' was the [[binomial name]] proposed by [[Peter Simon Pallas]] in 1811, who described its range as encompassing the upper levels of Udskoi Ostrog in [[Amurland]], towards the eastern side and in the region of the upper [[Lena River]], around the [[Yenisei]] River and occasionally crossing into [[China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pallas1811&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Pallas, P.

''Canis primaevus'' was a name proposed by [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]] in 1833 who thought that the dhole is a primitive ''Canis'' form and the [[progenitor]] of the [[domestic dog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hodgson, B. H. |year=1833 |title=Description and Characters of the Wild Dog of the Himalaya (''Canis primævus'') |journal=Asiatic Researches |volume=XVIII |issue=2 |pages=221–237, 235 |url=https://archive.org/stream/asiaticresearche181833cal#page/220/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgson later took note of the dhole's physical distinctiveness from the genus ''Canis'' and proposed the genus ''Cuon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hodgson, B. H. |year=1842 |url=https://archive.org/stream/calcuttajournalo02mccl#page/204/mode/2up |title=European notices of Indian canines, with further illustrations of the new genus ''Cuon'' vel ''Chrysæus'' |journal=Calcutta Journal of Natural History |volume=II |pages=205–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first study on the origins of the species was conducted by paleontologist Erich Thenius, who concluded that the dhole was a post-Pleistocene descendant of a golden jackal-like ancestor.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenius1954&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thenius, E. |year=1955 |title=Zur Abstammung der Rotwölfe (Gattung ''Cuon'' Hodgson) |trans-title=On the origins of the dholes (Genus ''Cuon'' Hodgson) |journal=Österreichische Zoologische Zeitschrift |volume=5 |pages=377–388 |url=http://www.landesmuseum.at/pdf_frei_remote/OEZ_05_0377-0387.pdf |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known member of the genus ''Cuon'' is the Chinese ''Cuon majori'' of the [[Villafranchian]] period. It resembled ''Canis'' in its physical form more than the modern species, which has greatly reduced [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, whose [[Cusp (anatomy)|cusp]]s have developed into sharply trenchant points. By the Middle Pleistocene, ''C. majori'' had lost the last lower molar altogether. ''C. alpinus'' itself arose during the late Middle Pleistocene, by which point the transformation of the lower molar into a single cusped, slicing tooth had been completed.

[[European dhole|Late Middle Pleistocene dhole]]s were virtually indistinguishable from their modern descendants, save for their greater size, which closely approached that of the [[Wolf|gray wolf]].

The dhole's distinctive morphology has been a source of much confusion in determining the species' systematic position among the Canidae. [[George Gaylord Simpson|George Simpson]] placed the dhole in the [[subfamily]] Simocyoninae alongside the [[African wild dog]] and the [[bush dog]], on account of all three species' similar dentition.&lt;ref name=&quot;simpson1945&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simpson, G.G. |year=1945 |title=The principles of classification and a classification of mammals |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=85 |pages=1–350|hdl=2246/1104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent authors, including [[Juliet Clutton-Brock]], noted greater morphological similarities to canids of the genera ''Canis'', ''[[Dusicyon]]'', and ''[[Arctic fox|Alopex]]'' than to either ''[[Speothos]]'' or ''[[Lycaon (genus)|Lycaon]]'', with any resemblance to the latter two being due to [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cluttonbrock1976&quot;/&gt;

Some authors consider the extinct ''Canis'' [[subgenus]] named ''[[Xenocyon]]'' as ancestral to both the genus ''Lycaon'' and the genus ''Cuon''.&lt;ref name=moulle2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=baryshnikov2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=cherin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=wang2008/&gt;{{rp|p149}} Subsequent studies on the canid [[genome]] revealed that the dhole and African wild dog are closely related to members of the genus ''Canis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;lindblad-toh2005&quot;/&gt; This closeness to ''Canis'' may have been confirmed in a menagerie in [[Madras]], where according to zoologist [[Reginald Innes Pocock|Reginald Pocock]] there is a record of a dhole interbred with a golden jackal.&lt;ref name=Pocock1941/&gt;

=== Admixture with the African wild dog ===
In 2018, [[whole genome sequencing]] was used to compare all members (apart from the black-backed and side-striped jackals) of the genus ''Canis'', along with the dhole and the [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus''). There was strong evidence of ancient [[genetic admixture]] between the dhole and the African wild dog. Today, their ranges are remote from each other; however, during the [[Pleistocene]] era the dhole could be found as far west as Europe. The study proposes that the dhole's distribution may have once included the [[Middle East]], from where it may have admixed with the African wild dog in [[North Africa]]. However, there is no evidence of the dhole having existed in the Middle East nor North Africa.&lt;ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/&gt;{{clear}}

===Subspecies===
Historically, up to 10 subspecies of dholes have been recognised.&lt;ref name=&quot;ellerman1966&quot;&gt;Ellerman, J.R. &amp; Morrison-Scott, T.C.S. (1966).

However, studies on the dhole's [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] and [[microsatellite]] genotype showed no clear subspecific distinctions. Nevertheless, two major phylogeographic groupings were discovered in dholes of the Asian mainland, which likely diverged during a [[Glacial period|glaciation event]]. One population extends from South, Central and North India (south of the Ganges) into Burma, and the other extends from India north of the Ganges into northeastern India, Burma, Thailand and the Malaysian Peninsula. The origin of dholes in Sumatra and Java is, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, unclear, as they show greater relatedness to dholes in India, Burma and China rather than with those in nearby Malaysia. In the absence of further data, the researchers involved in the study speculated that Javan and Sumatran dholes could have been introduced to the islands by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iyengar, A. |author2=Babu, V.

In appearance, the dhole has been variously described as combining the physical characteristics of the gray [[wolf]] and the [[red fox]],&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; and as being &quot;cat-like&quot; on account of its long backbone and slender limbs.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenius1954&quot;/&gt; It has a wide and massive skull with a well-developed [[sagittal crest]],&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; and its [[masseter muscle]]s are highly developed compared to other canid species, giving the face an almost [[hyena]]-like appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;f61_2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=61–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] is shorter than that of domestic dogs and most other canids.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen1978&quot;/&gt; The species has six rather than seven lower [[Molar (tooth)|molars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;f41&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper molars are weak, being one third to one half the size of those of wolves and have only one [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]] as opposed to between two and four, as is usual in canids,&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; an adaptation thought to improve shearing ability, thus allowing it to compete more successfully with [[kleptoparasite]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;durbin2004&quot;/&gt; Adult females can weigh from {{convert|10|to|17|kg|abbr=on}}, while the slightly larger male may weigh from {{convert|15|to|21|kg|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Cuon alpinus asiatic wild dog.jpg|thumb|Subadult]]

The general tone of the fur is reddish, with the brightest hues occurring in winter. In the winter coat, the back is clothed in a saturated rusty-red to reddish colour with brownish highlights along the top of the head, neck and shoulders. The throat, chest, flanks, and belly and the upper parts of the limbs are less brightly coloured, and are more yellowish in tone. The lower parts of the limbs are whitish, with dark brownish bands on the anterior sides of the forelimbs. The muzzle and forehead are greyish-reddish. The tail is very luxuriant and fluffy, and is mainly of a reddish-ocherous colour, with a dark brown tip. The summer coat is shorter, coarser, and darker.&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; The dorsal and lateral [[guard hair]]s in adults measure 20–30&amp;nbsp;mm in length. Dholes in the [[Moscow Zoo]] moult once a year from March to May.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen1978&quot;/&gt;

Dholes produce whistles resembling the calls of red foxes, sometimes rendered as ''coo-coo''. How this sound is produced is unknown, though it is thought to help in coordinating the pack when travelling through thick brush. When attacking prey, they emit screaming ''KaKaKaKAA'' sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;f93&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sounds include whines (food soliciting), growls (warning), screams, chatterings (both of which are alarm calls) and yapping cries.&lt;ref name=&quot;f95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to wolves, dholes do not howl or bark.&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; Dholes have a complex [[body language]]. Friendly or submissive greetings are accompanied by horizontal lip retraction and the lowering of the tail, as well as licking. Playful dholes open their mouths with their lips retracted and their tails held in a vertical position whilst assuming a play bow. Aggressive or threatening dholes pucker their lips forward in a snarl and raise the hairs on their backs, as well as keep their tails horizontal or vertical. When afraid, they pull their lips back horizontally with their tails tucked and their ears flat against the skull.&lt;ref name=&quot;f97&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Dhole feeding Khao Yai NP.jpg|thumb|Dhole feeding on [[sambar deer]] carcass, [[Khao Yai National Park]]]]
In Central Asia, dholes primarily inhabit mountainous areas; in the western half of their range, they live mostly in alpine meadows and high-montane steppes high [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]], while in the east, they mainly range in montane [[taiga]]s, though they may appear along [[coast]]lines. In India, Myanmar, Indochina, Indonesia and China, they prefer forested areas in [[alpine zone]]s and occasionally also in [[plain]]s regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt;

The dhole might still be present in the [[Tunkinsky National Park]] in extreme southern [[Siberia]] near [[Lake Baikal]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. and Troitskaya, N. (2007). [http://www.wild-russia.org/pubs/pdfs/42.pdf &quot;Then and Now: Updates from Russia's Imperiled Zapovedniks&quot;. Tunkinsky National Park.] Russian Conservation News 42: 14.&lt;/ref&gt; It possibly still exists in the [[Primorsky Krai]] province in far eastern Russia, where it was considered a rare and endangered species in 2004, with unconfirmed reports in the Pikthsa-Tigrovy Dom protected forest area; no sighting was reported in other areas such as the Mataisky Zakaznik forest since the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Newell, J.

Also, in 2011 to 2013, local government officials and herders reported the presence of several packs at altitudes of 2,000 to 3,500 m near the [[Taxkorgan Nature Reserve|Taxkorgan Reserve]] in the [[Karakoram]]/[[Pamir Mountains]] region of the [[Xinjiang]] Autonomous Region, on China's border with [[Pakistan]], Tajikistan, and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;researchgate.net&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Riordan, P. | year = 2015 | title = New evidence of dhole ''Cuon alpinus'' populations in northwest China | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277641707 | journal = Oryx | volume = 49 | issue = 2| pages = 203–204 | doi=10.1017/s0030605315000046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dholes still occur in [[Tibet]] and possibly also in [[North Korea]]. They once occurred in the alpine steppes extending into [[Kashmir]] to the [[Ladakh]] area, but have not been recorded in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

They occur in most of India south of the Ganges, particularly in the Central Indian Highlands and the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]]. In northeast India, it is present in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], and [[West Bengal]] and in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]'s [[Terai]] region.

Dholes still occur in northeastern [[Bangladesh]]'s forest reserves in the Sylhet area, as well the Chittagong Hill Tracts in the southeast. These zones are unlikely to contain viable populations, considering most sightings involve small groups or solitary specimens, and they are likely decreasing in number due to the lack of prey.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

==Ecology and behaviour==

===Social and territorial behaviour===

Dholes are more social than [[Wolf|gray wolves]],&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; and have less of a dominance hierarchy, as seasonal scarcity of food is not a serious concern for them. In this manner, they closely resemble African wild dogs in social structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;f85&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; They live in [[clan]]s rather than [[pack (canine)|pack]]s, as the latter term refers to a group of animals that always hunt together. In contrast, dhole clans frequently break into small packs of 3 to 5 animals, particularly during the spring season, as this is the optimal number for catching fawns.&lt;ref name=&quot;f81&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=81–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant dholes are hard to identify, as they do not engage in dominance displays as wolves do, though other clan members will show submissive behaviour toward them.&lt;ref name=&quot;f86&quot;/&gt; Intragroup fighting is rarely observed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowak1983&quot;/&gt;

Dholes are far less [[territorial]] than wolves, with pups from one clan often joining another without trouble once they mature sexually.&lt;ref name=&quot;f92&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clans typically number 5 to 12 individuals in India, though clans of 40 have been reported. In [[Thailand]], clans rarely exceed three individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen1978&quot;/&gt; Unlike other canids, there is no evidence of dholes using [[urine]] to mark their territories or travel routes. When urinating, dholes, especially males, may [[Raised-leg urination|raise one hind leg]] or both to result in a handstand. Handstand urination is also seen in [[bush dog]]s (''Speothos venaticus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Einige beobachtungen zum verhalten des Dekkan-Rothundes (Cuon alpinus dukhunensis Sykes) im Kanha National Park| author=Keller, R. |journal=Vierteljahresschrift. Naturf. Ges. Zürich |volume=118 |year=1973|pages=129–135|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may defecate in conspicuous places, though a territorial function is unlikely, as [[faeces]] are mostly deposited within the clan's territory rather than the periphery. Faeces are often deposited in what appear to be communal [[latrine (animal)|latrine]]s. They do not scrape the earth with their feet, as other canids do, to mark their territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;f97&quot;/&gt;

===Denning===
Four kinds of den have been described; simple earth dens with one entrance (usually remodeled [[striped hyena]] or [[porcupine]] dens); complex cavernous earth dens with more than one entrance; simple cavernous dens excavated under or between rocks; and complex cavernous dens with several other dens in the vicinity, some of which are interconnected. Dens are typically located under dense scrub or on the banks of dry rivers or creeks. The entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical, with a sharp turn three to four feet down. The tunnel opens into an antechamber, from which extends more than one passage. Some dens may have up to six entrances leading up to {{convert|100|ft}} of interconnecting tunnels. These &quot;cities&quot; may be developed over many generations of dholes, and are shared by the clan females when raising young together.&lt;ref name=&quot;f43&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=43–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[African wild dog]]s and [[dingo]]es, dholes will avoid killing prey close to their dens.&lt;ref name=&quot;f80&quot;/&gt;

===Reproduction and development===
[[File:Cuon alpinus alpinus puppy.jpg|thumb|Dhole pup, [[Kolmården Wildlife Park]]]]
In India, the [[mating season]] occurs between mid-October and January, while captive dholes in the [[Moscow Zoo]] breed mostly in February.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen1978&quot;/&gt; Unlike wolf packs, dhole clans may contain more than one breeding female.&lt;ref name=&quot;f86&quot;/&gt; More than one female dhole may den and rear their litters together in the same den.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowak1983&quot;/&gt; During [[mating]], the female assumes a crouched, cat-like position. There is no [[copulatory tie]] characteristic of other canids when the male dismounts. Instead, the pair lie on their sides facing each other in a semicircular formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;f79&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gestation period]] lasts 60–63 days, with litter sizes averaging four to six pups.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen1978&quot;/&gt; Their growth rate is much faster than that of wolves, being similar in rate to that of [[coyote]]s.

Pups are suckled at least 58 days. During this time, the pack feeds the mother at the den site. Dholes do not use [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] sites to meet their pups as wolves do, though one or more adults will stay with the pups at the den while the rest of the pack hunts. Once [[weaning]] begins, the adults of the clan will regurgitate food for the pups until they are old enough to join in hunting. They remain at the den site for 70–80 days. By the age of six months, pups accompany the adults on hunts and will assist in killing large prey such as sambar by the age of eight months.&lt;ref name=&quot;f80&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum longevity in captivity is 15–16 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowak1983&quot;/&gt;

===Hunting behaviour===
[[File:2012-bandipur-dhole-sambar.jpg|left|thumb|Dholes attacking a [[sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[Bandipur National Park]]]]
[[File:Tigerdholes.jpg|thumb|''A [[Tiger]] Hunted by Indian Wild Dogs'' (1807) by [[Samuel Howitt]]: This is one of the first illustrations of the species, featured in Thomas Williamson's ''Oriental Field Sports''. The depiction is based on Williamson's description of the animal as resembling the [[Indian pariah dog]].]]
Before embarking on a hunt, clans go through elaborate prehunt social rituals involving nuzzling, body rubbing and homo- and heterosexual mounting.&lt;ref name=&quot;f100&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=100–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dholes are primarily [[Diurnality|diurnal]] hunters, hunting in the early hours of the morning. They rarely hunt [[nocturnal]]ly, except on moonlit nights, indicating they greatly rely on [[Visual perception|sight]] when hunting.&lt;ref name=&quot;f50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not as fast as jackals and foxes, they can chase their prey for many hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; During a pursuit, one or more dholes may take over chasing their prey, while the rest of the pack keeps up at a steadier pace behind, taking over once the other group tires. Most chases are short, lasting only 500 m.&lt;ref name=&quot;f73&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; When chasing fleet-footed prey, they run at a pace of {{Convert|30|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; Dholes frequently drive their prey into water bodies, where the targeted animal's movements are hindered.&lt;ref name=&quot;f67&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once large prey is caught, one dhole will grab the prey's nose, while the rest of the pack pulls the animal down by the flanks and hindquarters. They do not use a killing bite to the throat.&lt;ref name=&quot;f61&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occasionally blind their prey by attacking the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grassman, L. I. Jr. |author2=M. E. Tewes |author3=N. J. Silvy |author4=K. Kreetiyutanont |year=2005 |title=Spatial ecology and diet of the dhole ''Cuon alpinus'' (Canidae, Carnivora) in north central Thailand |doi=10.1515/mamm.2005.002 |url=http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/front/medias/publication/6555_m05n1a2 |journal=Mammalia |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=11–20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123090326/http://www.mnhn.fr/museum/front/medias/publication/6555_m05n1a2 |archivedate=23 November 2006 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serow]]s are among the only ungulate species capable of effectively defending themselves against dhole attacks, due to their thick, protective coats and short, sharp horns capable of easily impaling dholes.&lt;ref name=&quot;lydekker1907&quot;/&gt; They will tear open their prey's flanks and [[Disembowelment|disembowel]] it, eating the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lungs]] and some sections of the [[intestines]]. The [[stomach]] and [[rumen]] are usually left untouched.&lt;ref name=&quot;f63&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prey weighing less than 50&amp;nbsp;kg is usually killed within two minutes, while large stags may take 15 minutes to die. Once prey is secured, dholes will tear off pieces of the carcass and eat in seclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;f70&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike wolf packs, in which the breeding pair monopolises food, dholes give priority to the pups when feeding at a kill, allowing them to eat first.&lt;ref name=&quot;f86&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally tolerant of [[scavenger]]s at their kills.&lt;ref name=&quot;f51&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both mother and young are provided with regurgitated food by other pack members.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowak1983&quot;/&gt;

===Feeding ecology===
[[File:2012-bandipur-dhole-chital.jpg|thumb|Dholes feeding on a [[chital]], Bandipur National Park]]
Prey animals in India include [[chital]], [[sambar deer]], [[muntjac]], [[mouse deer]], [[barasingha]], [[wild boar]], [[gaur]], [[water buffalo]]es, [[banteng]], [[cattle]], [[nilgai]], [[goat]]s, [[Indian hare]]s, [[Himalayan field rat]]s and [[langur]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen1978&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock1941/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f58&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=58–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is one record of a pack bringing down an [[Indian elephant]] calf in Assam, despite desperate defense of the mother, resulting in numerous losses to the pack.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry1965&quot;/&gt; In Kashmir, they prey on [[markhor]],&lt;ref name=Pocock1941/&gt; and [[thamin]] in Myanmar,&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen1978&quot;/&gt; [[Malayan tapir]], [[Sumatran serow]] in [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Javan rusa]] in Java.&lt;ref name=&quot;durbin2004&quot;/&gt; In the [[Tian Shan]] and [[Tarbagatai Mountains]], dholes prey on [[Siberian ibex]]es, [[arkhar]], [[roe deer]], [[maral]] and [[wild boar]]. In the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] and [[Sayan Mountains]], they prey on [[musk deer]] and [[reindeer]]. In eastern Siberia, they prey on roe deer, [[Manchurian wapiti]], wild pig, musk deer and reindeer, while in [[Primorye]] they feed on [[sika deer]] and [[goral]]. In Mongolia, they prey on [[argali]] and rarely Siberian ibex.&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt;

Like African wild dogs, but unlike wolves, dholes are not known to attack people.&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocock1941/&gt; Dholes eat [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]] matter more readily than other canids. In captivity, they eat various kinds of grasses, herbs and leaves, seemingly for pleasure rather than just when ill.&lt;ref name=&quot;mivart1890&quot;&gt;Mivart, G. (1890), ''[https://archive.org/stream/dogsjackalswolve00mivauoft#page/n307/mode/2up Dogs, Jackals, Wolves and Foxes: A Monograph of the Canidæ]'', London : R.H. Porter : Dulau, pp. 177–88&lt;/ref&gt; In summertime in the Tian Shan Mountains, dholes eat large quantities of mountain [[rhubarb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; Although opportunistic, dholes have a seeming aversion to hunting cattle and their calves.&lt;ref name=&quot;f71&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock predation by dholes has been a problem in Bhutan since the late 1990s, as domestic animals are often left outside to graze in the forest, sometimes for weeks at a time. [[Livestock]] stall-fed at night and grazed near homes are never attacked. [[Oxen]] are killed more often than [[cow]]s, probably because they are given less protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnsingh, A.J.T. |author2=Yonten, D. |author3=Wangchuck, S. |title=Livestock-Dhole Conflict in Western Bhutan |journal=Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society |volume= 104 |issue=2|year=2007|pages=201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enemies and competitors===
[[File:Dhole killed by leopard.jpg|thumb|Dhole killed and cached in a tree by a [[leopard]], India]]
In some areas, dholes are [[wiktionary:sympatric|sympatric]] to [[tiger]]s and [[leopard]]s. Competition between these species is mostly avoided through differences in prey selection, although there is still substantial dietary overlap. Along with leopards, dholes typically target animals in the 30–175&amp;nbsp;kg range (mean weights of 35.3&amp;nbsp;kg for dhole and 23.4&amp;nbsp;kg for leopard), while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than 176&amp;nbsp;kg (but their mean prey weight was 65.5&amp;nbsp;kg). Also, other characteristics of the prey, such as sex, arboreality and aggressiveness, may play a role in prey selection. For example, dholes preferentially select male chital, whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly (and tigers prefer larger prey altogether), dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards' greater arboreality, while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Karanth, K. U. |author2=Sunquist, M. E. |jstor=5647 |title=Prey selection by tiger, leopard and dhole in tropical forests |journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]|year=1995|volume=64|issue=4|pages=439–450|doi=10.2307/5647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some occasions, dholes may attack tigers. When confronted by dholes, tigers will seek refuge in trees or stand with their backs to a tree or bush, where they may be mobbed for lengthy periods before finally attempting escape. Escaping tigers are usually killed, while tigers which stand their ground have a greater chance of survival.&lt;ref name=Pocock1941/&gt; Tigers are dangerous opponents for dholes, as they have sufficient strength to kill a dhole with a single paw strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry1965&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Perry, R. |year=1964 |title=The World of the Tiger |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhole packs may steal leopard kills, while leopards may kill dholes if they encounter them singly or in pairs.&lt;ref name=Pocock1941/&gt; Since leopards are smaller than tigers and are more likely to hunt dholes, dhole packs tend to react more aggressively toward them than they do towards tigers.&lt;ref name=&quot;venkataraman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Venkataraman, A. |year=1995 |title=Do dholes (''Cuon alpinus'') live in packs in response to competition with or predation by large cats? |journal=Current Science |volume=69|issue=11 |pages=934–936 |url=http://eprints.iisc.ac.in/25085/1/article_id_069_11_0934_0936_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous records of leopards being treed by dholes.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowak1983&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Walker, E. P. |author2=Nowak, R. M. |author3=Warnick, F. |year=1983 |title=Walker's Mammals of the World. 4th ed.|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dholes sometimes drive tigers, leopards, snow leopards and bears (see below) from their kills.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowak1983&quot;/&gt; Dholes were once thought to be a major factor in reducing [[Asiatic cheetah]] populations, though this is doubtful, as cheetahs live in open areas as opposed to forested areas favoured by dholes.&lt;ref name=&quot;fin1929&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Finn, F. |year=1929 |title=Sterndale's Mammalia of India |publisher=Thacker, Spink &amp; Co. |location=London |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhole packs occasionally attack [[Asiatic black bear]]s, [[snow leopards]], and [[sloth bear]]s. When attacking bears, dholes will attempt to prevent them from seeking refuge in caves and lacerate their hindquarters.&lt;ref name=Pocock1941/&gt;

Although usually antagonistic toward [[Wolf|wolves]],&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt; they may hunt and feed alongside one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;shretha1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Shrestha, T. J. |year=1997 |title=Mammals of Nepal: (with reference to those of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan) |publisher=Bimala Shrestha |location=Kathmandu |isbn=978-0-9524390-6-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in [[Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nair M. V., Panda S. K. | year = 2013 | title = Just Friends | url = http://www.sanctuaryasia.com/magazines/features/9390-just-friends.html | journal = Sanctuary Asia | volume = XXXIII | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They infrequently associate in mixed groups with [[golden jackal|Eurasian golden jackal]]s. Domestic dogs may kill dholes, though they will feed alongside them on occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;humphrey1990&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=Humphrey, S. R. |author2=Bain, J. R. |year=1990 |title=Endangered Animals of Thailand |publisher=Sandhill Crane Press |location=Gainesville |isbn=978-1-877743-07-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diseases and parasites===
Dholes are vulnerable to a number of different diseases, particularly in areas where they are [[wiktionary:Sympatric|sympatric]] with other canid species. Infectious pathogens such as ''[[Toxocara canis]]'' are present in their faeces. They may suffer from [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[mange]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[canine parvovirus]] and [[endoparasite]]s such as [[cestode]]s and [[roundworm]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;durbin2004&quot;/&gt;

==Threats==
The dhole only rarely takes domestic livestock. Certain people, such as the [[Kuruba|Kurumbas]] and some [[Mon Khmer]]-speaking tribes will appropriate dhole kills; some Indian villagers welcome the dhole because of this appropriation of dhole kills.&lt;ref name=&quot;nowak1983&quot;/&gt; Dholes were persecuted throughout India for bounties until they were given protection by the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]]. Methods used for dhole hunting included poisoning, snaring, shooting and clubbing at den sites. Native Indian people killed dholes primarily to protect livestock, while British sporthunters during the [[British Raj]] did so under the conviction that dholes were responsible for drops in [[Game (hunting)|game]] populations. Persecution of dholes still occurs with varying degrees of intensity according to the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;durbin2004&quot;/&gt; Bounties paid for dholes used to be 25 [[rupee]]s, though this was reduced to 20 in 1926 after the number of presented dhole carcasses became too numerous to maintain the established reward.&lt;ref name=&quot;f109&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Indochina, dholes suffer heavily from nonselective hunting techniques such as snaring.&lt;ref name=&quot;durbin2004&quot;/&gt;

The [[fur trade]] does not pose a significant threat to dholes.&lt;ref name=&quot;durbin2004&quot;/&gt; The people of India do not eat dhole flesh and their fur is not considered overly valuable.&lt;ref name=&quot;mivart1890&quot;/&gt; Due to their rarity, dholes were never harvested for their skins in large numbers in the [[Soviet Union]] and were sometimes accepted as dog or wolf pelts (being labeled as &quot;half wolf&quot; for the latter). The winter fur was prized by the Chinese, who bought dhole pelts in [[Ussuriysk]] during the late 1860s for a few silver [[ruble]]s. In the early 20th century, dhole pelts reached eight rubles in [[Manchuria]]. In [[Semirechye]], [[fur coat]]s made from dhole skin were considered the warmest, but were very costly.&lt;ref name=&quot;heptner1998&quot;/&gt;

== Conservation ==
In India, the dhole is protected under Schedule 2 of the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]. The creation of reserves under [[Project Tiger]] provided some protection for dhole populations sympatric with [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s. In 2014, the Indian government sanctioned its first dhole conservation breeding centre at the [[Indira Gandhi Zoological Park]] (IGZP) in [[Visakhapatnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/zoo-to-have-conservation-breeding-centre-for-dhole/article6326027.ece Zoo to have conservation breeding centre for ‘dhole’], ''The Hindu'' (August 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The dhole has been protected in Russia since 1974, though it is vulnerable to poison left out for wolves. In China, the animal is listed as a category II protected species under the Chinese wildlife protection act of 1988. In [[Cambodia]], the dhole is protected from all hunting, while conservation laws in Vietnam limit extraction and utilisation.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

In 2016, the Korean company Sooam Biotech was reported to be attempting to clone the dhole using dogs as surrogate mothers to help conserve the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewScientist500&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|magazine=New Scientist|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three dhole-like animals are featured on the [[Coping (architecture)|coping]] stone of the [[Bharhut]] [[stupa]] dating from 100 BC. They are shown waiting by a tree, with a woman or spirit trapped up it, a scene reminiscent of dholes [[treeing]] tigers.&lt;ref&gt;van der Geer, A. A. E. (2008), ''Animals in stone: Indian mammals sculptured through time'', BRILL, p. 188, {{ISBN|90-04-16819-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The animal's fearsome reputation in India is reflected by the number of pejorative names it possesses in [[Hindi]], which variously translate as &quot;red devil&quot;, &quot;devil dog&quot;, &quot;jungle devil&quot;, or &quot;hound of [[Kali]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;perry1965&quot;/&gt; According to zoologist and explorer [[Leopold von Schrenck]], he had trouble obtaining dhole specimens during his exploration of [[Outer Manchuria|Amurland]], as the local [[Nivkh people|Gilyak]]s greatly feared the species. This fear and superstition was not, however, shared by neighbouring [[Tungusic peoples]].

Von Schrenk speculated that this differing attitude towards dholes was due to the Tungusic people's more nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;schrenk1859&quot;&gt;{{in lang|de}} [[Leopold von Schrenck|Schrenk, L. v.]] (1859), [https://archive.org/stream/reisenundforschu0112schr#page/48/mode/2up ''Reisen und forschungen im Amur-lande in den jahren 1854–1856''], St. Petersburg : K. Akademie der Wissenschaften, pp. 48–50&lt;/ref&gt; Dhole-like animals are described in numerous old European texts, including the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogoth]] [[saga]]s, where they are portrayed as [[hellhound]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith1839&quot;/&gt; The demon dogs accompanying [[Harlequin|Hellequin]] in Mediaeval French [[Passion Play]]s, as well as the ones inhabiting the legendary forest of [[Brocéliande]], have been attributed to dholes.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith1839&quot;/&gt; According to [[Charles Hamilton Smith]], the dangerous wild canids mentioned by [[Scaliger]] as having lived in the forests of [[Province of Pisa|Montefalcone]] could have been based on dholes, as they were described as unlike wolves in habits, voice and appearance. The Montefalcone family's [[coat of arms]] had a pair of red dogs as supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith1839&quot;/&gt;

Dholes appear in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Red Dog (Kipling short story)|Red Dog]]'', where they are portrayed as aggressive and bloodthirsty animals which descend from the [[Deccan Plateau]] into the [[Seoni, Madhya Pradesh|Seeonee Hills]] inhabited by [[Mowgli]] and his adopted wolf pack to cause carnage among the jungle's denizens. They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even [[Shere Khan]] and [[Hathi]] make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes. With Mowgli and [[Kaa]]'s help, the Seeonee wolf pack manages to wipe out the dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing off the rest in battle.

Japanese author Uchida Roan wrote 犬物語 (''Inu monogatari''; A dog's tale) in 1901 as a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] critique of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breeds, which he asserted were descended from the dhole.&lt;ref&gt;Skabelund, A. H. (2011). ''Empire of Dogs: Canines, Japan, and the Making of the Modern Imperial World''. Cornell University Press, p. 85, {{ISBN|0801463246}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional version of the dhole, imbued with supernatural abilities, appears in the season 6 episode of TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'', titled &quot;[[Alpha (The X-Files)|Alpha]]&quot;.

Dholes also appear as enemies in the [[video game]] ''[[Far Cry 4]]'', alongside other predators such as the [[Bengal tiger]], [[honey badger]], [[snow leopard]], [[clouded leopard]], [[Tibetan wolf]] and [[Asian black bear]]. They can be found hunting the player and other [[non-player character|NPCs]] across the map, but are easily killed, being one of the weakest enemies in the game. They once again appear in the video game ''[[Far Cry Primal]]'', where they play similar roles as their counterparts in the previous game, but can now also be tamed and used in combat by Takkar, the main protagonist of the game.

===Tameability===
[[Brian Houghton Hodgson]] kept captured dholes in captivity, and found, with the exception of one animal, they remained shy and vicious even after 10 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;mivart1890&quot;/&gt; According to [[Richard Lydekker]], adult dholes are nearly impossible to tame, though pups are docile and can even be allowed to play with domestic dog pups until they reach early adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;lydekker1907&quot;/&gt; A dhole may have been presented as a gift to [[Ibbi-Sin]] as tribute.&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, J. (2008). ''The ancient Indus Valley: new perspectives'', p. 130, ABC-CLIO, {{ISBN|1-57607-907-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
