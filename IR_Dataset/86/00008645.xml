{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]], '''declension''' is the changing of the form of a [[word]], generally to express its syntactic function in the sentence, by way of some [[inflection]]. The inflectional change of verbs is called [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]].

Declensions may apply to [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, and [[article (grammar)|articles]] to indicate [[grammatical number|number]] (e.g. singular, dual, plural), [[grammatical case|case]] (e.g. [[nominative case]], [[accusative case]], [[genitive case]], [[dative case]]), [[grammatical gender|gender]] (e.g. masculine, neuter, feminine), and a number of other [[grammatical categories]]. 

Declension occurs in many of the world's languages. Declension is an important aspect of language families like [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American]] (such as [[Quechuan languages|Quechuan]]), [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ([[German language|German]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Latin]]), [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] ([[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]]), [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] ([[Modern Standard Arabic]]), [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]] ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]]), [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]).

[[Old English]] was an inflectional language, but largely abandoned inflectional changes as it evolved into [[Modern English]]. Though traditionally classified as [[Synthetic language|synthetic]], Modern English has moved towards an [[analytic language]].

== History ==
It is agreed that [[Ancient Greeks]] had a &quot;vague&quot; idea of the forms of a noun in their language. A fragment of [[Anacreon]] seems to confirm this idea. Nevertheless, it cannot be concluded that the Ancient Greeks actually knew what the cases were. The [[Stoics]] developed many basic notions that today are the rudiments of [[linguistics]]. The idea of grammatical cases is also traced back to the Stoics, but it's still not completely clear what the Stoics exactly meant with their notion of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 43646836|title = The Stoic Notion of a Grammatical Case|journal = Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|volume = 39|pages = 13–24|last1 = Frede|first1 = Michael|year = 1994|doi = 10.1111/j.2041-5370.1994.tb00449.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=treccani&gt;http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/linguaggio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern English==
{{further|Old English grammar#Nouns}}
In [[Modern English]], the system of declensions is very simple compared to some other languages, so much so that the term ''declension'' is rarely applied to English in practice. Most nouns in English have distinct singular and plural forms and have distinct plain and [[possessive]] forms. Plurality is most commonly shown by the [[affix]] ''-s'' (or ''-es''), whereas possession is always shown by the [[clitic]] ''-'s'' (or by just the apostrophe for most plural forms ending in ''s'') attached to the noun. Consider, for example, the forms of the noun ''girl'':

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;
 ! 
 ! Singular
 ! Plural
|-
 | '''Plain'''
 | girl
 | girls
|-
 | '''Possessive'''
 | girl's
 | girls'
|}

Most speakers pronounce all of the forms other than the singular plain form (''girl'') exactly the same (though the elided possessive-indicating ''s'' of the plural possessive may be realised as [z] in some speakers' pronunciations, being separated from the plural-indicating ''s'' normally by a central vowel such as [ɨ̞]). By contrast, a few nouns are slightly more complex in their forms. For example:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;
 ! 
 ! Singular
 ! Plural
|-
 | '''Plain'''
 | man
 | men
|-
 | '''Possessive'''
 | man's
 | men's
|}

In that example, all four forms are pronounced in a distinct manner.

There can be other derivations from nouns that are not usually considered declensions. For example, the proper noun ''Britain'' has the associated descriptive adjective ''British'' and the [[demonym]] ''Briton''. Though these words are clearly related and are generally considered cognates, they are not specifically treated as forms of the same word and thus not declensions.

Pronouns in English have even more complex declensions. For example:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;
 ! 
 ! Singular
 ! Plural
|-
 | '''Subjective'''
 | I
 | we
|-
 | '''Objective'''
 | me
 | us
|-
 | '''Dependent possessive'''
 | my
 | our
|-
 | '''Independent possessive'''
 | mine
 | ours
|}

Whereas nouns do not distinguish between the [[nominative case|subjective (nominative)]] and [[oblique case| objective (oblique)]] cases, some pronouns do; that is, they decline to reflect their relationship to a [[verb]] or [[preposition]], or [[grammatical case|case]]. Consider the difference between ''he'' (subjective) and ''him'' (objective), as in &quot;He saw it&quot; and &quot;It saw him&quot;; similarly, consider ''[[Who (pronoun)|who]]'', which is subjective, and the objective ''whom'' (although it is increasingly common to use ''who'' for both).

The one situation where gender is still clearly part of the English language is in the pronouns for the third person singular. Consider the following:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;text-align:left&quot;
 ! 
 ! Masculine
 ! Feminine
 ! Neuter&lt;br&gt;(non-person)
 ! Neuter&lt;br&gt;(person)
|-
 | '''Subjective'''
 | he
 | she
 | it
 | they
|-
 | '''Objective'''
 | him
 | her
 | it
 | them
|-
 | '''Dependent possessive'''
 | his
 | her
 | its
 | their
|-
 | '''Independent possessive'''
 | his
 | hers
 | its
 | theirs
|}

The distinguishing of neuter for persons and non-persons is somewhat peculiar to English. This has existed since the 14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butterfield p814&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|page=814|last1=Fowler |first1=H.W.|editor1-last=Butterfield |editor1-first=Jeremy|title= Fowler's Dictionary of Modern English Usage |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |authorlink1=Rodney Huddleston |last2= Pullum |first2= Geoffrey K. |authorlink2= Geoffrey Pullum|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge; New York |isbn=0-521-43146-8 |page=494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the so-called ''singular they'' is often restricted to specific contexts, depending on the dialect or the speaker. It is most typically used to refer to a single person of unknown gender (e.g., &quot;someone left their jacket behind&quot;) or a hypothetical person where gender is insignificant (e.g., &quot;If someone wants to, then they should&quot;). Its use has expanded in recent years due to increasing social recognition of persons who do not identify themselves as male or female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=
The singular, gender-neutral ‘they’ added to the Associated Press Stylebook | author=Andrews, Travis M. | date=March 28, 2017 | newspaper=Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/28/the-singular-gender-neutral-they-added-to-the-associated-press-stylebook/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the ''singular they'' still uses plural verb forms, reflecting its origins.

For nouns, in general, gender is not declined in Modern English, or at best one could argue there are isolated situations certain nouns may be modified to reflect gender, though not in a systematic fashion. Loan words from other languages, particularly Latin and the Romance languages, often preserve their gender-specific forms in English, e.g. ''alumnus'' (masculine singular) and ''alumna'' (feminine singular). Similarly, names borrowed from other languages show comparable distinctions: ''Andrew'' and ''Andrea'', ''Paul'' and ''Paula'', etc. Additionally, suffixes such as ''-ess'', ''-ette'', and ''-er'' are sometimes applied to create overtly gendered versions of nouns, with marking for feminine being much more common than marking for masculine. Many nouns can actually function as members of two genders or even all three, and the gender classes of English nouns are usually determined by their agreement with pronouns, rather than marking on the nouns themselves.

Most adjectives are not declined. However, when used as nouns rather than adjectives, they do decline (e.g., &quot;I'll take the reds&quot;, meaning &quot;I'll take the red ones&quot; or as shorthand for &quot;I'll take the red wines&quot;). Also, the demonstrative determiners ''this'' and ''that'' are declined for number, as ''these'' and ''those''. Some adjectives borrowed from other languages are, or can be, declined for gender, at least in writing: ''blond'' (male) and ''blonde'' (female). Adjectives are not declined for case in Modern English, though they were in Old English. The [[English articles|article]] is never regarded as declined in Modern English, although formally, the words ''that'' and possibly ''[[She (pronoun)|she]]'' correspond to forms of the predecessor of ''the'' (''sē'' m., ''þæt'' n., ''sēo'' f.) as it was declined in Old English.

==Latin==
{{main|Latin declension|Latin syntax}}

Just as verbs in [[Latin]] are conjugated to indicate grammatical information, Latin nouns and adjectives that modify them are declined to signal their roles in sentences. There are five important cases for Latin nouns: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], and [[Ablative (Latin)|ablative]]. Since the [[Vocative case|vocative]] case [[Vocative_case#Latin|usually]] takes the same form as the nominative, it is seldom spelt out in grammar books.{{dubious|date=May 2019}} Yet another case, the [[Locative case|locative]], is limited to a small number of words.

The usual basic functions of these cases are as follows:
*Nominative case indicates the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]].
*Genitive case indicates [[Possessive|possession]] and can be translated with ‘of’.
*Dative case marks the [[Object (grammar)|indirect object]] and can be translated with ‘to’ or ‘for’.
*Accusative case marks the [[Object (grammar)|direct object]].
*Ablative case is used to modify verbs and can be translated as ‘by’, ‘with’, ‘from’, etc.
*Vocative case is used to address a person or thing.

The genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative also have important functions to indicate the object of a preposition.

Given below is the declension paradigm of Latin ''puer'' ‘boy’ and ''puella'' ‘girl’:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Case !! Singular !! Plural !! Singular !! Plural
|-
| Nominative || puer || puer'''ī''' || puell'''a''' || puell'''ae'''
|-
| Genitive || puer'''ī''' || puer'''ōrum''' || puell'''ae''' || puell'''ārum'''
|-
| Dative || puer'''ō''' || puer'''īs''' || puell'''ae''' || puell'''īs'''
|-
| Accusative || puer'''um''' || puer'''ōs''' || puell'''am''' || puell'''ās'''
|-
| Ablative || puer'''ō''' || puer'''īs''' || puell'''ā''' || puell'''īs'''
|}

From the provided examples we can see how cases work:

* ''liber puerī'' → the book of the boy (''puerī'' boy=genitive)
* ''puer puellae rosam dat'' → the boy gives the girl a rose (''puer'' boy=nominative; ''puellae'' girl=dative; ''rosam'' rose=accusative; ''dat'' give=third person singular present)

==Sanskrit==
{{main|Sanskrit nouns}}
Sanskrit, another Indo-European language, has eight cases: [[nominative]], [[vocative case|vocative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative case|ablative]], [[locative case|locative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clackson]] (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DJDjNp6wODoC&amp;pg=PA90 ''Indo-European linguistics: an introduction''], p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Some do not count vocative as a separate case, despite it having a distinctive ending in the singular, but consider it as a different use of the nominative.&lt;ref&gt;Amba Kulkarni and Peter Scharf (eds), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t2f1hneiV08C&amp;pg=PA68 Sanskrit Computational Linguistics: First and Second International Symposia Rocquencourt, France, October 29-31, 2007 and Providence, RI, USA, May 15-17, 2008, Revised Selected Papers]'', Volume 5402 of Lecture notes in artificial intelligence, Springer, 2009, {{ISBN|3-642-00154-8}}, pp. 64–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sanskrit]] grammatical cases have been analyzed extensively. The grammarian [[Pāṇini]] identified six semantic [[Thematic relation|roles]] or ''karaka'', which correspond closely to the eight cases:&lt;ref&gt;Pieter Cornelis Verhagen, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5vmaX_JQzc4C&amp;pg=PA281 Handbook of oriental studies: India. A history of Sanskrit grammatical literature in Tibet, Volume 2]'', BRILL, 2001, {{ISBN|90-04-11882-9}}, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;
* agent (''kartṛ'', related to the nominative)
* patient (''karman'', related to the accusative)
* means (''karaṇa'', related to the instrumental)
* recipient (''sampradāna'', related to the dative)
* source (''apādāna'', related to the ablative)
*relation (''sambandha,'' related to genitive)
* locus (''adhikaraṇa'', related to the locative)
* address (''sambodhana'', related to the vocative)
For example, consider the following sentence:
:{| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
| style=&quot;padding-right: 1em;&quot; | vṛkṣ-āt
| style=&quot;padding-right: 1em;&quot; | parṇ-aṁ
| style=&quot;padding-right: 1em;&quot; | bhūm-au
| patati
|-
|from the tree || a leaf || to the ground || falls
|}&quot;a leaf falls from the tree to the ground&quot;

Here ''leaf'' is the agent, ''tree'' is the source, and ''ground'' is the locus. The endings ''-aṁ'', ''-at'', ''-āu'' mark the cases associated with these meanings.
