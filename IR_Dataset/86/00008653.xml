'''Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A.''' ({{IPA-it|duˈkaːti}}) is the [[motorcycle]]-manufacturing division of Italian company [[Ducati (company)|Ducati]], headquartered in [[Bologna, Italy]]. The company is owned by German automotive manufacturer [[Audi]] through its Italian subsidiary [[Lamborghini]], which is in turn owned by the [[Volkswagen Group]].&lt;ref name=audi_ifr_2012/&gt;

==History==
In 1926 ''Antonio Cavalieri Ducati'' and his three sons, ''Adriano, Marcello, and Bruno Cavalieri Ducati'' founded ''Società Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati'' in Bologna to produce [[vacuum tube]]s, [[Capacitor|condensers]] and other radio components. In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city.  Production was maintained during World War II, despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing.
[[File:Ducati Werk.JPG|thumb|left|Ducati Factory]]
[[File:Ducati Vilar Cucciolo 1950.jpg|left|thumb|Ducati &quot;Cucciolo&quot;, 1950]]
Meanwhile, at the small [[Turin]]ese firm SIATA (''Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie''), Aldo Farinelli began developing a small [[pushrod]] [[Motorized bicycle|engine for mounting on bicycles]]. Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the [[Ducati Cucciolo|&quot;Cucciolo&quot;]] (Italian for &quot;puppy,&quot; in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound) to the public. The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the buyer; however, businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity, and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale.

In 1950, after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold, in collaboration with SIATA, the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle. This first Ducati motorcycle was a 48&amp;nbsp;cc bike weighing {{Convert|98|lb}}, with a top speed of {{convert|abbr=on|40|mph|0}}, and had a {{convert|15|mm |in |adj=mid|[[carburetor]] |abbr=in}} giving just under {{convert|abbr=on|200|mpgus}}. Ducati soon dropped the Cucciolo name in favor of &quot;55M&quot; and &quot;65TL&quot;.
[[File:Scooters.Assisi026.jpg|thumb|Ducati 175 Cruiser, 1952]]
[[File:Ducati mach1 800.jpg|thumb|[[Ducati Mach 1]]]]
When the market moved toward larger motorcycles, Ducati management decided to respond, making an impression at an early-1952 Milan show, introducing their 65TS cycle and Cruiser (a four-stroke [[motor scooter]]). Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show, the Cruiser was not a great success, and only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production.

In 1953, management split the company into two separate entities, Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica, in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day.

In the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250&amp;nbsp;cc road bike then available, the [[Ducati Mach 1|Mach 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ducati.com/heritage/anni60/mach1/mach1.jhtml |title= Mach 1 |publisher= ducati.com |accessdate= 25 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DUCATI-MOTOR-HOLDING-SPA-Jun-2004-20-F&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2325/115697304000783/filing-main.htm |title=DUCATI MOTOR HOLDING SPA, Form 20-F, Annual and Transition Report (foreign private issuer), Filing Date Jun 30, 2004 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mecossemi.com/H4FrameSet_L.html|title=History of the Motorcycle |publisher= mecossemi.com |accessdate= 25 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement [[V-twin engine|V-twin]]  motorcycles and in 1973, released a V-twin with the trademarked [[desmodromic valve]] design. In 1985, [[Cagiva]] bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the &quot;Cagiva&quot; name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the &quot;Ducati&quot; name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from [[Texas Pacific Group]] and sold a 51% stake in the company for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an [[initial public offering]] of Ducati stock and renamed the company &quot;Ducati Motor Holding SpA&quot;. TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to Investindustrial Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi.

In April 2012, [[Volkswagen Group]]'s [[Audi]] subsidiary announced its intention to buy Ducati for €{{Format price|860000000}} (US${{Format price|1200000000}}). Volkswagen chairman [[Ferdinand Piëch]], a motorcycle enthusiast, had long coveted Ducati, and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984. Analysts doubted a tiny motorcycle maker would have a meaningful effect on a company the size of Volkswagen, commenting that the acquisition has &quot;a trophy feel to it,&quot; and, &quot;is driven by VW's passion for nameplates rather than industrial or financial logic&quot;. Italian luxury car brand [[Lamborghini]] was strengthened under VW ownership.&lt;ref name=Cremer2012&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/audi-ducati-idUSL6E8FH5DR20120417 |title= UPDATE 2-Audi to pay about 860 mln euros for Ducati |agency= Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date= 17 April 2012 |first1= Andreas |last1=Cremer |first2=Christiaan |last2=Hetzner |accessdate= 17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schultz2012&gt;{{Citation |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Volkswagen Group to Add Ducati to Product Portfolio |first= Jonathan |last= Schultz |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/volkswagen-group-adds-ducati-to-product-portfolio |accessdate= 18 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AUDI AG's Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. subsidiary acquired 100 percent of the shares of Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. on 19 July 2012 for €{{Format price|747000000}} (US${{Format price|909323100}}).&lt;ref name=audi_ifr_2012 /&gt;

Ducati is best known for high-performance motorcycles characterized by large-capacity [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]], 90° [[V-twin engine]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ducati.com/bikes/techcafe.jhtml?detail=article&amp;value=technical&amp;part=technical&amp;artID=1 |title= History of the Two-Valve Twin |publisher= Ducati.com |accessdate= 25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[desmodromic valve]] design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ducati.com/bikes/techcafe.jhtml?detail=article&amp;value=technical&amp;part=technical&amp;artID=2 |title= Desmo for Dummies |publisher= Ducati.com |accessdate= 25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ducati refers to this configuration as L-twin because one cylinder is vertical while the other is horizontal, making it look like a letter &quot;L&quot;. Modern Ducatis remain among the dominant performance motorcycles available today partly because of the desmodromic valve design, which is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated cam lobe and lifter instead of the conventional valve [[spring (device)|springs]] used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a &quot;passive&quot; closing mechanism under the same conditions.

While most other manufacturers use [[wet clutch]]es (with the spinning parts bathed in oil)&lt;ref name=&quot;Transmissions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/our_company/news_item.php?news_id=45|title=What is in an oil|publisher=yamaha-motor.ca|accessdate=25 January 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117211117/http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/our_company/news_item.php?news_id=45|archivedate=17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ducati previously used multiplate [[dry clutch]]es in many of their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the power loss from oil viscosity drag on the engine, even though the engagement may not be as smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the clutch plates can wear more rapidly.  Ducati has converted to wet clutches across their current product lines.

Ducati also extensively uses a [[Space frame|trellis frame]], although Ducati's MotoGP project broke with this tradition by introducing a revolutionary carbon fibre frame for the Ducati Desmosedici GP9.

==Product history==
{{see also|Ducati Museum}}
The chief designer of most Ducati motorcycles in the 1950s was [[Fabio Taglioni]] (1920–2001). His designs ranged from the small single-cylinder machines that were successful in the Italian 'street races' to the large-capacity twins of the 1980s. Ducati introduced the [[Ducati Pantah|Pantah]] in 1979; its engine was updated in the 1990s in the [[Ducati SuperSport]] (SS) series. All modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which uses a toothed belt to actuate the engine's valves. Taglioni used the [[Ferrari#Identity|Cavallino Rampante]] (identified with the [[Ferrari]] brand) on his Ducati motorbikes, Taglioni chose this emblem of courage and daring as a sign of respect and admiration for [[Francesco Baracca]], a heroic World War I fighter pilot who died during an air raid in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ducati.com/heritage/protagonisti/fabiotaglioni6.jhtml|title=Fabio Taglioni: a Legend|publisher=ducati.com|accessdate=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Ducati commemorated its 1972 win at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] 200 with the production model green frame Ducati 750 SuperSport.

Ducati also targeted the offroad market with the two-stroke Regolarità 125, building 3,486 models from 1975 to 1979, but the bike was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/the-ducati-regolarita.aspx |title= Ducati Regolarità 125 |publisher=Motorcycle Classics |accessdate= 15 December 2011 |date= January–February 2011 |author= Alan Cathcart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the company introduced the [[Ducati 860 GT|860 GT]], designed by noted car stylist [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Its angular lines were unique, but raised handlebars made for an uncomfortable seating position at high speeds and also caused steering issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/1975-ducati-860-gt.aspx|title=1975 Ducati 860GT |publisher= Motorcycle Classics |accessdate= 18 July 2011 |date= July–August 2011 |author= Roland Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 860GT's angular styling was a sales disaster, and it was hurriedly re-designed for the 1976 season with a more rounded fuel tank.&lt;ref&gt;https://ridermagazine.com/2016/01/07/retrospective-ducati-860-gt-and-gte-1974-1975/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1975 Ducati offered hand-built production racers, the 'square case' [[Ducati 750SS|750SS]] and later [[Ducati SuperSport|900SS]] models, built in limited numbers.  Sales of the 900SS proved so strong, and sales of the 860GT/GTE/GTS so weak, that production of the 900SS was ramped up, and it became Ducati's #1 selling model&lt;ref&gt; Walker, Mick (2002), Illustrated Ducati Buyer's Guide (3rd ed.), MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company, p. 148, {{ISBN|978-0760313091}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===1980s===
{{main|Ducati Desmoquattro engine}}

Ducati's liquid-cooled, multi-valve V-twins, made from 1985 on, are known as ''Desmoquattro'' (&quot;[[desmodromic valve]] four&quot;). These include the 851, [[Ducati 916|916]] and [[Ducati 996|996]], [[Ducati 999|999]] and a few predecessors and derivatives.

{{Main|Ducati Paso}}
[[File:907ie.JPG|thumb|1993 Ducati 907 i.e.]]
The Ducati Paso was introduced in 1986 with the Paso 750, followed in 1989 with the Paso 906. The final version came in 1991 with the 907IE (Iniezione Elettronica), now without the name &quot;Paso&quot;. The design was from the hand of [[Massimo Tamburini]], who also designed the [[Ducati 916]] and [[MV Agusta F4 series|MV Agusta F4]]. The Paso was a typical &quot;you love it, you hate it&quot; bike. However, at that time it looked like that all-enclosed bodywork would be the future for all motorcycles. The Paso design was copied for the [[Moto Morini|Moto Morini Dart 400]] and [[:it:Cagiva Freccia|Cagiva Freccia]] 125. Together with Tamburini's [[Bimota DB1]], they were enormously influential in terms of styling.

===1990s===
In 1993, [[Miguel Angel Galluzzi]] introduced the [[Ducati Monster]],&lt;ref name=&quot;monster&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monsta.at/site_article_368.html |title=Desmo 2 Valve History |publisher=monsta.at |accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217050440/http://www.monsta.at/site_article_368.html |archivedate=17 February 2005 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; a naked bike with exposed trellis and engine. Today the Monster accounts for almost half of the company's worldwide sales. The Monster has undergone the most changes of any motorcycle that Ducati has ever produced.

In 1993, [[Pierre Terblanche]], Massimo Bordi and Claudio Domenicali designed the [[Ducati Supermono]]. A 550&amp;nbsp;cc single-cylinder lightweight &quot;Catalog Racer&quot;. Only 67 were built between 1993 and 1997.

In 1994, the company introduced the [[Ducati 916]] model designed by [[Massimo Tamburini]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ducati916&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ducati.com/heritage/anni90/916sbk95/916sbk95.jhtml |title= Ducati Official History (The 916) |publisher= Ducati Motor Holdings |accessdate= 22 June 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516040223/http://www.ducati.com/heritage/anni90/916sbk95/916sbk95.jhtml |archive-date= 16 May 2008 |url-status= dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; a water-cooled version that allowed for higher output levels and a striking new bodywork that had aggressive lines, an underseat exhaust, and a single-sided swingarm. Ducati has since ceased production of the 916, supplanting it (and its progeny, the [[Ducati 748|748]], [[Ducati 996|996]] and [[Ducati 998|998]]) with the [[Ducati 749|749]] and [[Ducati 999|999]].

===2000s===
In 2006, the retro-styled [[Ducati PaulSmart 1000 LE]] was released, which shared styling cues with the 1973 750 SuperSport (itself a production replica of [[Paul Smart (motorcycle racer)|Paul Smart]]'s 1972 race winning [[Ducati 750 Imola Desmo|750 Imola Desmo]]), as one of a [[Ducati SportClassic|SportClassic]] series representing the 750 GT, 750 Sport, and 750 SuperSport Ducati motorcycles.

==Motorcycle design history==
Ducati has produced several styles of motorcycle engines, including varying the number of cylinders, type of valve actuation and fuel delivery. Ducati is best known for its [[V-twin engine]], called an L-twin by the company, which is the powerplant in the majority of Ducati-marqued motorcycles.
Ducati has also manufactured engines with one, two, three or four cylinders; operated by pull rod valves and push rod valves; single, double and triple overhead camshafts; [[two-stroke]] and even at one stage manufactured small diesel engines, many of which were used to power boats, generators, garden machinery and emergency pumps (for example, for fire fighting). The engines were the IS series from {{convert|7|to|22|hp|abbr=on}} air-cooled and the larger twin DM series water- and air-cooled. The engines have been found in all parts of the globe. Wisconsin Diesel even assembled and &quot;badge engineered&quot; the engines in the USA. They have also produced outboard motors for marine use. Currently, Ducati makes no other engines except for its motorcycles.

On current Ducati motors, except for the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are actuated by a standard valve cam shaft which is rotated by a [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]] driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep the [[camshaft]] drive pulleys indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older [[single-cylinder]] motorcycles — the shaft tube is visible on the outside of the cylinder.

Ducati is also famous for using the desmodromic valve system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though the firm has also used engines that use valve springs to close their valves. In the early days, Ducati reserved the desmodromic valve heads for its higher performance bikes and its race bikes. These valves do not suffer from [[valve float]] at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Ducati produced a wide range of small two-stroke bikes, mainly sub-100&amp;nbsp;cc capacities. Large quantities of some models were exported to the United States.

Ducati has produced the following motorcycle engine types:
* Single-cylinder,
**pullrod actuated, 48&amp;nbsp;cc and 65&amp;nbsp;cc (Cucciolo)
**pushrod actuated, 98 and 125&amp;nbsp;cc

===MotoGP World Championship===
Ducati rejoined [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] in {{MGP|2003}}, after a 30-year absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ducati.com/racing/index_motogp.jhtml |title= 2003 Ducati MotoGP Team |publisher= ducati.com |accessdate= 25 January 2008 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071220235432/http://www.ducati.com/racing/index_motogp.jhtml |archivedate= 20 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 September 2007, [[Casey Stoner]] clinched his and Ducati's first Grand Prix World Championship.

When Ducati re-joined MotoGP in {{MGP|2003}}, MotoGP had changed its rules to allow four-stroke 990&amp;nbsp;cc engines to race. At the time Ducati was the fastest bike. In {{MGP|2007}}, MotoGP reduced the engine size to ''{{Convert|800|cc|abbr=on}}'', and Ducati continued to be the fastest with a bike that was markedly quicker than its rivals as was displayed by Casey Stoner on tracks with long straights.

For {{MGP|2009}}, [[Ducati Corse|Ducati Marlboro Team]] campaigned their [[Ducati Desmosedici#GP9|Desmosedici GP9]] with former World Champions [[Casey Stoner]] and [[Nicky Hayden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/motogp/news/81317/1/nicky-hayden-joins-ducati.html|title=Nicky Hayden joins Ducati|work=Crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=15 September 2008|quote=Hayden's Ducati move, which will see the 27-year-old line-up alongside 2007 world champion Casey Stoner, has been considered a done deal for months.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ducati also supplied [[customer]] bikes to [[Pramac Racing]], with [[Mika Kallio]] and [[Niccolò Canepa]] riding for the team in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2008/10/19/pramac-racing-announce-kallio-and-canepa-signings-for-2009/148505|title=Pramac Racing announce Kallio and Canepa signings for 2009|work=MotoGP.com|publisher=[[Dorna Sports]]|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ducati has entered a bike in every AMA Superbike season since 1986, but withdrew from the series after the 2006 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Minoli|first=Federico|url=http://blog.ducati.com/post/65/ama-next-year|title=AMA Next Year|publisher=ducati.com|date=22 August 2006|accessdate=25 January 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220234637/http://blog.ducati.com/post/65/ama-next-year|archivedate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Evan |url=http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2007/Mar/e/n070308b.htm |title=Ducati AMA Superbike Streak Ends |publisher=superbikeplanet.com |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=25 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516202843/http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2007/Mar/e/n070308b.htm |archivedate=16 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2006/Aug/060822a.htm |last=Adams |first=Dean |title=Bombshell: Ducati Pulls Out Of AMA Superbike |publisher=Superbikeplanet.net |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=25 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190036/http://www.superbikeplanet.com/2006/Aug/060822a.htm |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ducati had an important place in early Superbike racing history in the United States and vice versa: In 1977, [[Cycle (magazine)|''Cycle'' magazine]] editors [[Cook Neilson]] and [[Phil Schilling]] took a Ducati 750SS to first place at Daytona in the second-ever season of AMA Superbike racing. &quot;Neilson retired from racing at the end of the year, but the bike he and Schilling built — nicknamed Old Blue for its blue livery — became a legend,&quot; says Richard Backus from Motorcycle Classics: &quot;How big a legend? Big enough for Ducati to team with Italian specialty builder NCR to craft a limited-edition update, New Blue, based on the 2007 Sport 1000S, and big enough to inspire the crew at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum (see [[Barber Motorsports Park]]), arguably one of the most important motorcycle museums in the world, to commission Ducati specialist Rich Lambrechts to craft a bolt-by-bolt replica for its collection. The finished bike's name? Deja Blue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=January/February 2009 By Richard Backus |url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/Motorcycle-reviews/One-famous-Ducati-750SS.aspx |title=One famous Ducati 750SS |publisher=Motorcycleclassics.com |date= |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
