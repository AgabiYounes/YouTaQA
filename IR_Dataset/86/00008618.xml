His parents were fanatical [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] supporters who frequently travelled to [[Old Trafford]] from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of [[Bobby Charlton]]'s football schools in [[Manchester]] and won the chance to take part in a training session with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers, which was coached by his father, Stuart Underwood, and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and attended [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]'s school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for [[Brimsdown Rovers F.C.|Brimsdown Rovers]]' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Becks' Brimsdown boost, article from 24 September 2004|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFAVase/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/09/BecksBrimsdownBoost.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20041011163715/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFAVase/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/09/BecksBrimsdownBoost.htm|url-status=dead|archivedate=11 October 2004|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a [[Youth Training Scheme]] contract on 8 July 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;YTS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/plain/A1138600|title=David Beckham – Rise of a Footballer|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
====1991–1994: Youth and early career====
Having signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,&lt;ref name=&quot;H2G2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A1138600 |title=David Beckham – Rise of a Footballer |website=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Earth Edition |publisher=Not Panicking |accessdate=14 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham was part of a group of young players, including [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Gary Neville]], [[Phil Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]], who were coached by [[Eric Harrison (footballer)|Eric Harrison]], and helped the club win the [[FA Youth Cup]] in [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1990s#1991/92: Manchester United v. Crystal Palace (3-1 and 3-2, 6-3 Aggregate)|May 1992]]. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3–1 first-leg win of the final against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3–2 in favour of Manchester United and 6–3 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] in a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] match against [[Brighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton &amp; Hove Albion]]. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;H2G2&quot; /&gt;

Manchester United again reached the [[FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1990s#1992/93: Leeds United v. Manchester United (2-0 and 2-1, 4-1 Aggregate)|final of the FA Youth Cup]], where they faced [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2–0 home loss but was replaced by substitute [[Robbie Savage]]. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2–1 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4–1 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his [[UEFA Champions League]] debut, scoring a goal in a 4–0 victory at home to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1994/standings/index.html|title=Champions League 1994/95 Standings|publisher=UEFA|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1994–1995: Loan to Preston North End====
Beckham then went to [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] on loan for part of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]] to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a [[corner kick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2988104.stm |title=Beckham's pride at OBE |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2003 |accessdate=4 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1995–1996: Return to United and first Championship====
Beckham returned to Manchester and made his [[Premier League]] debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995, in a goalless draw against Leeds United. He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], missing out on a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for the [[1995 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 20 May, which United lost 1–0, leaving the club without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Hart (1995). &quot;The Guinness football encyclopedia&quot;. p. 69. Guinness&lt;/ref&gt;

United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as &quot;[[Fergie's Fledglings]]&quot;), which included [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Gary Neville|Gary]] and [[Phil Neville]]. When experienced players [[Paul Ince]], [[Mark Hughes]], and [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] left the club after the end of the 1994–95 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including [[Darren Anderton]], [[Marc Overmars]] and [[Roberto Baggio]], but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3–1 defeat at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;The most famous comment was [[Alan Hansen]]'s &quot;You can't win anything with kids&quot;, quoted in ''The Boss'' 405. Beckham scored United's goal (his first for them in the league) from a distance of around 30&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;/ref&gt; with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game. However, United recovered from this early season defeat and the young players performed well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Sir-Alex-25-Years/Trophies/Trophy-Articles/League-199596.aspx|title=Man Utd season review 1995/96|accessdate=12 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232144/http://www.manutd.com/en/Sir-Alex-25-Years/Trophies/Trophy-Articles/League-199596.aspx|archive-date=25 May 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and [[FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and also providing the [[corner kick|corner]] from which [[Eric Cantona]] scored in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his teammates had overhauled the [[Tyneside]]rs at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly and to a consistently high standard for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Euro 96 stars going strong |url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/01/Euro96_Feature.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20050326090133/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2005/01/Euro96_Feature.htm |url-status=dead |archivedate=26 March 2005 |publisher=The Football Association |date=21 January 2005 |accessdate=16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1996–1998: First-choice and inheriting No. 7 shirt====

{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote=&quot;It changed my life. The ball seemed to be in the air for hours and it all went quiet. Then the ball went in and it just erupted. I was on cloud nine.&quot;|source=—Beckham on the goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 that made him a household name.&lt;ref&gt;Gwen Russell (2011). &quot;Arise Sir David Beckham: Footballer, Celebrity, Legend – The Biography of Britain's Best Loved Sporting Icon&quot;. John Blake Publishing,&lt;/ref&gt; It was ranked number 18 on Channel 4’s poll of the [[100 Greatest Sporting Moments]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Channel4 Greatest&quot;/&gt;}}
At the beginning of the [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97 season]], Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the [[Premier League]] season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]. With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper [[Neil Sullivan]] was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line – 60 yards out – that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sky Sports]]' commentator [[Martin Tyler]]'s words ''&quot;You'll see that over and over again&quot;'' proved prophetic as the goal was voted Premier League Goal of the Decade in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====1998–1999: Treble====
[[File:1999 FA Cup Final Beckham corner.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham preparing to take a corner kick for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] during the [[1999 FA Cup Final]] at Wembley Stadium]]
In the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99 season]], he was part of the United team that won the [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the Premier League, FA Cup and [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], a unique feat in English football.&lt;ref name=&quot;treble&quot;/&gt; There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham decided to stay at Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Legends/David-Beckham.aspx?pageNo=2|title=Manchester United Legends: David Beckham|accessdate=12 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007021554/http://www.manutd.com/en/Players-And-Staff/Legends/David-Beckham.aspx?pageNo=2|archive-date=7 October 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. There were reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be beaten to prevent their local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title, but Tottenham took an early lead in the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;treble&quot;/&gt; Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United went on to win the match and the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;treble&quot;/&gt;

Beckham played in central midfield in United's win over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final]], since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and [[Roy Keane]] were suspended for the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;treble&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_treble_triumph/354262.stm|title=The Kings of Europe|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; United were losing the match 1–0 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham.&lt;ref name=&quot;treble&quot;/&gt; Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to [[Rivaldo]] for 1999's [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] and [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/ballondor/archive/edition=1999901999/|title=Rivaldo on top of the world|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1999–2000: Another Championship====
Despite Beckham's achievements in the 1998–99 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's [[FIFA Club World Cup|World Club Championship]] match against [[Club Necaxa|Necaxa]]. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Man Utd's flawed genius? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/593905.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=7 January 2000 |accessdate=6 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999–2000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in [[1999–2000 in English football|1999–2000]] by an 18-point margin, after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/738587.stm|title=Man Utd celebrate in style|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000–2001: Troubled relationship with Ferguson====
By the early 2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had [[gastroenteritis]], but Ferguson was furious when [[Victoria Beckham]] was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages – then £50,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United. He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been &quot;fair to his teammates&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Boss'' 469.&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing – from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part.&quot;' – Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ferguson-will-never-talk-to-the-bbc-again-401487.html|title=Ferguson will never talk to the BBC again|last=Harris|first=Nick|date=6 September 2007|work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was a key player in United's third successive league title in [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01]], only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League.

====2001–2002: Contract extension====
On 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against [[Deportivo de La Coruña]], breaking the second [[Metatarsus|metatarsal]] bone in his left foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine [[Aldo Duscher]], and [[England national football team|England]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] were due to meet in that year's World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Did 'hatchet man' target Beckham? |publisher=ESPN Socernet |date=2 April 2002 |url=http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2002/0402/20020411featwright.html |accessdate=7 October 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716052613/http://www.soccernet.com/championsleague/news/2002/0402/20020411featwright.html |archivedate=16 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] by [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beckham signs new contract |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/newsid_1976000/1976699.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 May 2002 |accessdate=7 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the injury, 2001–02 was arguably Beckham's best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best of his career.

====2002–2003: Boot incident and United exit====
Following an injury early in the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]], Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]] having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/2778985.stm|title=Man Utd play down Arsenal rift|date=19 February 2003|publisher=BBC Sport }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Matrix: Milan are favourites|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia//dec21o.html|work=Football Italia|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=21 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224070722/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia//dec21o.html|archivedate=24 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/04/28/1234261/silvestre-reminisces-about-fergusons-infamous-boot-throwing-at-be |title=Silvestre Reminisces About Ferguson's Infamous Boot-Throwing at Beckham Incident |publisher=Goal.com |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?Revealed:_What_happened_when_Beckham_was_hit_by_a_boot_in_the_face&amp;in_article_id=638192&amp;in_page_id=43 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903220624/http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?Revealed:_What_happened_when_Beckham_was_hit_by_a_boot_in_the_face&amp;in_article_id=638192&amp;in_page_id=43 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 September 2012 |title=Revealed: What happened when Beckham was hit by a boot in the face |work=Metro |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.co.uk/news/Football/18653/Silvestre_relives_Ferguson_throwing_boot_at_Beckham.aspx |title=Silvestre relives Ferguson throwing boot at Beckham |publisher=Sport.co.uk |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodinger |first=Katie |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/07/29/why-ryan-giggs-is-more-scared-of-his-mum-than-fergie-91466-21423456/ |title=Why Ryan Giggs is more scared of his mum than Fergie |publisher=WalesOnline |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013212846/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/07/29/why-ryan-giggs-is-more-scared-of-his-mum-than-fergie-91466-21423456/ |archivedate=13 October 2012 |df= |date=28 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or kicked a [[Football boot|boot]] that struck Beckham over the eye, causing a cut that required stitches.

He was still a first-choice player for England, however, and was appointed an [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) for services to football on 13 June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beckham's pride at OBE |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2988104.stm |accessdate=6 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], one Intercontinental Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind [[Ryan Giggs]] (having joined them at the same time as [[Nicky Butt]], [[Gary Neville]] and [[Paul Scholes]]).

Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt by club legend [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real unveil Beckham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3037824.stm |accessdate=25 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was assigned to club captain [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]]. He decided to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player [[Michael Jordan]], who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,,990894,00.html|title=The number 23|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=3 June 2003|accessdate=9 June 2007 |first=Sally |last=Bolton }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beckham zidane.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Beckham (top) and [[Zinedine Zidane]] at Real Madrid in August 2003]]
In the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named [[Carlos Queiroz]] as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham was reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid, since Queiroz had spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as Beckham, however, made this particular tour a financial smash for ''los Merengues''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What Did the Real Madrid Leave behind for Asia? |work=China Daily |date=21 August 2003 |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-08/15/content_255106.htm |accessdate=25 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his transfer to Real, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of [[Live Nation Entertainment|SFX Europe]], who had guided him through his career until that point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with [[Simon Fuller]] and his company [[19 Entertainment]], which already managed the career of Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham also appointed close friend [[Terry Byrne]] to be his personal manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;galaxy-millions&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/3229703.stm |title=Beckham bags Watford man |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 October 2003 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2003, Real Madrid won the [[2003 Supercopa de España|Spanish Super Cup]] over two legs versus [[RCD Mallorca]], with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3–0 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing in a star-laden team which included three former [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] recipients, [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Luís Figo]], in addition to [[Roberto Carlos]], [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]] and [[Iker Casillas]], Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5–3–2 formation, with two fullbacks [[Míchel Salgado]] and [[Roberto Carlos]], often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield, alongside Zidane and Figo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/t/t2003-042.html |title=2003–04 Real Madrid |publisher=Bdfutbol.com |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real Madrid were runners-up in the [[2003–04 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president Pérez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of [[gasoline|petrol]]. Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intruder alert for Victoria Beckham |publisher=Manchester Online |date=20 July 2004 |url=http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/124/124434_intruder_alert_for_victoria_beckham.html |accessdate=9 October 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222010135/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/news/s/124/124434_intruder_alert_for_victoria_beckham.html |archivedate=22 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2004–2005: Managerial changes====
The league season began with new head coach [[José Antonio Camacho]] at the helm, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant [[Mariano García Remón]] took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling [[Ben Thatcher]] in an England match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next [[Yellow card (sports)|caution]], and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. [[The Football Association]] asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had &quot;made a mistake&quot; and apologised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FA wants explanation from Beckham |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/3735276.stm |accessdate=6 October 2005 |date=14 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. Having received a [[Misconduct (football)|yellow card]], he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.

By Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second position in the league, García Remón was dismissed, and [[Vanderlei Luxemburgo]] became the new head coach. However, the well-travelled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against [[Getafe CF]]. A day later Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by [[Juan Ramón López Caro]]. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists.

====2005–2006: Another unsuccessful season====
[[File:Beckham warmingup.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Beckham warming up with Real Madrid in August 2006]]
During the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maul|first=Kimberly|title=David Beckham: Soccer Star and Book Judge|url=http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001842661|publisher=The Book Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212115110/http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001842661|archivedate=12 December 2007|date=11 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005–06 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and only reached the last 16 in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as Pérez resigned his post as president in January 2006, with [[Vicente Boluda]] named as replacement on an interim basis until the end of the season.

====2006–2007: Real Madrid exit====
The summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as the club's presidential elections were held. [[Ramón Calderón]] became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials who served under the previous president was kept, including head coach López Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach [[Fabio Capello]], Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier [[José Antonio Reyes]] was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director [[Predrag Mijatović]] announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/10/sports/web.0110beckham.php |title=Uncertainty over Beckham's future at Real Madrid |work=International Herald Tribune |date=10 January 2007 |accessdate=10 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220071830/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/10/sports/web.0110beckham.php |archivedate=20 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for the [[LA Galaxy]] beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he continued to train with the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/6259063.stm|title=Real coach calls time on Beckham |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 January 2007|accessdate=13 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calderón said that Beckham is &quot;going to Hollywood to be half a film star&quot;, adding &quot;our technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except Los Angeles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jack |last=Bell |title=Real Madrid Club President Says a Mouthful

About a month later, however, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against [[Real Sociedad]] on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick, as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6346573.stm|title=Beckham scores on Madrid return |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2007|accessdate=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League knockout stage|round-of-16 stage]] (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. Beckham played a pivotal role in all three Madrid goals in the home game, with Bayern goalkeeper [[Oliver Kahn]] describing his performance as &quot;world class&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/21/match.realmadrid|title=Beckham shines to give Real a slight advantage|first=Simon|last=Talbot|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=12 September 2014|date=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beckham 2 (2114756146).jpg|thumb|left|Beckham during his last season with Real Madrid]]
On 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3–1 win over Mallorca which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0–1, Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by José Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals, leading the team to that season's [[2006–07 La Liga|La Liga title]], their first since Beckham had signed with them and [[Real Madrid C.F.#Domestic competitions|30th overall in the club's history]]. Although Real and Barçelona both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of their superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liga&quot;/&gt; With his wife and children, along with celebrity friends [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Katie Holmes]], watching from a luxury box at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]], it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liga&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6759697.stm|title=Beckham bows out with Liga title|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Millward |first=Robert |title=Agent: Beckham Sticking to Galaxy Deal |work=The Washington Post |date=10 June 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/10/AR2007061000751.html |accessdate=14 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival in the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600&amp;nbsp;million during Beckham's four years at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Paul |last=Maidment |title=Becks And Bucks |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/sports/2007/07/07/beckham-soccer-marketing-face-markets-cx_pm_0707autofacescan01.html |work=Forbes |date=7 July 2007 |accessdate=14 August 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101184121/http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/sports/2007/07/07/beckham-soccer-marketing-face-markets-cx_pm_0707autofacescan01.html|archivedate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham's involvement with [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side [[LA Galaxy]]. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the [[2007 MLS SuperDraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Halpin |first=Jason |title=Events surround MLS SuperDraft |url=http://la.galaxy.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070110&amp;content_id=81545&amp;vkey=news_mls&amp;fext=.jsp|publisher=MLSnet.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527211351/http://la.galaxy.mlsnet.com/news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20070110&amp;content_id=81545&amp;vkey=news_mls&amp;fext=.jsp |archivedate=27 May 2008 |date=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beckham first goal LA Galaxy.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham scores his first goal for LA Galaxy with a trademark free-kick.]]
The announcement made global headlines and elevated the league's profile. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/01/11/beckham.mls/ Beckham will play for MLS' L.A. Galaxy in $250M deal]; ''Sports Illustrated'', 11 January 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725000850/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/soccer/01/11/beckham.mls/ |date=25 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency [[19 Entertainment]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5&amp;nbsp;million in total or $6.5&amp;nbsp;million per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;galaxy-millions&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Beckham rejected Milan and Inter to take Galaxy millions |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/beckham-rejected-milan-and-inter-to-take-galaxy-millions-431736.html |work=The Independent |date=12 January 2007 |accessdate=9 September 2008 |location=London |first=Sam |last=Wallace }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with [[Herbalife]] nutrition company worth US$20&amp;nbsp;million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the [[Dignity Health Sports Park|Home Depot Center]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Beckham Experiment p.44&quot;&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.44&lt;/ref&gt; LA Galaxy owners [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]], where the company had been working aggressively for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO [[Tim Leiweke]] put it as follows: &quot;Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|MLS expansion]] franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25&amp;nbsp;million whenever he stopped playing in the league&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/51723/beckham-is-mls-expansion-story-du-jour.html|title=Beckham is MLS expansion story du jour|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|date=20 May 2013|work=Soccer Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Beckham Experiment p.44&quot;/&gt; The league had a [[salary cap]] in place, requiring the creation of the [[Designated Player Rule]] for Beckham to bypass the cap; the rule was later nicknamed in his honor. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2&amp;nbsp;million home on San Ysidro Drive in [[Beverly Hills]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Beckham Experiment p.66&quot;&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Beckham (with a blue captain's armband) became LA Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team]]
Beckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham chose to wear number 23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nysun.com/national/soccer-player-beckham-sparks-13m-in-sales/52872/|title=Soccer Player Beckham Sparks $13M in Sales for Galaxy|publisher=New York Sun|accessdate=17 August 2019|date=20 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', a few weeks earlier [[Adidas]] launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign &quot;Fútbol meets Football&quot; starring Beckham and [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Reggie Bush]], and ''W'' magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]]. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air ''David Beckham: New Beginnings'' documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by [[Simon Fuller]], who in turn has a business relationship with the [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&amp;nbsp;million headquarters in [[Century City]] with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special ''[[Victoria Beckham: Coming to America]]'' aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, pp.69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007 Direction.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Beckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007]]
On Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for [[Alan Gordon (soccer)|Alan Gordon]] in the 78th minute of a 0–1 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the [[World Series of Soccer (MLS)|World Series of Soccer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|title=David Beckham's First Match in Major League Soccer Live on ESPN Saturday, 21&amp;nbsp;July|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=14 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224213616/http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|archivedate=24 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, [[Eva Longoria]], [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Drew Carey]] among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Michael Ballack]], and [[Frank Lampard]], the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by [[Steve Sidwell]] whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US – a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Beckham Experiment p.66&quot;/&gt; As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than [[2007 Open Championship|British Open]] golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the [[2007 IndyCar Series season|Indy Racing League]]'s [[2007 Honda 200|Honda 200]] motor race.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Beckham Experiment p.66&quot;/&gt;

The day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood [[A-list]]ers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.68–70&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches – three in the [[North American SuperLiga]] and an MLS game away at [[Toronto FC]] though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star [[King Edward Hotel (Toronto)|Le Méridien King Edward]] in [[downtown Toronto]] (an expense paid for by the local [[Toronto]] promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.&lt;ref&gt;''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.85–87&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beckham LA Galaxy cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008]]
Two weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus [[D.C. United]] in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]], coming on for [[Quavas Kirk]] in the 71st minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/2007-08-09-beckham-debut_N.htm |title=Beckham makes MLS debut but Galaxy stumbles in D.C. |work=USA Today |accessdate=15 August 2007 |first=Beau |last=Dure |date=12 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that [[Carlos Pavón]] failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into [[Landon Donovan]]'s path that United's keeper [[Troy Perkins]] managed to break up in the last moment – the Galaxy lost 1–0. The next match on the road trip was at [[New England Revolution]] and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the [[Gillette Stadium]]'s artificial surface.

Beckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]] semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=453684&amp;root=mls&amp;cc=5901|title=Beckham takes captain's armband to great effect|publisher=ESPN |date=16 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2–0 victory, and a place in the [[2007 North American SuperLiga|North American SuperLiga]] final versus [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] on 29 August.

During the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan revealing that he had sprained his [[medial collateral ligament]] and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1–0 loss to the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league).

Beckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7171836.stm |title=Beckham begins Arsenal training |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in the ninth minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&amp;cc=5901 |title=Beckham, Donovan propel L.A. past Quakes |publisher=ESPN |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408050045/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&amp;cc=5901 |archivedate=8 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]] 3–1, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70&amp;nbsp;yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] at [[Selhurst Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=538785&amp;root=mls&amp;cc=5901 |title=ESPNsoccernet – MLS – Canales: Beckham shows scoring touch against Wizards |publisher=ESPN |first=Andrea |last=Canales |accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.

====2009: Loan to A.C. Milan====
[[File:David Beckham at Al Saad (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Beckham playing for [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]]]
In 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under [[Fabio Capello]] led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying matches]] in 2009. On 30 October 2008, [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] announced that Beckham was to join them on [[loan (football)|loan]] from 7 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beckham to join Milan in January |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7697377.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 October 2008 |accessdate=30 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this and other speculation, Beckham made it clear that the move in no way signalled his intent to leave MLS and announced his intent to return to the Galaxy in time for the start of the [[2009 Major League Soccer season|2009 season]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Beckham Milan Update |url=http://web.mlsnet.com/media/player/mp_tpl.jsp?w=mms%3A//a1503.v115042.c11504.g.vm.akamaistream.net/7/1503/11504/v0001/mlbmls.download.akamai.com/11504/2008/shows/t106/102408_lag_beckham_int2.wmv&amp;w_id=27284&amp;catCode=shows&amp;type=v_free&amp;_mp=1 |publisher=Major League Soccer |date=25 October 2008 |accessdate=25 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028032340/http://web.mlsnet.com/media/player/mp_tpl.jsp?w=mms%3A%2F%2Fa1503.v115042.c11504.g.vm.akamaistream.net%2F7%2F1503%2F11504%2Fv0001%2Fmlbmls.download.akamai.com%2F11504%2F2008%2Fshows%2Ft106%2F102408_lag_beckham_int2.wmv&amp;w_id=27284&amp;catCode=shows&amp;type=v_free&amp;_mp=1 |archivedate=28 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many at Milan both within and outside of the club expressed serious reservations about the transfer, with it considered by some players no more than a marketing move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Beckham Conquered Milan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7887918.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 February 2009 |accessdate=10 March 2009 |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham was unveiled at Milan's [[Milanello|training facility]] by the club's chief executive [[Adriano Galliani]] on 20 December 2008. The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by [[Christian Vieri]], as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by [[Alexandre Pato]] and club vice captain [[Massimo Ambrosini]], respectively. The day after his unveiling, Beckham was brought to [[San Siro]] where he got introduced to home fans by walking out on the pitch before the league match versus [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] and proclaiming &quot;Forza Milan&quot; over the public address system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/3899667/David-Beckham-makes-San-Siro-entrance-with-Forza-Milan.html |title=David Beckham officially unveiled in Milan |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=22 December 2008 |accessdate=2 December 2012 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3WnTU88M40 |title=Intervista Sky Sport a Beckham all'intervallo di Milan-Udinese |publisher=Sky Sport 24 |date=21 December 2008 |accessdate=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar [[Kaká]] in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers – 28-year-old [[Ronaldinho]], and 29-year-old [[Andrea Pirlo]] – as well as club veterans [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], Massimo Ambrosini, [[Giuseppe Favalli]], [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Filippo Inzaghi]] and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the ''rossoneri'' in Serie A as a starter away at [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] on 11 January 2009, playing 89&amp;nbsp;minutes of the 2–2 draw in front of 53,444 at the [[Stadio Olimpico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=251467&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=ITA.1 |title=AS Roma 2–2 AC Milan |publisher=ESPN |date=11 January 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510203728/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=251467&amp;cc=5901&amp;league=ITA.1 |archivedate=10 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s decision to play him from the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/12/david-beckham-serie-a-milan-roma |title=Beckham proves a big draw but fails to make major impression on debut for Milan |work=The Guardian |date=12 January 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2012 |location=London |first=Tom |last=Kington}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Beckham's home debut against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] a week later, he turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1–0 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kaká, imploring him to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/jan/18/milan-kaka-manchester-city-fiorentina-berlusconi-ancelotti |title=Fans beg Kaka to stay but Pato is the hero in Milan victory |work=The Guardian |date=18 January 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2012 |location=London |first=Tom |last=Kington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noticeably older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4–1 victory over [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]] on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=612673&amp;&amp;cc=5901 |title=Beckham scores first goal for AC Milan |publisher=ESPN |date=25 January 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. Milan, however, failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10–15&amp;nbsp;million range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=616973&amp;cc=5901 |title=Galaxy reject AC Milan's opening gambit for Becks |publisher=ESPN |date=7 February 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, negotiations continued during a month of speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=619909&amp;cc=5901 |title=Beckham's future to be resolved on Friday? |publisher=ESPN |date=17 February 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 March, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Beckham's loan had been extended through mid-July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jones |first=Grahame L. |title=Beckham agrees to return to Galaxy in mid-July |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-beckham-milan-galaxy3-2009mar03,0,6510100.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2 March 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303222556/http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-beckham-milan-galaxy3-2009mar03%2C0%2C6510100.story |archivedate= 3 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later confirmed by Beckham, revealing what was described as a unique &quot;[[timeshare]]&quot; deal, in which Beckham would play with L.A. from mid-July until the end of the 2009 MLS season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article5871341.ece |title=David Beckham 'dream' deal |work=The Times |date=9 March 2009 |accessdate=9 March 2009 |location=London |first=Nick |last=Szczepanik }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009: Return to Galaxy====
After his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying &quot;Go home fraud&quot;, and &quot;Part-time player&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beckham booed by furious fans |publisher=BBC Sport |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/8159287.stm |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Galaxy, however, had [[2009 Los Angeles Galaxy season|a much more successful season]] than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 [[Western Conference (MLS)|Western Conference final]] after a 2–0 overtime victory over the [[Houston Dynamo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/sports/soccer/15galaxy.html|title=Two Blackouts and Two Goals Send Galaxy to M.L.S.

In the [[2009 MLS Cup|final]] on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to [[Real Salt Lake]] by 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw. Beckham also scored in the shootout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=702587&amp;sec=global&amp;cc=5739|title=Salt Lake beat L.A.

====2010: Return to Milan (loan)====
In November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/02/david-beckham-milan-loan|title=David Beckham's loan move to Milan from LA Galaxy is confirmed|date=2 November 2009|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return in a Milan shirt, playing 75&amp;nbsp;minutes of a 5–2 victory over [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8444755.stm|title=David Beckham makes winning return for AC Milan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 January 2010|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against Manchester United for the first time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76&amp;nbsp;minutes of the match at the San Siro – which ended 3–2 to Manchester United – before being substituted for Clarence Seedorf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Lyon |title=AC Milan 2–3 Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8515983.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=16 February 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham returned to Old Trafford for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for [[Ignazio Abate]] in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3–0 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4–0, winning the tie 7–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 4–0 AC Milan (agg 7–2) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8558023.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner [[Malcolm Glazer]]. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around [[Manchester United Supporters' Trust]] gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Beckham shows true colours |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/philmcnulty/2010/03/beckham_shows_true_colours.html |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 March 2010 |accessdate=13 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Milan's next game, against [[A.C. Chievo Verona|Chievo]], Beckham suffered a [[Achilles tendon rupture|torn left Achilles tendon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England's David Beckham is injured playing for AC Milan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/8567353.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; causing him to miss the World Cup as well as the [[2010 Major League Soccer season|MLS season]] due to the injury, which took him out of action for the next five months. Doctor [[Sakari Orava]] performed surgery on Beckham's tendon in [[Turku]], Finland, on 15 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Milan/15-03-2010/beckham-stagione-finita-603312286519.shtml |title=Beckham, stagione finita È sicuro: salta il Mondiale – Risultati e ultime notizie calcio e calciomercato |work=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the operation, Orava affirmed that, &quot;it went quite fine.

====2010: Second return to Galaxy====
[[File:David Beckham 2010 LA Galaxy.jpg|thumb|upright|Beckham in 2010]]
On 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3–1 win over [[Columbus Crew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8991596.stm|title=David Beckham returns to action after Achilles injury |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 September 2010|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, Beckham scored a trademark free kick in a 2–1 win over [[Chivas USA]] to mark his first goal in [[2010 Major League Soccer season|2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=829955&amp;sec=global&amp;cc=5739|title=Beckham goal sends Galaxy top of Western Conference|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October, Beckham scored his second goal of the season in the Galaxy's 2–1 win over [[FC Dallas]] which secured them their second successive [[Western Conference (MLS)|Western Conference]] title and first [[MLS Supporters' Shield]] since [[Major League Soccer 2002 Season|2002]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9122837.stm|title=David Beckham helps LA Galaxy win Supporters' Shield |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2010|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011: MLS Cup champion====
During January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur. Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager [[Harry Redknapp]], the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AEG blocked Becks switch |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11675_6742492,00.html |work=Sky Sports |date=9 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Galaxy won the 2011 MLS cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLS final&quot;/&gt;

[[File:David Beckham 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Beckham with LA Galaxy in 2012]]
On 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4–1 victory over Sporting Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/los-angeles/soccer/post/_/id/8106/galaxy-donovan-possession-spark-big-win|title=Donovan, possession spark big win|publisher=ESPN Los Angeles|date=15 May 2011|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner in a 2–1 win over Chicago Fire, repeating a feat he also achieved while playing for [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2011-07-10-948918221_x.htm|title=Beckham scores from corner to give Galaxy victory|work=USA Today|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won league titles in three countries, when Los Angeles won their third [[MLS Cup]] against the Houston Dynamo, winning 1–0 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player [[Robbie Keane]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MLS final&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7263458/mls-cup-landon-donovan-goal-powers-galaxy-third-mls-title |title=MLS Cup – Landon Donovan's goal powers Galaxy to third MLS title |publisher=ESPN |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Grant|last=Wahl|title=Hollywood Ending: If this was indeed David Beckham's final game in MLS, he went out in style, carrying the Galaxy to a championship and affirming the value of star power in America|date=28 November 2011|magazine=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1192446/index.htm|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012: Second successive cup victory====
Following the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive [[Supporters' Shield]], having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily linked with [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2012/01/la-galaxy-re-sign-david-beckham |title=David Beckham re-signs with LA Galaxy, LA Galaxy official website |publisher=Lagalaxy.com |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/16625942 |title=CBBC Newsround – Beckham stays with LA Galaxy and signs two-year deal |publisher=BBC |date=19 January 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/beckham-signs-year-deal-la-galaxy-15389465 |title=Beckham Signs New 2-Year-Deal With LA Galaxy |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kay |first=Simon |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/887779-david-beckham-signs-new-two-year-la-galaxy-deal |title=David Beckham signs new two-year LA Galaxy deal |work=Metro |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Beckham and his victorious teammates were received by [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] at the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18081171|title=President Obama teases David Beckham at White House|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 September 2014|date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham helped the Galaxy to a fourth-place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists.

===Euro 2000, and England captaincy===
The abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during [[UEFA Euro 2000 Group A#Portugal vs England|England's 3–2 defeat]] by [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match.&lt;ref&gt;A reference to Brooklyn {{cite web |title=Leader – Play games behind closed doors |work=New Statesman |date=26 June 2000 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200006260003 |accessdate=4 October 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127032613/http://www.newstatesman.com/200006260003|archivedate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham responded by [[finger (gesture)|raising his middle finger]] and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to stop abusing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Media sympathy for Beckham's gesture |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 June 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/euro2000/teams/england/790657.stm |accessdate=4 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 November 2000, following [[Kevin Keegan]]'s resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]], and then kept the role under new manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;captain&quot;/&gt;

Beckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], starring in an impressive 5–1 victory over [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened in England's final qualifying game against [[Greece national football team|Greece]] on 6 October 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greece&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2002/1575190.stm|title=England reach World Cup finals|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2–1 with little time remaining.

Beckham was partially fit by the time of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] held in Japan and South Korea, and played in the first match against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].

The following month, at the opening ceremony of the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]] in Manchester, Beckham escorted [[Kirsty Howard]] as she presented the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Jubilee Baton to the Queen]]. Beckham played in all of England's matches at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]].

===2006 FIFA World Cup===
In England's opening game at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an [[own-goal]] by [[Carlos Gamarra]] as England won 1–0. In England's next match, played against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a [[Peter Crouch]] goal, which put England into the lead 1–0. Beckham gave another assist to [[Steven Gerrard]]. In the end they won 2–0. He was named [[Man of the Match]] by tournament sponsor [[Budweiser]].

During England's second round match against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]], Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate World Cups,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecuador&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5103974.stm |title=England 1–0 Ecuador |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and giving England a 1–0 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of [[dehydration]] and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecuador&quot;/&gt; In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3–1), the score having been 0–0 after extra time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991618.stm|title=England 0–0 Portugal|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SPORT/football/07/01/worldcup.portugal/|title=Portugal sink England on Penalties|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference that he had stepped down as England captain,&lt;ref name=&quot;captain&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/england/5138288.stm |title=Beckham quits as England captain |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating, &quot;It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95&lt;ref&gt;This was an error on Beckham's part – he had played 94 times for England by this stage.&lt;/ref&gt; games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under [[Steve McClaren]].&quot; (Beckham had won 94 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] up to that point.)

Having stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach [[Steve McClaren]] on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was &quot;looking to go in a different direction&quot; with the team, and that Beckham &quot;wasn't included within that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/4782613.stm|title=McLaren ends Beckham England era|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]], [[Kieran Richardson]], and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, [[Aaron Lennon]], were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ [[Steven Gerrard]] in that role.

On 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in England's first match at the new [[Wembley Stadium]] and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain [[John Terry]]. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer [[Diego Ribas da Cunha|Diego]] equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], Beckham sent two trademark assists for [[Michael Owen]] and [[Peter Crouch]], helping England to prevail 3–0.

On 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against [[France national football team|France]] in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Beckham to start in Paris for 100th cap |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/03/26/football.beckham/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=26 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329225706/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/football/03/26/football.beckham/index.html |archivedate=29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to face the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 28 May before the away fixture with [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] on 1 June. Beckham was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from [[Bobby Charlton]], and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for [[David Bentley]], the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hart &amp; Jagielka in England Squad|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7395247.stm |publisher=BBC |date=11 May 2008 |accessdate=11 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated (though temporarily) as England captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Capello names Beckham as captain for T&amp;T friendly |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/8193404/Capello-names-Beckham-as-captain-for-T&amp;T-friendly |publisher=[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] |date=31 May 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712104347/http://msn.foxsports.com/soccer/story/8193404/Capello-names-Beckham-as-captain-for-T%26T-friendly |archivedate=12 July 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] in which England won 3–1 in [[Minsk]], Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's third-most-[[cap (sport)|capped]] player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with [[Bobby Moore]]'s record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for [[Stewart Downing]] in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=260599&amp;cc=5901 |title=Report: Spain vs England – International Friendly |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=4 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215121358/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=260599&amp;cc=5901 |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 2009, Beckham surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute in a friendly against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]], providing the assist for a goal from Wayne Rooney in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fletcher |first=Paul |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7966672.stm |title=International football as it happened |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 March 2009 |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name=BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture/&gt; His last game for England before injury had been on 14 October 2009 as a substitute in England's last World Cup qualifying game, which ended [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 6|England 3 – 0 Belarus]].&lt;ref name=BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture/&gt;

After a poor performance from England at the World Cup, Capello remained as manager but was under pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group G|UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign]]. He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following month.&lt;ref name=BBC11Aug2010NoEnglandFuture/&gt; In the post-match interview, Capello said of the prospect of the now 35-year-old Beckham playing any future competitive matches for England, that &quot;I need to change it.

==Approach to training and discipline==

===Training and praise from managers===
{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote=&quot;David Beckham is Britain's finest striker of a football not because of God-given talent but because he practises with a relentless application that the vast majority of less gifted players wouldn't contemplate.&quot;|source=—Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt;}}
Beckham was a product of Sir [[Alex Ferguson]]'s hard-working approach at Manchester United, and was renowned for his long-range passing, crossing ability, and [[Curl (football)|bending]] free-kicks as a right winger, which enabled him to excel in this role, despite his lack of significant pace and his preference for using his stronger right foot. Ferguson noted that Beckham &quot;practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other players wouldn't care about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/features/news/newsid=1551015/index.html &quot;Kings of the free-kick&quot;].

Beckham maintained his training routine at [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and even when his relationship with management was strained in early 2007, Real Madrid president [[Ramón Calderón]] and manager [[Fabio Capello]] praised Beckham for maintaining his professionalism and commitment to the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2007-01/14/content_782993.htm|title=Beckham will not play for Real again – Capello|work=China Daily|date=14 January 2007|accessdate=28 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/13/sports/EU-SPT-SOC-Real-Madrid-Beckham.php |title=Coach says Beckham won't play again for Real Madrid |work=International Herald Time |date=13 January 2007 |accessdate=28 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620123856/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/13/sports/EU-SPT-SOC-Real-Madrid-Beckham.php |archivedate=20 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham's Real Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos regarded Beckham to be the best free-kick exponent he had ever seen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberto Carlos&quot;/&gt; Two of the best free kick exponents of their generation, [[Roberto Carlos]] commented on the dilemma the team faced when they won a free kick on the edge of the penalty area: &quot;I would stand on one side and Beckham on the other but I wanted to see Beckham take the free-kick because it's beautiful how he hits the ball.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberto Carlos&quot;&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=esp/news/newsid=765938.html &quot;Beckham is best says Roberto Carlos&quot;].

In May 2013, asked about how he wanted to be remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, &quot;I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that – every time I stepped on the pitch – I've given everything that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I look back on it and hope people will see me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

===Discipline===
Beckham was the first England player ever to collect two red cards, and the first England captain to be sent off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article576493.ece|title=Beckham red card but joy for Sven|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham's most notorious red card was during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] after [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]'s [[Diego Simeone]] had fouled him: Beckham, lying face down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Argentina&quot;/&gt;

He amassed 41 yellow cards and four red cards in his time at Real Madrid; all four reds came in La Liga.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnfc.com&quot;&gt;ESPN player statistics: David Beckham (accessed 29 April 2013) http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/8880/david-beckham?cc=5739&lt;/ref&gt; He received one red card while at Paris Saint-Germain, picked up in injury time in a match against [[Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C.|Evian]] on 28 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22334844 |title=David Beckham sent off after six minutes in PSG victory |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 April 2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2013, Beckham played 420 competitive games for England, Milan, LA Galaxy, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG, and received seven red cards, one every 60 matches on average.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnfc.com&quot;/&gt;

On 9 May 2019, at Bromley Magistrates Court, Beckham was banned from driving for six months. He previously pleaded guilty to using a mobile phone while driving his Bentley in central London on 21 November 2018. The court heard he was photographed by a member of the public holding a phone as he drove in &quot;slowly moving&quot; traffic. Beckham received 6 points on his licence to add to the 6 he already had for previous speeding matters. He was also fined £750, and ordered to pay £100 in prosecution costs and a £75 surcharge fee within seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-48213106 |title = Beckham banned for using phone in Bentley|publisher = BBC News|date = 9 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tattoos===
{{as of|2017}}, Beckham had more than 50 tattoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=David Beckham 'sure' his son will regret his tattoos |url=https://www.msn.com/en-ie/news/other/david-beckham-sure-his-son-will-regret-his-tattoos/ar-BBGtTYN |accessdate=19 October 2018 |publisher=MSN |date=10 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019075752/https://www.msn.com/en-ie/news/other/david-beckham-sure-his-son-will-regret-his-tattoos/ar-BBGtTYN |archive-date=19 October 2018 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in [[Sanskrit]] script because Beckham thought it would be &quot;tacky&quot; to have it in English. However, this was misspelt as the equivalent of &quot;Vihctoria&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1044797.stm |title=Beckham's tattoo misspelt |publisher=BBC News |date=28 November 2000 |accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography ''David Beckham: My Side'', he said that the idea of having tattoos came to him in 1999 after his son Brooklyn was born, following a conversation on the subject of tattoos with [[Melanie Brown|Mel B]] and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar. Beckham said: &quot;When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beckham, David (2010). &quot;David Beckham: My Side&quot;.

==Outside football==
[[File:David Beckham 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Beckham in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, December 2009]]
Beckham's fame extends beyond the [[Association football pitch|pitch]]; in much of the world his name is &quot;as instantly recognisable as that of multinational companies like [[Coca-Cola]] and [[IBM]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thisismoney&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/special-report/article.html?in_article_id=409642&amp;in_page_id=108|title=Beckham the worldwide brand|work=This is Money|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckham's relationship and marriage to Victoria, who has been famous in her own right as part of the [[Spice Girls]], contributed to his celebrity beyond football.

Beckham became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, perfume and cosmetics manufacturers, hair stylists, exercise promoters, and spa and recreation companies. One example is a line of aftershave and fragrances called David Beckham Instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beckham-fragrances.com/ |title=David Beckham Instinct |publisher=Beckham-fragrances.com |accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Beckham was hailed as the ultimate &quot;[[metrosexual]]&quot; by the man who invented the term&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2002/07/22/metrosexual/print.html |title=Meet the metrosexual |work=Salon |accessdate=13 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113123551/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2002/07/22/metrosexual/print.html |archivedate=13 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as such by numerous other articles since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marksimpson.com/blog/2007/07/13/america-meet-david-beckham/ |title=America – meet David Beckham |publisher=Marksimpson.com |accessdate=13 November 2008|date=13 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham never personally appeared in the 2002 film ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'', except in archive footage. He and his wife wanted to make cameo appearances, but scheduling proved difficult, so the director used lookalike [[Andy Harmer]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title |id=0286499 |title=Bend It Like Beckham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beckham makes a cameo appearance with Zinedine Zidane and Raúl, in the 2005 film ''[[Goal! (film)|Goal!]]''.
