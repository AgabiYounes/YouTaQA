Although dwarfed by other, larger communities, the Druze community played an important role in shaping the history of the [[Levant]], where it continues to play a large political role. As a religious minority in every country in which they are found, they have frequently experienced [[persecution]], except in [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]], where Druze judges, parliamentarians, diplomats, and doctors occupy the highest echelons of society. Even though the faith originally developed out of [[Ismaili Islam]], Druze are not generally considered [[Muslims]], although [[Al Azhar]] of Egypt recognizes them as one of the [[Islamic schools and branches|Islamic sects]], akin to Shia.&lt;ref name=mordechai&gt;{{cite book|title=Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle and Self-Expression|last=Nisan|first=Mordechai|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5133-3|date=2015-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=randa&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arab Americans|last=Kayyali |first=Randa|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33219-7|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Security Watch-Lebanon: A Reference Handbook: A Reference Handbook|last=Sorenson|first=David|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-36579-9|date=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muhammed&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam: Questions And Answers — Schools of Thought, Religions and Sects|last=Abdul-Rahman|first=Muhammed Saed|publisher=AMSA Publication Limited|isbn=978-5-551-29049-0|date=December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatimid caliph [[Ali az-Zahir]], whose father al-Hakim is a key figure in the Druze faith, was particularly harsh to Druze, causing the death of many in [[Antioch]], [[Aleppo]], and northern Syria.

The Druze faith is one of the [[Major religious groups#World Religion Database|major religious groups]] in the Levant, with between 800,000 and a million adherents. They are found primarily in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] (where the Druze are considered part of their [[Islam in Lebanon#Druze|Muslim]] population),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lebanon Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wXO8AAAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=International Business Publications|isbn=978-1-4387-7482-4|oclc=972851389}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Israel]], with small communities in [[Jordan]]. The oldest and most densely-populated Druze communities exist in [[Mount Lebanon]] and in the south of Syria around [[Jabal al-Druze]] (literally the &quot;Mountain of the Druzes&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3158&amp;context=etd |title=Assessing Druze identity and strategies for preserving Druze heritage in North America |author=Radwan, Chad K. |journal=Scholar Commons |date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Druze's social customs differ markedly from those of Muslims or Christians, and they are known to form close-knit, cohesive communities which do not fully allow non-Druze in, though they themselves integrate fully in their adopted homelands.

== Etymology ==
The name Druze is derived from the name of [[Ad-Darazi|Muhammad bin Ismail Nashtakin ad-Darazī]] (from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''{{transl|fa|darzi}}'', &quot;seamster&quot;) who was an early [[preacher]]. Although the Druze consider ad-Darazī a [[heretic]],&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.druze.ca/AboutDruze.html |title=About the Faith of The Mo'wa'he'doon Druze |first=Moustafa F |last=Moukarim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426105258/http://www.druze.ca/AboutDruze.html |archivedate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the name has been used to identify them.

Before becoming public, the movement was secretive and held closed meetings in what was known as [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah#Sessions of Wisdom|Sessions of Wisdom]]. During this stage a dispute occurred between ad-Darazi and [[Hamza bin Ali]] mainly concerning ad-Darazi's ''{{transl|ar|[[ghulat|ghuluww]]}}'' (&quot;exaggeration&quot;), which refers to the belief that God was [[incarnation|incarnated]] in human beings (especially '[[Ali]] and his descendants, including [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], who was the [[caliph]] at the time) and to ad-Darazi naming himself &quot;The Sword of the Faith&quot;, which led Hamza to write an epistle refuting the need for the sword to spread the faith and several epistles refuting the beliefs of the ''{{transl|ar|[[ghulat]]}}''.

In 1016 ad-Darazi and his followers openly proclaimed their beliefs and called people to join them, causing riots in Cairo against the Unitarian movement including Hamza bin Ali and his followers. This led to the suspension of the movement for one year and the expulsion of ad-Darazi and his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Al-Darazî and Ḥamza in the Origin of the Druze Religion |last=Hodgson |first=Marshall G. S. |journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] |issn=0003-0279 |volume=82 |issue=1 |year=1962 |pages=5–20 |doi=10.2307/595974 |jstor=595974 |bibcode=1964JAOS...84..128H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Druze religious books describe ad-Darazi as the &quot;insolent one&quot; and as the &quot;calf&quot; who is narrow-minded and hasty, the name &quot;Druze&quot; is still used for identification and for historical reasons. In 1018, ad-Darazi was assassinated for his teachings; some sources claim that he was executed by Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=samy&gt;{{cite book|title= The Druzes: An Annotated Bibliography |last=Swayd|first=Samy |publisher=ISES Publications|location=Kirkland, WA, USA|year=1998|isbn=978-0-9662932-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authorities see in the name &quot;Druze&quot; a descriptive epithet, derived from Arabic ''{{transl|ar|dārisah}}'' (&quot;she who studies&quot;).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=605}} Others have speculated that the word comes from the Persian word ''{{transl|fa|Darazo}}'' ({{lang|fa|درز}} &quot;bliss&quot;) or from [[Shaykh]] Hussayn ad-Darazī, who was one of the early converts to the faith.&lt;ref name = najjar /&gt; In the early stages of the movement, the word &quot;Druze&quot; is rarely mentioned by historians, and in Druze religious texts only the word ''Muwaḥḥidūn'' (&quot;Unitarian&quot;) appears. The only early Arab historian who mentions the Druze is the eleventh century Christian scholar [[Yahya of Antioch]], who clearly refers to the heretical group created by ad-Darazī, rather than the followers of Hamza ibn 'Alī.&lt;ref name=najjar&gt;{{cite book |last=Al-Najjar |first='Abdullāh |title=Madhhab ad-Durūz wa t-Tawḥīd (The Druze Sect and Unism) |publisher=Dār al-Ma'ārif |location=Egypt |year=1965 |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Western sources, [[Benjamin of Tudela]], the Jewish traveler who passed through Lebanon in or around 1165, was one of the first European writers to refer to the Druzes by name. The word ''{{transl|he|Dogziyin}}'' (&quot;Druzes&quot;) occurs in an early Hebrew edition of his travels, but it is clear that this is a scribal error. Be that as it may, he described the Druze as &quot;mountain dwellers, monotheists, who believe in 'soul eternity' and [[reincarnation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitti |first=Philip K |title=Origins of the Druze People and Religion, with Extracts from their Sacred Writings |edition=new |series=Columbia University Oriental Studies |volume=28 |publisher=Saqi |location=London |year=2007 |origyear=1924 |isbn=978-0-86356-690-5 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that &quot;they loved the Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mordechai Nisan|title=Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle and Self-Expression, 2d ed.|date=1 Jan 2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5133-3|page=283}}&lt;!--|accessdate=21 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

They use the [[Arabic language]] and follow a social pattern very similar to those of the other peoples of the [[Levant]] (eastern Mediterranean).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Rabah |last=Halabi |title=Citizens of equal duties—Druze identity and the Jewish State |page=55 |language=Hebrew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of Druze people worldwide is between 800,000 and one million, with the vast majority residing in the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3612002.stm|title=Druze set to visit Syria |accessdate=8 September 2006 |work=BBC News |quote=The worldwide population of Druze is put at up to one million, with most living in mountainous regions in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel. |date=30 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The Druze faith began as a movement in [[Ismailism]] that was opposed to certain religious and philosophical ideologies that were present during that epoch.

The faith was preached by [[Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad|Hamza ibn 'Alī ibn Ahmad]], an [[Ismaili]] mystic and scholar from [[Zozan]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC-CLIO&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hendrix |editor1-first=Scott |editor2-last=Okeja |editor2-first=Uchenna |title=The World's Greatest Religious Leaders: How Religious Figures Helped Shape World History [2 volumes] |date=2018 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-4138-5 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|Egypt]] in 1014 or 1016,&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC-CLIO&quot; /&gt; and assembled a group of scholars and leaders from across the world to establish the Unitarian movement. The order's meetings were held in the Raydan Mosque, near the [[Al-Hakim Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.druze.com/education/DruzeLuminariesAlHakim-English-level3.pdf |publisher=Druze |title=Luminaries: Al Hakim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820044553/http://www.druze.com/education/DruzeLuminariesAlHakim-English-level3.pdf |archivedate=20 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1017, Hamza officially revealed the Druze faith and began to preach the Unitarian doctrine. Hamza gained the support of the Fātimid caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]], who issued a decree promoting religious freedom prior to the declaration of the [[divine call]].

Al-Hakim became a central figure in the Druze faith even though his own religious position was disputed among scholars. [[John Esposito]] states that al-Hakim believed that &quot;he was not only the divinely appointed religio-political leader, but also the [[nous|cosmic intellect]] linking God with creation&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lZXTFCN93kkC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=druze+hakim+John+Esposito#PPA156,M1 |title=Melville's Clarel and the Intersympathy of Creeds |first=William |last=Potter |page=156|isbn=978-0-87338-797-2 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others like Nissim Dana and [[Mordechai Nisan]] state that he is perceived as the manifestation and the reincarnation of God or presumably the image of God.{{Sfn|Nisan|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=keD9z1XWuNwC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Mordechai+Nisan++druze&amp;ei=IJ5uSLuLMZOkiwHp99SCBg&amp;sig=ACfU3U2QHNki1phQdaWTIOKngGyVPLnTbw#PPA100,M1 95]}}{{Sfn |Dana|2003}}{{Rp|needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Some Druze and non-Druze scholars like Samy Swayd and [[Sami Makarem]] state that this confusion is due to confusion about the role of the early preacher ad-Darazi, whose teachings the Druze rejected as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=The+Druzes:+A+New+Study+of+Their+History,+Faith+and+Society+Al-Hakim#PPA217,M1 |title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia |first1=Josef W |last1=Meri |first2=Jere L |last2=Bacharach |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-415-96690-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources assert that al-Hakim rejected ad-Darazi's claims of divinity,&lt;ref name= samy /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kY0oedX32BwC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Hamza+bin+Ali+druze#PPA127,M1 |title=The Olive and the Tree: The Secret Strength of the Druze |first1=Dr Ruth |last1=Westheimer |first2=Gil |last2=Sedan|isbn=978-1-59056-102-7 |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Swayd|2006}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}} and ordered the elimination of his movement while supporting that of Hamza ibn Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url =https://books.google.com/?id=rezD7rvuf9YC&amp;pg=PA921&amp;vq=druze&amp;dq=druze+god+hakim#PPA921,M1 |author1=M.

Al-Hakim disappeared one night while out on his evening ride – presumably assassinated, perhaps at the behest of his formidable elder sister [[Sitt al-Mulk]]. The Druze believe he went into [[Occultation (Islam)|Occultation]] with Hamza ibn Ali and three other prominent preachers, leaving the care of the &quot;Unitarian missionary movement&quot; to a new leader, [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin]] (also spelled Baha' ad-Din).{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

=== Closing of the faith ===
Al-Hakim was replaced by his underage son, [[Ali az-Zahir|'Alī az-Zahir]]. The Unitarian Druze movement, which existed in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], acknowledged az-Zahir as the caliph, but followed Hamzah as its [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]].&lt;ref name=samy /&gt; The young caliph's regent, [[Sitt al-Mulk]], ordered the army to destroy the movement in 1021.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; At the same time, Bahā'a ad-Dīn as-Samuki was assigned the leadership of the Unitarian Movement by Hamza Bin Ali.&lt;ref name=samy /&gt;

For the next seven years, the Druze faced extreme persecution by the new caliph, al-Zahir, who wanted to eradicate the faith.&lt;ref name=Rebecca&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredtribesjournal.org/images/Encyclopedia/The_Druze.pdf |title=The Druze |author=Rebecca Erickson |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518085757/http://www.sacredtribesjournal.org/images/Encyclopedia/The_Druze.pdf |archivedate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the result of a power struggle inside of the Fatimid empire in which the Druze were viewed with suspicion because of their refusal to recognize the new caliph, [[Ali az-Zahir]], as their Imam. Many spies, mainly the followers of Ad-Darazi, joined the Unitarian movement in order to infiltrate the Druze community. The spies set about agitating trouble and soiling the reputation of the Druze. This resulted in friction with the new caliph who clashed militarily with the Druze community. The clashes ranged from [[Antioch]] to [[Alexandria]], where tens of thousands of Druze were slaughtered by the Fatimid army.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; The largest massacre was at Antioch, where 5,000 Druze religious leaders were killed, followed by that of [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref name=about /&gt; As a result, the faith went underground, in hope of survival, as those captured were either forced to renounce their faith or be killed. Druze survivors &quot;were found principally in southern Lebanon and Syria&quot;. In 1038, two years after the death of al-Zahir, the Druze movement was able to resume because the new leadership that replaced him had friendly political ties with at least one prominent Druze leader.&lt;ref name=Rebecca /&gt;

In 1043, [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin|Baha' ad-Din]] declared that the sect would no longer accept new adherents, and since that time, [[proselytization]] has been prohibited.&lt;ref name=samy /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rebecca /&gt;

=== During the Crusades ===
It was during the period of Crusader rule in Levant (1099–1291) that the Druze first emerged into the full light of history in the Gharb region of the [[Chouf]] Mountains. As powerful warriors serving the Muslim rulers of Damascus against the [[Crusades]], the Druze were given the task of keeping watch over the crusaders in the seaport of Beirut, with the aim of preventing them from making any encroachments inland. Subsequently, the Druze chiefs of the Gharb placed their considerable military experience at the disposal of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] rulers of Egypt (1250–1516); first, to assist them in putting an end to what remained of Crusader rule in coastal Levant, and later to help them safeguard the Lebanese coast against Crusader retaliation by sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Druze heritage&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.druzeheritage.org/dhf/Druze_History.asp |publisher=Druze Heritage |title=History |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201657/http://www.druzeheritage.org/dhf/Druze_History.asp |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early period of the [[Crusades|Crusader]] era, the Druze feudal power was in the hands of two families, the [[Tanukh]]s and the [[Talal Arslan|Arslans]]. From their fortresses in the Gharb area (now in [[Aley District]] of southern [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]]), the Tanukhs led their incursions into the Phoenician coast and finally succeeded in holding Beirut and the marine plain against the [[Franks]]. Because of their fierce battles with the [[Crusaders]], the Druzes earned the respect of the [[Sunni]] Muslim caliphs and thus gained important political powers. After the middle of the twelfth century, the [[Maan family|Ma'an]] family superseded the [[Tanukhids|Tanukhs]] in Druze leadership. The origin of the family goes back to a Prince Ma'an who made his appearance in the Lebanon in the days of the 'Abbasid caliph [[al-Mustarshid]] (1118–35 CE). The Ma'ans chose for their abode the [[Chouf]] District in south-western Lebanon (southern [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]]), overlooking the maritime plain between [[Beirut]] and [[Sidon]], and made their headquarters in [[Baaqlin]], which is still a leading Druze village. They were invested with feudal authority by Sultan [[Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo|Nur ad-Din]] and furnished respectable contingents to the Muslim ranks in their struggle against the Crusaders.{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

=== Persecution during the Mamluk and Ottoman period ===
Having cleared the holy land of the Franks, the [[Mamluk]] sultans of Egypt turned their attention to the schismatic Muslims of Syria. In 1305, after the issuing of a [[fatwa]] by the scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], calling for [[jihad]] against all non-[[Sunni]] Muslims like the Druze, [[Alawites]], [[Ismaili]], and [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] Muslims, [[Al-Nasir Muhammad|al-Malik al-Nasir]] inflicted a disastrous defeat on the Druze at [[Keserwan District|Keserwan]], and forced outward compliance on their part to Orthodox Sunni Islam. Later, under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], they were severely attacked at [[Saoufar]] in 1585, after the Ottomans claimed that they assaulted their caravans near [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}} As a result of the Ottoman experience with the rebellious Druze, the word ''Durzi'' in Turkish came, and continues, to mean someone who is the ultimate thug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stefan Winter|title=The Shiites of Lebanon under Ottoman Rule, 1516–1788|date=11 Mar 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48681-1|page=37}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One influential Islamic [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] of that time{{who|date=October 2017}} labeled them as ''infidels'' and argued that, even though they might behave like Muslims on the outside, this is no more than a pretense. He also declared that confiscation of Druze property and even the death sentence would conform to the laws of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=shaanan |url=http://app.shaanan.ac.il/shnaton/15/14.pdf |title=Druze Identity, Religion — Tradition and Apostasy |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, the 16th and 17th centuries were to witness a succession of armed Druze rebellions against the Ottomans, countered by repeated Ottoman punitive expeditions against the Chouf, in which the Druze population of the area was severely depleted and many villages destroyed. These military measures, severe as they were, did not succeed in reducing the local Druze to the required degree of subordination. This led the Ottoman government to agree to an arrangement whereby the different [[nahiyes]] (districts) of the [[Chouf]] would be granted in ''[[iltizam]]'' (&quot;fiscal concession&quot;) to one of the region's [[amir]]s, or leading chiefs, leaving the maintenance of law and order and the collection of its taxes in the area in the hands of the appointed amir. This arrangement was to provide the cornerstone for the privileged status which ultimately came to be enjoyed by the whole of Mount Lebanon, Druze and Christian areas alike.&lt;ref name=&quot;Druze heritage&quot; /&gt;

=== Ma'an dynasty ===
{{Main|Maan family}}
[[File:fakhreddincastle.jpg|right|frame|[[Palmyra Castle|Fakhreddin Castle]] in [[Palmyra]]]]
With the advent of the Ottoman Turks and the conquest of Syria by [[Selim I|Sultan Selim I]] in 1516, the [[Ma'ans]] were acknowledged by the new rulers as the feudal lords of southern Lebanon. Druze villages spread and prospered in that region, which under Ma'an leadership so flourished that it acquired the generic term of ''Jabal Bayt-Ma'an'' (the mountain home of the Ma'an) or ''Jabal al-Druze''. The latter title has since been usurped by the [[Hawran]] region, which since the middle of the 19th century has proven a haven of refuge to Druze emigrants from Lebanon and has become the headquarters of Druze power.{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

Under [[Fakhr-al-Din II|Fakhr-al-Dīn II]] (Fakhreddin II), the Druze dominion increased until it included Lebanon-Phoenicia and almost all Syria, extending from the edge of the Antioch plain in the north to [[Safad]] in the south, with a part of the Syrian desert dominated by [[Fakhr-al-Din al-Maani Castle|Fakhr-al-Din's castle]] at Tadmur ([[Palmyra]]), the ancient capital of [[Zenobia]]. The ruins of this castle still stand on a steep hill overlooking the town. Fakhr-al-Din became too strong for his Turkish sovereign in [[Constantinople]]. He went so far in 1608 as to sign a commercial treaty with [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany]] containing secret military clauses. The Sultan then sent a force against him, and he was compelled to flee the land and seek refuge in the courts of [[Tuscany]] and [[Naples]] in 1613 and 1615 respectively.

In 1618 political changes in the Ottoman sultanate had resulted in the removal of many enemies of Fakhr-al-Din from power, signaling the prince's triumphant return to Lebanon soon afterwards. Through a clever policy of bribery and warfare, he extended his domains to cover all of modern Lebanon, some of Syria and northern Galilee.

In 1632 Küçük Ahmet Pasha was named Lord of [[Damascus]]. Küçük Ahmet Pasha was a rival of Fakhr-al-Din and a friend of the sultan [[Murad IV]], who ordered the pasha and the sultanate's navy to attack Lebanon and depose Fakhr-al-Din.

This time the prince decided to remain in Lebanon and resist the offensive, but the death of his son Ali in [[Wadi al-Taym]] was the beginning of his defeat. He later took refuge in [[Jezzine]]'s grotto, closely followed by Küçük Ahmet Pasha who eventually caught up with him and his family.

Fakhr-al-Din was captured, taken to [[Istanbul]], and imprisoned with two of his sons in the infamous Yedi Kule prison. The Sultan had Fakhr-al-Din and his sons killed on 13 April 1635 in [[Istanbul]], bringing an end to an era in the history of Lebanon, which would not regain its current boundaries until it was proclaimed a mandate state and republic in 1920. One version recounts that the younger son was spared, raised in the harem and went on to become Ottoman Ambassador to India.&lt;ref&gt;TJ Gorton, [http://tjgorton.wordpress.com/prince-of-lebanon-a-druze-emir-at-the-court-of-the-medici/ ''Renaissance Emir: a Druze Warlord at the court of the Medici''] (London: Quartet Books, 2013), pp 167–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fakhr-al-Din II was the first ruler in modern Lebanon to open the doors of his country to foreign Western influences. Under his auspices the French established a khān (hostel) in Sidon, the [[Florence|Florentines]] a consulate, and Christian missionaries were admitted into the country. Beirut and Sidon, which Fakhr-al-Din II beautified, still bear traces of his benign rule. See the new biography of this Prince, based on original sources, by TJ Gorton: ''Renaissance Emir: a Druze Warlord at the Court of the Medici'' (London, Quartet Books, 2013), for an updated view of his life.

Fakhr ad Din II was succeeded in 1635 by his nephew Ahmed [[Mulhim Ma'n|Ma'an]], who ruled through his death in 1658. (Fakhr ad Din's only surviving son, Husayn, lived the rest of his life as a court official in Constantinople.) Emir Mulhim exercised [[Iltizam]] taxation rights in the Shuf, Gharb, Jurd, Matn, and Kisrawan districts of Lebanon. Mulhim's forces battled and defeated those of Mustafa Pasha, [[Beylerbey]] of Damascus, in 1642, but he is reported by historians to have been otherwise loyal to Ottoman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-856-4 |last=Abu-Husayn |first=Abdul-Rahim |title=The View from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman Chancery Documents, 1546–1711 |year=2004 |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Mulhim's death, his sons Ahmad and Korkmaz entered into a [[Druze power struggle (1658–1667)|power struggle]] with other Ottoman-backed Druze leaders. In 1660, the Ottoman Empire moved to reorganize the region, placing the [[sanjak]]s (districts) of Sidon-Beirut and Safed in a newly formed [[Sidon Province, Ottoman Empire|province of Sidon]], a move seen by local Druze as an attempt to assert control.&lt;ref name=VI22 /&gt; Contemporary historian Istifan al-Duwayhi reports that Korkmaz was killed in act of treachery by the Beylerbey of Damascus in 1662.&lt;ref name=VI22&gt;{{cite book |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-856-4 |last=Abu-Husayn |first=Abdul-Rahim |title=The View from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman Chancery Documents, 1546–1711 |year=2004 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad however emerged victorious in the [[Druze power struggle (1658–1667)|power struggle]] among the Druze in 1667, but the Maʿnīs lost control of Safad&lt;ref name=&quot;VI22-23&quot; /&gt; and retreated to controlling the iltizam of the Shuf mountains and Kisrawan.&lt;ref name=Salibi&gt;{{cite book |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-912-7 |last=Salibi |first=Kamal S. |title=A house of many mansions: the history of Lebanon reconsidered |year=2005 |page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad continued as local ruler through his death from natural causes, without heir, in 1697.&lt;ref name=&quot;VI22-23&quot;&gt;{{cite book |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-856-4 |last=Abu-Husayn |first=Abdul-Rahim |title=The view from Istanbul: Lebanon and the Druze Emirate in the Ottoman chancery documents, 1546–1711 |year=2004 |pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shihab Dynasty ===
{{Main|Shihab family}}
[[File:Druzewomantantur.jpg|thumb|right|Druze woman wearing a [[tantour]] during the 1870s in [[Chouf]], [[Ottoman Lebanon]]]]
As early as the days of [[Saladin]], and while the Ma'ans were still in complete control over southern Lebanon, the Shihab tribe, originally [[Hijaz]] Arabs, but later settled in Ḥawran, advanced from Ḥawran, in 1172, and settled in [[Wadi al-Taym]] at the foot of mount [[Hermon]]. They soon made an alliance with the Ma'ans and were acknowledged as the Druze chiefs in ''Wadi al-Taym''. At the end of the 17th century (1697) the Shihabs succeeded the Ma'ans in the feudal leadership of Druze southern Lebanon, although they reportedly professed Sunni Islam, they showed sympathy with Druzism, the religion of the majority of their subjects.

The Shihab leadership continued until the middle of the 19th century and culminated in the illustrious governorship of [[Bashir Shihab II|Amir Bashir Shihab II]] (1788–1840) who, after Fakhr-al-Din, was the most powerful feudal lord Lebanon produced. Though governor of the Druze Mountain, Bashir was a [[crypto-Christian]], and it was he whose aid [[Napoleon]] solicited in 1799 during his campaign against Syria.

Having consolidated his conquests in Syria (1831–1838), [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], son of the viceroy of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]], made the fatal mistake of trying to disarm the Christians and Druzes of the Lebanon and to draft the latter into his army. This was contrary to the principles of the life of independence which these mountaineers had always lived, and resulted in a [[Sidon Eyalet revolt (1834)|general uprising]] against Egyptian rule. The uprising was encouraged, for political reasons, by the British.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} The Druzes of Wadi al-Taym and Ḥawran, under the leadership of Shibli al-Aryan, distinguished themselves in their stubborn resistance at their inaccessible headquarters, ''al-Laja'', lying southeast of Damascus.{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

=== Qaysites and the Yemenites ===
{{Main|Battle of Ain Darra}}
[[File:DruzeOttomanHakim.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting of Druze and Ottoman leaders in [[Damascus]], about the control of Jebel Druze]]
The conquest of Syria by the Muslim Arabs in the middle of the seventh century introduced into the land two political factions later called the Qaysites and the [[Yemen]]ites. The Qaysite party represented the [[Bedouin]] Arabs who were regarded as inferior by the Yemenites who were earlier and more cultured emigrants into Syria from southern Arabia. Druzes and Christians grouped in political, rather than religious, parties; the party lines in Lebanon obliterated racial and religious lines and the people grouped themselves into one or the other of these two parties regardless of their religious affiliations. The sanguinary feuds between these two factions depleted, in course of time, the manhood of the Lebanon and ended in the decisive [[battle of Ain Dara]] in 1711, which resulted in the utter defeat of the Yemenite party. Many Yemenite Druzes thereupon immigrated to the [[Hawran]] region, and thus laid the foundation of Druze power there.{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

=== Civil War of 1860 ===
{{Main|1860 Lebanon conflict}}
In 1840 social disturbance started between Druze and their Christian [[Maronite Christians in Lebanon|Maronite]] neighbors, who had previously been on friendly terms. This culminated in the [[1860 Lebanon conflict|civil war of 1860]].{{Sfn | Hitti | 1924}}{{Rp| needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

After the [[Shehab dynasty]] converted to Christianity, the Druze community and feudal leaders came under attack from the regime with the collaboration of the Catholic Church, and the Druze lost most of their political and feudal powers. Also, the Druze formed an alliance with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and allowed Protestant missionaries to enter Mount Lebanon, creating tension between them and the Catholic Maronites.

The Maronite-Druze conflict in 1840–60 was an outgrowth of the Maronite Christian independence movement,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} directed against the Druze, Druze feudalism, and the Ottoman-Turks. The civil war was not therefore a religious war,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} except in Damascus, where it spread and where the vastly non-Druze population was anti-Christian.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The movement culminated with the 1859–60 massacre and defeat of the Christians by the Druzes. The civil war of 1860 cost the Christians some ten thousand lives in [[Damascus]], [[Zahlé]], [[Deir al-Qamar]], [[Hasbaya]], and other towns of Lebanon.

The European powers then determined to intervene, and authorized the landing in Beirut of a body of French troops under [[Charles-Marie-Napoléon de Beaufort d'Hautpoul|General Beaufort d'Hautpoul]], whose inscription can still be seen on the historic rock at the mouth of [[Nahr al-Kalb]]. French intervention on behalf of the Maronites did not help the Maronite national movement, since France was restricted in 1860 by Britain, which did not want the [[Ottoman Empire]] dismembered. But European intervention pressured the Turks to treat the Maronites more justly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1977.tb03313.x |last1=Abraham |first1=Antoine |year=1977 |title=Lebanese Communal Relations |journal=Muslim World |volume=67 |issue=2|pages=91–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the recommendations of the powers, the Ottoman Porte granted Lebanon local autonomy, guaranteed by the powers, under a Christian governor.

=== Rebellion in Hauran ===
{{Main|Hauran Druze Rebellion}}
The Hauran rebellion was a violent Druze uprising against Ottoman authority in the Syrian province, which erupted in May 1909. The rebellion was led by [[al-Atrash]] family, originated in local disputes and Druze unwillingness to pay taxes and conscript into the Ottoman Army. The rebellion ended in brutal suppression of the Druze by General Sami Pasha al-Farouqi, significant depopulation of the Hauran region and execution of the Druze leaders in 1910. In the outcome of the revolt, 2,000 Druze were killed, a similar number wounded, and hundreds of Druze fighters imprisoned. Al-Farouqi also disarmed the population, extracted significant taxes, and launched a census of the region.

In Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Jordan, the Druzites have official recognition as a separate religious community with its own religious court system. Druzites are known for their loyalty to the countries they reside in,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Totten|first1=Michael J.|authorlink1=Michael Totten|title=Tower of the Sun: Stories from the Middle East and North Africa|date=2014 |publisher=Belmont Estate Books|isbn=978-0-692-29753-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyWzrQEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2015}}{{Verification needed|date=September 2015}} though they have a strong community feeling, in which they identify themselves as related even across borders of countries.&lt;ref name=lexicorient&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/druze.htm |title=Druze |first=Tore |last=Kjeilen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their practice of blending with dominant groups to avoid persecution, and because the Druze religion does not endorse separatist sentiments, but urges blending with the communities they reside in, the Druze have had a history of resistance to occupying powers, and they have at times enjoyed more freedom than most other groups living in the Levant.&lt;ref name=lexicorient /&gt;

In Syria, most Druzites live in the [[Jebel al-Druze]], a rugged and mountainous region in the southwest of the country, which is more than 90 percent Druze inhabited; some 120 villages are exclusively so.&lt;ref name=landis&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/L/Joshua.M.Landis-1/Joshua_Landis_Druze_and_Shishakli.htm |title=Shishakli and the Druzes: Integration and intransigence |first=Joshua |last=Landis |work=The Syrian Land: Processes of Integration and Fragmentation |location=Stuttgart |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag |year=1998 |pages=369–96 |editor1-first=T |editor1-last=Philipp |editor2-first=B |editor2-last=Schäbler}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}} Other notable communities live in the [[Harim Mountains]], the Damascus suburb of [[Jaramana]], and on the southeast slopes of [[Mount Hermon]]. A large Syrian Druze community historically lived in the Golan Heights, but following wars with Israel in [[Six-Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973]], many of these Druze fled to other parts of Syria; most of those who remained live in a handful of villages in the disputed zone, while only a few live in the narrow remnant of [[Quneitra Governorate]] that is still under effective Syrian control.

[[File:Druzeindependance1925.jpg|thumb|right|Druze celebrating their independence in 1925.]]
The Druze always played a far more important role in Syrian politics than its comparatively small population would suggest. With a community of little more than 100,000 in 1949, or roughly three percent of the Syrian population, the Druze of Syria's southwestern mountains constituted a potent force in Syrian politics and played a leading role in the nationalist struggle against the French. Under the military leadership of [[Sultan Pasha al-Atrash]], the Druze provided much of the military force behind the [[Great Syrian Revolt|Syrian Revolution]] of 1925–27. In 1945, Amir Hasan al-Atrash, the paramount political leader of the [[Jabal el Druze (state)|Jebel al-Druze]], led the Druze military units in a successful revolt against the French, making the Jebel al-Druze the first and only region in Syria to liberate itself from French rule without British assistance. At independence the Druze, made confident by their successes, expected that Damascus would reward them for their many sacrifices on the battlefield. They demanded to keep their autonomous administration and many political privileges accorded them by the French and sought generous economic assistance from the newly independent government.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

[[File:SyrianDouroze.jpg|thumb|left|Druze leaders meeting in [[Jebel al-Druze]], Syria, 1926]]
When a local paper in 1945 reported that President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] (1943–49) had called the Druzes a &quot;dangerous minority&quot;, Sultan Pasha al-Atrash flew into a rage and demanded a public retraction. If it were not forthcoming, he announced, the Druzes would indeed become &quot;dangerous&quot;, and a force of 4,000 Druze warriors would &quot;occupy the city of Damascus&quot;. Quwwatli could not dismiss Sultan Pasha's threat. The military balance of power in Syria was tilted in favor of the Druzes, at least until the military build up during the 1948 War in Palestine. One advisor to the Syrian Defense Department warned in 1946 that the Syrian army was &quot;useless&quot;, and that the Druzes could &quot;take Damascus and capture the present leaders in a breeze&quot;.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

During the four years of [[Adib Shishakli]]'s rule in Syria (December 1949 to February 1954) (on 25 August 1952: [[Adib al-Shishakli]] created the [[Arab Liberation Movement]] (ALM), a progressive party with [[pan-Arabist]] and socialist views),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.syrianhistory.com/node/3379 |title=Syrian History}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Druze community was subjected to a heavy attack by the Syrian government. Shishakli believed that among his many opponents in Syria, the Druzes were the most potentially dangerous, and he was determined to crush them. He frequently proclaimed: &quot;My enemies are like a serpent: The head is the Jebel al-Druze, the stomach [[Homs]], and the tail Aleppo. If I crush the head, the serpent will die.&quot; Shishakli dispatched 10,000 regular troops to occupy the Jebel al-Druze. Several towns were bombarded with heavy weapons, killing scores of civilians and destroying many houses. According to Druze accounts, Shishakli encouraged neighboring bedouin tribes to plunder the defenseless population and allowed his own troops to run amok.&lt;ref name = landis /&gt;{{Rp|needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

Shishakli launched a brutal campaign to defame the Druzes for their religion and politics. He accused the entire community of treason, at times claiming they were agents of the British and [[Hashemite|Hashimites]], at others that they were fighting for Israel against the Arabs. He even produced a cache of Israeli weapons allegedly discovered in the Jabal. Even more painful for the Druze community was his publication of &quot;falsified Druze religious texts&quot; and false testimonials ascribed to leading Druze sheikhs designed to stir up sectarian hatred. This propaganda also was broadcast in the Arab world, mainly Egypt. Shishakli was assassinated in Brazil on 27 September 1964 by a Druze seeking revenge for Shishakli's bombardment of the Jebel al-Druze.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

He forcibly integrated minorities into the national [[Syrian]] social structure, his &quot;Syrianization&quot; of [[Alawite]] and Druze territories had to be accomplished in part using violence, he declared: &quot;My enemies are like serpent. The head is the [[Jabal Druze]], if I crush the head the serpent will die&quot; (Seale 1963:132).&lt;ref name=landis /&gt; To this end, al-Shishakli encouraged the stigmatization of minorities. He saw minority demands as tantamount to treason. His increasingly chauvinistic notions of Arab nationalism were predicated on the denial that &quot;minorities&quot; existed in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecTTlytIjswC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Syria's Kurds: History, Politics and Society |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-89211-4 |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

After the Shishakli's military campaign, the Druze community lost much of its political influence, but many Druze military officers played important roles in the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath]] government currently ruling Syria.&lt;ref name=landis /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

[[File:Prophet Job Shrine.jpg|thumb|[[Job (Bible)|Prophet Job]] shrine in Lebanon the [[Chouf]] region]]
The Druzite community in Lebanon played an important role in the formation of the modern state of Lebanon, and even though they are a minority they play an important role in the Lebanese political scene. Before and during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] (1975–90), the Druze were in favor of [[Pan-Arabism]] and Palestinian resistance represented by the [[PLO]]. Most of the community supported the [[Progressive Socialist Party]] formed by their leader [[Kamal Jumblatt]] and they fought alongside other leftist and Palestinian parties against the [[Lebanese Front]] that was mainly constituted of Christians. After the assassination of Kamal Jumblatt on 16 March 1977, his son [[Walid Jumblatt]] took the leadership of the party and played an important role in preserving his father's legacy after winning the [[Mountain War]] and sustained the existence of the Druze community during the sectarian bloodshed that lasted until 1990.

In August 2001, [[Maronite Christians in Lebanon|Maronite Catholic]] [[Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir|Patriarch Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir]] toured the predominantly Druze Chouf region of Mount Lebanon and visited [[Mukhtara]], the ancestral stronghold of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. The tumultuous reception that Sfeir received not only signified a historic reconciliation between Maronites and Druze, who fought a bloody war in 1983–1984, but underscored the fact that the banner of Lebanese sovereignty had broad multi-confessional appeal&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Meib |url=http://www.meib.org/articles/0305_ld.htm |format=dossier |title=Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir |date=May 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030611090352/http://meib.org/articles/0305_ld.htm |archivedate=11 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a cornerstone for the [[Cedar Revolution]] in 2005. Jumblatt's post-2005 position diverged sharply from the tradition of his family. He also accused Damascus of being behind the 1977 assassination of his father, Kamal Jumblatt, expressing for the first time what many knew he privately suspected. The BBC describes Jumblatt as &quot;the leader of Lebanon's most powerful Druze clan and heir to a leftist political dynasty&quot;.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4348129.stm|title=Who's who in Lebanon|work=BBC News|date=14 March 2005|accessdate=13 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second largest political party supported by Druze is the [[Lebanese Democratic Party]] led by [[Talal Arslan|Prince Talal Arslan]], the son of Lebanese independence hero [[Emir Majid Arslan II|Emir Majid Arslan]].

The Druzites form a religious minority in [[Jordan]] of around 32,000, mostly residing in the northwestern part of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot; /&gt;

== Beliefs ==
=== God ===
The Druze conception of the deity is declared by them to be one of strict and uncompromising unity. The main Druze doctrine states that [[God]] is both [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] and [[Immanence|immanent]], in which he is above all attributes, but at the same time, he is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Druze Faith |first=[[Sami Makarem|Sami Nasib]] |last=[[Sami Makarem|Makarem]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their desire to maintain a rigid confession of unity, they stripped from God all attributes (''[[Tanzih|tanzīh]]''). In God, there are no attributes distinct from his essence. He is wise, mighty, and just, not by wisdom, might, and justice, but by his own essence. God is &quot;the whole of existence&quot;, rather than &quot;above existence&quot; or on his throne, which would make him &quot;limited&quot;. There is neither &quot;how&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, nor &quot;where&quot; about him; he is incomprehensible.&lt;ref name=swayd&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.eial.org/mesp/Swayd.rtf.rtf |title=Druze Spirituality and Asceticism |first=Dr. Samy |last=Swayd, SDSU |format=an abridged rough draft; [[Rich Text Format|RTF]] |publisher=Eial |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005012522/http://www.eial.org/mesp/Swayd.rtf.rtf |archivedate=5 October 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

In this dogma, they are similar to the semi-philosophical, semi-religious body which flourished under [[Al-Ma'mun]] and was known by the name of [[Mu'tazila]] and the fraternal order of the [[Brethren of Purity]] (''Ikhwan al-Ṣafa'').{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

Unlike the ''Mu'tazila'', however, and similar to some branches of [[Sufism]], the Druze believe in the concept of ''Tajalli'' (meaning &quot;[[theophany]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=swayd /&gt;{{Rp| needed =yes|date=April 2012}} ''Tajalli'' is often misunderstood by scholars and writers and is usually confused with the concept of [[incarnation]].

{{quote|[Incarnation] is the core spiritual beliefs in the Druze and some other intellectual and spiritual traditions&amp;nbsp;... In a mystical sense, it refers to the light of God experienced by certain mystics who have reached a high level of purity in their spiritual journey. Thus, God is perceived as the [[Lahut]] [the divine] who manifests His Light in the Station ([[Maqaam]]) of the [[Nasut]] [material realm] without the Nasut becoming Lahut. This is like one's image in the mirror: One is in the mirror, but does not become the mirror. The Druze manuscripts are emphatic and warn against the belief that the Nasut is God&amp;nbsp;... Neglecting this warning, individual seekers, scholars, and other spectators have considered al-Hakim and other figures divine.

&amp;nbsp;... In the Druze scriptural view, Tajalli takes a central stage. One author comments that Tajalli occurs when the seeker's humanity is annihilated so that divine attributes and light are experienced by the person.&lt;ref name=swayd /&gt;{{Rp| needed=yes|date=April 2012}}}}

=== Reincarnation ===
{{See also|Reincarnation#Druze}}
Reincarnation is a paramount principle in the Druze faith.&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, W. B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion)&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnations occur instantly at one's death because there is an eternal [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] of the body and the soul and it is impossible for the soul to exist without the body. A human soul will transfer only to a human body, in contrast to the Hindu and Buddhist belief systems, according to which souls can transfer to any living creature. Furthermore, a male Druze can be reincarnated only as another male Druze and a female Druze only as another female Druze. A Druze cannot be reincarnated in the body of a non-Druze. Additionally, souls cannot be divided and the number of souls existing in the universe is finite.&lt;ref&gt;Dwairy, Marwan (2006) &quot;The Psychosocial Function Of Reincarnation Among Druze In Israel&quot; ''Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry'', page 29–53&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of rebirth is continuous and the only way to escape is through successive reincarnations. When this occurs, the soul is united with the Cosmic Mind and achieves the ultimate happiness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Druze&quot; /&gt;

=== Pact of Time Custodian ===
The Pact of Time Custodian (''{{transl|ar|Mithaq Walley El-Zaman}}'') is considered the entrance to the Druze religion, and they believe that all Druze in their past lives have signed this Charter, and Druze believe that this Charter embodies with human souls after death.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Druze also use a similar formula, called al-'ahd, when one is initiated into the ʻUqqāl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hanna Batatu|title=Syria's Peasantry, the Descendants of Its Lesser Rural Notables, and Their Politics|date=17 Sep 2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-4584-2|pages=15–16|quote=I&amp;nbsp;... son of&amp;nbsp;... being sane of spirit and body and duly qualified, attest on my soul, without compulsion or constraint, that I renounce all the different cults, religions, and creeds and acknowledge nothing other than obedience to our Lord al-Hakim, revered be his name, and obedience is worship; that in his worship I associate no past, present, or future being; that I commit my soul, my body, my property, and my offspring&amp;nbsp;... to our Lord al-Hakim&amp;nbsp;... and accept all his decrees, be they in my favour or against me&amp;nbsp;...

=== Esotericism ===
The Druze believe that many teachings given by prophets, religious leaders and holy books have esoteric meanings preserved for those of intellect, in which some teachings are [[Religious symbolism|symbolic]] and [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature, and divide the understanding of holy books and teachings into three layers.

These layers, according to the Druze, are as follows:

Druze do not believe that the esoteric meaning abrogates or necessarily abolishes the exoteric one. Hamza bin Ali refutes such claims by stating that if the esoteric interpretation of ''[[taharah]]'' (purity) is purity of the heart and soul, it doesn't mean that a person can discard his physical purity, as ''[[salat]]'' (prayer) is useless if a person is untruthful in his speech and that the esoteric and exoteric meanings complement each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |contribution=The Epistle Answering the People of Esotericism ''(batinids)'' |title=Epistles of Wisdom |volume=Second }} (a rough translation from the Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seven Druze precepts ===
{{further|Seven pillars of Ismailism#Druze list}}
The Druze follow seven moral precepts or duties that are considered the core of the faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Druze&quot; /&gt;
The Seven Druze precepts are:{{Sfn|Hitti|1924|p=51}}
# Veracity in speech and the truthfulness of the tongue.
# Protection and mutual aid to the brethren in faith.
# Renunciation of all forms of former worship (specifically, invalid creeds) and false belief.
# Repudiation of the devil ([[Iblis]]), and all forces of evil (translated from Arabic ''Toghyan'', meaning &quot;[[despotism]]&quot;).
# Confession of God's unity.
# Acquiescence in God's acts no matter what they be.
# Absolute submission and resignation to God's divine will in both secret and public.

=== Taqiyya ===
Complicating their identity is the custom of ''{{transl|ar|[[taqiyya]]}}''—concealing or disguising their beliefs when necessary—that they adopted from Ismailism and the esoteric nature of the faith, in which many teachings are kept secretive. This is done in order to keep the religion from those who are not yet prepared to accept the teachings and therefore could misunderstand it, as well as to protect the community when it is in danger. Druzes tend to follow the dominant religion of the country where they reside. Some claim to be Muslim or Christian in order to avoid persecution; some do not.&lt;ref name=&quot;kais&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Druzes, Volume 1|last=Firro|first=Kais|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-09437-6|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Druze in different states can have radically different lifestyles.{{Sfn|Dana|2003|p=18}}

===Prophethood===

Recognition of prophets in the Druze religion is divided into three sort-of subcategories, the prophet themselves (''natiq''), their disciples (''asas''), and witnesses to their message (''hujjah''). For example, [[Muhammad]] is considered a ''natiq'', [[Ali]] is considered an ''asas'', but both are considered prophets. Each major prophet had seven minor prophets, and each minor prophet had twelve disciples.

The number 5 contains an unstated significance within the Druze faith, it's believed in this area that great prophets come in groups of five. In the time of the ancient Greeks, these five were represented by [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Empedocles]]. In the first century, the five were represented by [[Jesus Christ]], [[John the Baptist]], [[Saint Matthew]], [[Saint Mark]], and [[Saint Luke]]. In the time of the faith's foundation, the five were [[Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad]], Muḥammad ibn Wahb al-Qurashī, Abū'l-Khayr Salama ibn Abd al-Wahhab al-Samurri, Ismāʿīl ibn Muḥammad at-Tamīmī, and [[Al-Muqtana Baha'uddin]].

=== Other beliefs ===
The Druze allow divorce, although it is discouraged; circumcision is not necessary; they cannot be reborn as non-Druze; those who purify and perfect their soul ascend to the stars upon death; when al-Hakim returns, all faithful Druze will join him in his march from China and on to conquer the world;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gananath Obeyesekere|title=Karma and Rebirth: A Cross Cultural Study|date=2006|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] Publishe|isbn=9788120826090|pages=311, 313–14|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; apostasy is forbidden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Farhad Daftary|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|date=20 Sep 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46578-6|page=189|edition=2, illustrated, revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually have religious services on Thursday evenings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Samy S.

== Religious symbol {{anchor|Druze flag|flag|Druze star}} ==
[[File:Druze star.svg|70px|frameless|right]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
The Druze strictly avoid [[iconography]], but use five colors (&quot;Five Limits&quot; {{lang|ar|خمس حدود}} ''{{transl|ar|khams ḥudūd}}'') as a religious symbol:{{year needed|date=July 2017}} green, red, yellow, blue, and white. Each color pertains to a metaphysical power called ''{{transl|ar|ḥadd}}'', literally &quot;a limit&quot;, as in the distinctions that separate humans from animals, or the powers that make human the animalistic body. Each ''{{transl|ar|ḥadd}}'' is color-coded in the following manner:
* Green for ''{{transl|ar|ʻAql}}'' &quot;the Universal Mind/Intelligence/[[Nous]]&quot;,
* Red for ''{{transl|ar|Nafs}}'' &quot;the Universal Soul/[[Anima mundi]]&quot;,
* Yellow for ''{{transl|ar|Kalima}}'' &quot;the Word/[[Logos]]&quot;,
* Blue for ''{{transl|ar|Sabiq}}'' &quot;the Potentiality/Cause/Precedent&quot;, and
* White for ''{{transl|ar|Tali}}'' &quot;the Future/Effect/[[Immanence]]&quot;.

The mind generates [[qualia]] and gives consciousness. The soul embodies the mind and is responsible for transmigration and the character of oneself. The word which is the atom of language communicates qualia between humans and represents the platonic forms in the sensible world. The ''{{transl|ar|Sabq}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|Tali}}'' is the ability to perceive and learn from the past and plan for the future and predict it.

[[File:Flag of Druze.svg|70px|frameless|right]]
The colors can be arranged in vertically descending stripes (as a flag) or a [[five-pointed star]]. The stripes are a diagrammatic cut of the spheres in neoplatonic philosophy, while the five-pointed star embodies the [[golden ratio]], [[phi]], as a symbol of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and a life of moderation.

== Prayer houses and holy places ==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 6935 In the holy place of jethro.jpg|thumb|Jethro shrine and temple of Druze in [[Hittin]], northern [[Israel]]]]
Holy places of the Druze are archaeological sites important to the community and associated with religious holidays&lt;ref name=dhp&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy places of the Druze |url=http://www.al-amama.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=848|publisher=Aamama|issue=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the most notable example being [[Nabi Shu'ayb]], dedicated to [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], who is a central figure of the Druze religion. Druze make pilgrimages to this site on the holiday of [[Ziyarat al-Nabi Shu'ayb]].

[[File:DrusischerTempel.jpg|thumb|Druze Prayer house in [[Daliyat al-Karmel|Daliat al-Karmel]], [[Israel]]]]
One of the most important features of the Druze village having a central role in social life is the ''{{transl|ar|[[Khalwat al-Bayada|khalwat]]}}''—a house of prayer, retreat and religious unity. The ''{{transl|ar|khalwat}}'' may be known as ''{{transl|ar|[[majlis]]}}'' in local languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khalwah the prayer place of the Druze |url=http://www.druzesect.com/?p=184|publisher=Druze sect site|date=2010-08-29|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203003230/http://www.druzesect.com/?p=184 |archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of religious shrine is one associated with the anniversary of a historic event or death of a prophet. If it is a [[mausoleum]] the Druze call it [[Mazar (mausoleum)|''mazār'']] and if it is a [[shrine]] they call it [[Maqam (shrine)|''maqām'']]. The holy places become more important to the community in times of adversity and calamity. The holy places and [[shrine]]s of the Druze are scattered in various villages, in places where they are protected and cared for. They are found in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=dhp /&gt;

== Initiates and &quot;ignorant&quot; members ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
[[File:Druze man.jpg|thumb|Druze [[sheikh]] (''{{transl|ar|ʻuqqāl}}'') wearing religious dress]]

The Druzes do not recognize any religious hierarchy. As such, there is no &quot;Druze clergy&quot;. Those few initiated in the Druze holy books are called '''ʿuqqāl''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Druze|title=Druze – History, Religion, &amp; Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the &quot;ignorant&quot;, regular members of the group are called '''juhhāl'''.

{{anchor|al-Juhhāl|Juhhāl|Juhhal|Juhhaal}}
Given the strict religious, intellectual and spiritual requirements, most of the Druzes are not initiated and might be referred to as ''{{transl|ar|al-Juhhāl}}'' ({{lang|ar|جهال}}), literally &quot;the Ignorant&quot;, but in practice referring to the non-initiated Druzes; however, that term is seldom used by the Druzes. Those are not granted access to the Druze holy literature or allowed to attend the initiated religious meetings of the ''{{transl|ar|ʻuqqāl}}''. The cohesiveness and frequent inter-community social interaction however makes it in sort that that most Druzes have an idea about their broad ethical requirements and have some sense of what their theology consists of (albeit often flawed).

{{anchor|al-ʻUqqāl|ʻuqqāl|Uqqal|Uqqaal}}
The initiated religious group, which includes both men and women (less than 10% of the population), is called ''{{transl|ar|al-ʻUqqāl}}'' ({{lang|ar|عقال}} &quot;the Knowledgeable Initiates&quot;). They might or might not dress differently, although most wear a costume that was characteristic of [[mountain people]] in previous centuries. Women can opt to wear ''{{transl|ar|al-mandīl}}'', a loose white [[veil]], especially in the presence of other people. They wear ''{{transl|ar|al-mandīl}}'' on their heads to cover their hair and wrap it around their mouths. They wear black shirts and long skirts covering their legs to their ankles. Male ''{{transl|ar|ʻuqqāl}}'' often grow mustaches, and wear dark Levantine-Turkish traditional dresses, called the ''{{transl|ar|shirwal}}'', with white turbans that vary according to the seniority of the ''{{transl|ar|ʻuqqāl}}''. Traditionally the Druze women have played an important role both socially and religiously inside the community.

''{{transl|ar|Al-ʻuqqāl}}'' have equal rights to ''{{transl|ar|al-Juhhāl}}'', but establish a hierarchy of respect based on religious service. The most influential of ''{{transl|ar|al-ʻuqqāl}}'' become ''{{transl|ar|Ajawīd}}'', recognized religious leaders, and from this group the spiritual leaders of the Druze are assigned. While the ''{{transl|ar|[[Shaykh]] al-ʻAql}}'', which is an official position in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, is elected by the local community and serves as the head of the Druze religious council, judges from the Druze religious courts are usually elected for this position. Unlike the spiritual leaders, the authority of the ''{{transl|ar|Shaykh al-ʻAql}}'' is limited to the country he is elected in, though in some instances spiritual leaders are elected to this position.

The Druze believe in the unity of God, and are often known as the &quot;People of Monotheism&quot; or simply &quot;Monotheists&quot;. Their [[theology]] has a [[Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonic]] view about how God interacts with the world through emanations and is similar to some [[gnosticism|gnostic]] and other [[esotericism|esoteric]] sects. Druze philosophy also shows [[Sufi]] influences.

Druze principles focus on honesty, loyalty, [[filial piety]], [[altruism]], patriotic sacrifice, and [[monotheism]]. They reject [[nicotine]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and other [[drug]]s, and often the consumption of pork (to those Uqqāl and not necessarily to be required by the Juhhāl). Druze reject [[polygamy]], believe in [[reincarnation]], and are not obliged to observe most of the religious rituals. The Druze believe that rituals are symbolic and have an individualistic effect on the person, for which reason Druze are free to perform them, or not. The community does celebrate [[Eid al-Adha]], however, considered their most significant holiday.

== Culture ==
=== Cuisine ===
[[Mate (beverage)|Mate]] is a popular drink consumed by the Druze brought to the Levant from Syrian migrants from [[Argentina]] in the 19th century. Mate is made by steeping dried leaves of [[yerba mate]] in hot water and is served with a metal straw (''bambija'' or ''masassa'') from a gourd (''finjan/Qar'aa''). Mate is often the first item served when entering a Druze home. It is a social drink and can be shared between multiple participants. After each drinker, the metal straw is cleaned with a lemon rind. Traditional snacks eaten with mate include raisins, nuts, dried figs, biscuits, and chips.&lt;ref name=&quot;donald&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Toxicology of Drug Abuse: Synthesized Chemicals and Psychoactive Plants|last=Barceloux |first=Donald |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-10605-1|date=2012-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Middle East Online&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=64763|title=South American 'mate' tea a long-time Lebanese hit|publisher=Middle East Online|accessdate=11 March 2014|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
=== Ethnic origins ===
{{disputed section|date=May 2014}}

==== Arabian hypothesis ====
The Druze faith extended to many areas in the Middle East, but most of the modern Druze can trace their origin to the ''[[Wadi al-Taym]]'' in [[South Lebanon]], which is named after an Arab tribe ''Taymour-Allah (formerly Taymour-Allat) '' which, according to Islamic historian, [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], first came from Arabia into the valley of the [[Euphrates]] where they had been Christianized prior to their migration into the Lebanon. Many of the Druze feudal families whose genealogies have been preserved by the two modern Syrian chroniclers Haydar al-Shihabi and [[Ahmad Faris Shidyaq|al-Shidyaq]] seem also to point in the direction of this origin. Arabian tribes emigrated via the [[Persian Gulf]] and stopped in Iraq on the route that was later to lead them to Syria. The first feudal Druze family, the [[Tanukh]] family, which made for itself a name in fighting the Crusaders, was, according to Haydar al-Shihabi, an Arab tribe from [[Mesopotamia]] where it occupied the position of a ruling family and apparently was Christianized.{{Sfn|Hitti|1924}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=April 2012}}

Travelers like [[Niebuhr]], and scholars like [[Max von Oppenheim]], undoubtedly echoing the popular Druze belief regarding their own origin, have classified them as Arabs. The prevailing idea among the [[Druzes]] themselves today is that they are of Arab stock.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==== Druze as a mixture of Middle Eastern tribes ====
The 1911 edition of [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] states that the Druzes are &quot;a mixture of refugee stocks, in which the Arab largely predominates, grafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic blood&quot;.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=605}}

The Tanukhs must have left [[Arabia]] as early as the second or third century AD. The [[Maan family|Ma'an]] tribe, which superseded the Tanukhs and produced the greatest Druze hero, [[Fakhreddin II|Fakhr-al-Din]], had the same traditional origin. The ''Talhuq'' family and '' 'Abd-al-Malik'', who supplied the later Druze leadership, have the same record as the Tanukhs. The [[Imad]] family is named for ''al-Imadiyyah''—the Kurdish town of [[Amadiya]], northeast of [[Mosul]] inside [[Kurdistan]], and, like the [[Jumblatt]]s, is thought to be of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] tribal origin, the Janpulad (&quot;soul of steel&quot;) are still found east of [[Adana]] in Turkey, across the borders from Syria. The leading &quot;Atrash&quot; family also can trace its background to the Kurdish tribe, the Hartush/Atrush, found in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey today. {{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The Arsalan family claims descent from the [[Hirah]] Arab kings, but the name ''Arsalan'' (Persian and Turkish for lion) suggests Persian influence, if not origin.{{Sfn |Hitti |1924}}{{Rp|needed =yes|date=April 2012}}

During the 18th century, there were two branches of Druze living in Lebanon: the Yemeni Druze, headed by the &quot;Harmouche&quot; and &quot;Alamuddine&quot; families; and the Kaysi Druze, headed by the [[Jumblatt family|Jumblatt]] and [[Arslan family|Arslan]] families. The Harmouche family was banished from [[Mount Lebanon]] following the [[battle of Ain Dara]] in 1711. The battle was fought between two Druze factions: the Yemeni and the Kaysi. Following their dramatic defeat, the Yemeni faction migrated to Syria in the [[Jebel-Druze]] region and its capital, [[As-Suwayda]]. However, it has been argued that these two factions were of a political nature, rather than ethnic, and had both Christian and Druze supporters.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

==== Iturean hypothesis ====
According to Jewish contemporary literature, the Druze, who were visited and described in 1165 by [[Benjamin of Tudela]], were pictured as descendants of the [[Itureans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitti|first=P. K. |title=The Origins of the Druze People and Religion: With Extracts from Their Sacred Writings|work=Library of Alexandria|year=1966 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pYgvLf2GE8YC&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=druze+benjamin+of+tudela#v=onepage&amp;q=druze%20benjamin%20of%20tudela&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-4655-4662-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Ismaelite]] [[Arab]] tribe, which used to reside in the northern parts of the [[Golan Heights|Golan plateau]] through Hellenistic and Roman periods. The word Druzes, in an early Hebrew edition of his travels, occurs as &quot;Dogziyin&quot;, but it is clear that this is a scribal error.

Archaeological assessments of the Druze region have also proposed the possibility of Druze descending from Itureans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dar|first=Shimon|date=1988|title=The History of the Hermon Settlements|journal=Palestine Exploration Quarterly|volume=120|issue=1|pages=26–44|doi=10.1179/peq.1988.120.1.26|issn=0031-0328|quote=Heretofore studies of the Ituraeans have been based on historical sources and written history. Archaeological surveys from 1968 to ... Proposes the possibility that the Druze descended from the Ituraeans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had inhabited [[Mount Lebanon]] and [[Golan Heights]] in late classic antiquity, but their traces fade in the Middle Ages.

=== Genetics ===
In a 2005 study of [[ASPM (gene)|ASPM gene variants]], Mekel-Bobrov et al. found that the [[Israelis|Israeli]] Druze people of the [[Mount Carmel]] region have among the highest rate of the newly evolved ASPM- Haplogroup D, at 52.2% occurrence of the approximately 6,000-year-old allele.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/309/5741/1720 |title=Ongoing Adaptive Evolution of ASPM, a Brain Size Determinant in Homo sapiens |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=9 September 2005 |volume=309 |number=5741 |pages=1720–22 |doi=10.1126/science.1116815 |pmid=16151010|bibcode=2005Sci...309.1720M |last1=Mekel-Bobrov |first1=N |last2=Gilbert |first2=SL |last3=Evans |first3=PD |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not yet known exactly what selective advantage is provided by this gene variant, the Haplogroup D allele is thought to be positively selected in populations and to confer some substantial advantage that has caused its frequency to rapidly increase.

One small [[DNA]] study has shown that Israeli Druze are remarkable for the high frequency (35%) of males who carry the [[Y-chromosome|Y-chromosomal]] [[Haplogroup L (Y-DNA)|haplogroup L]] (though some [[Afshar, Syria|Afshar]] village{{dubious|word(s) missing, sense probably lost|date=December 2016}} and the [[Raqqa]] Syrians have even more), which is otherwise uncommon in the Mideast (Shen et al. 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reconstruction of Patrilineages and Matrilineages of Samaritans and Other Israeli Populations From Y-Chromosome and Mitochondrial DNA Sequence Variation |author=Peidong Shen |display-authors=etal |journal=Human Mutation |date=2004 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=248–260 |url=http://evolutsioon.ut.ee/publications/Shen2004.pdf |accessdate=2 December 2016 |doi=10.1002/humu.20077|pmid=15300852 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This haplogroup originates from prehistoric [[South Asia]] and has spread from [[Pakistan]] into southern [[Iran]]. However, studies done on larger samples showed that L-M20 averages 5% in Israeli Druze,&lt;ref group=Footnote&gt;12/222 Shlush et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 8% in Lebanese Druze,&lt;ref group=Footnote&gt;1/25 Shlush et al. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not found in a sample of 59 Syrian Druze.

Cruciani in 2007 found E1b1b1a2 (E-V13) [a subclade of E1b1b1a (E-M78)] in high levels (&gt;10% of the male population) in Turkish Cypriot and Druze Arab lineages. Recent genetic clustering analyses of ethnic groups are consistent with the close ancestral relationship between the Druze and Cypriots, and also identified similarity to the general Syrian and Lebanese populations, as well as a variety of Jewish groups (Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Iraqi, and Moroccan) (Behar et al. 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Behar2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Doron M.

Also, a new study concluded that the Druze harbor a remarkable diversity of [[human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] lineages that appear to have separated from each other thousands of years ago. But instead of dispersing throughout the world after their separation, the full range of lineages can still be found within the Druze population.&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{Citation |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080508182219.htm |date=12 May 2008|title=Genetics Confirm Oral Traditions of Druze In Israel |journal=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers noted that the Druze villages contained a striking range of high frequency and high diversity of the [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X haplogroup]], suggesting that this population provides a glimpse into the past genetic landscape of the [[Near East]] at a time when the X haplogroup was more prevalent.&lt;ref name=dna /&gt;

These findings are consistent with the Druze [[oral tradition]], that claims that the adherents of the faith came from diverse ancestral lineages stretching back tens of thousands of years.&lt;ref name=dna /&gt; The [[Shroud of Turin]] analysis shows significant traces of mitochondrial DNA unique to the Druze community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Uncovering the sources of DNA found on the Turin Shroud|first1=Gianni|last1=Barcaccia|first2=Giulio|last2=Galla|first3=Alessandro|last3=Achilli|first4=Anna|last4=Olivieri|first5=Antonio|last5=Torroni|date=5 October 2015|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|issue=1|pages=14484|doi=10.1038/srep14484|pmid=26434580|pmc=4593049|bibcode=2015NatSR...514484B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study published on the genetic background of Druze communities in Israel showed highly heterogeneous parental origins. A total of 311 Israeli Druze were sampled: 37 from the [[Golan Heights]], 183 from the [[Galilee]], and 35 from [[Mount Carmel]], as well as 27 Druze immigrants from Syria and 29 from Lebanon.

A 2016 study based on testing samples of Druze in the [[Syria (region)]] in comparison with ancient humans (including Anatolian and Armenian), and on Geographic Population Structure (GPS) tool by converting genetic distances into geographic distances, concluded that Druze might hail from the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the surroundings of [[Lake Van]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], then they later migrated south to settle in the mountainous regions in Syria, Lebanon and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author1=Scarlett Marshall | author2=Ranajit Das | author3=Mehdi Pirooznia | author4=Eran Elhaik|title=Reconstructing Druze population history | journal=Scientific Reports | volume=6 | pages=35837 |date=16 November 2016 | doi=10.1038/srep35837 | pmid=27848937 | pmc=5111078 | bibcode=2016NatSR...635837M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
