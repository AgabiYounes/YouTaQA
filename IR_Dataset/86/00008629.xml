'''Donald Henry Rumsfeld''' (born July 9, 1932) is an American former politician. Rumsfeld served as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] from 1975 to 1977 under [[Gerald Ford]], and again from January 2001 to December 2006 under [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Office Rumsfeld Ford Administration&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.defense.gov/Multimedia/Biographies/Article-View/Article/571288/donald-h-rumsfeld/ |title=Donald H. Rumsfeld – Gerald Ford Administration |work=Office of the Secretary of Defense - Historical Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is both the youngest and the second-oldest person to have served as Secretary of Defense. Additionally, Rumsfeld was a three-term [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] from [[Illinois]] (1963–1969), director of the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (1969–1970), counsellor &lt;!-- This is the correct spelling per Rumsfeld's 2011 memoir --&gt; to the president (1969–1973), the [[United States Permanent Representative to NATO]] (1973–1974), and [[White House Chief of Staff]] (1974–1975). Between his terms as Secretary of Defense, he served as the CEO and chairman of several companies.

Born in Illinois, Rumsfeld attended [[Princeton University]], graduating in 1954 with a degree in [[political science]]. After serving in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for three years, he mounted a campaign for Congress in Illinois's 13th Congressional District, winning in 1962 at the age of 30. While in Congress, he was a leading co-sponsor of the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. Rumsfeld reluctantly accepted an appointment by President [[Richard Nixon]] to head the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969; appointed counsellor by Nixon and entitled to Cabinet-level status, he would also head up the [[Economic Stabilization Act of 1970|Economic Stabilization Program]] before being appointed ambassador to NATO. Called back to Washington in August 1974, Rumsfeld was appointed chief of staff by President Ford. Rumsfeld recruited a young one-time staffer of his, [[Dick Cheney]], to succeed him when Ford nominated him to be Secretary of Defense in 1975. When Ford lost the 1976 election, Rumsfeld returned to private business and financial life, and was named president and CEO of the [[pharmaceutical]] corporation [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]]. He was later named CEO of [[General Instrument]] from 1990 to 1993 and chairman of [[Gilead Sciences]] from 1997 to 2001.

Rumsfeld was appointed Secretary of Defense for a second time in January 2001 by President [[George W. Bush]]. As Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld played a central role in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. Before and during the Iraq War, he claimed that Iraq had an active [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] program; no stockpiles were ever found.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/truth/why/said.html |title=Truth, War And Consequences: Why War? - In Their Own Words - Who Said What When |publisher=[[PBS]] |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV program)|Frontline]] |access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.factcheck.org/2005/09/anti-war-ad-says-bush-cheney-rumsfeld/|title=Anti-war Ad Says Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld &amp; Rice &quot;Lied&quot; About Iraq|last=Jackson|first=Brooks|date=2005-09-26|website=FactCheck.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pentagon Inspector General report found that Rumsfeld's top policy aide &quot;developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaida relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/special-reports/iraq-intelligence/article24461020.html|title=Pentagon office produced 'alternative' intelligence on Iraq|last=Landay|first=Jonathan S. |work=[[McClatchy]] |access-date=2019-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld's tenure was controversial for [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|its use of torture]] and the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/04/politics/rumsfeld-says-he-offered-to-quit.html |title= Rumsfeld Says He Offered to Quit|journal=The New York Times|access-date=June 28, 2017|date= 2005-02-04|last1= Shanker|first1= Thom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld gradually lost political support and he resigned in late 2006.

===Nixon Administration===
[[File:Richard Nixon and Donald Rumsfeld with son Nick.jpg|thumb|right|Rumsfeld with his son, Nick, in the Oval Office with President Nixon, 1973]]
Rumsfeld resigned from Congress in 1969{{snd}}his fourth term{{snd}}to serve President [[Richard Nixon]] in his administration, and he would serve in a variety of executive branch positions throughout the Nixon presidency. In 1969, Nixon sought to reform and reorganize the [[United States Office of Economic Opportunity]], an organization created during the [[Kennedy administration]] and greatly expanded as a part of [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] programs, rather than eliminate it outright. He appointed Rumsfeld Director of the organization with [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet rank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/virtuallibrary/documents/PDD/1969/017%20November%201-15%201969.pdf |title=President Richard Nixon's Daily Diary November 1, 1969 – November 15, 1969 |publisher=Nixon Library |date=2013-07-02 |accessdate=2017-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld had voted against the creation of OEO when he was in Congress, and initially rejected Nixon's offer, citing his own inherent belief that the OEO did more harm than good, and he felt that he was not the right person for the job.&lt;ref name=memoir&gt;{{cite book|title=Known and Unknown: A Memoir|publisher=[[Sentinel (publisher)|Sentinel]]|last=Rumsfeld |first=Donald|date=February 8, 2011|isbn=978-1-59523-067-6|title-link=Known and Unknown: A Memoir}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119–121}} He only accepted after personal pleas from the president.

As director, Rumsfeld sought to reorganize the Office to serve as &quot;a laboratory for experimental programs&quot;.&lt;ref name=memoir/&gt;{{rp|125}} Several beneficial [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty programs]] were saved by allocating funds to them from other less-successful government programs. During this time, he hired [[Frank Carlucci]] and [[Dick Cheney]] to serve under him.

He was the subject of one of legendary writer [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]]'s columns, alleging that &quot;anti-poverty czar&quot; Rumsfeld had cut programs to aid the poor while spending thousands to redecorate his office. Rumsfeld dictated a four-page response to Anderson, labeling the accusations as falsehoods, and invited Anderson to tour his office. Despite the tour, Anderson did not retract his claims, and would only much later admit that his column was a mistake.&lt;ref name=memoir/&gt;{{rp|125}}

When he left OEO in December 1970, Nixon named Rumsfeld [[Counselor to the President]], a general advisory position; in this role, he retained Cabinet status.&lt;ref name=ownrules /&gt;{{|75}} He was given an office in the [[West Wing]] in 1969 and regularly interacted with the [[Nixon administration]] hierarchy. He was named director of the [[Economic Stabilization Act of 1970|Economic Stabilization Program]] in 1970 as well, and later headed up the [[ACCRA Cost of Living Index|Cost of Living Council]]. In March 1971 Nixon was recorded saying about Rumsfeld &quot;at least Rummy is tough enough&quot; and &quot;He's a ruthless little bastard. You can be sure of that.&quot;&lt;ref name=rummy1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tapes.millercenter.virginia.edu/clips/rmn_rumsfeld.html |title=Nixon White House conversation 464-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124003134/http://tapes.millercenter.virginia.edu/clips/rmn_rumsfeld.html |archivedate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Cockburn|title=''Rumsfeld: His Rise, Fall, and Catastrophic Legacy''|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2007|page=20|author-link=Andrew Cockburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig Unger|title=''The Fall of the House of Bush: The Untold Story of how a Band of True Believers Seized the Executive Branch, Started the Iraq War, and Still Imperils America's Future''|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2007|page=50|author-link=Craig Unger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig Unger|title=''American Armageddon: How the Delusions of the Neoconservatives and the Christian Right Triggered the Descent of America – and Still Imperil Our Future''|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2008|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Naomi Klein|title=''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism''|publisher=[[Metropolitan Books]]/[[Henry Holt (publisher)|Henry Holt]]|year=2007|title-link=The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism|author-link=Naomi Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1973, Rumsfeld left Washington to serve as [[Ambassadors from the United States|U.S. Ambassador]] to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. He served as the United States' Permanent Representative to the [[North Atlantic Council]] and the [[Defense Planning Committee]], and the [[Nuclear Planning Group]]. In this capacity, he represented the United States in wide-ranging military and diplomatic matters, and was asked to help mediate a conflict on behalf of the United States between [[Cyprus]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=memoir/&gt;{{rp|157}}

===Ford Administration===

In August 1974, after Nixon resigned as president in the aftermath of the [[Watergate scandal]], Rumsfeld was called back to Washington to serve as transition chairman for the new president, [[Gerald Ford]]. He had been Ford's confidant since their days in the House, before Ford was House minority leader. As the new president became settled in, Ford appointed Rumsfeld [[White House Chief of Staff]], where he served from 1974 to 1975.

[[File:Ford-rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|left|Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld shares a laugh with President Ford in a Cabinet meeting, 1975]]

In October 1975, Ford reshuffled his cabinet in the [[Halloween Massacre]]. He named Rumsfeld to become the 13th U.S. Secretary of Defense; [[George H. W. Bush]] became [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. According to [[Bob Woodward]]'s 2002 book ''[[Bush at War]]'', a rivalry developed between the two men and &quot;Bush senior was convinced that Rumsfeld was pushing him out to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to end his political career.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodward|first=Bob|title=Bush At War|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7432-4461-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRzVPPstf3EC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=rumsfeld+ford+bush+cia+director|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[the Pentagon]], Rumsfeld oversaw the transition to an all-volunteer military. He sought to reverse the gradual decline in the defense budget and to build up U.S. strategic and conventional forces, skillfully undermining [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] at the [[SALT]] talks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTInfighter&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Defense Choice Made a Name As an Infighter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/08/us/defense-choice-made-a-name-as-an-infighter.html |first=Elaine |last=Sciolino |first2=Eric |last2=Schmitt |date=January 8, 2001 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=August 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714182443/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/08/us/defense-choice-made-a-name-as-an-infighter.html |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted, along with [[Team B]] (which he helped to set up),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hnn.us/articles/18668.html |author=Sidney Blumenthal |title=The Long March of Dick Cheney |publisher=[[History News Network|HNN]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217110948/http://hnn.us/articles/18668.html |archivedate=December 17, 2005 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; that trends in comparative U.S.-[[Soviet armed forces|Soviet]] military strength had not favored the United States for 15 to 20 years and that, if continued, they &quot;would have the effect of injecting a fundamental instability in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=defenselink1/&gt; For this reason, he oversaw the development of [[cruise missile]]s, the [[B-1 Lancer|B-1 bomber]], and a major naval shipbuilding program.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTInfighter&quot;/&gt;

In 1977, Rumsfeld was awarded the nation's highest civilian award, the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Historical Office Rumsfeld Bush Administration&quot;/&gt; Kissinger, his bureaucratic adversary, would later pay him a different sort of compliment, pronouncing him &quot;a special Washington phenomenon: the skilled full-time politician-bureaucrat in whom ambition, ability, and substance fuse seamlessly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2003/11/rumsfelds-roots/378570/ |title=Rumsfeld's Roots |last=Mann |first=James |date=October 8, 2003 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=August 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709025136/http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200310u/int2003-10-08 |archivedate=July 9, 2008 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to the private sector (1977–2000)==
===Business career===
In early 1977 Rumsfeld briefly lectured at Princeton's [[Woodrow Wilson School]] and Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]], located in Chicago, Illinois. His sights instead turned to business, and from 1977 to 1985 Rumsfeld served as chief executive officer, president, and then chairman of [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]], a worldwide pharmaceutical company based in [[Skokie, Illinois]]. During his tenure at Searle, Rumsfeld led the company's financial turnaround, thereby earning awards as the Outstanding Chief Executive Officer in the Pharmaceutical Industry from the ''Wall Street Transcript'' (1980) and ''Financial World'' (1981). In 1985, Searle was sold to [[Monsanto Company]].

Rumsfeld served as chairman and chief executive officer of [[General Instrument Corporation]] from 1990 to 1993. A leader in broadband transmission, distribution, and access control technologies for cable, satellite and terrestrial broadcasting applications, the company pioneered the development of the first all-digital [[high-definition television]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]]) technology. After taking the company public and returning it to profitability, Rumsfeld returned to private business in late 1993.

From January 1997 until being sworn in as the 21st Secretary of Defense in January 2001, Rumsfeld served as chairman of [[Gilead Sciences|Gilead Sciences, Inc.]] Gilead Sciences is the developer of Tamiflu ([[Oseltamivir]]), which is used in the treatment of [[H5N1|bird flu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ |work=[[Gilead Sciences]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619044137/http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ |archivedate=June 19, 2007 |title=Donald H. Rumsfeld Named Chairman of Gilead Sciences |date= January 3, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Rumsfeld's holdings in the company grew significantly when avian flu became a subject of popular anxiety during his later term as Secretary of Defense. Following standard practice, Rumsfeld [[recusal|recused]] himself from any decisions involving Gilead, and he directed the Pentagon's [[General Counsel]] to issue instructions outlining what he could and could not be involved in if there were an avian flu pandemic and the Pentagon had to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Roche, Gilead Sciences resolve Tamiflu conflict|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-11-16-tamiflu-usat_x.htm |work=USA Today|first1=Julie|last1=Schmit |date=November 17, 2005|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 31, 2005 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/10/31/news/newsmakers/fortune_rumsfeld/ |department=[[CNNMoney]] |title=Rumsfeld's growing stake in Tamiflu |first1=Nelson D. |last1=Schwartz |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314083340/http://money.cnn.com/2005/10/31/news/newsmakers/fortune_rumsfeld/ |archivedate=March 14, 2010 |url-status=live |accessdate=May 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part-time public service===
During his business career, Rumsfeld continued part-time public service in various posts. In November 1983, Rumsfeld was appointed Special Envoy to the Middle East by President [[Ronald Reagan]], at a turbulent time in modern Middle Eastern history when Iraq was fighting Iran in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The United States wished for the conflict to end, and Rumsfeld was sent to the Middle East to serve as a mediator on behalf of the President.

[[File:Saddam rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|right|As President Reagan's Special Envoy to the [[Middle East]], Rumsfeld met with [[Saddam Hussein]] during a visit to [[Baghdad]] in December 1983, during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (see video [[:File:Shakinghands high.OGG|here]]).]]

When Rumsfeld visited [[Baghdad]] on December 20, 1983, he met Saddam Hussein at Saddam's palace and had a 90-minute discussion. They largely agreed on opposing Syria's occupation of [[Lebanon]]; preventing Syrian and Iranian expansion; and preventing arms sales to Iran. Rumsfeld suggested that if U.S.-Iraq relations could improve the U.S. might support a new [[oil pipeline]] across [[Jordan]], which Iraq had opposed but was now willing to reconsider. Rumsfeld also informed Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and [[Foreign relations of Iraq|Foreign Minister]] [[Tariq Aziz]] that &quot;Our efforts to assist were inhibited by certain things that made it difficult for us ... citing the use of chemical weapons.&quot;&lt;ref name=ownrules /&gt;{{rp|159–60}}

Rumsfeld wrote in his memoir ''Known and Unknown'' that his meeting with Hussein &quot;has been the subject of gossip, rumors, and crackpot conspiracy theories for more than a quarter of a century ... Supposedly I had been sent to see Saddam by President Reagan either to negotiate a secret oil deal, to help arm Iraq, or to make Iraq an American [[client state]]. The truth is that our encounter was more straightforward and less dramatic.&quot;&lt;ref name=memoir/&gt;{{rp|6}}

In addition to taking the position of Middle East envoy, Rumsfeld served as a member of the President's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control (1982–1986); President Reagan's Special Envoy on the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] (1982–1983); a senior adviser to President Reagan's Panel on Strategic Systems (1983–1984); a member of the Joint Advisory Commission on U.S./Japan Relations (1983–1984); a member of the National Commission on the Public Service (1987–1990); a member of the [[National Economic Commission]] (1988–1989); a member of the board of visitors of the [[National Defense University]] (1988–1992); a member of the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s High Definition Television Advisory Committee (1992–1993); a member of the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission (1999–2000); a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]; and chairman of the U.S. Commission to Assess National Security Space Management and Organization (2000). Among his most noteworthy positions was chairman of the nine-member [[Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States]] from January to July 1998. In its findings, the commission concluded that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea could develop intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities in five to ten years and that U.S. intelligence would have little warning before such systems were deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/threat/missile/rumsfeld/ |title=Report of the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States |date=15 July 1998 |accessdate=2019-05-29 |work=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |display-authors=etal |first=Donald |last=Rumsfeld }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, Rumsfeld became a member of the [[National Academy of Public Administration (United States)|National Academy of Public Administration]], and was named a member of the boards of trustees of the Gerald R. Ford Foundation, the [[Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships]], the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] and the [[National Park Foundation]]. He was also a member of the U.S./Russia Business Forum and chairman of the Congressional Leadership's National Security Advisory Group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Rumsfeld was a member of the [[Project for the New American Century]], a think-tank dedicated to maintaining U.S. primacy. In addition, he was asked to serve the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] as a foreign policy consultant from 1990 to 1993. He also sat on European engineering giant [[Asea Brown Boveri]]'s board from 1990 to 2001, a company which sold two light-water nuclear reactors to the [[Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization]] for installation in [[North Korea]], as part of the [[Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|1994 agreed framework]] reached under President [[Bill Clinton]]. Rumsfeld's office said that he did not &quot;recall it being brought before the board at any time&quot; though ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine reported that &quot;board members were informed about this project.&quot;&lt;ref name=rummy2&gt;{{cite news|title=Rummy's North Korea Connection; What did Donald Rumsfeld know about ABB's deal to build nuclear reactors there? And why won't he talk about it?|work=Fortune|date=May 12, 2003|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential and vice presidential aspirations===
During the [[1976 Republican National Convention]], Rumsfeld received one vote for [[Vice President of the United States]], although he did not seek the office, and the nomination was easily won by Ford's choice, Senator [[Bob Dole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=59886 |title=US Vice President – R Convention |work=OurCampaigns |accessdate=May 29, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] he also received one vote for vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Vice President – R Convention|publisher=OurCampaigns|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=59877 |accessdate=May 29, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Milton Friedman]] later noted that he, Friedman, regarded Reagan's pick of Bush as &quot;the worst decision not only of his campaign but of his presidency,&quot; and that Rumsfeld was instead his preference. &quot;Had he been chosen,&quot; Friedman said, &quot;I believe he would have succeeded Reagan as president and the sorry Bush-Clinton period would never have occurred.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ennh28taSiEC&amp;pg=pa391 |title=Two Lucky People: Memoirs|first=Milton |last=Friedman |authorlink=Milton Friedman |first2=Rose |last2=Friedman |authorlink2=Rose Friedman|date=June 8, 1998|place=[[Chicago]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|page=391|isbn=978-0226264141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld briefly sought the presidential nomination [[1988 United States presidential election|in 1988]], but withdrew from the race before [[primary election|primaries]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US President – R Primaries|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55211 |publisher=OurCampaigns |accessdate=2019-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]] season, he initially formed a [[presidential exploratory committee]], but declined to formally enter the race. He was instead named national chairman for Republican nominee [[Bob Dole]]'s campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=AmericaLive |url-status=dead |url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-521030 |title=Donald Rumsfeld Biography |work=[[iReport]] |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2017-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528031323/http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-521030 |archive-date=May 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to government (2001–2006)==
[[File:Rumsfeld is sworn-in as Secretary of Defense, January 20, 2001.jpg|thumb|Rumsfeld is administered the oath of office as the 21st Secretary of Defense on January 20, 2001 by [[Director of Administration and Management (DoD)|Director of Administration and Management]] [[David O. Cooke]] (left), as Joyce Rumsfeld holds the Bible in a ceremony at the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]]]

Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense soon after President [[George W. Bush]] took office in 2001 despite Rumsfeld's past rivalry with the previous President Bush. Bush's first choice, [[FedEx]] founder [[Frederick W. Smith|Fred Smith]], was unavailable and Vice President-elect Cheney recommended Rumsfeld for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W. (2010), pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;
Rumsfeld's second tenure as Secretary of Defense cemented him as the most powerful Pentagon chief since [[Robert McNamara]] and one of the most influential Cabinet members in the Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2002-12-09-1a-cover_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=November 17, 2011|date=December 9, 2002|author=Moniz, Dave|title=Rumsfeld's abrasive style sparks conflict}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure would prove to be a pivotal and rocky one which led the United States military into the 21st century. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], Rumsfeld led the military planning and execution of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] and the subsequent [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He pushed hard to send as small a force as soon as possible to both conflicts, a concept codified as the [[Rumsfeld Doctrine]].

Throughout his time as defense secretary, Rumsfeld was noted for his candor and quick wit when giving weekly press conferences or speaking with the press.&lt;ref name=candor&gt;{{cite news|date=January 20, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/opinion/rumsfeld-s-moment.html |accessdate=November 17, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Wright, Robert |title=Rumsfeld's Moment |archivedate=May 14, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514141146/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/opinion/rumsfeld-s-moment.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' called him &quot;a straight-talking Midwesterner&quot; who &quot;routinely has the press corps doubled over in fits of laughter&quot;.&lt;ref name=candor/&gt; By the same token, his leadership was exposed to much criticism through provocative books covering the Iraq conflict, like Bob Woodward's ''State of Denial'', Thomas E. Ricks' ''Fiasco'', and Seymour Hersh's ''Chain of Command''.

===September 11, 2001===
[[File:The Pentagon is functioning.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Pentagon is functioning&quot; was the message Rumsfeld stressed during a press conference in the Pentagon briefing room barely eight hours after terrorists crashed a hijacked commercial jetliner into the Pentagon. Rumsfeld is flanked, left to right, by [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] [[Thomas E.

Rumsfeld wrote in ''Known and Unknown'', &quot;Much has been written about the Bush administration's focus on Iraq after 9/11. Commentators have suggested that it was strange or obsessive for the President and his advisers to have raised questions about whether Saddam Hussein was somehow behind the attack. I have never understood the controversy.

Before and during the Iraq War, Rumsfeld claimed that Iraq had an active weapons of mass destruction program; no stockpiles were ever found.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Bush administration officials also claimed that there was an operational relationship between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. A Pentagon Inspector General report found that Rumsfeld's top policy aide, [[Douglas J. Feith]], &quot;developed, produced, and then disseminated alternative intelligence assessments on the Iraq and al Qaida relationship, which included some conclusions that were inconsistent with the consensus of the Intelligence Community, to senior decision-makers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

After the war in Afghanistan was launched, Rumsfeld participated in a meeting in regard to the review of the Department of Defense's Contingency Plan in the event of a war with Iraq. The plan, as it was then conceived, contemplated troop levels of up to 500,000, which Rumsfeld felt was far too many. Gordon and Trainor wrote:

{{quote|As [General] Newbold outlined the plan ... it was clear that Rumsfeld was growing increasingly irritated. For Rumsfeld, the plan required too many troops and supplies and took far too long to execute. It was, Rumsfeld declared, the &quot;product of old thinking and the embodiment of everything that was wrong with the military.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;inside&quot;&gt;Id.Gordon, Michael R. and Bernard E. Trainor, Cobra II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq, 2006. Book excerpt from the Denver Post&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rumsfeld's plan resulted in a lightning invasion that took Baghdad in well under a month with very few American casualties. Many government buildings, plus major museums, electrical generation infrastructure, and even oil equipment were looted and vandalized during the transition from the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime to the establishment of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]. A violent [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|insurrection]] began shortly after the military operation started. After the [[Germany|German]] and [[France|French]] governments voiced opposition to invading Iraq, Rumsfeld labeled these countries as part of &quot;[[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]]&quot;, implying that countries that supported the war were part of a newer, modern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 1, 2010 |date=January 23, 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2687403.stm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421002430/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2687403.stm |archivedate=April 21, 2010 |url-status=live |work=BBC News |title=Outrage at 'old Europe' remarks }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Rumsfeld stirred controversy as to whether the forces that did invade Iraq were enough in size.&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; In a September 2007 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', General [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]], the head of the [[British army]] during the invasion, criticized Rumsfeld's plans for the invasion of Iraq as &quot;intellectually bankrupt,&quot; adding that Rumsfeld is &quot;one of those most responsible for the current situation in Iraq,&quot; and that he felt that &quot;the US approach to combating global terrorism is 'inadequate' and too focused on military might rather than [[nation building]] and diplomacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/01/wirq601.xml |author1=Robert Watts |author2=Tim Shipman |title=Gen Sir Mike Jackson's attack draws US ire |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] (online) |work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |date=September 1, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017092732/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F09%2F01%2Fwirq601.xml |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |location=London |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rumsfeld responded to a question by [[Brit Hume]] of Fox News as to whether he pressed General [[Tommy Franks]] to lower his request for 400,000 troops for the war:

{{quote|Absolutely not. That's a mythology. This town [Washington, D.C] is filled with this kind of nonsense.

There was also controversy between Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and the CIA over who had the authority to fire [[Hellfire missiles]] from [[RQ-1 Predator|Predator drones]].&lt;ref name=gpo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec6.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112165907/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec6.pdf |archivedate=January 12, 2012 }} (pp. 189–90, 211–214)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the drones were not ready for deployment until 2002,&lt;ref name=gpo/&gt; [[Daniel Benjamin]] and [[Steven Simon]] have argued that &quot;these quarrels kept the Predator from being used against al Qaeda ...

He has helped the terrorists.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Daniel Benjamin|author2=Steven Simon|title=''The Next Attack''|place=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Times Books]]|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8050-7941-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/nextattackfailur00benj/page/161 161]|url=https://archive.org/details/nextattackfailur00benj/page/161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Iraq invasion, U.S. troops were criticized for not protecting the historical artifacts and treasures located at the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. When asked at the time why U.S. troops did not actively seek to stop the lawlessness, Rumsfeld replied, &quot;Stuff happens ... and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They're also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that's what's going to happen here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StuffHappens&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2367 |title=DoD News Briefing – Secretary Rumsfeld and Gen.

Rumsfeld and General [[Richard Myers]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], gave reporters an operational update on Operation Iraqi Freedom on October 2, 2003.]]
Throughout his tenure, Rumsfeld sought to remind the American people of the 9/11 attacks and threats against Americans, noting at one time in a 2006 memo to &quot;[m]ake the American people realize they are surrounded in the world by violent extremists&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=MCJYFVHYHCMGNQFIQMGSFGGAVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2007/11/02/wgulf402.xml |title=Rumsfeld 'kept up fear of terror attacks' |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=March 11, 2007 |location=London |first=Boris |last=Johnson |url-status=live |archivedate=November 16, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116052736/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml%3Bjsessionid%3DMCJYFVHYHCMGNQFIQMGSFGGAVCBQWIV0?xml=%2Fnews%2F2007%2F11%2F02%2Fwgulf402.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FromDesk&quot;/&gt;

As Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld was deliberate in crafting the public message from the Department of Defense. People will &quot;rally&quot; to the word &quot;sacrifice&quot;, Rumsfeld noted after a meeting. &quot;They are looking for leadership. Sacrifice = Victory.&quot; In May 2004, Rumsfeld considered whether to redefine the war on terrorism as a fight against &quot;worldwide insurgency&quot;. He advised aides &quot;to test what the results could be&quot; if the war on terrorism were renamed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FromDesk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/31/AR2007103103095.html?hpid=topnews|title=From the Desk of Donald Rumsfeld ... |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 1, 2007|first=Robin|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld also ordered specific public Pentagon attacks on and responses to U.S. newspaper columns that reported the negative aspects of the war.

In October 2003, Rumsfeld approved a secret Pentagon &quot;roadmap&quot; on public relations, calling for &quot;boundaries&quot; between information operations abroad and the news media at home. The Roadmap advances a policy according to which as long as the U.S. government does not intentionally target the American public, it does not matter that [[psychological operations]] reach the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Australia Broadcasting Corporation reported that though Rumsfeld didn't specify a withdrawal date for troops in Iraq, &quot;He says it would be unrealistic to wait for Iraq to be peaceful before removing US led forces from the country, adding that Iraq had never been peaceful and perfect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-09-25/us-troops-can-leave-before-iraq-peaceful-rumsfeld/557522 |newspaper=Australia Broadcasting Corporation |title=US troops can leave before Iraq peaceful: Rumsfeld |first= |last= |date=September 24, 2004 |accessdate=April 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Condolence letters ===
In December 2004, Rumsfeld was heavily criticized for using a [[Autopen|signing machine]] instead of personally signing over 1000 letters of condolence to the families of soldiers killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. He promised to personally sign all letters in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/rumsfeld-to-personally-sign-all-condolence-letters-1.27255|title=Rumsfeld to personally sign all condolence letters|last=|first=|date=Dec 17, 2004|work=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2017-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prisoner abuse and torture concerns===

{{Further|Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse}}
The Department of Defense's preliminary concerns for holding, housing, and interrogating captured prisoners on the battlefield were raised during the military build-up prior to the Iraq War. Because Saddam Hussein's military forces surrendered when faced with military action, many within the DOD, including Rumsfeld and United States Central Command General [[Tommy Franks]], decided it was in the best interest of all to hand these prisoners over to their respective countries. Additionally, it was determined that maintaining a large holding facility was, at the time, unrealistic. Instead, the use of many facilities such as [[Abu Ghraib]] would be utilized to house prisoners of interest prior to handing them over, and Rumsfeld defended the Bush administration's decision to detain [[enemy combatant]]s. Because of this, critics, including members of the [[U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee]], would hold Rumsfeld responsible for the ensuing [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal. Rumsfeld himself said: &quot;These events occurred on my watch as Secretary of Defense. I am accountable for them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/09/iraq.abuse.main.int/ |agency=CNN |title=Rumsfeld 'the best' |date=May 9, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040511033734/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/09/iraq.abuse.main.int/ |archivedate=May 11, 2004 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered his resignation to President Bush in the wake of the scandal, but it was not accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W.

In a memo read by Rumsfeld detailing how Guantanamo interrogators would induce stress in prisoners by forcing them to remain standing in one position for a maximum of four hours, Rumsfeld scrawled a handwritten note on the memo reading: &quot;I stand for 8–10 hours a day.

In the months after his resignation, Rumsfeld toured the [[New York City|New York]] publishing houses in preparation for a potential memoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nysun.com/national/publishers-abuzz-over-possible-rumsfeld-book/57376/ |first=Gary |last=Shapiro |title=Publishers Abuzz Over Possible Rumsfeld Book |date=June 27, 2007 |work=[[The New York Sun]] |accessdate=2019-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving what one industry source labeled &quot;big bids&quot;, he reached an agreement with the [[Penguin Group]] to publish the book under its [[Sentinel HC]] imprint.

Rumsfeld was awarded the &quot;Defender of the Constitution Award&quot; at the 2011 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] in Washington, D.C., on February 10, 2011.

After his retirement from government, Rumsfeld criticized former fellow Cabinet member [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in his memoir, asserting that she was basically unfit for office. In 2011 she responded, saying that Rumsfeld &quot;doesn't know what he's talking about.
