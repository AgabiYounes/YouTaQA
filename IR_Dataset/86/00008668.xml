==Early life==
Bricklin was born in a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A list of famous Jewish American Computer Scientists. |url=http://www.jewishsoftware.net/jewish-software/jewish-american-computer-scientists
    |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131014110109/http://www.jewishsoftware.net/jewish-software/jewish-american-computer-scientists

He began his college career as a [[mathematics]] major, but soon switched to computer science. He earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1973, where he was a resident of [[List of MIT dormitories#Bexley Hall|Bexley Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TS&quot;&gt;[http://www.techstars.org/mentors/dbricklin/ Dan Bricklin Co-creator of VisiCalc, and Founder of Software Garden, Inc.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231035123/http://www.techstars.org/mentors/dbricklin/ |date=2010-12-31 }}. [[TechStars]]. Accessed Jan 3 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EI&quot;/&gt;

Upon graduating from MIT, Bricklin worked for Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) where he was part of the team that worked on [[WPS-8]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Spira2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan B. Spira|title=Overload!: How Too Much Information is Hazardous to Your Organization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eC016EMcTmoC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=%22WPS-8%22%20%20%22DEC%22|date=18 April 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-06417-7|page=53|quote=...I spoke with Dan Bricklin, the co-inventor of [[VisiCalc]], who was on the team at DEC that developed WPS-8 in the mid-1970s...}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1976, when he began working for FasFax, a cash register manufacturer. In 1977 he returned to education, and was awarded a [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI&quot;/&gt;

While a student at Harvard Business School, Bricklin co-developed VisiCalc in 1979, making it the first electronic spreadsheet readily available for home and office use. It ran on an [[Apple II]] computer, and was considered a fourth generation software program. VisiCalc is widely credited for fueling the rapid growth of the personal computer industry. Instead of doing financial projections with manually calculated spreadsheets, and having to recalculate with every single cell in the sheet, VisiCalc allowed the user to change any cell, and have the entire sheet automatically recalculated. This could turn 20 hours of work into 15 minutes and allowed for more creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inventors&quot;&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa010199.htm The First Spreadsheet - VisiCalc]. [[About.com: Inventors]]. Accessed January 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Software Arts===
In 1979, Bricklin and Frankston founded Software Arts, Inc., and began selling VisiCalc, via a separate company named [[VisiCorp]]. Along with co-founder Bob Frankston, he started writing versions of the program for the Tandy TRS-80, Commodore PET and the Atari 800. Soon after its launch, VisiCalc became a fast seller at $100.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Inventors&quot;/&gt;

Software Arts also published [[TK/Solver]]&lt;ref&gt;a numeric equation solving system&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;and ''Spotlight'',&quot;a desktop organizer for the I.B.M. Personal Computer.&quot;&lt;ref name=TK2.NYT&gt;{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]

Bricklin was awarded the [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]] in 1981 for VisiCalc. Bricklin could not patent VisiCalc, since software programs were not eligible for patent protection at the time.

Other versions released soon after included demo-it!. He remained the president of the company until he co-founded Slate Corporation in 1990. In 1992, he became the vice president of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based&lt;ref name=PhoenixAtHand&gt;{{cite newspaper
