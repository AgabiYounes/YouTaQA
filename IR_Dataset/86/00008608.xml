A '''dolmen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|l|m|ɛ|n}}) is a type of single-chamber [[Megalith#Tombs|megalithic tomb]], usually consisting of two or more vertical [[megalith]]s supporting a large flat horizontal capstone or &quot;table&quot;. Most date from the early [[Neolithic]] (4000{{ndash}}3000 BC) and were sometimes covered with earth or smaller stones to form a [[tumulus]]. Small pad-stones may be wedged between the cap and supporting stones to achieve a level appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;m43&quot;&gt;Murphy (1997), 43&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances, the covering has weathered away, leaving only the stone &quot;skeleton&quot; of the mound intact.

It remains unclear when, why and by whom the earliest dolmens were made. The oldest known are found in Western Europe, dating from c 7,000 years ago. Archaeologists still do not know who erected these dolmens, which makes it difficult to know why they did it. They are generally all regarded as tombs or burial chambers, despite the absence of clear evidence for this. Human remains, sometimes accompanied by artefacts, have been found in or close to the dolmens which could be scientifically dated using [[radiocarbon dating]]. However, it has been impossible to prove that these remains date from the time when the stones were originally set in place.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, S.

The word ''dolmen'' has an unclear history. The word entered archaeology when [[Théophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne]] used it to describe megalithic tombs in his ''Origines gauloises'' (1796) using the spelling ''dolmin'' (the current spelling was introduced about a decade later and had become standard in French by about 1885).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakker|first=Jan Albert|title=Megalithic Research in the Netherlands, 1547–1911|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_MQiK5ATCL1wC|year=2009|publisher=Sidestone Press|isbn=978-9088900341 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, {{google books|vmpAAAAAcAAJ|Origines gauloises. Celles des plus anciens peuples de l'Europe puisées dans leur vraie source ou recherche sur la langue, l'origine et les antiquités des Celto-bretons de l'Armorique, pour servir à l'histoire ancienne et moderne de ce peuple et à celle des Français|page=PR1}}, 1796–97.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' does not mention &quot;dolmin&quot; in English and gives its first citation for &quot;dolmen&quot; from a book on [[Brittany]] in 1859, describing the word as &quot;The French term, used by some English authors, for a [[cromlech]] ...&quot;.  The name was supposedly derived from a [[Breton language]] term meaning &quot;stone table&quot; but doubt has been cast on this, and the ''OED'' describes its origin as &quot;Modern French&quot;. A book on [[Cornwall|Cornish]] antiquities from 1754 said that the current term in the [[Cornish language]] for a cromlech was ''tolmen'' (&quot;hole of stone&quot;) and the OED says that &quot;There is reason to think that this was the term inexactly reproduced by Latour d'Auvergne [sic] as ''dolmen'', and misapplied by him and succeeding French archaeologists to the ''cromlech''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'' &quot;Dolmen&quot;, 1st edition, 1897&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless it has now replaced cromlech as the usual English term in archaeology, when the more technical and descriptive alternatives are not used. The later Cornish term was [[wikt:quoit|quoit]]  - an English language word for an object with a hole through the middle preserving the original Cornish language term of 'Tolmen'  - the name of another dolmen-like monument is in fact [[Mên-an-Tol]] 'stone with hole' (SWF: ''Men An Toll''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/nov/12/maevkennedy1&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dolmens are known by a variety of names in other languages, including {{lang-ga|dolmain}}, [[Galician language|Galician]] and {{lang-pt|anta}}, Bulgarian: Долмени Dolmeni, {{lang-de|Hünengrab/Hünenbett}}, [[Afrikaans]] and {{lang-nl|hunebed}}, {{lang-eu|trikuharri}}, {{lang-ab|Adamra}}, [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] Ispun, ''dysse'' ([[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), ''dös'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]), {{lang-ko|고인돌}} ''goindol (modernized word: stacked stone)'', &quot;dol (stone)&quot;, and {{lang-he|גַלעֵד}}. [[:wikt:granja|Granja]] is used in [[Portugal]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Spain]]. The rarer forms ''anta'' and ''ganda'' also appear. In the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], they are attributed to the ''[[jentil]]ak'', a race of giants.

The [[etymology]] of the {{lang-de|Hünenbett, Hünengrab}} and {{lang-nl|hunebed}} - with ''Hüne/hune'' meaning &quot;giant&quot; - all evoke the image of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] buried (bett/bed/grab = bed/grave)there. Of other [[Celtic languages]], {{lang-cy|cromlech}} was borrowed into English and ''quoit'' is commonly used in English in [[Cornwall]].
