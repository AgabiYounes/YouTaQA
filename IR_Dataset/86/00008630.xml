'''Diego Garcia''' is an island of the British Indian Ocean Territory, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. It is a militarised [[atoll]] just south of the [[equator]] in the central [[Indian Ocean]], and the largest of 60 small [[islands]] comprising the [[Chagos Archipelago]]. It was first discovered by Europeans and named by the Portuguese, settled by the French in the 1790s and transferred to British rule after the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It was one of the &quot;Dependencies&quot; of the British Colony of [[Mauritius]] until the Chagos Islands were detached for inclusion in the newly created [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT) in 1965.

In 1966, the population of the island was 924.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islanders v AG 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants =Chagos Islanders v Attorney General Her Majesty's British Indian Ocean Territory Commissioner |court = EWHC |division = QB |year = 2003 |num = 2222 |date = 9 October 2003 |courtname = auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|par 23}} These people were employed as contract farm workers on coconut plantations owned by the Chagos-Agalega company. Although it was common for local plantation managers to allow pensioners and the disabled to remain in the islands and continue to receive housing and rations in exchange for light work, children after the age of 12 were required to work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islanders v AG 2003&quot;/&gt; In 1964, only 3 of a population of 963 were unemployed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Islanders v AG 2003&quot;/&gt; In April 1967, the BIOT Administration bought out Chagos-Agalega for £600,000, thus becoming the sole property owner in the BIOT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bancoult&quot;&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants = R (on the application of Bancoult) v.

Between 1968 and 1973, the now unemployed farm workers were forcibly removed from Diego Garcia by the UK Government so a joint US/UK military base could be established on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Bengali |first=Shashank |url=http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-britain-us-diego-garcia-20180814-story.html | title=A half-century after being uprooted for a remote U.S. Naval base, these islanders are still fighting to return. |work= Los Angeles Times |date=14 August 2018 |accessdate=20 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were deported to [[Mauritius]] and the [[Seychelles]], following which the United States built a large naval and military base, which has been in continuous operation since then.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;/&gt; {{As of|2018|8}}, Diego Garcia is the only inhabited island of the BIOT; the population is composed of military personnel and supporting contractors. It is one of two critical US bomber bases in the [[Asia Pacific region]], along with [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]], [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/andersen.htm | title=Andersen AFB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The atoll is located {{convert|3535|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Tanzania]]'s coast, {{convert|1796|km|0|abbr=on}} south-southwest of the southern tip of [[India]] (at [[Kanyakumari]]), and {{convert|4723|km|0|abbr=on}} west-northwest of the west coast of [[Australia]] (at [[Cape Range National Park]], [[Western Australia]]). Diego Garcia lies at the southernmost tip of the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]], a vast underwater mountain range&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=im0125|name=Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with peaks consisting of [[coral reef]]s, atolls, and islands comprising [[Lakshadweep]], the [[Maldives]], and the Chagos Archipelago. Local time is [[UTC+06:00|UTC+6]] year-round ([[Daylight saving time|DST]] is not observed).&lt;ref name=USNWorldTimeChart&gt;{{cite web|title=World Time Chart |url=https://www.cnic.navy.mil/navycni/groups/public/documents/document/cnicd_a095922.pdf |publisher=US Navy |accessdate=7 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126224933/http://www.cnic.navy.mil/navycni/groups/public/documents/document/cnicd_a095922.pdf |archivedate=26 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2017, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UNGA) voted in favour  of referring the territorial dispute between Mauritius and the UK to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) in order to clarify the legal status of the Chagos Islands archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The motion was approved by a majority vote with 94 voting for and 15 against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sengupta|first1=Somini |title=U.N.

In February 2019, the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]] ruled that the United Kingdom must transfer the islands to Mauritius as they were not legally separated from the latter in 1965. The ruling is not legally binding.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chagos Islands dispute: UK obliged to end control – UN |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47358602 |work=BBC News |date=25 February 2019 |accessdate=25 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2019, the United Nations General Assembly affirmed the decision of the  International Court of Justice and demanded that the United Kingdom withdraw its colonial administration from the Islands and cooperate with Mauritius to facilitate the resettlement of Mauritian nationals in the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK suffers crushing defeat in UN vote on Chagos Islands|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/22/uk-suffers-crushing-defeat-un-vote-chagos-islands |work=The Guardian |date=23 May 2019 |accessdate=6 June 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 22 May 2019|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/73/295 |work=UN General Assembly |date=22 May 2019 |accessdate=6 June 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a written statement the U.S. government said that neither the Americans or the British have any plans to discontinue use of the military base on Diego Garcia.  The statement said in a footnote:

&quot;In 2016, there were discussions between the United Kingdom and the United States concerning the continuing importance of the joint base. Neither party gave notice to terminate and the agreement remains in force until 2036&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.stripes.com/news/un-ruling-raises-questions-about-future-of-us-mission-in-diego-garcia-1.571709 |title = UN ruling raises questions about future of US mission in Diego Garcia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Before European discovery===
[[File:DG Ariel Plantation.jpg|thumb|Coconut plantation, [[East Point, British Indian Ocean Territory|East Point]] (former main settlement)]]

According to Southern Maldivian oral tradition, traders and fishermen were occasionally lost at sea and got stranded on one of the islands of the Chagos. Eventually, they were rescued and brought back home. However, the different atolls of the Chagos have no individual names in the Maldivian [[oral tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom.'' Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}. Chapter 1 ''&quot;A Seafaring Nation&quot;,'' page 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Nothing is known of pre-European contact history of Diego Garcia. Speculations include visits during the [[Austronesia]]n diaspora around 700 AD, as some say the old Maldivian name for the islands originated from [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]. [[Arab people|Arabs]], who reached [[Lakshadweep]] and [[Maldives]] around 900 AD, may have visited the Chagos.

===European discovery===
The uninhabited islands are asserted to have been [[History of Portugal (1415–1578)#Chronology of the Portuguese discoveries|discovered]] by the Portuguese navigator, explorer, and diplomat [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] in 1512, first named as Dom Garcia, in honour of his patron, Dom [[Garcia de Noronha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmbd1945.blogspot.pt/2011_04_01_archive.html|title=PORTUGAL MARÍTIMO: Abril 2011|author=Josmael Bardour|work=jmbd1945.blogspot.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zianet.com/tedmorris/dg/dgtest.html|title=The Diego Garcia Test Question|work=zianet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was detached from the [[Portuguese India Armadas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zianet.com/tedmorris/dg/realhistory.html|title=History of Diego Garcia Atoll, Indian Ocean|work=zianet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; during his voyage of 1512–1513. Another Portuguese expedition with a Spanish explorer of Andalusian origin, [[Diego García de Moguer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edith Porchat|title=Informações históricas sobre São Paulo no século de sua fundação|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4FAezV2IKwUC&amp;pg=PA61|year=1956|publisher=Editora Iluminuras Ltda|isbn=978-85-85219-75-8|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; rediscovered the island in 1544 and named it after himself. Garcia de Moguer died the same year on the return trip to Portugal in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the South African coast. The misnomer &quot;Diego&quot; could have been made unwittingly by the British ever since, as they copied the Portuguese maps. It is assumed{{by whom|date=December 2017}} that the island was named after one of its first two discoverers—the one by the name of Garcia, the other with name Diego. Also, a [[cacography]] of the saying ''Deo Gracias'' (&quot;Thank God&quot;) is eligible for the attribution of the atoll. Although the [[Cantino planisphere]] (1504) and the [[Early world maps#Ruysch World Map (1507)|Ruysch map (1507)]] clearly delineate the Maldive Islands, giving them the same names, they do not show any islands to the south which can be identified as the Chagos archipelago.

[[File:Diego garcian.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Chagossians|Chagossian]] photographed by a [[US National Geodetic Survey]] team in 1969]]
The [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] map (Antwerp 1544) shows a number of islands to the south which may be the [[Mascarene Islands]]. The first map which identifies and names &quot;''Los Chagos''&quot; (in about the right position) is that of [[Pierre Desceliers]] ([[Dieppe maps#Existing Dieppe maps|Dieppe 1550]]), although Diego Garcia is not named. An  island called &quot;Don Garcia&quot; appears on the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' of [[Abraham Ortelius]] (Antwerp 1570), together with &quot;Dos Compagnos&quot;, slightly to the north. It may be the case that &quot;Don Garcia&quot; was named after Garcia de Noronha, although no evidence exists to support this.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The island is also labelled &quot;Don Garcia&quot; on [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]]'s ''[[Early world maps#Mercator world map (1569)|Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigatium Emendate]]'' (Duisburg 1569). However, on the ''Vera Totius Expeditionis Nauticae Description'' of Jodocus Hondius (London 1589), &quot;Don Garcia&quot; mysteriously changes its name to &quot;I. de Dio Gratia&quot;, while the &quot;I. de Chagues&quot; appears close by.

The first map to delineate the island under its present name, Diego Garcia, is the ''World Map'' of [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] (London 1599), possibly as a result of misreading Dio (or simply &quot;D.&quot;) as Diego, and Gratia as Garcia. The ''Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Geographica'' of [[Hendrik Hondius II]] (Antwerp 1630) repeats Wright's use of the name, which is then proliferated on all subsequent Dutch maps of the period, and to the present day.

===Settlement of the island===
Diego Garcia and the rest of the Chagos islands were uninhabited until the late 18th century. In 1778, the French Governor of [[Mauritius]] granted Monsieur Dupuit de la Faye the island of Diego Garcia, and evidence exists of temporary French visits to collect coconuts and fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis_29&quot;&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Frenchmen living in &quot;a dozen huts&quot; abandoned Diego Garcia when the British [[East India Company]] attempted to establish a settlement there in April 1786.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis_29&quot;/&gt; The supplies of the 275 settlers were overwhelmed by 250 survivors of the wreck of the British East Indian Ship  ''Atlas'' in May, and the colony failed in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis_32&quot;&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the departure of the British, the French colony of Mauritius began marooning [[lepers]]  on Diego Garcia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis_32&quot;/&gt; and in 1793, the French established a [[coconut]] plantation using [[Slavery|slave labour]], which also exported cordage made from coconut fibre, and [[sea cucumber]]s, known as a delicacy in the Orient.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diego Garcia became a colony of the UK after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]], and from 1814 to 1965, it was administered from [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis 2004, p. 80&quot;/&gt; On Diego Garcia, the main plantations were located at East Point, the main settlement on the eastern rim of the atoll; Minni Minni, {{convert|4.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of East Point, and Pointe Marianne, on the western rim, all located on the lagoon side of the atoll rim. The workers lived at these locations, and at villages scattered around the island.

From 1881 until 1888, Diego Garcia was the location of two coaling stations for [[steamships]] crossing the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_209_218&quot;&gt;D. R. Stoddart (1971): &quot;Settlement and development of Diego Garcia&quot;. In: [[#Stoddart|Stoddart &amp; Taylor (1971)]], pp. 209–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, the French-financed, Mauritian-based Société Huilière de Diego et de Peros (the &quot;Oilmaking Company of Diego and Peros&quot;), consolidated all the plantations in the Chagos under its control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_209_218&quot;/&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Barochois Maurice, Diego Garcia.jpg|thumb|[[Barachois]] Maurice, Diego Garcia]]
[[File:Consolidated PBY Catalina wreck on Diego Garcia 1982.jpg|thumb|Catalina wreck on the beach]]

In 1914, the island was visited by the German light cruiser [[SMS Emden|SMS ''Emden'']] halfway through its commerce-raiding cruise during the early months of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tPUMAAAAYAAJ |title=Helmuth von Mucke 'The Emden' |year=1916 |page= 130 |last1=Mücke |first1=Hellmuth von }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, the British opened RAF Station Diego Garcia and established an advanced flying boat unit at the East Point Plantation, staffed and equipped by No 205 and No 240 Squadrons, then stationed on Ceylon. Both [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Catalina]] and [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]]  aircraft were flown during the course of [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] in search of Japanese and German submarines and surface raiders. At Cannon Point,&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1211xF65ac|title=Cannon Point, Diego Garcia|last=subiepowa|date=28 April 2007|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; two 6-inch naval guns were installed by a [[Royal Marines]] detachment. In February 1942, the mission was to protect the small Royal Navy base and Royal Air Force station located on the island from Japanese attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;/&gt; They were later manned by Mauritian and Indian Coastal Artillery troops.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the conclusion of hostilities, the station was closed on 30 April 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the Chagos Agalega Company of the British colony of Seychelles purchased the Société Huilière de Diego et Peros and moved company headquarters to Seychelles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis_82&quot;&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, the UK was withdrawing its military presence from the Indian Ocean, not including the airfield at [[RAF Gan]] to the north of Diego Garcia in the [[Maldives]] (which remained open until 1976), and agreed to permit the United States to establish a naval communication station on one of its island territories there. The United States requested an unpopulated island belonging to the UK to avoid political difficulties with newly independent countries, and ultimately the UK and United States agreed that Diego Garcia was a suitable location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sand_3&quot;&gt;[[#Sand|Sand (2009)]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purchase by the United Kingdom===
[[File:Ted Morris on Diego Garcia.jpg|thumb|upright|An unpaved road in Diego Garcia in the eastern restricted zone, home to the former plantations]]

To accomplish the UK–US mutual defence strategy, in November 1965, the UK purchased the [[Chagos Archipelago]], which includes Diego Garcia, from the then self-governing colony of Mauritius for £3 million to create the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT), with the intent of ultimately closing the plantations to provide the uninhabited British territory from which the United States would conduct its military activities in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sand_3&quot;/&gt;

In April 1966, the British government bought the entire assets of the Chagos Agalega Company in the BIOT for £600,000 and administered them as a government enterprise while awaiting United States funding of the proposed facilities, with an interim objective of paying for the administrative expenses of the new territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis_82&quot;/&gt; However, the plantations, both under their previous private ownership and under government administration, proved consistently unprofitable due to the introduction of new oils and lubricants in the international marketplace, and the establishment of vast coconut plantations in the East Indies and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=Chagos Islanders v Attorney General and Her Majesty's British Indian Ocean Territory Commissioner |year=2003 |num=2222 |court=EWHC |division=QB |date=9 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 1966, the United States and the UK executed an agreement through an Exchange of Notes which permitted the United States to use the BIOT for defence purposes for 50 years until December 2016, followed by a 20-year extension (to 2036) as long as neither party gave notice of termination in a two-year window (December 2014 – December 2016) and the UK may decide on what additional terms to extend the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmfaff/377/37702.htm Report: The use of Diego Garcia by the United States]&quot;. US Parliament, September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; No monetary payment was made from the United States to the UK as part of this agreement or any subsequent amendment. Rather, the United Kingdom received a US$14-million discount from the United States on the acquisition of submarine-launched [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris missiles]] per a now-declassified addendum to the 1966 agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sand|Sand (2009)]], pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of the U.S. Navy===
To the United States, Diego Garcia was a prime territory for setting up a foreign military base. According to Stuart Barber—a civilian working for the US Navy at [[the Pentagon]]—Diego Garcia was located far away from any potential threats, it was low in a native population and it was an island that was not sought after by other countries as it lacked economic interest. To Barber, Diego Garcia and other acquired islands would play a key role in maintaining US dominance. Here Barber designed the strategic island concept, where the US would obtain as many less populated islands as possible for military purposes. According to Barber, this was the only way to ensure security for a foreign base. Diego Garcia is often referred to as &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; for its seclusion.

[[File:Seychelles Governor inspection 1972.jpg|thumb|right|200px|British colonial governor of Seychelles [[Bruce Greatbatch|Sir Bruce Greatbatch]] oversaw the [[depopulation of Chagossians from the Chagos Archipelago]].]]
The key component in obtaining Diego Garcia was the perceived lack of a native population on the island.  Uninhabited until the late 18th century, Diego Garcia had no indigenous population. Its only inhabitants were European overseers who managed the coconut plantations for their absentee landowners and contract workers mostly of African, Indian, and Malay ancestry, known as [[Chagossians]], who had lived and worked on the plantations for several generations. Prior to setting up a military base, the United States government was informed by the British government—which owned the island—that Diego Garcia had a population of hundreds. The eventual number of Chagossians numbered around 1,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Health_and_Mortality_papers&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.zianet.com/tedmorris/dg/chagosmortalityreport.pdf |publisher=[[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] |title=Health &amp; Mortality in the Chagos Islands |series=Research and Analytical Papers |author=African Research Group |year=2000 |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the size of the population, the Chagossians had to be removed from the island before the base could be constructed. In 1968, the first tactics were implemented to decrease the population of Diego Garcia. Those who left the island—either for vacation or medical purposes—were not allowed to return, and those who stayed could obtain only restricted food and medical supplies.

In March 1971, United States Naval construction battalions, ([[Seabee (United States Navy)|Seabees]]), arrived on Diego Garcia to begin the construction of the communications station and an airfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ted Morris |url=http://www.zianet.com/tedmorris/dg/71.html |title=Personal Accounts of Landing on Diego Garcia, 1971 |publisher=Zianet.com |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To satisfy the terms of an agreement between the UK and the United States for an uninhabited island, the plantation on Diego Garcia was closed in October of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sand_24&quot;&gt;[[#Sand|Sand (2009)]], p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The plantation workers and their families were relocated to the plantations on Peros Bahnos and Salomon atolls to the northwest.

Following the fall of the [[Shah of Iran]] and the [[Iran hostage crisis|Iran Hostage Crisis]] in 1979–1980, the West became concerned with ensuring the flow of oil from the [[Persian Gulf]] through the [[Strait of Hormuz]], and the United States received permission for a $400-million expansion of the military facilities on Diego Garcia consisting of two parallel {{convert|12000|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} runways, expansive parking aprons for heavy bombers, 20 new anchorages in the lagoon, a deep-water pier, port facilities for the largest naval vessels in the American or British fleet, aircraft hangars, maintenance buildings and an air terminal, a {{convert|1340000|oilbbl}} fuel storage area, and [[billet]]ing and messing facilities for thousands of sailors and support personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis_90&quot;/&gt;

===Chagos Marine Protected Area===
On 1 April 2010, the [[Chagos Marine Protected Area]] (MPA) was declared to cover the waters around the Chagos Archipelago. However, [[Mauritius]] objected, stating this was contrary to its legal rights, and on 18 March 2015, the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] ruled that the Chagos Marine Protected Area was illegal under the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] as Mauritius had legally binding rights to fish in the waters surrounding the Chagos Archipelago, to an eventual return of the Chagos Archipelago, and to the preservation of any minerals or oil discovered in or near the Chagos Archipelago prior to its return.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-20150319&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/19/un-ruling-raises-hope-of-return-for-exiled-chagos-islanders |title=UN ruling raises hope of return for exiled Chagos islanders |author1=Owen Bowcott |author2=Sam Jones |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 March 2015 |accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cga-pressrelease&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pca-cpa.org/showfile.asp?fil_id=2901 |title=Chagos Marine Protected Area Arbitration (Mauritius v.

==Inhabitants==
Diego Garcia had no permanent inhabitants when discovered by the Spanish explorer [[Diego García de Moguer]] in the 16th century, then in the service of Portugal, and this remained the case until it was settled as a French colony in 1793.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_209_218&quot;/&gt;

===French settlement===
{{main|Chagossians}}

Most inhabitants of Diego Garcia through the period 1793–1971 were plantation workers, but also included Franco-Mauritian managers, Indo-Mauritian administrators, Mauritian and Seychellois contract employees, and in the late 19th century, Chinese and Somali employees.

A distinct Creole culture called the [[Ilois]], which means &quot;islanders&quot; in [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]], evolved from these workers. The Ilois, now called Chagos Islanders or [[Chagossians]] since the late-1990s, were descended primarily from [[slaves]] brought to the island from [[Madagascar]] by the French between 1793 and 1810, and [[Malay race|Malay]] slaves from the slave market on [[Nias Island|Pulo Nyas]], an island off the northwest coast of [[Sumatra]], from around 1820 until the slave trade ended following the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of 1833]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reefnewmedia.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reefnewmedia.co.uk/cmt_chagos/uploads/PDF/Newsletters/ChagosNews14.pdf |title=Slavery in the Chagos Archipelago |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119043547/http://www.reefnewmedia.co.uk/cmt_chagos/uploads/PDF/Newsletters/ChagosNews14.pdf |archivedate=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ilois also evolved a French-based [[Mauritian Creole|Creole dialect]] now called [[Chagossian Creole]].

Throughout their recorded history, the plantations of the Chagos Archipelago had a population of approximately 1,000 individuals, about two-thirds of whom lived on Diego Garcia. A peak population of 1,142 on all islands was recorded in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Health_and_Mortality_papers&quot;/&gt;

The primary industry throughout the island's colonial period consisted of [[coconut]] [[plantations]] producing [[copra]] and/or [[coconut oil]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_209_218&quot;/&gt; until closure of the plantations and relocation of the inhabitants in October 1971. For a brief period in the 1880s, it served as a [[coaling station]] for steamships transiting the Indian Ocean from the [[Suez Canal]] to [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], pp. 49–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expulsion of 1971===
{{main|Depopulation of Diego Garcia| Chagossians}}

All the inhabitants of Diego Garcia were forcibly resettled to other islands in the Chagos Archipelago, Mauritius or Seychelles by 1971 to satisfy the requirements of a UK/United States Exchange of Notes signed in 1966 to depopulate the island when the United States constructed a base upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j1970/chagos.htm |title=England and Wales High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division Appendix, Paragraph 396 |publisher=Hmcourts-service.gov.uk |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604072841/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j1970/chagos.htm |archivedate=4 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No current agreement exists on how many of the evacuees met the criteria to be an Ilois, and thus be an indigenous person at the time of their removal, but the UK and Mauritian governments agreed in 1972 that 426 families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j1970/chagos.htm |title=England and Wales High Court of Justice, Queens Bench Division Appendix, Paragraph 417 |publisher=Hmcourts-service.gov.uk |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604072841/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j1970/chagos.htm |archivedate=4 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; numbering 1,151 individuals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sand_25&quot;/&gt; were due compensation payments as exiled Ilois.

Fifteen years after the last expulsion, the Chagossians received a small amount of compensation from the British, totalling $6,000 per person; some Chagossians received nothing. The British expulsion action remains in litigation {{As of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eeas.europa.eu/british_indian_ocean_territory/index_en.htm |title=European Union – EEAS (European External Action Service) |work=europa.eu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225061830/http://eeas.europa.eu/british_indian_ocean_territory/index_en.htm |archivedate=25 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/27/chagos-islands-maldives-seabed-claim?intcmp=239 |title=Chagos Islands exiles amazed by speed of Foreign Office's opposition to seabed claim by Maldives |author=Owen Bowcott |date=27 September 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Chagossians remain highly impoverished and are living as &quot;marginalized&quot; outsiders on the island of Mauritius and the Seychelles.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===After 1971===
Between 1971 and 2001, the only residents on Diego Garcia were UK and United States military personnel and civilian employees of those countries.

==Politics==
[[File:CIA-DG-BIOT.jpg|thumb|A detailed map of Diego Garcia]]

Diego Garcia is the only inhabited island in the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]], an [[overseas territory of the United Kingdom]], usually abbreviated as &quot;BIOT&quot;. The [[Government of the British Indian Ocean Territory|Government of the BIOT]] consists of a [[Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory|commissioner]] appointed by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]]. The commissioner is assisted by an administrator and small staff, and is based in London and is resident in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].

Originally colonised by the French, Diego Garcia was ceded, along with the rest of the Chagos Archipelago, to the United Kingdom in the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] at the conclusion of a portion of the Napoleonic Wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_209_218&quot;/&gt; Diego Garcia and the Chagos Archipelago were administered by the colonial government on the island of [[Mauritius]] until 1965, when the UK purchased them from the self-governing colony of Mauritius for £3 million, and declared them to be a separate [[British Overseas Territory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis_84&quot;&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The BIOT administration was moved to [[Seychelles]] following the independence of Mauritius in 1968 until the independence of Seychelles in 1976,&lt;ref name=&quot;Edis 2004, p. 80&quot;&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and to a desk in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] in [[London]] since.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military administration===
UK represents the territory internationally. A local government as normally envisioned does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/io.html CIA World Factbook], accessed 23 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the administration is represented in the territory by the officer commanding British Forces on Diego Garcia, the &quot;Brit rep&quot;. Laws and regulations are promulgated by the commissioner and enforced in the BIOT by Brit rep.

Of major concern to the BIOT administration is the relationship with the United States military forces resident on Diego Garcia. An annual meeting called &quot;The Pol-Mil Talks&quot; (for &quot;political-military&quot;) of all concerned is held at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London to resolve pertinent issues. These resolutions are formalised by an &quot;Exchange of Notes&quot;, or, since 2001, an &quot;Exchange of Letters&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sand_24&quot;/&gt;

Neither the US nor the UK recognises Diego Garcia as being subject to the [[African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty]], which lists BIOT as covered by the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones at a Glance |publisher=Arms Control Association |url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/nwfz.asp |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809134008/http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/nwfz.asp |archivedate=9 August 2006 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1093/jel/eqn034&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Diego Garcia: British–American Legal Black Hole in the Indian Ocean? |first=Peter H. |last=Sand |date=29 January 2009 |periodical=Journal of Environmental Law |publisher=Oxford Journals |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=113–137 |doi=10.1093/jel/eqn034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/RATPAKPELINDABATREATYOCT08.PDF |title=Info |publisher=issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com |date= |accessdate=2019-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not publicly known whether [[nuclear weapon]]s have ever been stored on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=20–21 |url=http://www.unidir.org/files/publications/pdfs/nuclear-weapon-free-zones-en-314.pdf |title=The Treaty of Pelindaba: towards the full implementation of the African NWFZ Treaty |author=Noel Stott |journal=Disarmament Forum |year=2011 |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] and Peter Sand claim the US and UK stance is blocking the full implementation of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/5/17/denied_entry_israel_blocks_noam_chomsky|title=Denied Entry: Israel Blocks Noam Chomsky from Entering West Bank to Deliver Speech|publisher=democracynow.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.asil.org/insights/volume/13/issue/12/african-nuclear-weapon-free-zone-force-what-next-diego-garcia | title=African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Force: What Next for Diego Garcia? &amp;#124; ASIL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transnational political issues===
There are two transnational political issues which affect Diego Garcia and the BIOT, through the British government.

* First, the island nation of Mauritius claims the Chagos Archipelago (which is coterminous with the BIOT), including Diego Garcia. A subsidiary issue is the Mauritian opposition to the UK Government's declaration of 1 April 2010 that the BIOT is a marine protected area with fishing and extractive industry (including oil and gas exploration) prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/05/14/mauritius-to-reiterate-its-conditions-for-renewed-talks-with-uk-on-chagos/ Mauritius to reiterate its conditions for renewed talks with UK on Chagos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223113708/http://www.afriqueavenir.org/en/2010/05/14/mauritius-to-reiterate-its-conditions-for-renewed-talks-with-uk-on-chagos/ |date=23 December 2011 }} at afriqueavenir.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, the issue of compensation and repatriation of the former inhabitants, [[Depopulation of Diego Garcia|exiled since 1973]], continues in litigation and as of August 2010 had been submitted to the European Court of Human Rights by a group of former residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7052088.ece |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=23 August 2010 |title=Chagossians fight for a home in paradise |date=6 March 2010 |author=Catherine Philp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{Who|date=June 2012}} groups allege that Diego Garcia and its territorial waters out to {{convert|3|nmi|km|0}} have been restricted from public access without permission of the BIOT Government since 1971.

===Prison site allegations===
In 2015, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]]'s former chief of staff, [[Lawrence Wilkerson]], said Diego Garcia was used by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] for &quot;nefarious activities&quot;. He said that he had heard from three US intelligence sources that Diego Garcia was used as &quot;a transit site where people were temporarily housed, let us say, and interrogated from time to time&quot; and, &quot;What I heard was more along the lines of using it as a transit location when perhaps other places were full or other places were deemed too dangerous or insecure, or unavailable at the moment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-20150130&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/cia-interrogation-diego-garcia-lawrence-wilkerson |title=CIA interrogated suspects on Diego Garcia, says Colin Powell aide |author=Ian Cobain |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 January 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph-20150130&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11380992/Terror-suspects-were-interrogated-on-Diego-Garcia-US-official-admits.html |title=Terror suspects were interrogated on Diego Garcia, US official admits |agency=Press Association |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=30 January 2015 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] stated that United States authorities had repeatedly assured him that no detainees had passed in transit through Diego Garcia or were disembarked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Written Answers to Questions 21 June 2004 | journal=Hansard House of Commons Daily Debates| volume= 422 | issue=part 605 | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040621/text/40621w13.htm#40621w13.html_wqn9 | accessdate=21 February 2008 | format= – &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AWritten+Answers+to+Questions+%5B%5B21+June%5D%5D+%5B%5B2004%5D%5D&amp;as_publication=Hansard+House+of+Commons+Daily+Debates&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manfred Nowak]], one of five of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on [[torture]], said that credible evidence exists supporting allegations that ships serving as black sites have used Diego Garcia as a base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/19/alqaida.usa |title=Claims of secret CIA jail for terror suspects on British island to be investigated |first1=Ian |last1=Cobain |author2=Richard Norton-Taylor |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human rights group [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] alleged that United States-operated ships moored outside the [[territorial waters]] of Diego Garcia were used to incarcerate and torture detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Jamie Doward | title=British island 'used by US for rendition' | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/02/ciarendition.unitednations | work=The Observer | date=2 March 2008 | accessdate=27 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2014, the [[United States Senate Intelligence Committee]] published a 600-page unclassified summary of its 6,700-page secret report on the CIA's abuse of its secret prisoners.&lt;ref name=&quot;DailyMail2014-12-20&quot;/&gt;
David Jones, writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', expressed surprise that Diego Garcia went entirely unmentioned on every page of the unclassified summary, and speculated that pressure from UK security agencies caused the portions of the report that covered CIA prisoner facilities on the island to remain classified.

===Rendition flight refuelling admission===

According to Wikileaks CableGate documents (reference ID &quot;[https://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/05/09LONDON1156.html 09LONDON1156]&quot;), in a calculated move planned in 2009, the UK proposed that the BIOT become a &quot;marine reserve&quot; with the aim of preventing the former inhabitants from returning to the islands. A summary of the diplomatic cable is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/12/british-government-mauritius |title=WikiLeaks, a forgotten people, and the record-breaking marine reserve, Posted by Sean Carey – 8 December 2010 |publisher=Newstatesman.com |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[[Her Majesty's Government|HMG]] would like to establish a &quot;marine park&quot; or &quot;reserve&quot; providing comprehensive environmental protection to the reefs and waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) official informed Polcouns on 12 May. The official insisted that the establishment of a marine park—the world's largest—would in no way impinge on USG use of the BIOT, including Diego Garcia, for military purposes. He agreed that the UK and United States should carefully negotiate the details of the marine reserve to assure that United States interests were safeguarded and the strategic value of BIOT was upheld. He said that the BIOT's former inhabitants would find it difficult, if not impossible, to pursue their claim for resettlement on the islands if the entire Chagos Archipelago were a marine reserve.}} Additionally, Diego Garcia was used as a storage section for US cluster bombs as a way of avoiding UK parliamentary oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09STATE52368.html |title=Cable Viewer |publisher=Wikileaks.ch |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318190254/http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2009/05/09STATE52368.html |archivedate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural history==
No species of plants, birds, amphibians, reptiles, molluscs, crustaceans, or mammals is [[Endemism|endemic]] on Diego Garcia or in the surrounding waters. Several endemic fish and aquatic invertebrates are present, though. All plants, wildlife, and aquatic species are protected to one degree or another. In addition, much of the lagoon waters are protected wetlands as a designated [[Ramsar site]], and large parts of the island are nature preserves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sheppard Spalding|Sheppard &amp; Spalding (2003)]], chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the UK applied for, and received, Ramsar site wetlands conservation status for the lagoon and other waters of Diego Garcia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukotcf.org/pdf/Ramsar/61BIOT.pdf |title=Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands: Chagos Banks |publisher=United Kingdom Overseas Territories Conservation Forum |date=13 November 2004 |accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geography===
[[File:Biot-travel-svg-map.svg|thumb|A location map of Diego Garcia]]
Diego Garcia is the largest land mass in the Chagos Archipelago (which includes [[Peros Banhos]], the [[Salomon Islands]], the [[Three Brothers (islands), Chagos|Three Brothers]], the [[Egmont Islands]], and the [[Great Chagos Bank]]), being an atoll occupying approximately {{convert|174|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2}}, of which {{convert|27.19|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2}} is dry land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 2.4.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous portion of the atoll rim stretches {{convert|64|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} from one end to the other, enclosing a lagoon {{convert|21|km|0|abbr=on}} long and up to {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, with a {{convert|6|km|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} pass opening at the north. Three small islands are located in the pass.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The island consists of the largest continuous dryland rim of all atolls in the world. The dryland rim varies in width from a few hundred metres to 2.4&amp;nbsp;km. Typical of coral atolls, it has a maximum elevation on some dunes on the ocean side of the rim of 9&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft) above mean low water. The rim nearly encloses a lagoon about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and up to {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. The atoll forms a nearly complete rim of land around a lagoon, enclosing 90% of its [[perimeter]], with an opening only in the north. The main island is the largest of about 60 islands which form the Chagos Archipelago. Besides the main island, three small islets are at the mouth of the lagoon: West Island ({{convert|3.4|ha|acre|abbr=on}}), Middle Island ({{convert|6|ha|acre|abbr=on}}) and East Island ({{convert|11.75|ha|acre|abbr=on}}). A fourth, Anniversary Island, 1&amp;nbsp;km (1,100 [[yards]]) southwest of Middle Island, appears as just a sand bar on satellite images. Both Middle Island and Anniversary Island are part of the Spur Reef complex.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 2.5.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The total area of the atoll is about {{convert|170|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. The lagoon area is roughly {{convert|120|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} with depths ranging down to about {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The total land area (excluding peripheral reefs) is around {{convert|30|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. The coral reef surrounding the seaward side of the atoll is generally broad, flat, and shallow around {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} below mean sea level in most locations and varying from {{convert|100|to|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in width. This fringing seaward reef shelf comprises an area around {{convert|35.2|km2|sqmi|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. At the outer edge of the reef shelf, the bottom slopes very steeply into deep water, at some locations dropping to more than {{convert|450|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} within {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the shore.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In the lagoon, numerous coral heads present hazards to navigation. The shallow reef shelf surrounding the island on the ocean side offers no ocean-side anchorage. The channel and anchorage areas in the northern half of the lagoon are [[dredge]]d, along with the pre-1971 ship [[turning basin]]. Significant saltwater wetlands called [[barachois]] exist in the southern half of the lagoon. These small lagoons off of the main lagoon are filled with [[seawater]] at high tide and dry at low tide. Scientific expeditions in 1996 and 2006 described the lagoon and surrounding waters of Diego Garcia, along with the rest of the Chagos Archipelago, as &quot;exceptionally unpolluted&quot; and &quot;pristine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chagos-trust.org/science.asp |title=Science of the Chagos – Chagos Conservation Trust |accessdate=16 June 2009 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616185943/http://www.chagos-trust.org/science.asp |archivedate=16 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diego Garcia is frequently subject to earthquakes caused by [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] movement along the [[Carlsberg Ridge]] located just to the west of the island. One was recorded in 1812; one measuring 7.6 on the Richter Scale hit on 30 November 1983, at 23:46 local time and lasted 72 seconds, resulting in minor damage including wave damage to a 50-m stretch of the southern end of the island, and another on 2 December 2002, an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale struck the island at 12:21&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=&quot;realhistory&quot; /&gt;

In December 2004, [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|a tsunami generated near Indonesia]] caused minor shoreline erosion on Barton Point (the northeast point of the atoll of Diego Garcia).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reefnewmedia.co.uk/cmt_chagos/uploads/PDF/Newsletters/ChagosNews25.pdf Chagos News, No. 25, p. 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119025950/http://www.reefnewmedia.co.uk/cmt_chagos/uploads/PDF/Newsletters/ChagosNews25.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceanography===
Diego Garcia lies within the influence of the South Equatorial current year-round. The surface currents of the Indian Ocean also have a monsoonal regimen associated with the Asian Monsoonal wind regimen. Sea surface temperatures are in the range of {{convert|80|–|84|F|C}} year-round.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAVCENT2002&quot;&gt;[[#NAVCENT|Local Area Forecaster's Handbook (2002)]], p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fresh water supply===
Diego Garcia is the above-water rim of a coral atoll composed of [[Holocene]] coral rubble and sand to the depth of about {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=on}}, overlaying [[Pleistocene]] limestone deposited at the then-sea level on top of a [[seamount]] rising about {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the floor of the Indian Ocean. The Holocene sediments are porous and completely saturated with sea water. Any rain falling on the above-water rim quickly percolates through the surface sand and encounters the salt water underneath. Diego Garcia is of sufficient width to minimise tidal fluctuations in the [[aquifer]], and the rainfall (in excess of 102.5&amp;nbsp;inches/260&amp;nbsp;cm per year on average)&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 2.5.2.&lt;/ref&gt; is sufficient in amount and periodicity for the fresh water to form a series of convex, freshwater, [[Ghyben-Herzberg lenses]] floating on the heavier salt water in the saturated sediments.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/library/misc/ucghyben.htm|title=Salt Water vs. Fresh Water – Ghyben-Herzberg Lens |publisher=Geography.about.com |date=9 April 2012 |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Urish&quot;&gt;[[#Urish|Urish (1974)]], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The horizontal structure of each lens is influenced by variations in the type and porosity of the subsurface deposits, which on Diego Garcia are minor. At depth, the lens is globular; near the surface, it generally conforms to the shape of the island.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Urish|Urish (1974)]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; When a Ghyben-Herzberg lens is fully formed, its floating nature will push a [[Hydraulic head|freshwater head]] above [[mean sea level]], and if the island is wide enough, the depth of the lens below mean sea level will be 40 times the height of the water table above sea level. On Diego Garcia, this equates to a maximum depth of 20 m. However, the actual size and depth of each lens is dependent on the width and shape of the island at that point, the permeability of the aquifer, and the equilibrium between recharging rainfall and losses to evaporation to the atmosphere, transpiration by plants, tidal advection, and human use.

In the plantation period, shallow wells, supplemented by rainwater collected in cisterns, provided sufficient water for the pastoral lifestyle of the small population. On Diego Garcia today, the military base uses over 100 shallow &quot;horizontal&quot; wells to produce over 560,000 l per day from the &quot;Cantonment&quot; lens on the northwest arm of the island—sufficient water for western-style usage for a population of 3,500. This 3.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; lens holds an estimated 19 million m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of fresh water and has an average daily recharge from rainfall over 10,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, of which 40% remains in the lens and 60% is lost through evapotranspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Charles D. Hunt &quot;Hydrogeology of Diego Garcia&quot;. In: [[#Vacher|Vacher &amp; Quinn (1997)]], pp. 909–929. {{doi|10.1016/S0070-4571(04)80054-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extracting fresh water from a lens for human consumption requires careful calculation of the sustainable yield of the lens by season because each lens is susceptible to corruption by saltwater intrusion caused by overuse or drought. In addition, overwash by tsunamis and tropical storms has corrupted lenses in the Maldives and several Pacific islands. Vertical wells can cause salt upcoming into the lens, and overextraction will reduce freshwater pressure resulting in lateral intrusion by seawater. Because the porosity of the surface soil results in virtually zero runoff, lenses are easily polluted by fecal waste, burials, and chemical spills. Corruption of a lens can take years to &quot;flush out&quot; and reform, depending on the ratio of recharge to losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot; /&gt;

A few natural depressions on the atoll rim capture the abundant rainfall to form areas of freshwater wetlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_127_142&quot;&gt;D. R. Stoddart (1971): &quot;Land vegetation of Diego Garcia&quot;. In: [[#Stoddart|Stoddart &amp; Taylor (1971)]], pp. 127–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Two are of significance to island wildlife and to recharge their respective freshwater lenses. One of these is centred on the northwest point of the atoll; another is found near the Point Marianne Cemetery on the southeast end of the airfield. Other, smaller freshwater wetlands are found along the east side of the runway, and in the vicinity of the receiver antenna field on the northwest arm of the atoll.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 3.3.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, several man-made freshwater ponds resulted from excavations made during construction of the airfield and road on the western half of the atoll rim. These fill from rainfall and from extending into the Ghyben-Herzberg lenses found on this island.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen W. Surface and Edward F.C. Lau, &quot;Fresh Water Supply System Developed on Diego Garcia&quot;, The Naval Civil Engineer, Winter 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Island couple.jpg|thumb|right|Eclipse Point]]

All [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls as [[rainfall|rain]], characterised by air mass-type showers. Annual rainfall averages {{convert|2603.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with the heaviest precipitation from September to April. January is the wettest month with {{convert|353|mm|in|abbr=on}} of mean monthly precipitation, and August the driest month, averaging {{convert|106.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} of mean monthly precipitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAVCENT_2002&quot;/&gt;

The surrounding sea surface temperature is the primary climatic control, and temperatures are generally uniform throughout the year, with an average maximum of {{convert|30|C|F}} by day during March and April, and {{convert|29|C|F}} from July to September. Diurnal variation is roughly {{convert|3|-|4|C-change|F-change}}, falling to the low {{convert|27|°C|°F|abbr=on}} by night.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAVCENT_2002&quot;/&gt; Humidity is high throughout the year. The almost constant breeze keeps conditions reasonably comfortable.

From December through March, winds are generally westerly around {{convert|6|kn|km/h}}. During April and May, winds are light and variable, ultimately backing to an east-southeasterly direction. From June through September, the influence of the Southeast trades is felt, with speeds of 10–15 knots. During October and November, winds again go through a period of light and variable conditions veering to a westerly direction with the onset of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAVCENT_2002&quot;/&gt;

[[Thunderstorm]] activity is generally noticed during the afternoon and evenings during the summer months (December through March) and when the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] is in the vicinity of the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAVCENT_2002&quot;&gt;[[#NAVCENT|Local Area Forecaster's Handbook (2002)]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diego Garcia is at minimum risk from [[tropical cyclone]]s due to its proximity to the [[equator]] where the [[Coriolis effect|coriolis parameter]] required to organise circulation of the [[upper atmosphere]] is minimal. Low-intensity storms have hit the island, including one in 1901, which blew over 1,500 coconut trees;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edis|Edis (2004)]], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; one on 16 September 1944,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ted Morris |url=http://www.zianet.com/tedmorris/dg/pby.html |title=Diego Garcia – The PBY Catalina |publisher=Zianet.com |date=19 September 2002 |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused the wreck of a Royal Air Force PBY Catalina; one in September 1990 which demolished the tent city then being constructed for United States Air Force bomber crews during Operation Desert Storm;&lt;ref name=&quot;realhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zianet.com/tedmorris/dg/realhistory.html |title=Important Dates of the Provisional People's Democratic Republic of Diego Garcia |accessdate=27 September 2011 |date=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one on 22 July 2007, when winds exceeded {{convert|60|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and over {{convert|250|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell in 24 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;realhistory&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Degar sunset from cannon point.jpg|thumb|left|Sunset at Cannon Point]]
The island was somewhat affected by the [[tsunami]] caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. Service personnel on the western arm of the island reported only a minor increase in wave activity. The island was protected to a large degree by its favourable [[ocean topography]]. About {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the atoll lies the 650-km-long (400-mile) Chagos Trench, an underwater canyon plunging more than {{convert|4900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The depth of the trench and its grade to the atoll's slope and shelf shore makes it more difficult for substantial tsunami waves to build before passing the atoll from the east. In addition, near-shore [[coral reef]]s and an algal platform may have dissipated much of the waves' impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=26265 &quot;Diego Garcia Navy base reports no damage from quake, tsunamis&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024535/http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=26265 |date=27 September 2011 }}.

===Vegetation===
[[File:Diego Garcia Mixed Species Marsh.png|thumb|right|A mixed-species freshwater wetland on Diego Garcia]]

The first [[botanical]] observations of the island were made by Hume in 1883, when the coconut plantations had been in operation for a full century. Subsequent studies and collections during the plantation era were made in 1885, 1905, 1939, and 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix E1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, very little of the nature of the precontact vegetation is known.

The 1967 survey, published by the [[Smithsonian]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stoddart|Stoddart &amp; Taylor (1971)]]{{page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used as the most authoritative baseline for more recent research. These studies indicate the vegetation of the island may be changing rapidly. For example, J. M. W. Topp collected data annually between 1993 and 2003 and found that on the average three new plant species arrived each year, mainly on Diego Garcia. His research added fully a third more species to Stoddart.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Topp|Topp (1988)]], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Topp and Martin Hamilton of [[Kew Gardens]] compiled the most recent checklist of vegetation in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hamilton|Hamilton &amp; Topp (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Stoddart described the land area of Diego Garcia as having a [[littoral zone|littoral]] [[hedge]] of ''[[Scaevola taccada]]'', while inland, ''[[Coconut|Cocos nucifera]]'' (coconut) was the most dominant tree, covering most of the island. The substory was either managed and park-like, with understory less than 0.5 m in height, or consisted of what he called &quot;Cocos Bon-Dieu&quot;&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;an intermediate story of juvenile trees and a luxuriant ground layer of self-sown seedlings&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;causing those areas to be relatively impenetrable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_143_160&quot;&gt;F. R. Fosberg &amp; A. A. Bullock (1971): &quot;List of Diego Garcia vascular plants&quot;. In: [[#Stoddart|Stoddart &amp; Taylor (1971)]], pp. 143–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, areas of remnant tropical hardwood forest are at the sites of the plantation-era villages, as well as ''[[Casuarina equisetifolia]]'' (iron wood pines) woodlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_127_142&quot;/&gt;

In 1997, the United States Navy contracted a vegetation survey that identified about 280 species of terrestrial [[vascular plant]]s on Diego Garcia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sheppard Seaward|Sheppard &amp; Seaward (1999)]], p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; None of these was [[Endemism|endemic]], and another survey in 2005 identified just 36 species as &quot;native&quot;, meaning arriving without the assistance of humans, and found elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix E2, paragraph E2-2.&lt;/ref&gt; No [[terrestrial plant]] species are of any conservation-related concern at present.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sheppard Spalding|Sheppard &amp; Spalding (2003)]], p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Diego Garcia Hernandia Forest.png|thumb|A ''Hernandia''-dominated forest on Diego Garcia]]

Of the 36 native vascular plants on Diego Garcia, 12 are trees, five are [[shrub]]s, seven are [[dicotyledon]] herbs, three are grasses, four are [[vine]]s, and five are [[fern]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix E1, p. 4-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12 tree species are: ''[[Barringtonia asiatica]]'' (fish-poison tree), ''[[Calophyllum inophyllum]]'' (Alexandrian laurel), ''[[Cocos nucifera]]'', ''[[Cordia subcordata]]'', ''[[Guettarda speciosa]]'', ''[[Intsia bijuga]]'', ''[[Hernandiaceae|Hernandia sonora]]'', ''[[Morinda citrifolia]]'', ''[[Neisosperma|Neisosperma oppositifolium]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/~sbmljw/cgi-bin/taxon.pl?412139 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903221255/http://www.ars-grin.gov/~sbmljw/cgi-bin/taxon.pl?412139 |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 September 2015 |title=''Neisosperma oppositifolium'' (Lam.) Fosberg &amp; Sachet |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |work=[[Germplasm Resources Information Network]] |accessdate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pisonia grandis]]'', ''[[Terminalia catappa]]'', and ''[[Heliotropium foertherianum]]''. Another three tree species are common, and may be native, but they may also have been introduced by humans: ''Casuarina equisetifolia'', ''[[Hibiscus tiliaceus]]'', and ''[[Pipturus|Pipturus argenteus]]''.

The five native shrubs are: ''[[Caesalpinia bonduc]]'', ''[[Pemphis|Pemphis acidula]]'', ''[[Premna|Premna serratifolia]]'', ''Scaevola taccada'' (often mispronounced &quot;Scaveola&quot;), and ''[[Suriana|Suriana maritima]]''.

[[File:Premna Shrubland.png|thumb|right|A ''Premna''-dominated scrub land on Diego Garcia]]
Also, 134 species of plants are classified as &quot;weedy&quot; or &quot;naturalised alien species&quot;, being those unintentionally introduced by man, or intentionally introduced as ornamentals or crop plants which have now &quot;gone native&quot;, including 32 new species recorded since 1995, indicating a very rapid rate of introduction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix E1, p. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The remainder of the species list consists of cultivated food or ornamental species, grown in restricted environments such as a planter's pot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix E1, p. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, 10 [[plant community|plant communities]] were recognized on the atoll rim:&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
* ''Calophyllum'' forest, dominated by ''Calophyllum inophyllum'', with trunks that can grow in excess of 2 m in diameter: This forest often contains other species such as ''Hernandia sonora'', ''Cocos nucifera'', and ''Guettarda speciosa'' with a ''Premna obtusifolia'' edge. When found on the beaches, ''Calophyllum'' often extends over the lagoon water and supports nesting red-footed boobies, as does ''Barringtonia asiatica'' found mostly on the eastern arm of the atoll.
* ''Cocos'' forest, essentially monotypic (''Cocos bon Dieu''), with the understory consisting of coconut seedlings
* ''Cocos-Hernandia'' forest, dominated by two canopy species—''C. nucifera'' and ''H. sonora''
* ''Cocos-Guettarda'' forest, dominated by the canopy species ''C. nucifera'' and ''G. speciosa'': The understory consists of a mix of ''Neisosperma oppositifolium'', with ''Scaevola taccada'' and ''Tournefortia argentea'' on the beach edge.
* ''Hernandia'' forest, dominated at the canopy level by ''H. sonora'': The most representative areas of this forest type are on the eastern, undeveloped part of the atoll. ''Calophyllum inophyllum'' and ''C. nucifera'' are often present. Understory species in this forest are often ''Morinda citrifolia'', ''Cocos'' seedlings, and ''[[Asplenium nidus]]'' (bird's nest fern), and occasionally, ''N. oppositifolium'' and ''G. speciosa''.
* ''Premna'' shrubland, occurring generally between marshy areas and forested areas: The most conspicuous vegetation is primarily ''P. obtusifolia'', with ''Casuarina equisetifolia'' and ''Scaevola taccada'' on the margins. The dense groundcover consists of species such as ''[[Fimbristylis|Fimbristylis cymosa]]'', ''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae]]'' (beach morning glory) and ''[[Triumfetta|Triumfetta procumbens]]''. ''Premna'' shrubland appears mostly adjacent to the developed areas of the atoll, particularly in the well fields.
* Littoral scrub lines almost the entire seashore and lagoon shore of the island. It is dominated by ''S. taccada'', but it also contains scattered coconut trees, ''G. speciosa'' and ''Pisonia grandis''. On the seaward side, it also contains ''Tournefortia argentea'' and ''Suriana maritima''. On the lagoon side, it may also contain ''[[Lepturus|Lepturus repens]]'', ''[[Triumfetta|Triumfetta procumbens]]'' and ''[[Cyperus|Cyperus ligularis]]''. Large pockets of ''Barringtonia asiatica'' are also on the eastern edge of the lagoon.
* Maintained areas of grasses and sedges routinely mowed: Aerial photographs of the island clearly display large areas of grasslands and park-like [[savanna]] upon which the United States military has constructed large outdoor facilities such as antenna fields and the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=President for Life |url=http://www.zianet.com/tedmorris/dg/aerial2.html |title=Aerial Photographs of Diego Garcia |publisher=Zianet.com |accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mixed native forest, with no dominant canopy species
* Marshes are divided into three different types: cattail (''[[Typha domingensis]]''), wetland, and mixed species. Cattail marshes contained almost entirely cattails. These areas are often man-made reservoirs or drainages that have been almost entirely monotypic. Wetlands were based upon vegetation that occurred in the area with fresh water. Mixed-species marshes were highly variable and usually had no standing water.

===Wildlife===
[[File:Coconut Crab.jpg|thumb|[[Coconut crab]]s are protected on Diego Garcia.]]
All the terrestrial and aquatic fauna of Diego Garcia are protected, with the exception of certain game fish, rats, and cats; hefty fines are levied against violators.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crustaceans====
The island is a haven for several types of [[crustacean]]; &quot;warrior crabs&quot; (''[[Cardisoma carnifex]]'') overrun the jungle at night. The extremely large {{convert|4|kg|lb|adj=on}} [[coconut crab]] or robber crab (''Birgus latro'') is found here in large numbers. Because of the protections provided the species on this atoll, and the isolation of the east rim of the atoll, the species is recorded in greater densities there than anywhere else in its range (339 crabs/ha).&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix G, p. G-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mammals====
No [[mammal]] species are native on Diego Garcia, with no record of [[bat]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoddart_163_170&quot;&gt;D. R. Stoddart (1971): &quot;Terrestrial fauna of Diego Garcia and other Chagos atolls&quot;. In: [[#Stoddart|Stoddart &amp; Taylor (1971)]], pp. 163–170.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than rats (''[[Rattus rattus]]''), all &quot;wild&quot; mammal species are feral descendants of domesticated species. During the plantation era, Diego Garcia was home to large herds of Sicilian donkeys (''[[Equus asinus]]''), dozens of horses (''[[Equus caballus]]''), hundreds of dogs (''[[Canis familiaris]]''), and house cats (''[[Felis catus]]''). In 1971, the BIOT Commissioner ordered the extermination of feral dogs following the departure of the last plantation workers, and the program continued through 1975, when the last feral dog was observed and shot.&lt;ref&gt;Bruner, Phillip, Avifaunal and Feral Mammal Survey of Diego Garcia, Chagos Archipelago, British Indian Ocean Territory, 17 October 1995, p. 3-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Donkeys, which numbered over 400 in 1972, were down to just 20 individuals in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRMP_G_4_27&quot;&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix G, p. 4.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The last horse was observed in 1995,&lt;ref name=&quot;NRMP_G_4_27&quot;/&gt; and by 2005, just two cats were thought to have survived an island-wide eradication program.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

====Native birds====
[[File:Red-tailed Tropicbird3.jpg|thumb|left|Several pairs of [[red-tailed tropicbird]] nest near the cantonment area.]]

The total bird list for the Chagos Archipelago, including Diego Garcia, consists of 91 species, with large breeding populations of 16 species. Although no birds are endemic, internationally important seabird colonies exist. Diego Garcia's seabird community includes thriving populations of species which are rapidly declining in other parts of the Indian Ocean. Large nesting colonies of brown noddies (''[[brown noddy|Anous stolidous]]''), bridled terns (''[[Sterna anaethetus]]''), the lesser noddy (''[[Anous tenuirostris]]''), red-footed booby (''[[Sula sula]]'') and lesser frigate birds (''[[Fregata ariel]]''), exist on Diego Garcia.

Other nesting native birds include red-tailed tropicbirds (''[[Phaethon rubricauda]]''), wedge-tailed shearwaters (''[[Puffinus pacificus]]''), Audubon's shearwater (''[[Audubon's shearwater|Puffinus iherminierii]]''), black-naped terns (''[[Sterna sumatrana]]''), white (or fairy) terns (''[[Gygis alba]]''), striated herons (''[[Butorides striatus]]''), and white-breasted waterhens (''[[Amaurornis phoenicurus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 4.2.2.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The 680-hectare [[Barton Point Nature Reserve]] was identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] for its large breeding colony of red-footed boobies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org |title=Barton Point Nature Reserve |accessdate=21 October 2012 |work=Important Bird Areas factsheet |publisher=BirdLife International |year=2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710124603/http://www.birdlife.org/ |archivedate=10 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Introduced birds====
The island hosts introduced bird species from many regions, including cattle egrets (''[[Bubulcus ibis]]''), Indian barred ground dove, also called the zebra dove (''[[Geopelia striata]]''), turtle dove (''[[Nesoenas picturata]]''), Indian mynah (''[[Acridotheres tristis]]''), Madagascar fody (''[[Foudia madagascariensis]]''), and chickens (''[[Gallus gallus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 4.2.2.1.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Clear left}}

====Terrestrial reptiles and freshwater amphibians====
Currently, three lizards and one toad are known to inhabit Diego Garcia, and possibly one snake. All are believed to have been introduced by human activity. The house gecko (''[[Hemidactylus frenatus]]''), the mourning gecko (''[[Lepidodactylus lugubris]]''), the garden lizard (an agamid) (''[[Calotes versicolor]]''), and the cane toad (''[[Bufo marinus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 4.2.2.6.&lt;/ref&gt; A viable population of a type of blind snake from the family Typhlopidae may be present, probably the brahminy blind snake (''[[Ramphotyphlops braminus]]''). This snake feeds on the larvae, eggs, and pupae of [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s, and is about the size of a large earthworm.

====Sea turtles====
Diego Garcia provides suitable foraging and nesting habitat for both the hawksbill turtle (''[[Eretmochelys imbricata]]'') and the green turtle (''[[Chelonia mydas]]''). Juvenile hawksbills are quite common in the lagoon and at Barachois Sylvane (also known as Turtle Cove) in the southern part of the lagoon. Adult hawksbills and greens are common in the surrounding seas and nest regularly on the ocean-side beaches of the atoll. Hawksbills have been observed nesting during June and July, and from November to March. Greens have been observed nesting in every month; the average female lays three clutches per season, each having an average clutch size of 113 eggs. Diurnal nesting is common in both species. An estimated 300–700 hawksbills and 400–800 greens nest in the Chagos.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], Appendix K, pp. K-2–K-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endangered species====
Four reptiles and six cetaceans are endangered and may or may not be found on or around Diego Garcia:&lt;ref&gt;[[#NRMP|Natural Resources Management Plan (2005)]], paragraph 4.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hawksbill turtle (''[[hawksbill turtle|Eretmocheyls imbricata]]'') – known; leatherback turtle (''[[Dermochelys coriacea]]'') – possible; green turtle (''[[Chelonia mydas]]'') – known; olive ridley turtle (''[[olive ridley|Lepidochelys oliveacea]]'') – possible; sperm whale (''[[Physeter macrocephalus]]'') – possible; sei whale (''[[Sei whale|Balaeonoptera borealis]]'') – possible;
finback whale (''[[Fin whale|Balaeonoptera physalus]]'') – possible; Bryde's whale (''[[Bryde's whale|Balaeonoptera edeni]]'') – possible; blue whale (''[[blue whale|Balaeonoptera musculus]]'') – possible; humpback whale (''[[Megaptera novaeangliae]]'') – possible; southern right whale (''[[Eubalaena australis]]'') – possible.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll L.E.. 2011.

[[File:Diego Garcia Island Map.jpg|thumb|A map of military installations on Diego Garcia in 2002]]

During the [[Cold War]] era, following the British withdrawal from East of Suez, the United States was keen to establish a military base in the Indian Ocean to counter Soviet influence in the region and protect the sea-lanes for oil transportation from the Middle East. The United States saw the atoll as the &quot;Malta of the Indian Ocean&quot; equidistant from all points.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ladwig|Ladwig, Erickson and Mikolay (2014)]], pp. 138–42.&lt;/ref&gt; The value has been proven many times, with the island providing an &quot;[[unsinkable aircraft carrier]]&quot; for the United States during the [[Iranian revolution]], the [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]], [[Operation Desert Fox]], [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. In the contemporary era, the atoll continues to play a key role in America's approach to the Indian Ocean as a flexible forward hub that can facilitate a range of regional strategies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladwig2&quot;&gt;Walter C.

Five of these vessels carry supplies for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] sufficient to support a [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]] for 30 days: USNS ''Button'', USNS ''Kocak'', USNS ''Lopez'', USNS ''Stockham'', and USNS ''Fisher''.

Prior to 2001, COMPSRON 2 consisted of up to 20 ships, including four Combat Force Ships which provided rapid-response delivery of equipment to ground troops in the [[United States Army]]. Three are [[lighter aboard ship]]s (LASH) which carry barges called [[Lighter (barge)|lighters]] that contain Army ammunition to be ferried ashore: MV ''American Cormorant'', SS ''Green Harbour'', (LASH), SS ''Green Valley'', (LASH), MV ''Jeb Stuart'', (LASH). There were logistics vessels to service the rapid delivery requirements of the [[United States Air Force]], [[United States Navy]] and [[Defense Logistics Agency]]. These included [[container ship]]s for Air Force munitions, missiles and spare parts; a 500-bed [[hospital ship]], and [[floating storage and offloading unit]]s assigned to [[Military Sealift Command]] supporting the Defense Logistics Agency, and an offshore petroleum discharge system (OPDS) [[Tanker (ship)|tanker]]. Examples of ships are [[MV Buffalo Soldier|MV ''Buffalo Soldier'']], MV ''Green Ridge'', pre-position tanker [[USNS Henry J. Kaiser|USNS ''Henry J. Kaiser'']], and tanker [[USNS Potomac (T-AO-181)]].

===HF global station===
{{main|High Frequency Global Communications System}}

The United States Air Force operates a High Frequency Global Communications System transceiver site located on the south end of the atoll near the GEODSS station. The transceiver is operated remotely from [[Joint Base Andrews]] and locally maintained by NCTS FE personnel.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station Far East Detachment Diego Garcia===
Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station Far East Detachment Diego Garcia operates a detachment in Diego Garcia. This detachment provides base telephone communications, base network services (Local Network Services Center), pier connectivity services, and an AN/GSC-39C [[Super high frequency|SHF]] satellite terminal, operates the [[Air Force Technical Applications Center|Hydroacoustic Data Acquisition System]], and performs on-site maintenance for the remotely operated Air Force [[HF-GCS]] terminal.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Naval Security Group Detachment Diego Garcia===
[[Naval Security Group]] detachment Diego Garcia was disestablished on 30 September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;OPNAVNOTE 5450 dated 6 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining essential operations were transferred to a contractor. The large AN/AX-16 High Frequency [[Radio direction finding]] [[Wullenweber|Circularly Disposed Antenna Array]] has been demolished, but the four satellite antenna [[radome]]s around the site remain {{As of|2010|lc=y}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==ETOPS emergency landing site==
Diego Garcia may be identified as an [[ETOPS]] (Extended Range Twin Engine Operations) emergency landing site (en route alternate) for flight planning purposes of commercial airliners. This allows twin-engine commercial aircraft (such as the [[Airbus A330]], [[Boeing 767]] or [[Boeing 777]]) to make theoretical nonstop flights between city pairs such as [[Perth]] and [[Dubai]] ({{convert|9013.61|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), [[Hong Kong]] and [[Johannesburg]] ({{convert|10658|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) or [[Singapore]] and [[São Paulo]] ({{convert|15985.41|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), all while maintaining a suitable diversion airport within 180 minutes' flying time with one engine inoperable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/faqs/etopseropsenroutealt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228071611/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/airports/faqs/etopseropsenroutealt.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All consumable food and equipment are brought to Diego Garcia by sea or air, and all non-biodegradable waste is shipped off the island as well. From 1971 to 1973, United States Navy LSTs provided this service. Beginning in 1973, civilian ships were contracted to provide these services. From 2004 to 2009, the US-flagged [[container ship]] [[MV Baffin Strait (T-AK W9519)|MV ''Baffin Strait'']], often referred to as the &quot;DGAR shuttle,&quot; delivered 250 containers every month from [[Singapore]] to Diego Garcia.&lt;ref name=&quot;dgar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/N00p/pressrel/press07/press51.htm |title=Change at the helm for MSC's Diego Garcia office |publisher=Msc.navy.mil |date=8 November 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806085739/http://www.msc.navy.mil/N00p/pressrel/press07/press51.htm |archivedate=6 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship delivered &quot;more than 200,000 tons of cargo to the island each year.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dgar&quot;/&gt; On the return trip to Singapore, it carried recyclable metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deparc.xservices.com/pdfs/stories/Navy/FY06_SW_Success_Stories.pdf |title=2006 Pollution Prevention and Solid Waste Success Stories |accessdate=18 March 2008 |author=Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) |year=2007 |website= |publisher=US Department of the Navy}}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |quote       = Given the weight of evidence proving that Diego Garcia was – at the very least – a key staging post in the U.S. rendition and torture programme, it had been widely expected to feature in the dossier, thus exposing Britain’s involvement beyond doubt. That the island was not mentioned once in almost 500 heavily redacted pages has merely heightened suspicion of an MI6-orchestrated cover-up.
