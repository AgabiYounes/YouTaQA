'''Arithmetic''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:en:ἀριθμός#Ancient Greek|ἀριθμός]] ''arithmos'', &quot;[[number]]&quot; and [[wikt:en:τική#Ancient Greek|τική]] [[wikt:en:τέχνη#Ancient Greek|[τέχνη]]], ''tiké [téchne]'', &quot;[[art]]&quot;) is a branch of [[mathematics]] that consists of the study of [[number]]s, especially the properties of the traditional [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] on them—[[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]]. Arithmetic is an elementary part of [[number theory]], and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level [[Areas of mathematics|divisions of modern mathematics]], along with [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. The terms ''arithmetic'' and ''higher arithmetic'' were used until the beginning of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century as synonyms for ''number theory'' and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Davenport|Davenport, Harold]], ''The Higher Arithmetic: An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers'' (7th ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-63446-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of arithmetic}}
The prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a small number of artifacts which may indicate the conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the [[Ishango bone]] from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|central Africa]], dating from somewhere between 20,000 and 18,000&amp;nbsp;BC, although its interpretation is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudman |first=Peter Strom |title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years |year=2007 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-59102-477-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/howmathematicsha0000rudm/page/64 64] |url=https://archive.org/details/howmathematicsha0000rudm/page/64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest written records indicate the [[Egyptian mathematics|Egyptians]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonians]] used all the [[elementary arithmetic]] operations as early as 2000&amp;nbsp;BC. These artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems, but the characteristics of the particular [[numeral system]] strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for [[Egyptian numerals]], like the later [[Roman numerals]], descended from [[tally marks]] used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a [[decimal]] base but did not include [[positional notation]]. Complex calculations with Roman numerals required the assistance of a [[counting board]] or the [[Roman abacus]] to obtain the results.

Early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the [[sexagesimal]] (base&amp;nbsp;60) system for [[Babylonian numerals]] and the [[vigesimal]] (base&amp;nbsp;20) system that defined [[Maya numerals]]. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation.

The continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the [[Hellenistic civilization]] of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of [[Euclid]] around 300&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Greek mathematics|Greek studies in mathematics]] overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. For example, [[Nicomachus]] summarized the viewpoint of the earlier [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] approach to numbers, and their relationships to each other, in his ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]''.

[[Greek numerals]] were used by [[Archimedes]], [[Diophantus]] and others in a [[positional notation]] not very different from ours. The ancient Greeks lacked a symbol for zero until the Hellenistic period, and they used three separate sets of symbols as [[numerical digit|digits]]: one set for the units place, one for the tens place, and one for the hundreds. For the thousands place they would reuse the symbols for the units place, and so on. Their addition algorithm was identical to ours, and their multiplication algorithm was only very slightly different. Their long division algorithm was the same, and the [[Methods of computing square roots#Digit-by-digit calculation|digit-by-digit square root algorithm]], popularly used as recently as the 20th century, was known to Archimedes, who may have invented it. He preferred it to [[Heron's method|Hero's method]] of successive approximation because, once computed, a digit doesn't change, and the square roots of perfect squares, such as 7485696, terminate immediately as 2736. For numbers with a fractional part, such as 546.934, they used negative powers of 60 instead of negative powers of 10 for the fractional part 0.934.&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of Archimedes'', Chapter IV, ''Arithmetic in Archimedes'', edited by T.L. Heath, Dover Publications Inc, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Chinese had advanced arithmetic studies dating from the Shang Dynasty and continuing through the Tang Dynasty, from basic numbers to advanced algebra. The ancient Chinese used a positional notation similar to that of the Greeks. Since they also lacked a symbol for zero, they had one set of symbols for the units place, and a second set for the tens place. For the hundreds place they then reused the symbols for the units place, and so on. Their symbols were based on the ancient [[counting rods]]. It is a complicated question to determine exactly when the Chinese started calculating with positional representation, but it was definitely before 400&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China'', Vol. 3, p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Chinese were the first to meaningfully discover, understand, and apply negative numbers as explained in the ''[[Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (''Jiuzhang Suanshu''), which was written by [[Liu Hui]].

The gradual development of the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] independently devised the place-value concept and positional notation, which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal base and the use of a digit representing [[0 (number)|0]]. This allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers. This approach eventually replaced all other systems. In the early {{nowrap|6th century AD,}} the Indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] incorporated an existing version of this system in his work, and experimented with different notations. In the 7th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Brahmagupta]] established the use of&amp;nbsp;0 as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers, except for the result of [[division by zero]]. His contemporary, the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] bishop [[Severus Sebokht]] (650&amp;nbsp;AD) said, &quot;Indians possess a method of calculation that no word can praise enough. Their rational system of mathematics, or of their method of calculation. I mean the system using nine symbols.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reference: Revue de l'Orient Chretien by François Nau pp. 327–338. (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs also learned this new method and called it ''hesab''.

[[File:Leibniz Stepped Reckoner.png|thumb|200px|Leibniz's [[Stepped Reckoner]] was the first calculator that could perform all four arithmetic operations.]]
Although the [[Codex Vigilanus]] described an early form of Arabic numerals (omitting&amp;nbsp;0) by 976&amp;nbsp;AD, Leonardo of Pisa ([[Fibonacci]]) was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout Europe after the publication of his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202. He wrote, &quot;The method of the Indians (Latin ''Modus Indoram'') surpasses any known method to compute. It's a marvelous method. They do their computations using nine figures and symbol [[zero]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reference: Sigler, L., &quot;Fibonacci's Liber Abaci&quot;, Springer, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Middle Ages, arithmetic was one of the seven [[liberal arts]] taught in universities.

The flourishing of [[algebra]] in the [[medieval]] [[Islamic]] world and in [[Renaissance]] [[Europe]] was an outgrowth of the enormous simplification of [[computation]] through [[decimal]] notation.

Various types of tools have been invented and widely used to assist in numeric calculations. Before Renaissance, they were various types of [[abaci]]. More recent examples include [[slide rule]]s, [[nomogram]]s and [[mechanical calculator]]s, such as [[Pascal's calculator]]. At present, they have been supplanted by electronic [[calculator]]s and [[computer]]s.

==Arithmetic operations==
{{See also|Algebraic operation}}
The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, although this subject also includes more advanced operations, such as manipulations of [[percentage]]s, [[square root]]s, [[exponentiation]], [[logarithmic function]]s, and even [[trigonometric function]]s, in the same vein as logarithms ([[prosthaphaeresis]]). Arithmetic expressions must be evaluated according to the intended sequence of operations. There are several methods to specify this, either—most common, together with [[infix notation]]—explicitly using parentheses, and relying on [[Order of operations|precedence rules]], or using a [[Polish notation|prefix]] or [[Reverse Polish notation|postfix]] notation, which uniquely fix the order of execution by themselves. Any set of objects upon which all four arithmetic operations (except [[division by zero]]) can be performed, and where these four operations obey the usual laws (including distributivity), is called a [[field mathematics|field]].&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=0-19-914551-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addition (+)===
{{main|Addition}}
Addition is the most basic operation of arithmetic. In its simple form, addition combines two numbers, the ''addends'' or ''[[term (mathematics)|terms]]'', into a single number, the ''sum'' of the numbers (such as {{math|2 + 2 {{=}} 4}} or {{math|3 + 5 {{=}} 8}}).

Adding finitely many numbers can be viewed as repeated simple addition; this procedure is known as [[summation]], a term also used to denote the definition for &quot;adding infinitely many numbers&quot; in an [[series (mathematics)|infinite series]]. Repeated addition of the number&amp;nbsp;[[one|1]] is the most basic form of [[counting]]; the result of adding {{math|1}} is usually called the [[successor function|successor]] of the original number.

Addition is [[commutative]] and [[associative]], so the order in which finitely many terms are added does not matter. The [[identity element]] for a [[binary operation]] is the number that, when combined with any number, yields the same number as the result. According to the rules of addition, adding&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}} to any number yields that same number, so {{math|0}} is the [[additive identity]]. The ''[[inverse element|inverse]] of a number'' with respect to a [[binary operation]] is the number that, when combined with any number, yields the identity with respect to this operation. So the inverse of a number with respect to addition (its [[additive inverse]], or the opposite number) is the number that yields the additive identity,&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}}, when added to the original number; it is immediately obvious that this is the negative of the original number. For example, the additive inverse of {{math|7}} is {{math|−7}}, since {{math|7 + (−7) {{=}} 0}}.

Addition can be interpreted geometrically as in the following example:
:If we have two sticks of lengths ''2'' and ''5'', then, if we place the sticks one after the other, the length of the stick thus formed is ''7'', since {{math|2 + 5 {{=}} 7}}.

===Subtraction (−)===
{{Main|Subtraction}}
{{See also|Method of complements}}
Subtraction is the inverse operation to addition. Subtraction finds the ''difference'' between two numbers, the ''minuend''  minus the ''subtrahend'': {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''M'' - ''S''.}} Resorting to the previously established addition, this is to say that the difference is the number that, when added to the subtrahend, results in the minuend: {{math|''D'' + ''S'' {{=}} ''M''.}}

For positive arguments {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|S}} holds:
:If the minuend is larger than the subtrahend, the difference {{mvar|D}} is positive.
:If the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference {{mvar|D}} is negative.
In any case, if minuend and subtrahend are equal, the difference {{math|''D'' {{=}} 0.}}

Subtraction is neither [[Commutative property|commutative]] nor [[Associative property|associative]]. For that reason, in modern algebra the construction of this inverse operation is often discarded in favor of introducing the concept of inverse elements, as sketched under  [[#Addition (+)|Addition]], and to look at subtraction as adding the additive inverse of the subtrahend to the minuend, that is {{math|''a'' − ''b'' {{=}} ''a'' + (−''b'')}}. The immediate price of discarding the binary operation of subtraction is the introduction of the (trivial) [[unary operation]], delivering the additive inverse for any given number, and losing the immediate access to the notion of [[difference (mathematics)|difference]], which is potentially misleading when negative arguments are involved.

For any representation of numbers there are methods for calculating results, some of which are particularly advantageous in exploiting procedures, existing for one operation, by small alterations also for others. For example, digital computers can reuse existing adding-circuitry and save additional circuits for implementing a subtraction by employing the method of [[two's complement]] for representing the additive inverses, which is extremely easy to implement in hardware ([[Inverter (logic gate)|negation]]). The trade-off is the halving of the number range for a fixed word length.

A formerly wide spread method to achieve a correct change amount, knowing the due and given amounts, is the ''counting up method'', which does not explicitly generate the value of the difference. Suppose an amount ''P'' is given in order to pay the required amount ''Q'', with ''P'' greater than ''Q''. Rather than explicitly performing the subtraction ''P'' − ''Q'' = ''C'' and counting out that amount ''C'' in change, money is counted out starting with the successor of ''Q'', and continuing in the steps of the currency, until ''P'' is reached. Although the amount counted out must equal the result of the subtraction ''P'' − ''Q'', the subtraction was never really done and the value of ''P'' − ''Q'' is not supplied by this method.

===Multiplication (× or · or *)===
{{main|Multiplication}}
Multiplication is the second basic operation of arithmetic. Multiplication also combines two numbers into a single number, the ''product''. The two original numbers are called the ''multiplier'' and the ''multiplicand'', mostly both are simply called ''factors''.

Multiplication may be viewed as a scaling operation. If the numbers are imagined as lying in a line, multiplication by a number, say ''x'', greater than&amp;nbsp;1 is the same as stretching everything away from&amp;nbsp;0 uniformly, in such a way that the number&amp;nbsp;1 itself is stretched to where ''x'' was. Similarly, multiplying by a number less than&amp;nbsp;1 can be imagined as squeezing towards&amp;nbsp;0. (Again, in such a way that&amp;nbsp;1 goes to the multiplicand.)

Another view on multiplication of integer numbers, extendable to rationals, but not very accessible for real numbers, is by considering it as repeated addition. So {{math|3 × 4}} corresponds to either adding {{math|3}} times a {{math|4}}, or {{math|4}} times a {{math|3}}, giving the same result. There are different opinions on the advantageousness of these [[Multiplication and repeated addition|paradigmata]] in math education.

Multiplication is commutative and associative; further, it is [[distributivity|distributive]] over addition and subtraction. The [[multiplicative identity]] is&amp;nbsp;1, since multiplying any number by&amp;nbsp;1 yields that same number. The [[multiplicative inverse]] for any number except&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}} is the [[reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of this number, because  multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself yields the multiplicative identity {{math|1}}.  {{math|0}}&amp;nbsp;is the only number without a multiplicative inverse, and the result of multiplying any number and {{math|0}} is again {{math|0.}} One says that {{math|0}} is not contained in the multiplicative [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of the numbers.

The product of ''a'' and ''b'' is written as {{math|''a'' × ''b''}} or {{math|''a''·''b''}}. When ''a'' or ''b'' are expressions not written simply with digits, it is also written by simple juxtaposition:&amp;nbsp;''ab''. In computer programming languages and software packages in which one can only use characters normally found on a keyboard, it is often written with an asterisk:&amp;nbsp;{{math|''a'' * ''b''.}}

Algorithms implementing the operation of multiplication for various representations of numbers are by far more costly and laborious than those for addition. Those accessible for manual computation either rely on breaking down the factors to single place values and apply repeated addition, or employ [[Mathematical table|tables]] or [[slide rules]], thereby mapping the multiplication to addition and back. These methods are outdated and replaced by mobile devices. Computers utilize diverse sophisticated and highly optimized algorithms to implement multiplication and division for the various number formats supported in their system.

===Division (÷, or /)===
{{main|Division (mathematics)}}
Division is essentially the inverse operation to multiplication. Division finds the ''quotient'' of two numbers, the ''dividend'' divided by the ''divisor''. Any dividend [[division by zero|divided by zero]] is undefined. For distinct positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor, the quotient is greater than&amp;nbsp;1, otherwise it is less than&amp;nbsp;1 (a similar rule applies for negative numbers). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend.

Division is neither commutative nor associative. So as explained for [[#Subtraction (−)|subtraction]], in modern algebra the construction of the division is discarded in favor of constructing the inverse elements with respect to multiplication, as introduced [[#Multiplication (× or · or *)|there]]. That is, division is a multiplication with the dividend and the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the divisor as factors, that is {{math|''a'' ÷ ''b'' {{=}} ''a'' × {{sfrac|1|''b''}}.}}

Within natural numbers there is also a different, but related notion, the [[Euclidean division]], giving two results of &quot;dividing&quot; a natural {{mvar|N}} (numerator) by a natural {{mvar|D}} (denominator), first, a natural {{mvar|Q}} (quotient) and second, a natural {{mvar|R}} (remainder), such that {{math|''N'' {{=}} ''D''×''Q'' + ''R''}} and {{math|''R'' &lt; ''Q''.}}

==Decimal arithmetic==
'''[[Decimal representation]]''' refers exclusively, in common use, to the written [[numeral system]] employing [[arabic numerals]] as the [[numerical digit|digits]] for a [[radix]] [[decimal|10&amp;nbsp;(&quot;decimal&quot;)]] [[positional notation]]; however, any [[numeral system]] based on powers of&amp;nbsp;10, e.g., [[Greek Numerals|Greek]], [[Cyrillic numerals|Cyrillic]], [[Roman numerals|Roman]], or [[Chinese numerals]] may conceptually be described as &quot;decimal notation&quot; or &quot;decimal representation&quot;.

Modern methods for four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) were first devised by [[Brahmagupta]] of India. This was known during medieval Europe as &quot;Modus Indoram&quot; or Method of the Indians. Positional notation (also known as &quot;place-value notation&quot;) refers to the representation or encoding of [[number]]s using the same symbol for the different [[orders of magnitude]] (e.g., the &quot;ones place&quot;, &quot;tens place&quot;, &quot;hundreds place&quot;) and, with a [[radix point]], using those same symbols to represent [[arithmetic fraction|fractions]] (e.g., the &quot;tenths place&quot;, &quot;hundredths place&quot;). For example, 507.36 denotes 5&amp;nbsp;hundreds (10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), plus 0&amp;nbsp;tens (10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), plus 7&amp;nbsp;units (10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), plus 3&amp;nbsp;tenths (10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) plus 6&amp;nbsp;hundredths (10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The concept of [[Zero|0]] as a number comparable to the other basic digits is essential to this notation, as is the concept of&amp;nbsp;0's use as a placeholder, and as is the definition of multiplication and addition with&amp;nbsp;0. The use of&amp;nbsp;0 as a placeholder and, therefore, the use of a positional notation is first attested to in the [[Jainism|Jain]] text from [[India]] entitled the ''[[Lokavibhâga]]'', dated 458&amp;nbsp;AD and it was only in the early 13th&amp;nbsp;century that these concepts, transmitted via the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|scholarship of the Arabic world]], were introduced into [[Europe]] by [[Fibonacci]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-4153/Leonardo-Pisano Leonardo Pisano – p. 3: &quot;Contributions to number theory&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617154015/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-4153/Leonardo-Pisano |date=2008-06-17 }}. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' Online, 2006. Retrieved 18 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; using the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.

[[Algorism]] comprises all of the rules for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value&amp;nbsp;9, the result is represented with two digits. The rightmost digit is the value for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by the value of the second (leftmost) digit, which is always one (if not zero). This adjustment is termed a ''carry'' of the value&amp;nbsp;1.

The process for multiplying two arbitrary numbers is similar to the process for addition. A multiplication table with ten rows and ten columns lists the results for each pair of digits. If an individual product of a pair of digits exceeds&amp;nbsp;9, the ''carry'' adjustment increases the result of any subsequent multiplication from digits to the left by a value equal to the second (leftmost) digit, which is any value from {{nowrap|1 to 8}} ({{math|9 × 9 {{=}} 81}}). Additional steps define the final result.

Similar techniques exist for subtraction and division.

The creation of a correct process for multiplication relies on the relationship between values of adjacent digits. The value for any single digit in a numeral depends on its position. Also, each position to the left represents a value ten times larger than the position to the right. In mathematical terms, the [[exponentiation|exponent]] for the [[radix]] (base) of&amp;nbsp;10 increases by&amp;nbsp;1 (to the left) or decreases by&amp;nbsp;1 (to the right). Therefore, the value for any arbitrary digit is multiplied by a value of the form&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[integer]]&amp;nbsp;''n''. The list of values corresponding to all possible positions for a single digit is written {{nowrap|as {..., 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 10, 1, 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, ...}.}}

Repeated multiplication of any value in this list by&amp;nbsp;10 produces another value in the list. In mathematical terminology, this characteristic is defined as [[closure (mathematics)|closure]], and the previous list is described as '''closed under multiplication'''. It is the basis for correctly finding the results of multiplication using the previous technique. This outcome is one example of the uses of [[number theory]].

Before decimal-based systems of money and units of measure, compound unit arithmetic was widely used in commerce and industry.

* '''Normalization''' is the conversion of a set of compound units to a standard form—for example, rewriting &quot;{{nowrap|1 ft 13 in}}&quot; as &quot;{{nowrap|2 ft 1 in}}&quot;.

Knowledge of the relationship between the various units of measure, their multiples and their submultiples forms an essential part of compound unit arithmetic.

===Principles of compound unit arithmetic===
There are two basic approaches to compound unit arithmetic:
* '''Reduction–expansion method''' where all the compound unit variables are reduced to single unit variables, the calculation performed and the result expanded back to compound units. This approach is suited for automated calculations. A typical example is the handling of time by [[Microsoft Excel]] where all time intervals are processed internally as days and decimal fractions of a day.
* '''On-going normalization method''' in which each unit is treated separately and the problem is continuously normalized as the solution develops. This approach, which is widely described in classical texts, is best suited for manual calculations. An example of the ongoing normalization method as applied to addition is shown below.

[[File:MixedUnitAddition.svg|left|thumb]]
The addition operation is carried out from right to left; in this case, pence are processed first, then shillings followed by pounds. The numbers below the &quot;answer line&quot; are intermediate results.

The total in the pence column is 25. Since there are 12 pennies in a shilling, 25 is divided by&amp;nbsp;12 to give&amp;nbsp;2 with a remainder of&amp;nbsp;1. The value&amp;nbsp;&quot;1&quot; is then written to the answer row and the value&amp;nbsp;&quot;2&quot; carried forward to the shillings column. This operation is repeated using the values in the shillings column, with the additional step of adding the value that was carried forward from the pennies column. The intermediate total is divided by&amp;nbsp;20 as there are 20&amp;nbsp;shillings in a pound. The pound column is then processed, but as pounds are the largest unit that is being considered, no values are carried forward from the pounds column.

For the sake of simplicity, the example chosen did not have farthings.

===Operations in practice===

During the 19th and 20th centuries various aids were developed to aid the manipulation of compound units, particularly in commercial applications. The most common aids were mechanical tills which were adapted in countries such as the United Kingdom to accommodate pounds, shillings, pennies and farthings and &quot;Ready Reckoners&quot;—books aimed at traders that catalogued the results of various routine calculations such as the percentages or multiples of various sums of money. One typical booklet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ran to 150&amp;nbsp;pages tabulated multiples &quot;from one to ten thousand at the various prices from one farthing to one pound&quot;.

The cumbersome nature of compound unit arithmetic has been recognized for many years—in 1586, the Flemish mathematician [[Simon Stevin]] published a small pamphlet called ''[[De Thiende]]'' (&quot;the tenth&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Stevin|date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he declared the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time. In the modern era, many conversion programs, such as that included in the Microsoft Windows&amp;nbsp;7 operating system calculator, display compound units in a reduced decimal format rather than using an expanded format (e.g. &quot;2.5&amp;nbsp;ft&quot; is displayed rather than {{nowrap|&quot;2 ft 6 in&quot;}}).

==Number theory==
{{main|Number theory}}
Until the 19th century, ''number theory'' was a synonym of &quot;arithmetic&quot;. The addressed problems were directly related to the basic operations and concerned [[prime number|primality]], [[divisibility]], and the [[Diophantine equation|solution of equations in integers]], such as [[Fermat's last theorem]]. It appeared that most of these problems, although very elementary to state, are very difficult and may not be solved without very deep mathematics involving concepts and methods from many other branches of mathematics. This led to new branches of number theory such as [[analytic number theory]], [[algebraic number theory]], [[Diophantine geometry]] and [[arithmetic algebraic geometry]]. [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem]] is a typical example of the necessity of sophisticated methods, which go far beyond the classical methods of arithmetic, for solving problems that can be stated in elementary arithmetic.

==Arithmetic in education==
[[Primary education]] in mathematics often places a strong focus on algorithms for the arithmetic of [[natural number]]s, [[integer]]s, [[arithmetic fraction|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s (using the decimal place-value system). This study is sometimes known as algorism.

The difficulty and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas. One notable movement in this direction was the [[New Math]] of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to teach arithmetic in the spirit of axiomatic development from set theory, an echo of the prevailing trend in higher mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000519063231/http://mathematicallycorrect.com/glossary.htm Mathematically Correct: Glossary of Terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, arithmetic was used by [[Ulama|Islamic Scholars]] in order to teach application of the rulings related to [[Zakat]] and [[Islamic inheritance jurisprudence|Irth]]. This was done in a book entitled ''The Best of Arithmetic'' by Abd-al-Fattah-al-Dumyati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=al-Dumyati |first=Abd-al-Fattah Bin Abd-al-Rahman al-Banna |url={{wdl|3945}} |date=1887 |title=The Best of Arithmetic |work=[[World Digital Library]] |language=Arabic |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book begins with the foundations of mathematics and proceeds to its application in the later chapters.
