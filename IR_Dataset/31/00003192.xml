Rabbi '''Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz''' ({{lang-he-n|עדין אבן-ישראל שטיינזלץ}})  (born 11 July 1937) is an Israeli [[Chabad|Chabad Chasidic]] [[rabbi]], teacher, philosopher, social critic, and publisher, who has been hailed by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as a &quot;once-in-a-millennium scholar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966474,00.html|title=Giving The Talmud to the Jews|authorlink=Richard N.

Beginning in 1989, Steinsaltz published several [[tract (literature)|tractates]] in Hebrew and English of the Babylonian (Bavli) Talmud in an English-Hebrew edition. The first volume of a new English-Hebrew edition, the Koren Talmud Bavli, was released in May 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/april-27-2012/rabbi-adin-steinsaltz/10847/|title=Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz|authorlink=Bob Abernethy|first= Bob| last= Abernethy|work=Religion &amp; Ethics | date=27 April 2012 | access-date=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been brought to completion. 

Steinsaltz is a recipient of the [[Israel Prize]] for Jewish Studies (1988), [[President's Medal (Israel)|President's Medal]] (2012), and [[Yakir Yerushalayim]] (2017).

== Biography ==
[[File:A. Steinsaltz Zürich.jpg|thumb| Adin Steinsaltz in the [[Israelitische Cultusgemeinde Zürich (ICZ)]] in [[Zürich-Enge]] (2010)]]
[[File:Rabbi Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz - Steinsaltz Center.jpg|thumb|Meni Even-Israel and his father, Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz, inspect a newly printed volume of the [[Koren]] Noe Talmud series, an elegant and intuitive English-language edition of the Babylonian Talmud that is shaped by Steinsaltz's acclaimed translation and commentary. (2018)]]
Adin Steinsaltz was born in Jerusalem in 1937 to secular parents, Avraham Steinsaltz and Leah (nee Krokovitz). His father was a great-grandson of the first [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonimer Rebbe]], Avrohom Weinberg, and was a student of [[Hillel Zeitlin]]. Avraham and Leah Steinsaltz met through Zeitlin. They [[Aliyah|immigrated to Israel]] in [[1924]]. Avraham Steinsaltz, a devoted communist and member of [[Lehi (militant group)|Lehi]] went to Spain in [[1936]] to fight with the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jpress.org.il/olive/apa/nli_heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=MAR/1986/06/12&amp;id=Ar01704|title=אגדות מבית אבא|website=jpress.org.il|access-date=2020-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adin was born the following year.

Steinsaltz became a [[baal teshuva]] during his teenage years and learned from rabbi Shmuel Elazar Heilprin ([[Rosh yeshiva]] of Yeshivas Toras Emes [[Chabad]]). He studied mathematics,&lt;ref name=&quot;tanya&quot;&gt;Steinsaltz, Adin; Shneur Zalman (of Lyady). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ylvMsMBvPbEC&amp;pg=PA343 ''Understanding the Tanya: Volume Three in the Definitive Commentary on a Classic Work of Kabbalah by the World's Foremost Authority'']. John Wiley and Sons, 2007, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; physics, and chemistry at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pebbles&quot;&gt;Steinsaltz, Adin; Arthur Kurzweil. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3kA21pE0_jgC&amp;pg=PA331 ''Pebbles of wisdom from Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz'']. John Wiley and Sons, 2009, p.331.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to rabbinical studies at Yeshivas Tomchei Tmimim in [[Lod]] and with rabbis Dov Ber Eliezrov and Shmaryahu Noach Sasonkin. Following graduation, he established several experimental schools after an unsuccessful attempt to start a neo-[[Hassidic]] community in the [[Negev|Negev desert]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek&quot; /&gt; and, at the age of 24, became [[Israel]]'s youngest school principal.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanya&quot; /&gt;

In 1965, he founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications, and began his monumental work on the Talmud, including translation into Hebrew, English, Russian, and various other languages. The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud include translation from the original [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and a comprehensive commentary. Steinsaltz completed his Hebrew edition of the entire Babylonian Talmud in November 2010, at which time [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] became the publisher of all of his works, including the Talmud. While not without criticism (such as by [[Jacob Neusner]], 1998), the Steinsaltz edition is widely used throughout Israel, the United States, and the world.{{citation needed|date= March 2015}} Over two million volumes of the Steinsaltz Talmud have been distributed to date. Controversial Talmud passages previously obscured, omitted entirely or confined to footnotes in English translations like the [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] Talmud, receive full exposition in the Steinsaltz Talmud. Random House halted publication of the Steinsaltz Talmud after less than one-third of the English translation had been published.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud have opened up the world of Talmud study to thousands of people outside the walls of the traditional yeshiva, including women, who traditionally were not taught Talmud. Regarding the access that his work provides, Steinsaltz says: &quot;I never thought that spreading ignorance has any advantage, except for those who are in a position of power and want to deprive others of their rights and spread ignorance in order to keep them underlings.&quot;

Steinsaltz's classic work of [[Kabbalah]], ''The Thirteen Petalled Rose'', was first published in 1980, and now appears in eight languages. In all, Steinsaltz has authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects including Talmud, [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[sociology]], historical biography, and philosophy. Many of these works have been translated into English by his close personal friend, now deceased, Yehuda Hanegbi. His latest book is a memoir-biography on the [[Chabad|Lubavitcher]] [[Rebbe]], rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], published by Maggid Books (2014).

Continuing his work as a teacher and spiritual mentor, Steinsaltz established Yeshivat Mekor Chaim alongside rabbis [[Menachem Froman]] and [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg|Shagar]] in 1984, and Yeshivat [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]] in 1999. He also serves as president of the Shefa Middle and High Schools. He has served as scholar in residence at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in Washington, D. C., and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His honorary degrees include doctorates from [[Yeshiva University]], [[Ben Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Bar Ilan University]], [[Brandeis University]], and [[Florida International University]]. Steinsaltz is also [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshivat Hesder]] [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]].

Being a follower of rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]], he went to help Jews in the [[Soviet Union]] assisting Chabad's ''[[Shaliach (Chabad)|shluchim]]'' (propagators) network. Deeply involved in the future of the Jews in the former Soviet Union, Steinsaltz serves as the region's ''Duchovny Ravin'' (Spiritual Rabbi), a historic Russian title which indicates that he is the spiritual mentor of Russian Jewry. In this capacity, Steinsaltz travelled to Russia and the Republics once each month from his home in Jerusalem. During his time in the former Soviet Union, he founded the Jewish University, both in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]]. The Jewish University is the first degree-granting institution of Jewish studies in the former [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-heritage.org/hpeumr.htm |title=Jewish University in Moscow |website=Jewish-Heritage.org |publisher=Jewish Heritage Society |access-date=4 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927163427/http://www.jewish-heritage.org/hpeumr.htm |archive-date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1991]], on Schneersohn's advice, he changed his family name from Steinsaltz to Even-Israel. Besides Chabad, Steinsaltz is also inspired by the teachings of the [[Menachem Mendel of Kotzk|Kotzker Rebbe]]. He was in close contact with the fifth [[Ger (Hasidic dynasty)|Gerrer]] Rebbe, [[Yisrael Alter|Yisroel Alter]], and his brother and successor, [[Simcha Bunim Alter]].

Steinsaltz has taken a cautious approach to interfaith dialogues. During a visit of a delegation of Roman Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] in Manhattan in January 2004, he said that, &quot;You do not have to raise over-expectations of a meeting, as it doesn't signify in itself a breakthrough; however, the opportunity for cardinals and rabbis to speak face to face is valuable. It's part of a process in which we can talk to each other in a friendly way&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/20/nyregion/in-upper-manhattan-talmudic-scholars-look-up-and-find-cardinals-among-the-rabbis.html?scp=1&amp;sq=In%20Upper%20Manhattan,%20Talmudic%20Scholars%20Look%20Up%20and%20Find%20Cardinals%20Among%20the%20Rabbis&amp;st=cse| title=In Upper Manhattan, Talmudic Scholars Look Up and Find Cardinals Among the Rabbis| first1= Daniel J. |last1= Wakin |first2= Laurie |last2= Goodstein| date=20 January 2004| newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for &quot;a theological dialogue that asks the tough questions, such as whether Catholicism allows for Jews to enter eternal paradise&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forward.com/articles/6156/| title=Cardinals Meet For a Dialogue With Top Rabbis| first= Nacha |last= Cattan| date=23 January 2004| newspaper= The Jewish Daily Forward| access-date=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinsaltz and his wife live in Jerusalem, and have three children and more than ten grandchildren. In 2016, Rav Steinsaltz suffered a stroke, leaving him unable to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/rabbi-adin-steinsaltz-recovering-from-stroke/|title=Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz recovering from stroke|last=JTA|website=www.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Rabbi Menachem (&quot;Meni&quot;) Even-Israel, is the Executive Director of the Steinsaltz Center, Rabbi Steinsaltz's umbrella organization, located in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Knowledge-The-key-to-Jewish-survival-557918| title=Knowledge: The Key to Jewish Survival| first= Meni |last= Even-Israel| date=20 May 2018| newspaper= The Jerusalem Post| access-date=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public reception ==
=== Academic criticism ===
[[Jacob Neusner]]'s ''How Adin Steinsaltz Misrepresents the Talmud. Four False Propositions from his &quot;Reference Guide&quot;'' (1998) displays strong disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;So to orient Steinsaltz to the discourse he manifestly has missed, I call to his attention the following works in ... of book reviews and criticism I have published over the past forty years: Judaic Law from Jesus to the Mishnah. ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jeremy Brown criticized the [[The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition#Koren Talmud Bavli|Koren Talmud Bavli]] as having inaccurate scientific information, such as identifying [[Ursa Major]] as a star and describing [[polycythemia vera]] as a disease causing excessive bleeding from the gums and from ordinary cuts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://seforimblog.com/2012/07/a-preliminary-review-of-new-koren/ A Preliminary Review of The New Koren Talmud Bavli: A Goldilocks edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haredi community ===
Steinsaltz's works was the target of fierce opposition in parts of the Orthodox Jewish world, with many leading rabbis such as [[Elazar Shach]], [[Yosef Shalom Eliashiv]], and [[Eliezer Waldenberg]] harshly condemning his Talmud and other books.&lt;ref name=Dat&gt;{{cite book |last=Elchanan |first=Yoel |date= |title=דת הציונות |trans-title=Dat Hatzionut |url=http://www.yoel-ab.com/data/upload_images/docs/%D7%93%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7%20%D7%91.pdf |language=Hebrew|pages=288–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Waldenberg further wrote that these works had the power to &quot;poison the souls&quot; of those who read them.&lt;ref name=Dat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ranaz.co.il/articles/article3071_19890804.asp Noach Zvuluny] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007200851/http://www.ranaz.co.il/articles/article3071_19890804.asp |date=7 October 2013 }}; Davar - 4/8/1989, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aharon Feldman]] has penned a lengthy critical review of the Steinsaltz Talmud. Among many criticisms, he writes, &quot;Specifically, the work is marred by an extraordinary number of inaccuracies stemming primarily from misreadings of the sources; it fails to explain those difficult passages which the reader would expect it to explain; and it confuses him with notes which are often irrelevant, incomprehensible, and contradictory.&quot; Feldman says he fears that, &quot;An intelligent student utilizing the Steinsaltz Talmud as his personal instructor might in fact conclude that Talmud in general is not supposed to make sense.&quot; Furthermore, writes Feldman, the Steinsaltz Talmud gives off the impression that the Talmud is intellectually flabby, inconsistent, and often trivial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Jewish leaders and authors ===
While certain members of the Haredi community may have opposition to Steinsaltz's works, other Jewish leaders, rabbis, and authors have spoken or written about their appreciation for Steinsaltz's unique educational approach. Rabbi John Rosove of [[Temple Israel of Hollywood]] featured “Opening The Tanya”, “Learning the Tanya”, and “Understanding the Tanya” on his list of the top ten recommended Jewish books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rabbijohnrosove.wordpress.com/about/ |title=About |website= rabbijohnrosove.wordpress.com |publisher=Wordpress |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jewishjournal.com/blogs/222904/top-ten-recommended-jewish-books/ |title= My Top Ten Recommended Jewish Books |website=JewishJournal.com |publisher=Jewish Journal |accessdate=10 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These volumes are written by rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]], the founder of the [[Chabad]] Lubavitch movement, and include commentary by Steinsaltz. Through reading the [[Tanya]], readers can explore all aspects of the central text of Chabad movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/6237/jewish/Lessons-in-Tanya.htm |title=Lessons in Tanya |website=Chabad.org |publisher=Chabad Lubavitch Center |accessdate=10 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Elie Kaunfer]], a [[rosh yeshiva]] and the CEO of Mechon Hadar Yeshiva, discussed his gratitude for Steinsaltz's Global Day of Jewish Learning and the opportunity created by this online platform for learning and creating a deeper connection to [[Torah]], other Jewish text, and Jews worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Borschel-Dan|first=Amanda|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/old-school-educators-go-hi-tech-to-promote-torah-accessibility/| date=13 November 2014|title=Old-school educators go hi-tech to promote Torah accessibility|periodical=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Pinchas Allouche, who studied under Steinsaltz, notes that Steinsaltz &quot;is a world scholar&quot; who &quot;revolutionized the Jewish landscape&quot; through his commentary, other writings, and educational organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allouche|first=Pinchas|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/why-rabbi-adin-steinsaltz-is-right-about-the-rabbis-of-today/| date=1 January 2014|title=Why Rabbi Steinsaltz is right about the rabbis of today|periodical=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the Jewish community, such as Zeev Katz, an Israeli Historian, have verbalized their appreciation of Steinsaltz's contribution to historical education by comparing Steinsaltz to [[Rashi]] and [[Maimonides]], two great Jewish sages of medieval times, and classifying him as “a once-in-a-millennium scholar”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=N.
