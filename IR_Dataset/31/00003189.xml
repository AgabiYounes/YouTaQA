      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''ascending chain condition''' ('''ACC''') and '''descending chain condition''' ('''DCC''') are finiteness properties satisfied by some [[algebraic structure]]s, most importantly [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in certain [[commutative ring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hazewinkel, Gubareni &amp; Kirichenko (2004), p.6, Prop. 1.1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraleigh &amp; Katz (1967), p. 366, Lemma 7.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 142 and 147&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of [[David Hilbert]], [[Emmy Noether]], and [[Emil Artin]].
The conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any [[partially ordered set]]. This point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to Gabriel and Rentschler.

== Definition ==
A [[partially ordered set]] (poset) ''P'' is said to satisfy the '''ascending chain condition''' (ACC) if no (infinite) strictly ascending sequence 
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; a_3 &lt; \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
of elements of ''P'' exists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hazewinkel&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Hazewinkel| first = Michiel| title = Encyclopaedia of Mathematics| publisher = Kluwer| isbn = 1-55608-010-7 | page = 580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Equivalently,&lt;ref group=note&gt;Proof: first, a strictly increasing sequence cannot stabilize, obviously. Conversely, suppose there is an ascending sequence that does not stabilize; then clearly it contains a strictly increasing (necessarily infinite) subsequence. Notice the proof does not use the full force of the axiom of choice.{{clarify|reason=But still relies on the [[axiom of dependent choice]]?|date=October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; given any weakly ascending sequence
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq \cdots,&lt;/math&gt;
of elements of ''P'' there exists a positive [[integer]] ''n'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} = \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, ''P'' is said to satisfy the '''descending chain condition''' (DCC) if there is no [[infinite descending chain]] of elements of ''P''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hazewinkel&quot;/&gt; Equivalently, every weakly descending sequence
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 \geq a_2 \geq a_3 \geq \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
of elements of ''P'' eventually stabilizes.

=== Comments ===
* The descending chain condition on ''P'' is equivalent to ''P'' being [[well-founded]]: every nonempty subset of ''P'' has a minimal element (also called the '''minimal condition''' or '''minimum condition''').{{clarify|reason=According to the 4th item, and to the article 'Infinite descending chain', equivalence requires the axiom of choice.|date=May 2018}}
* Similarly, the ascending chain condition is equivalent to ''P'' being converse well-founded: every nonempty subset of ''P'' has a maximal element (the '''maximal condition''' or '''maximum condition''').
* Trivially every finite poset satisfies both ACC and DCC.
* A [[total order|totally ordered set]] that satisfies the descending chain condition is a [[well-order|well-ordered set]] (assuming the [[axiom of dependent choice]]).
