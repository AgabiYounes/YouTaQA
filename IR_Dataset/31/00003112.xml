The launcher was to be developed for the purpose of sending [[Commercial use of space#Satellites and equipment|commercial satellites]] into [[geosynchronous orbit]] with a family of Ariane [[launch vehicle]]s.&lt;ref name=harvey2003/&gt;{{rp|161–166}}
[[Government of France|France]] was the largest stakeholder in the Ariane [[new product development|development]] programme.&lt;ref name=harvey2003/&gt;{{rp|166}}

Immediately following the successful [[maiden flight|first test launch]] of an [[Ariane 1]] on 24 December 1979, The French space agency [[CNES]] and ESA created a new company—''Arianespace''—for the purpose of promoting, marketing, and managing Ariane operations.&lt;ref name=harvey2003/&gt;{{rp|169}} Three addition test flights were carried out, with one failure and two more successes. The first commercial launch took place on 10 September 1982, and ended in failure when a [[turbopump]] failed in the third stage.&lt;ref name=harvey2003/&gt;{{rp|170–172}} The six remaining flights of Ariane 1 were successful, with the final flight occurring in February 1986.

On 21 October 2011 Arianespace [[Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre#Inaugural flight|launched the first Soyuz rocket]] ever from outside former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] territory. The payload consisted of two [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] navigation satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interspacenews.com/tabid/130/Arianespace_Launches_First_European_Soyuz.aspx?id=7475 |title=Arianespace Launches First European Soyuz |publisher=Interspacenews.com |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Arianespace shareholding was restructured due to the creation of [[Airbus Safran Launchers]] (later renamed ArianeGroup), which is tasked with developing and manufacturing the [[Ariane 6]] carrier rocket. Industrial groups [[Airbus]] and [[Safran]] pooled their shares along with the French government's [[CNES]] stake to form a partnership company holding just under 74% of Arianespace shares, while the remaining 26% is spread across suppliers in nine countries including further Airbus subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2015/06/10/le-gouvernement-privatise-arianespace_4650837_3234.html |title=Le gouvernement privatise Arianespace |language=fr |trans-title=Government privatizes Arianespace |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |first=Dominique |last=Gallois |date=10 June 2015 |access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition and pricing==
{{main|Space launch market competition}}

In 2004, Arianespace held more than 50% of the world market for boosting satellites to [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The European Union|author=John McCormick|pages=[https://archive.org/details/europeanunionpol0000mcco_d3k0/page/273 273]|publisher=[[Westview Press]]|edition=3rd|isbn=978-0-8133-4202-3|date=2004|url=https://archive.org/details/europeanunionpol0000mcco_d3k0/page/273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the disruptive force represented by the new sector entrant [[SpaceX]] forced Arianespace to cut back on its workforce and focus on cost-cutting to decrease costs to remain competitive against the new low-cost entrant in the launch sector.

According to an Arianespace managing director, &quot;It's quite clear there's a very significant challenge coming from [[SpaceX]],&quot; he said in 2015. &quot;Therefore things have to change … and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined.&quot;&lt;ref name=SMH-2015-05-19&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/business/nbn-launcher-arianespace-to-cut-jobs-and-costs-to-fight-spacex-20150519-gh4i4x.html |title= NBN launcher Arianespace to cut jobs and costs to fight SpaceX |date= 19 May 2015 |author= David Ramli |publisher= The Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of [[competition (economics)|pricing pressure]] from U.S. company [[SpaceX]], Arianespace made a November 2013 announcement of pricing flexibility for the &quot;lighter satellites&quot; it carries to [[Geostationary transfer orbit|Geostationary]] orbits aboard its Ariane 5.&lt;ref name=CASBAA2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20131125&gt;
{{cite news |last=de Selding|first=Peter B. |title=SpaceX Challenge Has Arianespace Rethinking Pricing Policies |url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/launch-report/38331spacex-challenge-has-arianespace-rethinking-pricing-policies |accessdate=2013-11-27 |newspaper=Space News |date=2013-11-25 |quote=''The Arianespace commercial launch consortium is telling its customers it is open to reducing the cost of flights for lighter satellites on the Ariane 5 rocket in response to the challenge posed by SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, Arianespace was considering requesting additional subsidies from European governments to face the competition from SpaceX and unfavorable changes in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate. The company had halved subsidy support by €100m per year since 2002 but the fall in the value of the US Dollar meant Arianespace was losing €60m per year due to currency fluctuations on launch contracts.&lt;ref name=aw20140211&gt;{{cite news |last=Svitak|first=Amy |title=Arianespace To ESA: We Need Help |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/Article.aspx?id=/article-xml/awx_02_11_2014_p0-663010.xml |accessdate=2014-02-12 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=2014-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing the cost allowed Arianespace to sign four additional contracts in September 2014 for lower slots on an [[Ariane 5 SYLDA]] dispenser for the satellites that otherwise could be flown on a SpaceX launch vehicle.

Arianespace signed 11 contracts in 2014 until September that year. with two additional being in a late stage of negotiations. {{As of|2014|September}} Arianespace has a backlog of launches worth {{Euro|4.5}} billion with 38 satellites to be launched on [[Ariane 5]], 7 on [[Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre|Soyuz]] and 9 on [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]], claiming 60% of the global satellite launch market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1409/08ariane5contracts/|title=Arianespace nets four commercial launch contracts|date=8 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2014/9-8-2014-Euroconsult2014.asp|title=World Satellite Business Week 2014: A rich harvest of contracts for Arianespace|date=8 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2014/09/08/europes-arianespace-claims-60-of-the-commercial-launch-market/|title=Europe's Arianespace Claims 60% Of The Commercial Launch Market|date=9 September 2014|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2014, SpaceX had &quot;already begun to take market share&quot;&lt;ref name=sn20141120/&gt; from Arianespace, and [[Eutelsat]] CEO [[Michel de Rosen]] — a major customer of Arianespace — said that &quot;Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through [[economies of scale]].&quot;&lt;ref name=sn20141120/&gt;

===Ariane launch vehicles===
{{Main|Ariane (rocket family)}}
Since the first launch in 1979, there have been several versions of the Ariane [[launch vehicle]]:

* [[Ariane 1]], first successful launch on December 24, 1979
* [[Ariane 2]], first successful launch on November 20, 1987 ''(the first launch on May 30, 1986 failed)''
* [[Ariane 3]], first successful launch on August 4, 1984
* [[Ariane 4]], first successful launch on June 15, 1988
* [[Ariane 5]], first successful launch on October 30, 1997 ''(the first launch on June 4, 1996 failed)''.
The new [[Ariane 6]] vehicle is in development. It would have a similar payload capacity to the Ariane 5 but have considerably lower costs. Tentatively, its first flight is planned for 2020.
