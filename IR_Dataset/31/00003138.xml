The city serves as the cultural and economic center of the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], home to 5.9 million people and the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|ninth largest metropolitan area]] in the nation.&lt;ref name=PopEstCBSA/&gt; Atlanta is the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], the most populous county in Georgia.

Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus  of a major state-sponsored railroad. With rapid expansion, however, it soon became the convergence point among multiple railroads, spurring its rapid growth. The city's name derives from that of the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]]'s local depot, signifying the town's growing reputation as a transportation hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Atlanta |url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/atlanta#Population-Patterns |website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], the city was almost entirely burned to the ground in [[General William T. Sherman]]'s famous [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]. However, the city rose from its ashes and quickly became a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the &quot;[[New South]]&quot;.  During the 1950s and 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with Dr. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Ralph David Abernathy]], and many other locals playing major roles in the movement's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/jun/28/al-roker/whos-right-cities-lay-claim-civil-rights-cradle-ma/ |title=&quot;Who's right?

The Atlanta area was first settled by the Creek and Cherokee tribes to trade with the English.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=P0RFP4LX6nEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=atlanta+cherokee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=atlanta%20cherokee&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western and Atlantic Railroad===
[[File:Marietta-Street-Atlanta.jpg|thumb|left|Marietta Street, 1864]]

In 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad in order to provide a link between the port of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;W&amp;ARR&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Creation of the Western and Atlantic Railroad |work=About North Georgia |publisher=Golden Ink |url = http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html |access-date=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial route was to run southward from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] to a terminus east of the Chattahoochee River, which would be linked to Savannah. After engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the &quot;zero milepost&quot; was driven into the ground in what is now [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]]. A year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as ''Terminus'', and later ''Thrasherville'', after a local merchant who built homes and a [[general store]] in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThrashervilleHistoricalMarker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrasherville|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/fulton/thrasherville|website=Georgia Info|access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed ''[[Marthasville, Georgia|Marthasville]]'' to honor Governor [[Wilson Lumpkin|Wilson Lumpkin's]] daughter Martha. Later, [[J. Edgar Thomson]], Chief Engineer of the [[Georgia Railroad]], suggested the town be renamed ''Atlanta''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGEAtlanta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrose|first1=Andy|title=Atlanta|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/atlanta#Population-Patterns|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|publisher=Georgia Humanities Council|access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/date/December_29|title=Georgia History Timeline Chronology for December&amp;nbsp;29 |publisher=Our Georgia History |access-date=August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil War ===

By 1860, Atlanta's population had grown to 9,554.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Storey |first = Steve |title = Atlanta &amp; West Point Railroad |publisher=Georgia's Railroad History &amp; Heritage |url = http://railga.com/atlwp.html |access-date=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Atlanta Old and New: 1848 to 1868 |work=Roadside Georgia |publisher=Golden Ink |url = http://roadsidegeorgia.com/city/atlanta02.html |access-date=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], the nexus of multiple railroads in Atlanta made the city a strategic hub for the distribution of military supplies.

In 1864, the [[Union Army]] moved southward following the capture of Chattanooga and began its [[Atlanta campaign|invasion of north Georgia]]. The region surrounding Atlanta was the location of several major army [[battle]]s, culminating with the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and a four-month-long siege of the city by the Union Army under the command of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. On September 1, 1864, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] made the decision to retreat from Atlanta, and he ordered the destruction of all public buildings and possible assets that could be of use to the Union Army. On the next day, Mayor [[James Calhoun (politician, born 1811)|James Calhoun]] surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, Sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, Sherman prepared for the Union Army's [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] by ordering the destruction of Atlanta's remaining military assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwarlibrary.org/sherman-s-march-chronology.html|title=Chronology of Sherman's March to the sea, the Carolina's Campaign, and Its Aftermath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebuilding the city===
After the Civil War ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt. The work attracted many new residents. Due to the city's superior [[rail transportation]] network, the [[List of U.S. state historical capitals|state capital]] was moved from [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] to Atlanta in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Edwin L. |title=The Story of Georgia's Capitols and Capital Cities |publisher=Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia |url=http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 |access-date=November 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009145856/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm |archivedate=October 9, 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880 Census, Atlanta had surpassed Savannah as Georgia's largest city.

Beginning in the 1880s, [[Henry W. Grady]], the editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' newspaper, promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the &quot;[[New South]]&quot; that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. By 1885, the founding of the Georgia School of Technology (now [[History of Georgia Tech|Georgia Tech]]) and the [[Atlanta University Center]], a [[historically black college]] made up of units for men and women, had established Atlanta as a center for higher education. In 1895, Atlanta hosted the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]], which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New South's development to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/06/08/102515577.pdf|title=The South: Vast Resources, Rapid Development, Wonderful Opportunities for Capital and Labor ...|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 8, 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumb|left|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles.]]

During the first decades of the 20th century, Atlanta enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth. In three decades' time, Atlanta's population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs. The city's skyline grew taller with the construction of the [[Equitable Building (Atlanta 1892)|Equitable]], [[Flatiron Building (Atlanta)|Flatiron]], [[J. Mack Robinson College of Business Administration Building|Empire]], and [[Candler Building (Atlanta)|Candler]] buildings.  [[Sweet Auburn]] emerged as a center of black commerce. The period was also marked by strife and tragedy. Increased racial tensions led to the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906, when whites attacked blacks, leaving at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured, with extensive damage in black neighborhoods. In 1913, [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish-American factory superintendent, was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old girl in a highly publicized trial. He was sentenced to death but the governor commuted his sentence to life. An enraged and organized [[Lynching|lynch mob]] took him from jail in 1915 and hanged him in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]. The Jewish community in Atlanta and across the country were horrified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Atlanta |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/atlanta |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klapper, Melissa, R., PhD. &quot;[http://www.teachinghistory.org/history-content/beyond-the-textbook/25059 20th-Century Jewish Immigration]&quot;. [http://www.teachinghistory.org/ Teachinghistory.org], accessed February 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 1917, the [[Great Atlanta Fire of 1917|Great Atlanta Fire]] destroyed 1,938 buildings in what is now the [[Old Fourth Ward]], resulting in one fatality and the displacement of 10,000 people.&lt;ref name=NGEAtlanta/&gt;

On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the [[premiere]] of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta's [[Margaret Mitchell]]. The gala event at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]] was attended by the film's legendary producer, [[David O. Selznick]], and the film's stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], and [[Olivia de Havilland]], but Oscar winner [[Hattie McDaniel]], an African-American actress, was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/Atlanta_Premiere_of_Gone_With_The_Wind |title=Atlanta Premiere of Gone with the Wind |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |access-date=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan area's growth===
Atlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during [[World War II]] due to the city's war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network and military bases. The defense industries attracted thousands of new residents and generated revenues, resulting in rapid population and economic growth. In the 1950s, the city's newly constructed highway system, supported by federal subsidies, allowed middle class Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. As a result, the city began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population.&lt;ref name=NGEAtlanta/&gt;

===Civil rights movement===
African-American veterans returned from World War II seeking full rights in their country and began heightened activism. In exchange for support by that portion of the black community that could vote, in 1948 the mayor ordered the hiring of the first eight African-American police officers in the city. In the 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the [[civil rights movement]], with Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Ralph David Abernathy]], and students from Atlanta's [[historically black colleges and universities]] playing major roles in the movement's leadership. While Atlanta in the postwar years had relatively minimal racial strife compared to other cities, blacks were limited by discrimination, segregation, and continued [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of most voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;kruse&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5763Zgu4_oC&amp;lpg=PP1 |title=White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism|author=Kevin Michael Kruse|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=February 1, 2008|isbn=978-0-691-09260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the city attempted to thwart [[blockbusting]] by realtors by erecting road barriers in [[Cascade Heights]], &lt;!-- How was this supposed to work? --&gt;countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the &quot;city too busy to hate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kruse&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874660,00.html |title=&quot;The South: Divided City&quot;, ''Time'' magazine, January 18, 1961 |work=TIME |date=January 18, 1963 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 Summer Olympic Games===
[[File:JO Atlanta 1996 - Drapeau.jpg|thumb|The Olympic flag waves at the 1996 games.|alt=|left]]

Atlanta was selected as the site for the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]]. Following the [[Bids for the 1996 Summer Olympics|announcement]], the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve Atlanta's parks, sporting venues, and transportation infrastructure. While the games were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies, as well as the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Olympic Games Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., 1996|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-249564/Olympic-Games|access-date=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the spectacle was a watershed event in Atlanta's history. The related projects such as [[Atlanta's Olympic Legacy Program]] and civic effort initiated a fundamental transformation of the city in the following decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;

===2000 to present===
During the 2000s, Atlanta underwent a profound physical, [[human culture|cultural]], and [[demographics|demographic]] transformation. As some of the black middle and upper classes also began to move to the suburbs, a booming economy drew numerous new migrants from other areas of the country, who contributed to changes in the city's demographics. African Americans made up a decreasing portion of the population, from a high of 67% in 1990 to 54% in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;spelman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spelman.edu/academics/enrichment/census/pdf/cicnewsletterjan2009vs2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208211609/http://www.spelman.edu/academics/enrichment/census/pdf/cicnewsletterjan2009vs2.pdf |archive-date=December 8, 2011 |title=The U.S. Census in the Past and Present|author=Tiffany Davis, B.A.|publisher=Spelman College|date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 to 2010, Atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, 5,142 Asian residents, and 3,095 Hispanic residents, while the city's black population decreased by 31,678.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.ajc.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim |last=Galloway |url=http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2011/03/23/a-census-speeds-atlanta-toward-racially-neutral-ground/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140913094510/http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2011/03/23/a-census-speeds-atlanta-toward-racially-neutral-ground/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2014 |title=A census speeds Atlanta toward racially neutral ground |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=March 23, 2011 |access-date=July 16, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-031106&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times |first=Shaila |last=Dewan |date=March 11, 2006 |title=Gentrification Changing Face of New Atlanta |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/11/national/11atlanta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the city's demographic change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the [[Intown Atlanta|three-mile radius]] surrounding [[Downtown Atlanta]] gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 and holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-01-1Ayoungrestless01_ST_N.htm |work=USA Today |title=Urban centers draw more young, educated adults |date=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was similar to the tendency in other cities for young, college educated, single or married couples to live in downtown areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider |first=Craig |url=http://www.atlantadowntown.com/article/young-professionals-lead-surge-of-intown-living |title=Young professionals lead surge of intown living |publisher=ajc.com |date=April 13, 2011 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-fifths of previous public housing residents attained new housing in such units; the remainder received vouchers to be used at other units, including in suburbs. At the same time, in an effort to change the culture of those receiving subsidized housing, the AHA imposed a requirement for such residents to work (or be enrolled in a genuine, limited-time training program). It is virtually the only housing authority to have created this requirement. To prevent problems, the AHA also gave authority to management of the mixed-income or voucher units to evict tenants who did not comply with the work requirement or who caused behavior problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;husock&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, the city approved the $2.8 billion [[BeltLine]] project.

Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. Yet architecturally, the city had never been traditionally &quot;southern&quot; because Atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a southern seaport dominated by the planter class, such as [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] or [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Because of its later development, many of the city's landmarks share architectural characteristics with buildings in the Northeast or Midwest, as they were designed at a time of shared national architectural styles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gournay&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=AIA Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta|last=Gournay|first=Isabelle|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn = 0820314501|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of the 1980s, Atlanta became one of the early adopters of postmodern designs that reintroduced classical elements to the cityscape. Many of Atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as the {{convert|1,187,676|ft2|m2|adj=on}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Atlantic Center|url=https://www.credifi.com/ui/freemium/propertydetails/1201-W-Peachtree-St-Atlanta-GA/568500fdfbffa90cf4b40d57|website=CrediFi|accessdate=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[One Atlantic Center]] (1987), [[191 Peachtree Tower]] (1991), and the [[Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta]] (1992).

Downtown Atlanta contains the most office space in the metro area, much of it occupied by government entities. Downtown is home to the city's sporting venues and many of its tourist attractions. [[Midtown Atlanta]] is the city's second-largest business district, containing the offices of many of the region's law firms.

In southwest Atlanta, neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs, including the historic [[West End (Atlanta)|West End]], while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout.

Gentrification of the city's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta. The [[gentrification of Atlanta]] has its origins in the 1970s, after many of Atlanta's neighborhoods had declined and suffered the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th century. When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|freeways]] from being built through the city's east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's [[gentrification]]. After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990, gentrification expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. New development post-2000 has been aided by the [[Atlanta Housing Authority]]'s eradication of the city's public housing. As noted above, it allowed development of these sites for mixed-income housing, requiring developers to reserve a considerable portion for affordable housing units. It has also provided for other former residents to be given vouchers to gain housing in other areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;husock&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_4_atlanta-public-housing.html |title=Atlanta's Public-Housing Revolution |last=Husock |first=Howard |work=City Journal |date= Autumn 2010|access-date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the Beltline has stimulated new and related development along its path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Powers |first=Benjamin |url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/11/putting-the-brakes-on-runaway-gentrification-in-atlanta/545555/ |title=Putting the Brakes on Runaway Gentrification in Atlanta |work=[[CityLab (web magazine)|CityLab]] |date=November 10, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 Census, Atlanta was recorded as the nation's fourth-largest majority-black city.  The [[New Great Migration]] has brought an insurgence of African Americans from the [[West Coast of the United States|West]] and [[Northern United States|North]] to the Atlanta area.&lt;ref&gt;https://lawrencemigration.phillipscollection.org/culture/migration-map&lt;/ref&gt; It has long been known as a center of African-American political power, education, economic prosperity, and culture, often called a [[black mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A CHAMPION FOR ATLANTA: Maynard Jackson: 'Black mecca' burgeoned under leader&quot;, ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', June 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;the city that calls itself America's 'Black Mecca{{'&quot;}} in &quot;Atlanta Is Less Than Festive on Eve of Another 'Freaknik{{'&quot;}}, ''Washington Post'', April 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/us/atlanta-emerges-as-a-center-of-black-entertainment.html &quot;Atlanta emerges as a center of black entertainment&quot;], ''New York Times'', November 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Some middle and upper class [[African Americans in Atlanta|African-American residents of Atlanta]] followed an influx of whites to newer housing and public schools in the suburbs in the early 21st century.

At the same time, the white population of Atlanta has increased. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of whites in the city's population grew faster than in any other U.S. city.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In that decade, Atlanta's white population grew from 31% to 38% of the city's population, an absolute increase of 22,753 people, more than triple the increase that occurred between 1990 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurwitt |first=Rob |url=http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/Atlanta-and-the-Urban.html |title=Atlanta and the Urban Future|work=Governing Magazine |publisher=Governing.com |date=July 1, 2008 |access-date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religion in Atlanta]], while historically centered on [[Protestant Christianity]], now encompasses many faiths, as a result of the city and metro area's increasingly international population.

Atlanta started as a railroad town, and [[logistics]] has been a major component of the city's economy to this day. Atlanta serves as an important rail junction and contains major [[classification yard]]s for [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]. Since its construction in the 1950s, [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] has served as a key engine of the city's economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Frederick |title=Atlanta Rising |year=1996 |publisher=Longstreet Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn=1-56352-296-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delta Air Lines, the city's largest employer and the metro area's third-largest, operates the world's largest airline hub at Hartsfield-Jackson, and it has helped make it the [[world's busiest airport]], in terms of both passenger traffic and aircraft operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce]] |title = Atlanta's top employers, 2006 |url=http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/business/img/TopEmployers2006.pdf |accessdate=August 8, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225123824/http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/business/img/TopEmployers2006.pdf |archivedate = February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to the airport, Atlanta has been also a hub for diplomatic missions; {{As of|2017|lc=y}}, the city contains [[List of diplomatic missions in Atlanta|26 consulates general]], the seventh-highest concentration of diplomatic missions in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consulates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSULAR OFFICES|url=http://www.georgia.org/business-resources/international-relations/consular-offices/|website=Georgia.org|publisher=Georgia Department of Economic Development|accessdate=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207112711/http://www.georgia.org/business-resources/international-relations/consular-offices/|archive-date=February 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media is also an important aspect of Atlanta's economy. In fact, the city is even a major [[cable TV|cable television]] programming center.

Information technology—a business sector that includes publishing, software development, entertainment and data processing—has garnered a larger percentage of Atlanta's economic output. Atlanta has, indeed, been nicknamed the &quot;[[Silicon peach]]&quot; thanks to its burgeoning technology sector. {{As of|2013}}, Atlanta contains the fourth-largest concentration of information technology jobs in the US, numbering 85,000+. The city also is ranked as the sixth fastest-growing community for information technology jobs, with an employment growth of 4.8% in 2012 and a three-year growth near 9%, or 16,000 jobs.

This is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S., in addition to many recent [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the U.S.]] who have made the metropolitan area their home, establishing Atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly [[Multi-culturalism|multi-cultural]] metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;18.6% of City of Atlanta born in US outside South and 8.0% foreign born (compare to 7.1%/3.0% for Macon, GA and 7.7%/3.2% for Birmingham, AL): [https://web.archive.org/web/20110211074220/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml PLACE OF BIRTH BY CITIZENSHIP STATUS, 2010 ACS 1-year estimates, U.S. Census American Fact Finder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garner |first1=Marcus K. |last2=Schneider |first2=Craig |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/foreign-born-population-continues-780806.html |title=Foreign-born population continues to grow in metro Atlanta |newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=December 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221101715/http://www.ajc.com/news/foreign-born-population-continues-780806.html |archive-date=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although traditional Southern culture is part of Atlanta's cultural fabric, it is mostly the backdrop to one of the nation's most cosmopolitan cities.

Atlanta has played a major or contributing role in the development of various genres of American music at different points in the city's history.
