{{Refimprove|date=January 2009}}
'''Axiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀξία|ἀξία]]}}, ''axia'', &quot;value, worth&quot;; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[value (ethics)|value]]. It is either the collective term for [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapie|first=Paul|title=Logique de la volonté|url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_87792|year=1902|publisher=F. Alcan|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotaste.com/axiology-and-aesthetics/|title=Axiology and aesthetics - article|website=www.infotaste.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eduard von Hartmann]], in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hartmann|first=Eduard|title=Grundriss der Axiologie|year=1908|publisher=Hermann Haacke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Hart. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology—Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot; in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;harmony.&quot; '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[science of value]].

==History==
Between the 5th and 6th centuries BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[Socrates]] believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated70&quot;&gt;Arneson, P.
