An '''afterglow''' is a broad arch of whitish or pinkish [[sunlight]] in the [[sky]] that is [[light scattering|scattered]] by fine [[particulates]], like [[dust]], suspended in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. An afterglow may appear above the highest [[cloud]]s in the hour of fading [[twilight]] or be [[reflection (optics)|reflected]] off high [[snow]]fields in [[mountain]] regions long after [[sunset]]. The particles produce a [[scattering]] effect upon the component parts of [[Electromagnetic spectrum#Visible radiation (light)|white light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wordacross.com/answer/afterglow |title=Afterglow |publisher=Word Across |access-date=2019-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite of an afterglow is a '''foreglow''', which occurs before [[sunrise]].

True [[alpenglow]], which occurs long after sunset or long before sunrise, is caused by the [[backscatter]]ing of red sunlight by [[aerosols]] and fine dust particles low in the atmosphere. After sunset, alpenglow is an afterglow caused by the illumination of atmospheric particles by sunlight as it gets [[refraction|refracted]] and [[Rayleigh scattering|scattered]] through the Earth's atmosphere.

The [[energy of light|high-energy]] and [[high-frequency]] light is [[scattering of electromagnetic radiation|scattered]] out the most, while the remaining low-energy and -frequency light reaches the observer on the [[horizon]] at [[twilight]]. The backscattering of this light further turns it pinkish to reddish. This period of time is referred to as [[blue hour]] and is widely treasured by [[photographers]] and [[painters]].{{fact|date=September 2019}}

The afterglow persists until the [[Earth's shadow]] ([[terminator (solar)|terminator]] line) overtakes the sky above the observer as night falls and the stars appear, with [[Venus]] (the second-brightest [[celestial object]] after the Moon in the [[night sky]]) visible above the horizon opposite of the [[Belt of Venus]] around the [[antisolar point]].

After the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|1883 eruption]] of the [[volcano]] [[Krakatoa]], a remarkable series of red [[sunset]]s appeared worldwide. An enormous amount of exceedingly fine dust were blown to a great height by the volcano's explosion, and then globally diffused by the high atmospheric winds. [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]'' possibly depicts an afterglow during this period.
