The '''AGM-65 Maverick''' is an [[air-to-ground missile]] (AGM) designed for [[close air support]]. It is the most widely produced precision-guided missile in the Western world,&lt;ref name=&quot;PDF_2001&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poweredmodelairplanes.com/pma/a10/maverick04.pdf|title=AGM-65 Maverick|publisher=Raytheon|year=2001|accessdate=22 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104071216/http://www.poweredmodelairplanes.com/pma/a10/maverick04.pdf|archivedate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is effective against a wide range of [[Military tactics|tactical]] targets, including [[Armour|armor]], air defenses, [[ship]]s, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities.

Development began in 1966 at [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]] as the first missile to use an electronic [[contrast seeker]]. It entered service with the [[United States Air Force]] in August 1972. Since then, it has been exported to more than 30 countries and is certified on 25 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ray_PDF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/cms01_055755.pdf|title=AGM-65 Maverick|publisher=Raytheon|year=2007|accessdate=22 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728105311/http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/stellent/groups/public/documents/content/cms01_055755.pdf|archivedate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maverick served during the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], [[Yom Kippur War|Yom Kippur]], [[Iran–Iraq War|Iran–Iraq]], and [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]s, along with other smaller conflicts, destroying enemy forces and installations with varying degrees of success.

Since its introduction into service, numerous Maverick versions had been designed and produced using electro-optical, [[Laser guidance|laser]], and [[Infrared homing#Imaging systems|imaging infrared]] [[guidance system]]s. The AGM-65 has two types of warhead: one has a contact fuze in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its kinetic energy before detonating. The missile is currently produced by [[Raytheon Missile Systems]].

The Maverick shares the same configuration as Hughes's [[AIM-4 Falcon]] and [[AIM-54 Phoenix]], and measures more than {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} in length and {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter.

==Development==
The Maverick's development history began in 1965, when the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) began a program to develop a replacement to the [[AGM-12 Bullpup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clancy_p163&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Clancy|1995|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a range of {{convert|8.8|nmi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}, the radio-guided Bullpup was introduced in 1959 and was considered a &quot;silver bullet&quot; by operators. However, the launch aircraft was required to fly straight towards the target during the missile's flight instead of performing evasive maneuvers, thus risking the crew.&lt;ref name=Clancy_p163/&gt; Even when it hit, the small {{convert|250|lbs}} warhead was only useful against small targets like bunkers, when used against larger targets like the [[Thanh Hóa Bridge]] it did little other than char the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin |last=Lambeth |title=The Transformation of American Air Power |url=https://archive.org/details/transformationof00lamb |url-access=registration |date=2000 |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/transformationof00lamb/page/39 39] |isbn=0801438160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USAF began a series of projects to replace Bullpup, both larger versions of Bullpup, models C and D, as well as a series of Bullpup adaptations offering fire-and-forget guidance. Among the latter were the [[AGM-83 Bulldog]], [[AGM-79 Blue Eye]] and [[AGM-80 Viper]].

From 1966 to 1968, [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes Missile Systems Division]] and [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] competed for the contract to build an entirely new fire-and-forget missile with far greater range performance than any of the Bullpup versions. Each were allocated $3&amp;nbsp;million for preliminary design and engineering work of the Maverick in 1966.&lt;ref name=FI_AGM/&gt; In 1968, Hughes emerged with the $95&amp;nbsp;million contract for further development and testing of the missile; at the same time, contract options called for 17,000 missiles to be procured.&lt;ref name=FI_AGM/&gt; Hughes conducted a smooth development of the AGM-65 Maverick, with the first unguided test launch from a F-4 on 18 September 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Maverick Under Control |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%202966.html |journal=Flight International |date=9 October 1969 |page=582 |access-date=22 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925084022/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1969/1969%20-%202966.html |archive-date=25 September 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first guided test on 18 December successfully performing a direct hit on a [[M41 Walker Bulldog|M41 tank]] target at the Air Force Missile Development Center at [[Holloman Air Force Base]], [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=FI_AGM/&gt;

In July 1971, the USAF and Hughes signed a $69.9&amp;nbsp;million contract for 2,000 missiles,&lt;ref name=FI_AGM/&gt; the first of which was delivered in 1972.&lt;ref name=Clancy_p163/&gt; Although early operational results were favorable, military planners predicted that the Maverick would fare less successfully in the hazy conditions of [[Central Europe]], where it would have been used against [[Warsaw Pact]] forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clancy_p164&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Clancy|1995|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, development of the AGM-65B &quot;Scene Magnified&quot; version began in 1975 before it was delivered during the late 1970s. When production of the AGM-65A/B was ended in 1978, more than 35,000 missiles had been built.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;

More versions of the Maverick appeared, among which was the [[Laser guidance|laser-guided]] AGM-65C/E. Development of the AGM-65C started in 1978 by [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]], who built a number of development missiles for the USAF.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clancy_p164/&gt; Due to high cost, the version was not procured by the USAF, and instead entered service with the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC) as the AGM-65E.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clancy_p164/&gt;

Another major development was the AGM-65D, which employed an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker.  By imaging on radiated heat, the IIR is all-weather operable as well as showing improved performance in acquiring and tracking the hot engines, such as in tanks and trucks, that were to be one of its major missions.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; The seekerhead mechanically scanned the scene over a nitrogen-cooled 4-by-4 pixel array using a series of mirrored facets machined into the inner surface of the ring-shaped main gyroscope.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The five-year development period of the AGM-65D started in 1977 and ended with the first delivery to the USAF in October 1983.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; The version received [[initial operating capability]] in February 1986.&lt;ref name=Factsheet/&gt;

The AGM-65F is a hybrid Maverick combining the AGM-65D's IIR seeker and warhead and propulsion components of the AGM-65E.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; Deployed by the [[United States Navy]] (USN), the AGM-65F is optimized for maritime strike roles.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; The first AGM-65F launch from the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C]] took place in 1989, and in 1994, the USN awarded [[Unisys]] a contract to integrate the version with the P-3C.&lt;ref name=PDF_2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman_p562/&gt; Meanwhile, Hughes produced the AGM-65G, which essentially has the same guidance system as the D, with some software modifications that track larger targets.&lt;ref name=Factsheet/&gt;

In the mid-1990s to early 2000s, there were several ideas of enhancing the Maverick's potential. Among them was the stillborn plan to incorporate the Maverick [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter wave]] [[active radar homing]], which can determine the exact shape of a target.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clancy_p166&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Clancy|1995|p=166.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study called &quot;Longhorn Project&quot;&lt;ref name=Clancy_p166/&gt; was conducted by Hughes, and later Raytheon following the absorption of Hughes into Raytheon, looked a Maverick version equipped with [[turbojet]] engines instead of rocket motors. The &quot;Maverick ER&quot;, as it was dubbed, would have a &quot;significant increase in range&quot; compared to the Maverick's current range of {{Convert|25|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;TurboMav&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Paul|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2002/2002%20-%201286.html|title=Raytheon considers turbojet as part of Maverick missile upgrade package|date=30 April – 6 May 2002|accessdate=21 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408220533/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/2002/2002%20-%201286.html|archivedate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was abandoned, but if the Maverick ER had entered production, it would have replaced the [[Penguin (missile)|AGM-119B Penguin]] carried on the MH-60R.&lt;ref name=TurboMav/&gt;
{{Image frame|width=200|content=[[File:AGM-65 M-48 pre impact.jpg|220px]]&lt;br&gt;[[File:AGM-65 M-48 post impact.jpg|220px]]|caption=An AGM-65 test-fired against an [[M48 Patton|M48]] tank (1978)}}

The most modern versions of the Maverick are the AGM-65H/K, which were in production {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=Factsheet/&gt; The AGM-65H was developed by coupling the AGM-65B with a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) seeker optimized for desert operations and which has three times the range of the original TV-sensor;&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=TurboMav/&gt; a parallel USN program aimed at rebuilding AGM-65Fs with newer CCD seekers resulted in the AGM-65J.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; The AGM-65K, meanwhile, was developed by replacing the AGM-65G's IR guidance system with an electro-optical television guidance system.&lt;ref name=Factsheet/&gt;

==Design==
The Maverick has a [[modular design]], allowing for different combinations of the guidance package and warhead to be attached to the rocket motor to produce a different weapon.&lt;ref name=Factsheet/&gt; It has long-[[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] [[delta wing]]s and a cylindrical body, reminiscent of the [[AIM-4 Falcon]] and the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]].&lt;ref name=B&amp;M_230/&gt;

Different models of the AGM-65 have used electro-optical, laser, and imaging infrared guidance systems. The AGM-65 has two types of [[warhead]]: one has a [[contact fuze]] in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its [[kinetic energy]] before detonating. The latter is most effective against large, hard targets. The propulsion system for both types is a [[solid-fuel rocket]] motor behind the warhead.&lt;ref name=Factsheet/&gt;

The Maverick missile is unable to lock onto targets on its own; it has to be given input by the pilot or [[weapon systems officer]] (WSO) after which it follows the path to the target autonomously. In an [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt II]], for example, the video feed from the seeker head is relayed to a screen in the cockpit, where the pilot can check the locked target of the missile before launch. A crosshair on the [[heads-up display]] is shifted by the pilot to set the approximate target, where the missile will then automatically recognize and lock on to the target. Once the missile is launched, it requires no further assistance from the launch vehicle and tracks its target automatically. This [[fire-and-forget]] property is not shared by the E version that uses [[Laser guidance|semi-active laser homing]].&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;

* '''Maverick A''' is the basic model and uses an electro-optical television guidance system. No longer in U.S. service.
* '''Maverick B''' is similar to the A model, although the B model added optical zooming to lock onto small or distant targets.
* '''Maverick C''' was to be a laser-guided variant for the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC). It was canceled before production, however its requirement was later met by the Maverick E.
* '''Maverick D''' replaced the electro-optical guidance with an [[Thermographic camera|imaging infrared system]] which doubled the practical firing distance and allowed for its use at night and during bad weather. A reduced smoke rocket engine was also introduced in this model. It achieved its initial operation capability in 1983.
* '''Maverick E''' uses a laser designator guidance system optimized for fortified installations and heavier penetrating blast-fragmentation warhead ({{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} vs. {{convert|125|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}} in older models). It achieved IOC in 1985 and was used mainly by USMC aviation.
* '''Maverick F''', designed specially for [[United States Navy]], it uses a modified Maverick D infrared guidance system optimized for tracking ships fitted onto a Maverick-E body and warhead.
* '''Maverick G''' model essentially has the same guidance system as the D with some software modification that enables the pilot to track larger targets. The G model's major difference is its heavier penetrator warhead taken from the Maverick E, compared to the D model's [[shaped charge|shaped-charge warhead]]. It completed tests in 1988.
* '''Maverick H''' model is an AGM-65B/D missile upgraded with a new [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) seeker better suited for the desert environment.
* '''Maverick J''' model is a Navy AGM-65F missile upgraded with the new CCD seeker. However, this conversion is not confirmed.
* '''Maverick K''' model is an AGM-65G upgraded with the CCD seeker; at least 1,200, but possibly up to 2,500 AGM-65G rounds are planned for conversion to AGM-65K standard.&lt;ref name=ds /&gt;
* '''Maverick E2/L''' model incorporates a laser-guided seeker that allows for designation by the launch aircraft, another aircraft, or a ground source and can engage small, fast moving, and maneuvering targets on land and at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://raytheon.mediaroom.com/index.php?item=1886 U.S. Air Force Completes Developmental Testing of Raytheon Laser-Guided Maverick] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201803/http://raytheon.mediaroom.com/index.php?item=1886 |date=14 July 2014 }} – Raytheon news release, 9 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/singapore-air-show/2012-02-15/laser-maverick-missile-will-hit-pirates Laser Maverick Missile Will Hit Pirates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714132828/http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/singapore-air-show/2012-02-15/laser-maverick-missile-will-hit-pirates |date=14 July 2014 }} – Ainonline.com, 15 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
