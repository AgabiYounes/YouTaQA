The '''Commodore Amiga 1000''', also known as the '''A1000''' and originally marketed as the '''Amiga''', is the first [[personal computer]] released by [[Commodore International]] in the [[Amiga]] line. It combines the 16/32-bit [[Motorola 68000]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] which was powerful by 1985 standards with one of the most advanced graphics and sound systems in its class, and runs a [[preemptive multitasking]] [[operating system]] that fits into {{nowrap|256 KB}} of read-only memory&lt;ref name=inside9&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside the Amiga 1000 - Slideshow |date= |accessdate=2016-05-14 |url=https://www.computerworld.com.au/slideshow/351631/inside-amiga-1000/?image=9 |quote=The WCS included 256KB of memory used specifically to hold a basic OS that had to be loaded from a floppy disk at boot time.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=PC Magazine |date=October 22, 1996 |page=89|title=Inside Track |author=John C.

== Design ==
The A1000 has a number of characteristics that distinguish it from later Amiga models: It is the only model to feature the short-lived Amiga check-mark logo on its case, the majority of the case is elevated slightly to give a storage area for the keyboard when not in use (a &quot;keyboard garage&quot;), and the inside of the case is engraved with the signatures of the Amiga designers (similar to the [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]]); including [[Jay Miner]] and the paw print of his dog Mitchy. The A1000's case was designed by [[Howard Stolz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ism101/Winter05/abstracts/week1.html | title=ISM 101 Seminar: 13 January 2005 | work=USCS Engineering | accessdate=2009-03-14 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617144450/http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/classes/ism101/Winter05/abstracts/week1.html | archive-date=June 17, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Senior Industrial Designer at Commodore, Stolz was the mechanical lead and primary interface with [[Sanyo]] in Japan, the contract manufacturer for the A1000 casing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/howardstolz | title=Howard Stolz profile | work=Howard Stolz LinkedIn profile | accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amiga 1000 was manufactured in two variations:  One uses the [[NTSC]] television standard and the other uses the [[PAL]] television standard. The NTSC variant was the initial model manufactured and sold in [[North America]]. The later PAL model was manufactured in Germany and sold in countries using the PAL television standard. The first NTSC systems lack the [[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB video mode]] which is present in all later Amiga models.

Because [[AmigaOS]] was rather [[Software bug|buggy]] at the time of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM then. Instead, the A1000 includes a [[daughterboard]] with 256&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of RAM, dubbed the &quot;writable control store&quot; (WCS), into which the core of the operating system is loaded from floppy disk (this portion of the operating system is known as the &quot;[[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]]&quot;). The WCS is write-protected after loading, and system resets do not require a reload of the WCS. In Europe, the WCS was often referred to as WOM (Write Once Memory), a play on the more conventional term &quot;ROM&quot; ([[read-only memory]]).

== Technical information ==
The preproduction Amiga (which was codenamed &quot;Velvet&quot;) released to developers in early 1985 contained {{nowrap|128 KB}} of RAM with an option to expand it to {{nowrap|256 KB.}} Commodore later increased the system memory to {{nowrap|256 KB}} due to objections by the Amiga development team. The names of the custom chips were different; Denise and Paula were called Daphne and Portia respectively. The casing of the preproduction Amiga was almost identical to the production version: the main difference being an embossed Commodore logo in the top left corner. It did not have the developer signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amiga 1000 Developer &quot;Velvet&quot; - computer collection vienna ENG|url = http://scacom.bplaced.net/Collection/velvet/velveten.php|website = scacom.bplaced.net|accessdate = 2015-08-23|first = Stefan|last = Egger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amiga 1000 has a [[Motorola 68000]] CPU running at 7.15909&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] (on [[NTSC]] systems) or 7.09379&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[PAL]] systems), precisely double the video color [[carrier frequency]] for NTSC or 1.6 times the color carrier frequency for PAL. The system clock timings are derived from the video frequency, which simplifies [[glue logic]] and allows the Amiga&amp;nbsp;1000 to make do with a single [[crystal oscillator|crystal]]. In keeping with its video game heritage, the chipset was designed to synchronize CPU memory access and chipset [[direct memory access|DMA]] so the hardware runs in real time without wait-state delays.

Though most units were sold with an analog [[RGB color model|RGB]] monitor, the A1000 also has a built-in [[composite video]] output which allows the computer to be connected directly to some monitors other than their standard RGB monitor. The A1000 also has a &quot;TV MOD&quot; output, into which an RF Modulator can be plugged, allowing connection to a TV that was old enough not to even have a composite video input.

The original 68000 CPU can be directly replaced with a [[Motorola 68010]], which can execute instructions slightly faster than the 68000 but also introduces a small degree of software incompatibility. Third-party CPU upgrades, which mostly fit in the CPU socket, use faster successors 68020/68881 or 68030/68882 microprocessors and integrated memory. Such upgrades often have the option to revert to 68000 mode for full compatibility. Some boards have a socket to seat the original 68000, whereas the 68030 cards typically come with an on-board 68000.

The original Amiga&amp;nbsp;1000 is the only model to have 256&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Amiga Chip RAM]], which can be expanded to 512&amp;nbsp;KB with the addition of a [[daughterboard]] under a cover in the center front of the machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;a1000_intro&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/Amiga_1000_Introduction.pdf | title=Introduction to the Amiga | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | year=1986 | access-date=August 26, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613032259/http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/Amiga_1000_Introduction.pdf | archive-date=June 13, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} RAM may also be upgraded via official and third-party upgrades, with a practical upper limit of about 9&amp;nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] of &quot;fast RAM&quot; due to the 68000's 24-bit [[address bus]]. This memory is accessible only by the CPU permitting faster code execution as DMA cycles are not shared with the chipset.

The Amiga 1000 features an 86-pin expansion port (electrically identical to the later [[Amiga 500]] expansion port, though the A500's connector is inverted). This port is used by third-party expansions such as memory upgrades and [[SCSI]] adapters. These resources are handled by the Amiga [[Autoconfig]] standard. Other expansion options are available including a bus expander which provides two [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro-II]] slots.

== Retail ==
Introduced on July 23, 1985, during a star-studded gala featuring [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Debbie Harry]] held at the [[Vivian Beaumont Theater]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15|title=New York Magazine Aug 5, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]], machines began shipping in September with a base configuration of 256&amp;nbsp;KB of RAM at the retail price of {{US$|1,295}}. A {{convert|13|in|mm|adj=on}} analog [[Computer monitor|RGB monitor]] was available for around {{US$|300}}, bringing the price of a complete Amiga system to US$1,595 ({{Inflation|US|1595|1985|fmt=eq}}). Before the release of the [[Amiga 500]] and [[Amiga 2000]] models in 1987, the A1000 was marketed as simply the ''Amiga'', although the model number was there from the beginning, as the original box indicates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bytecellar.com/2016/04/07/it-was-always-the-amiga-1000/|title=It Was Always The “Amiga 1000”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the A1000 was marketed as ''The Amiga from Commodore'', with the Commodore logo omitted from the case. The Commodore branding was retained for the international versions.  

Additionally, the Amiga 1000 was sold exclusively in computer stores in the US rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores through which the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]] were retailed. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's &quot;toy-store&quot; computer image created during the [[Jack Tramiel|Tramiel]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&amp;res=9A01EFDC1038F93AA1575BC0A962948260&amp;scp=5&amp;sq=amiga&amp;st=nyt | title = Amiga's High-Tech Gamble | accessdate = 2008-04-11 | first = Susan | last = Chira | work = New York Times, August 29, 1984 | date=August 29, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Starfire | first=Brian | title=Commodore in tough market with new personal computer | newspaper=The Evening Independent (Dallas Morning News) | date=September 13, 1985| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19850913&amp;id=5-cLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZFkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5279,3001216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Along with the operating system, the machine came bundled with a version of [[AmigaBASIC]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and a [[speech synthesis]] library developed by [[Softvoice, Inc]].

== Aftermarket upgrades ==
Many A1000 owners remained attached to their machines long after newer models rendered the units technically obsolete, and it attracted numerous aftermarket upgrades. Many CPU upgrades that plugged into the Motorola 68000 socket functioned in the A1000. Additionally, a line of products called the ''Rejuvenator'' series allowed the use of newer chipsets in the A1000, and an [[Australia]]n-designed replacement A1000 motherboard called ''The Phoenix'' utilized the same chipset as the A3000 and added an A2000-compatible video slot and on-board [[SCSI]] controller.

== Impact ==
In 1994, as Commodore filed for bankruptcy, ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine called the Amiga 1000 &quot;the first [[multimedia computer]]... so far ahead of its time that almost nobody—including Commodore's marketing department—could fully articulate what it was all about&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halfhill |first=Tom |url=http://byte.com/art/9408/sec14/art1.htm |title=R.I.P.

In 2006, ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' rated the Amiga 1000 as the 7th greatest PC of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,8-c,systems/article.html |title=The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time &amp;#124; TechHive |publisher=Pcworld.com |accessdate=2015-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828031746/http://www.pcworld.com/article/id%2C126692-page%2C8-c%2Csystems/article.html |archivedate=August 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it was rated by the same magazine as the 37th best tech product of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Null |first=Christopher |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130207-page,9-c,technology/article.html |title=The 50 Best Tech Products of All Time |magazine=PCWorld |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Joe Pillow ==

Initially ''Joe Pillow'' was the name given on the ticket for the extra [[airline seat]] purchased to hold the first [[Amiga]] prototype while on the way to the January 1984 [[Consumer Electronics Show]]. The airlines required a name for the airline ticket and Joe Pillow was born. The engineers ([[Robert J. Mical|RJ Mical]] and Dale Luck) who flew with the Amiga prototype (codenamed ''Lorraine'') drew a happy face on the front of the pillowcase and even added a tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Joe Pillow extended his [[fifteen minutes of fame]] when the Amiga went to production. All fifty-three Amiga team members who worked on the project signed the Amiga case. This included Joe Pillow and [[Jay Miner]]'s dog Michy who each got to &quot;sign&quot; the case in their own unique way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
