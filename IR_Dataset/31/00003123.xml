{{nihongo|'''Amakusa'''|天草}}, which means &quot;Heaven's Grass,&quot; is a series of islands off the west coast of [[Kyushu]], the southernmost of the four main islands of [[Japan]].

== Geography ==
The largest island of the Amakusa group is [[Shimoshima Island, Amakusa|Shimoshima]], which is 26.5 miles long and 13.5 miles at its widest ({{convert|26.5|x|13.5|mi|km|disp=out|1}}). It is situated at 32°20'N, 130°E, separated from the rest of  [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] by the [[Yatsushiro Sea]].

While lacking high mountains with only four peaks surpassing {{convert|1500|ft|m}}, the island terrain is ruggedly hilly. To cope with the lack of flat arable land, farming is carried out on a [[terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] system of [[tillage|cultivation]].

== History ==
Amakusa, along with the neighboring Shimabara Peninsula, became the site of the [[Shimabara rebellion]] in the 17th century, led by Christians.  Following the rebellion, [[Kakure Kirishitan]], the Christians who had survived, continued to practice their faith in secret, despite severe persecution.

== Economy ==
Amakusa produces a little [[coal]] and pottery stone,&lt;ref&gt;'Clay Mineral Associations And Mineralogical Properties Of Quartz In Some Pottery Stones Of Western Kyushu, Japan. M.Nakagawa. Applied Clay Science, Vol. 8, Issue 5. Jan. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; both being used by the [[pottery|potters]] of [[Hirado ware]] and [[Satsuma ware]]. Many kilns remain on the islands today, and pottery and pottery stone are still exported.

[[Amakusa pottery]] has been recognised by the government. The retail company [[Muji]] brought out its own line of ''[[Hakuji]]'' home ware, which is produced out of ground translucent Amakusa stones kneaded into clay, using traditional techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MUJI IT Department |url=https://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=11&amp;Sub=97 |title=MUJI Online - Welcome to the MUJI Online Store |publisher=Muji.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== People ==
Hidenoshin Koyama, who built [[Thomas Blake Glover]]'s House in [[Glover Garden]], came from this island.

== Government ==
At present, the islands are organized as [[Amakusa District, Kumamoto|Amakusa District]], [[Amakusa, Kumamoto|Amakusa City]], and [[Kami-Amakusa, Kumamoto|Kami-amakusa City]], all of which are under the administration of [[Kumamoto Prefecture]].

The islands are served by [[Amakusa Airfield]], located on the north end of [[Shimoshima Island, Amakusa|Shimoshima]].  The islands are connected to the mainland by the [[Five Bridges of Amakusa]] and by ferry from [[Hondo, Kumamoto|Hondo]] and [[Matsushima, Kumamoto|Matsushima]].

There are also [[ferry|ferries]] between the islands and the neighboring prefectures of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] and [[Nagasaki Prefecture]].  The ferry from Oniike on the north [[Shimoshima Island, Amakusa|Shimoshima]] to [[Kuchinotsu, Nagasaki|Kuchinotsu]], at the southern tip of the [[Shimabara Peninsula]], is run by the [[Shimabara Railway]] and operates hourly each day.&lt;ref&gt;

Two ferries from Shinwa and Ushibuka, in the south of [[Shimoshima Island, Amakusa|Shimoshima]], connect Amakusa to [[Nagashima, Kagoshima|Nagashima]] in Kagoshima Prefecture.
