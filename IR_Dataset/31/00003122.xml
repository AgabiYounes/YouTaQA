The '''Agra Canal''' is an important [[India]]n [[irrigation]] work which starts from [[Okhla]] in [[Delhi]]. The Agra canal originates from [[Okhla barrage]], downstream of Nizamuddin bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irrigation.up.nic.in/achievements.htm Agra Canal Modernization Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318135145/http://irrigation.up.nic.in/achievements.htm |date=18 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Canal]] receives its water from the [[Yamuna River]] at [[Okhla]], about 10&amp;nbsp;km to the south of [[New Delhi]]. The weir across the [[Yamuna]] was constructed of locally quarried stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones&quot;/&gt; It was about 800-yard long, and rises seven-feet above the summer level of the river.

From [[Okhla]] the canal follows a route south then southeast for {{convert|140| miles|km}} in the high land between the Khari-Nadi and the [[Yamuna]] and finally joins the &lt;!--Banganga--&gt;Utanga River about {{convert|27| miles|km}} below Agra.&lt;ref name=&quot;jones&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones, R.E. |first1=Major H. Helshman |title=Professional Papers on Indian Engineering, Volume 3 |date=1874 |publisher=Thomason College Press |page=302 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AjRFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=agra+canal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHnJjex8PfAhUln-AKHUHQBx8Q6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=agra%20canal&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navigable branches connect the canal with [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Agra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Agra Canal}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The canal irrigates about 1.5 lakh [[MOS:DIGITS]] hectares in [[Agra]], and [[Mathura]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Faridabad]] in [[Haryana]], [[Bharatpur district|Bharatpur]] in [[Rajasthan]] and also some parts of [[Delhi]]

==History==
The canal opened in 1874. In the beginning, it was available for navigation, in [[Delhi]], erstwhile [[Gurgaon]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Agra District|Agra]] Districts, and [[Bharatpur State]]. Later, navigation was stopped in 1904 and the canal has since then, been exclusively used for irrigation purposes only. At present the canal does not flow in district Gurgaon, but only in [[Faridabad]], which was earlier a part of Gurgaon.

In recent times, Agra canal is an important landmark which separates [[Greater faridabad|Greater Faridabad]] from [[Faridabad]].
