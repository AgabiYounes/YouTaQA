The '''AGM-88 HARM''' (High-speed Anti-radiation Missile) is a tactical, [[air-to-surface missile|air-to-surface]] [[anti-radiation missile]] designed to home in on electronic transmissions coming from surface-to-air [[radar]] systems. It was originally developed by [[Texas Instruments]] as a replacement for the [[AGM-45 Shrike]] and [[AGM-78 Standard ARM]] system. Production was later taken over by [[Raytheon Corporation]] when it purchased the defense production business of Texas Instruments.

==Description==
The AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a [[radar antenna]] or [[transmitter]] with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, [[dual-thrust|booster-sustainer]] [[rocket motor]] propels the missile at speeds over [[Mach number|Mach 2.0]]. The HARM missile was a program led by the [[U.S. Navy]], and it was first carried by the [[A-6 Intruder|A-6E]], [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7]], and [[F/A-18]]A/B aircraft, and then it equipped the [[EA-6B]] aircraft. RDT&amp;E for use on the [[F-14 Tomcat|F-14]] aircraft was begun, but not completed. The [[U.S. Air Force]] (USAF) put the HARM onto the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4G]] [[Wild Weasel]] aircraft, and later on specialized [[F-16]]s equipped with the [[HARM Targeting System]] (HTS). The HTS pod, used by the USAF, only, allows F-16 to detect and automatically target radars with HARMs instead of relying on the missile's sensors alone.

==History==
{{expand section|Development history is missing and later history is thin on details|date=September 2012}}

===Deployment===
The HARM missile was approved for full production in March 1983, obtained initial operating capability (IOC) on the A-7E Corsair II in late 1983 and then deployed in late 1985 with [[Attack Squadron 46 (United States Navy)|VA-46]] aboard the aircraft carrier [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America'']]. In 1986, the first successful firing of the HARM from an EA-6B was performed by VAQ-131. It was soon used in combat—in March 1986 against a [[Libyan Army (1951–2011)|Libyan]] [[S-200 Angara/Vega/Dubna|SA-5]] site in the [[Gulf of Sidra]], and then during [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|Operation Eldorado Canyon]] in April. HARM was used extensively by the Navy, Marine Corps, and the Air Force in [[Operation Desert Storm]] during the [[Persian Gulf War]] of 1991.

During the Gulf War, the HARM was involved in a friendly fire incident when the pilot of an F-4G Wild Weasel escorting a [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bomber mistook the latter's tail gun radar for an Iraqi [[antiaircraft artillery|AAA]] site. (This was after the tail gunner of the B-52 had targeted the F-4G, mistaking it for an Iraqi [[MiG]].) The F-4 pilot launched the missile and then saw that the target was the B-52, which was hit.  It survived with shrapnel damage to the tail and no casualties. The B-52 was subsequently renamed ''In HARM's Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lake|first=Jon|title=B-52 Stratofortress Units in Operation Desert Storm|year=2004|publisher=Osprey|location=Oxford|isbn=1-84176-751-4|pages=47–48|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Magnum&quot; is spoken over the radio to announce the launch of an AGM-88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/usaf/docs/mcm3-1-a1.htm |title=MCM 3-1 |volume=Volume 1 |chapter=Attachment I: Glossary: Operational Brevity Words and Terminology |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |date=1 December 1991 |accessdate=2010-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314121936/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/usaf/docs/mcm3-1-a1.htm |archive-date=2010-03-14 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Gulf War, if an aircraft was illuminated by enemy radar a bogus &quot;Magnum&quot; call on the radio was often enough to convince the operators to power down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lambeth | first = Benjamin | title = The Transformation of American Air Power | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-8014-3816-5 | page = [https://archive.org/details/transformationof00lamb/page/112 112] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/transformationof00lamb/page/112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This technique would also be employed in Serbia during air operations in 1999.

In 2013 President Obama offered the AGM-88 to Israel for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/07/01/Israel-seeks-50B-in-US-loans-to-buy-arms/UPI-49641372706630/|title=Israel seeks $5B in U.S. loans to buy arms |publisher=United Press International |access-date=2013-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707003555/http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2013/07/01/Israel-seeks-50B-in-US-loans-to-buy-arms/UPI-49641372706630|archive-date=2013-07-07|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AGM-88E AARGM===
[[File:AGM-88E HARM p1230047.jpg|left|thumb|AGM-88E]]

The newest upgrade, the ''AGM-88E Advanced Antiradiation Guided Missile (AARGM),'' features the latest software, enhanced capabilities intended to counter enemy radar shutdown, and passive radar using an additional active millimeter-wave seeker. It was released in November 2010, and it is a joint venture by the US Department of Defense and the Italian Ministry of Defense, produced by [[Orbital ATK]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In November 2005, the Italian Ministry of Defense and the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] signed a Memorandum of Agreement on the joint development of the AGM-88E AARGM missile. Italy was providing $20 million of developmental funding as well as several million dollars worth of material, equipment, and related services. The Italian Air Force was expected to buy up to 250 missiles for its [[Tornado ECR]] aircraft. A flight test program was set to integrate the AARGM onto Tornado ECR's weapon system.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The U.S. Navy demonstrated the AARGM's capability during Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&amp;E) in spring 2012 with live firing of 12 missiles. Aircrew and maintenance training with live missiles was completed in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Navy approves full rate production for new anti-radiation missile |date=29 August 2012 |url=http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.NAVAIRNewsStory&amp;id=5109 |publisher=Naval Air Systems Command, United States Navy |accessdate=7 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707202233/http://www.navair.navy.mil/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.NAVAIRNewsStory&amp;id=5109 |archive-date=7 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Navy authorized Full-Rate Production (FRP) of the AARGM in August 2012, with 72 missiles for the Navy and nine for the [[Italian Air Force]] to be delivered in 2013. A [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[F/A-18 Hornet]] squadron will be the first forward-deployed unit with the AGM-88E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/137980/us-navy-oks-full_rate-production-for-aargm-anti_radiation-missile.html |title=Navy Approves Full Rate Production for New Anti-Radiation Missile |date=29 August 2012 |access-date=4 February 2020 |website=Defense-Aerospace.com |publisher=Briganti et Associés}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, ATK delivered the 100th AARGM to the U.S. Navy. The AGM-88E program is on schedule and on budget, with Full Operational Capability (FOC) planned for September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atk-delivers-100th-advanced-anti-radiation-guided-missile-aargm-to-us-navy-224053301.html |title=ATK Delivers 100th Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) to U.S. Navy |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430091322/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atk-delivers-100th-advanced-anti-radiation-guided-missile-aargm-to-us-navy-224053301.html |archive-date=2014-04-30 |publisher=PR Newswire |date=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AGM-88E was designed to improve the effectiveness of legacy HARM variants against fixed and relocatable radar and communications sites, particularly those that would shut down to throw off anti-radiation missiles, by attaching a new seeker to the existing Mach 2-capable rocket motor and warhead section, adding a passive anti-radiation homing receiver, satellite and [[inertial navigation system]], a [[millimeter-wave]] radar for terminal guidance, and the ability to beam up images of the target via a [[satellite link]] just seconds before impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-navy-extends-orbital-atk-agm-88e-production-423546/ |first=James |last=Drew |title=US Navy extends Orbital ATK AGM-88E production |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407203723/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-navy-extends-orbital-atk-agm-88e-production-423546/ |archive-date=2016-04-07 |website=FlightGlobal |publisher=DVV Media |date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This model of the HARM will be integrated onto the F/A-18C/D, F/A-18E/F, EA-18G, and Tornado ECR aircraft, and later on the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]] (externally).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=ATK |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/21/idUS152956+21-Jan-2009+PRN20090121 |title=ATK Awarded $55 Million Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile Low Rate Initial Production Contract by the United States Navy |via=Reuters |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2011-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623150446/https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/21/idUS152956%2B21-Jan-2009%2BPRN20090121 |archivedate=2013-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://aviationweek.com/awin-only/us-navy-wants-internal-aargm-f-35/ |title=U.S. Navy Wants Internal AARGM For F-35 |url-access=subscription |website=Aviation Week |publisher=Informa |date=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, the AGM-88E successfully hit a mobile ship target in a live-fire test, demonstrating the missile's ability to use antiradiation homing and millimeter-wave radar to detect, identify, locate, and engage moving targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2015/09/23/US-Navy-tests-upgraded-missile/3861443019797/?spt=trc |title=U.S. Navy tests upgraded missile |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925120146/http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2015/09/23/US-Navy-tests-upgraded-missile/3861443019797/?spt=trc |archive-date=2015-09-25 |first=Richard |last=Tomkins |publisher=United Press International |date=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AGM-88F HCSM===
Although the US Navy/Marine Corps chose the Orbital ATK-produced AGM-88E AARGM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/AARGM/Pages/default.aspx/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916215149/https://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/AARGM/Pages/default.aspx/ |archive-date=2018-09-16 |title=Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) - Standard and Extended Range |publisher=Northrop-Grumman}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Raytheon developed its own update of the HARM called the AGM-88F HCSM (HARM Control Section Modification), tested in conjunction with and ultimately for the US Air Force.  It incorporates similar upgrade features to the AARGM, and although it is not yet listed for export, existing HARM users have shown interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/raytheons-hcsm-anti-radiation-missile-upgrade-compl-418218/ |first=James |last=Drew |title=Raytheon's HCSM anti-radiation missile upgrade completes key test |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413223904/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/raytheons-hcsm-anti-radiation-missile-upgrade-compl-418218/ |archive-date=2016-04-13 |website=FlightGlobal |publisher=DVV Media |date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AGM-88G AARGM-ER ===
The Navy's FY 2016 budget included funding for an extended range AARGM-ER that uses the existing guidance system and warhead of the AGM-88E with a solid integrated rocket-[[ramjet]] for double the range.
