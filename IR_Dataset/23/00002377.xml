Eventually, this region emerged as the [[Coastal Andhra]] region. Later the [[Nizam]] rulers of Hyderabad ceded five territories to the British that eventually became the [[Rayalaseema]] region. The Nizams retained control of the interior provinces as the [[princely state]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], acknowledging British rule in return for local autonomy. However, [[Komaram Bheem]], a tribal leader, started his fight against the erstwhile [[Asaf Jahi Dynasty]] for the liberation of [[Hyderabad State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091816590500.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | date=18 September 2005 | title=Tributes paid to Telangana martyrs | access-date=14 July 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141203205044/http://www.thehindu.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091816590500.htm | archive-date=3 December 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[French colonial empire|French]] occupied [[Yanam (India)|Yanam]], in the Godavari delta, and (save for periods of British control) would hold it until 1954.

[[Indian independence movement|India became independent]] from the United Kingdom in 1947. The Nizam wanted to retain the independence of the Princely Hyderabad State from India, but the people of the region launched a movement to join the Indian Union. The state of Hyderabad was forcibly joined to the Republic of India with [[Operation Polo]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,799076-2,00.html |work=Time |title=HYDERABAD: The Holdout |date=30 August 1948 |accessdate=20 May 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522212635/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C799076-2%2C00.html |archivedate=22 May 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to gain an independent state based on linguistic identity, and to protect the interests of the Telugu-speaking people of [[Madras State]], [[Potti Sreeramulu]] fasted to death in 1952.

There are two main rivers namely, [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Godavari river|Godavari]], that flow through the state.

The Ghats become more pronounced towards the south and extreme north of the coast. Most of the coastal plains are put to intense agricultural use.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 41&amp;nbsp;°C. July to September is the season for tropical rains. About one-third of the total rainfall is brought by the [[northeast monsoon]]. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the northeast monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state.

November, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12&amp;nbsp;°C to 30&amp;nbsp;°C. [[Lambasingi]]  in [[Visakhapatnam district]] is the only place in South India which receives snowfall because of its location as at {{Convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} above the sea level.

==== Mahayana Buddhism ====
Buddhism spread to Andhra Pradesh early in its history. The Krishna River valley was &quot;a site of extraordinary Buddhist activity for almost a thousand years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald. ''Tibetan Renaissance''. Columbia 2005, pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Krishna Valley, including Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda and Jaggayyapeta &quot;can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The region played a central role in the development of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], along with the [[Magadha]]-area in northeastern India.&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey (2013), ''An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices'', Cambridge University Press, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.K. Warder]] holds that &quot;the Mahāyāna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the Andhra country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Warder, A.K.

When the state was first created, [[Tanguturi Prakasam|Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu]], became the chief minister. After the unification with Telangana, [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]]  became the first chief minister.

The [[Indian National Congress]] (INC), the [[Praja Socialist Party]] and the Krishi Lok Party were the major parties in the 1950s. Later the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI) became the dominant opposition party. In the 1967 state assembly elections, all socialist parties were eliminated and the CPI lost opposition party status.

The INC ruled the state from 1956 to 1982. In 1983, the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) won the state elections and [[N. T. Rama Rao]] became the chief minister of the state for the first time. This broke the long-time single party monopoly enjoyed by the INC. The 1989 elections ended the rule of Rao, with the INC returning to power with [[Marri Chenna Reddy]] at the helm. He was replaced by [[Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy|Janardhan Reddy]] in 1990, who was replaced by [[Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy]] in 1992.

In 1994, Andhra Pradesh gave a mandate to the Telugu Desam Party again, and Rao became the chief minister again. [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu]], Rao's son-in-law, came to power in 1995 with the backing of a majority of the [[MLAs]]. The Telugu Desam Party won both the assembly and [[Lok Sabha]] election in 1999 under the leadership of Chandrababu Naidu. Thus Naidu held the record for the longest-serving chief minister (1995 to 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/401839/Nara-Chandrababu-Naidu|title= Length of time as Chief Minister|accessdate= 20 December 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195811/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/401839/Nara-Chandrababu-Naidu|archive-date= 10 September 2014|url-status=live|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last elections held in the unified state in 2014, the TDP got a mandate in their favour in the residuary (new) state.
