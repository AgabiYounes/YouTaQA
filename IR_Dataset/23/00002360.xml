The '''Abu Nidal Organization''' ('''ANO''') is the most common name for the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] nationalist militant group '''Fatah – The Revolutionary Council''' (''[[Fatah]] al-Majles al-Thawry''). The ANO is named after its founder [[Abu Nidal]]. It was created by a split from [[Yasser Arafat]]'s [[Fatah]] faction of the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization|PLO]] in 1974. The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;StateDepartment2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2013/224829.htm |title=Chapter 6.

==Formation and background==
{{main|Abu Nidal}}
The ANO was originally formed as a result of the 1974 [[Rejectionist Front]] split in the PLO, after Arafat's Fatah had pushed through amendments of the PLO's goals, which were seen as a step towards compromise with [[Israel]]. Abu Nidal then moved to [[Ba'athist Iraq]] where he set up the ANO, which soon began a vicious string of terrorist attacks.

It hasn't clearly defined its ideological position, but was clearly opposed to any form of compromise or negotiation with Israel. It is known as one of the most uncompromisingly militant Palestinian groups ever. It had an estimated membership of several hundred, but its strength today is not known.

==ANO attacks==
{{main|List of attacks attributed to Abu Nidal|Abu Nidal internal executions}}
The ANO carried out attacks in 20 countries, killing or injuring almost 1,650 persons. Targets include the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, moderate [[Palestinian diaspora|Palestinians]], the [[PLO]], and various [[Arab world|Arab]] and European countries. The group has not attacked Western targets since the late 1980s.

Major attacks included the [[Rome and Vienna Airport Attacks]] in December 1985, the [[Neve Shalom synagogue]] in [[Istanbul]] and the [[Pan Am Flight 73]] hijacking in [[Karachi]] in September 1986, and the ''[[City of Poros (ship)|City of Poros]]'' day-excursion ship attack in Greece in July 1988.

The ANO has been especially noted for its uncompromising stance on negotiation with Israel, treating anything less than all-out military struggle against Israel as treachery. This led the group to perform numerous attacks against the PLO, which had made clear it accepted a negotiated solution to the conflict. Fatah-RC is believed to have assassinated PLO deputy chief [[Abu Iyad]] and PLO security chief Abu Hul in [[Tunis]] in January 1991. It assassinated a [[Jordan]]ian diplomat in [[Lebanon]] in January 1994 and has been linked to the killing of the PLO representative there. Noted PLO moderate [[Issam Sartawi]] was killed by the Fatah-RC in 1983. In the late 1970s, the group also made failed assassination attempt on the present Palestinian [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|president]] and PLO chairman, [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. These attacks, and numerous others, led to the PLO issuing a death sentence ''in absentia'' against Abu Nidal. In the early 1990s, it made an attempt to gain control of a refugee camp in [[Lebanon]], but this was thwarted by PLO organizations.
