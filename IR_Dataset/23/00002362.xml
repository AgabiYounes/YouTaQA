Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can ''tag'' a [[microbe]] or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by inhibiting a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate [[macrophages]] to destroy the foreign substance. The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc region]] (located at the base of the &quot;Y&quot;), which contains a conserved [[glycosylation]] site involved in these interactions.&lt;ref name = &quot;immune_glycan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maverakis E, Kim K, Shimoda M, Gershwin ME, Patel F, Wilken R, Raychaudhuri S, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB | title = Glycans in the immune system and The Altered Glycan Theory of Autoimmunity: a critical review | journal = Journal of Autoimmunity | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 1–13 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25578468 | pmc = 4340844 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of antibodies is the main function of the [[humoral immune system]].&lt;ref name=Pier&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Pier GB, Lyczak JB, Wetzler LM | title = Immunology, Infection, and Immunity | publisher = ASM Press| year = 2004 | isbn = 978-1-55581-246-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibodies are secreted by [[B cell]]s of the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called [[plasma cell]]s. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the [[blood plasma]], and a [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the [[B-cell receptor]] (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called [[plasma cell]]s or [[memory B cell]]s that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17337763&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Borghesi L, Milcarek C|date=|year=2006|title=From B cell to plasma cell: regulation of V(D)J recombination and antibody secretion|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1385%2FIR%3A36%3A1%3A27|journal=Immunologic Research|volume=36|issue=1–3|pages=27–32|doi=10.1385/IR:36:1:27|pmid=17337763|url-access=limited&lt;!--references exposed in addition to abstract--&gt;|via=SpringerLink}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a [[T cell|T helper cell]] is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding.&lt;ref name=&quot;T cell-dependent B cell activation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Parker DC|date=|year=1993|title=T cell-dependent B cell activation|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.iy.11.040193.001555|journal=Annual Review of Immunology|volume=11|issue=1|pages=331–60|doi=10.1146/annurev.iy.11.040193.001555|pmid=8476565|url-access=limited&lt;!--first page exposed--&gt;|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soluble antibodies are released into the [[blood]] and tissue fluids, as well as many [[secretion]]s to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.

Antibodies are [[glycoprotein]]s belonging to the [[immunoglobulin superfamily]].&lt;ref name = &quot;immune_glycan&quot;/&gt; They constitute most of the [[gamma globulin]] fraction of the [[blood proteins]]. They are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]]s and two small [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chains]]. There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of crystallisable fragments (Fc) that may be attached to the antigen-binding fragments. The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five ''[[isotype (immunology)|isotypes]]''. Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific [[Fc Receptor]] (FcR), except for IgD, which is essentially the BCR, thus allowing the antigen-antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds. The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the glycan(s) present at conserved sites within its Fc region.&lt;ref name = &quot;immune_glycan&quot;/&gt; The ability of antibodies to bind to FcRs helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Market&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Market E, Papavasiliou FN | title = V(D)J recombination and the evolution of the adaptive immune system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = E16 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14551913 | pmc = 212695 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[IgE]] is responsible for an [[allergic]] response consisting of [[mast cell]] degranulation and [[histamine]] release. IgE's [[Fragment antigen-binding|Fab]] paratope binds to allergic [[antigen]], for example [[house dust mite]] particles, while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε. The allergen-IgE-FcRε interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams CM, Galli SJ | title = The diverse potential effector and immunoregulatory roles of mast cells in allergic disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 847–59 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10808163 | doi = 10.1067/mai.2000.106485 }}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen-binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the ''hypervariable region''. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen-binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens.&lt;ref name=Rhoades/&gt; The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of [[gene]] segments that encode different antigen-binding sites (or ''paratopes''), followed by random [[mutation]]s in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity.&lt;ref name=Market/&gt;&lt;ref name=diaz&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diaz M, Casali P | title = Somatic immunoglobulin hypermutation | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 235–40 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11869898 | pmc = 4621002 | doi = 10.1016/S0952-7915(02)00327-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V(D)J or VJ recombination. Basically, the antibody paratope is polygenic, made up of three genes, V, D, and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic, such that during antibody production, one allele of V, one of D, and one of J is chosen. These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope. The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis.

Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called [[Immunoglobulin class switching|class switching]] that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.

The first use of the term &quot;antibody&quot; occurred in a text by [[Paul Ehrlich]]. The term ''Antikörper'' (the German word for ''antibody'') appears in the conclusion of his article &quot;Experimental Studies on Immunity&quot;, published in October 1891, which states that, &quot;if two substances give rise to two different ''Antikörper'', then they themselves must be different&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindenmann&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Lindenmann J|date=April 1984|title=Origin of the terms 'antibody' and 'antigen'|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-3083.1984.tb00931.x|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Immunology|volume=19|issue=4|pages=281–5|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3083.1984.tb00931.x|pmid=6374880|url-access=limited&lt;!--first page exposed without login--&gt;|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term was not accepted immediately and several other terms for antibody were proposed; these included ''Immunkörper'', ''Amboceptor'', ''Zwischenkörper'', ''substance sensibilisatrice'', ''copula'', ''Desmon'', ''philocytase'', ''fixateur'', and ''Immunisin''.&lt;ref name=Lindenmann/&gt; The word ''antibody'' has formal analogy to the word ''[[antitoxin]]'' and a similar concept to ''Immunkörper'' (''immune body'' in English).&lt;ref name=Lindenmann/&gt; As such, the original construction of the word contains a logical flaw; the antitoxin is something directed against a toxin, while the antibody is a body directed against something.&lt;ref name=Lindenmann/&gt;

The study of antibodies began in 1890 when [[Kitasato Shibasaburō]] described antibody activity against [[diphtheria]] and [[tetanus toxin]]s. Kitasato put forward the theory of [[humoral immunity]], proposing that a mediator in serum could react with a foreign antigen.&lt;ref&gt;Emil von Behring – Biographical. NobelPrize.org.

Further work concentrated on characterizing the structures of the antibody proteins. A major advance in these structural studies was the discovery in the early 1960s by [[Gerald Edelman]] and Joseph Gally of the antibody [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edelman GM, Gally JA | title = The nature of Bence-Jones proteins.

==Forms==
The membrane-bound form of an antibody may be called a ''surface immunoglobulin'' (sIg) or a ''membrane immunoglobulin'' (mIg). It is part of the ''B cell receptor'' (BCR), which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation.&lt;ref name=&quot;T cell-dependent B cell activation&quot;/&gt; The BCR is composed of surface-bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig-α and Ig-β [[heterodimer]]s, which are capable of [[signal transduction]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintrobe&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Wintrobe | last1 = Maxwell Myer|authorlink= Maxwell Wintrobe| editor-first1 = John G. | editor-last1 = Greer | editor-first2 = John | editor-last2 = Foerster | editor-first3 = John N | editor-last3 = Lukens | editor-first4 = George M | editor-last4 = Rodgers | editor-first5 = Frixos | editor-last5 = Paraskevas | name-list-format = vanc |title=Wintrobe's clinical hematology|edition=11|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Hagerstown, MD|year=2004|pages=453–456|isbn=978-0-7817-3650-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical human B cell will have 50,000 to 100,000 antibodies bound to its surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintrobe&quot; /&gt; Upon antigen binding, they cluster in large patches, which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter, on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wintrobe&quot; /&gt;

==Antibody–antigen interactions==
The antibody's paratope interacts with the antigen's epitope. An antigen usually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged discontinuously, and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called determinants.

Antibody and antigen interact by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces involved in the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic forces]], [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[hydrophobic interactions]], and [[van der Waals force]]s. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's [[Affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means it is possible for an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.

Often, once an antibody and antigen bind, they become an [[immune complex]], which functions as a unitary object and can act as an antigen in its own right, being countered by other antibodies. Similarly, [[hapten]]s are small molecules that provoke no immune response by themselves, but once they bind to proteins, the resulting complex or hapten-carrier [[adduct]] is antigenic.

==Isotypes==
Antibodies can come in different varieties known as [[Isotype (immunology)|isotypes]] or classes. In [[eutheria|placental]] mammals there are five antibody isotypes known as IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM. They are each named with an &quot;Ig&quot; prefix that stands for immunoglobulin (a name sometimes used interchangeably with antibody) and differ in their biological properties, functional locations and ability to deal with different antigens, as depicted in the table.&lt;ref name = woof&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woof JM, Burton DR | title = Human antibody-Fc receptor interactions illuminated by crystal structures | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 89–99 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 15040582 | doi = 10.1038/nri1266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The different suffixes of the antibody isotypes denote the different types of heavy chains the antibody contains, with each heavy chain class named alphabetically: α (alpha), γ (gamma), δ (delta), ε (epsilon), and μ (mu). This gives rise to IgA, IgG, IgD, IgE, and IgM, respectively.

The antibody isotype of a [[B cell]] changes during cell [[Pre-pre B cell|development]] and activation. Immature B cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, express only the IgM isotype in a cell surface bound form. The B lymphocyte, in this ready-to-respond form, is known as a &quot;naive B lymphocyte.&quot; The naive B lymphocyte expresses both surface IgM and IgD. The co-expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen.&lt;ref name=Goding&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Goding JW | title = Allotypes of IgM and IgD receptors in the mouse: a probe for lymphocyte differentiation | journal = Contemporary Topics in Immunobiology | volume = 8 | pages = 203–43 | year = 1978 | pmid = 357078 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4684-0922-2_7 | isbn = 978-1-4684-0924-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; B cell activation follows engagement of the cell-bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into an antibody-producing cell called a [[plasma cell]]. In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a [[Secretion|secreted]] form rather than a [[cell membrane|membrane]]-bound form. Some [[daughter cell]]s of the activated B cells undergo [[isotype switching]], a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.

Antibodies are heavy (~150&amp;nbsp;k[[Dalton (unit)|Da]]) [[globular protein|globular]] [[plasma protein]]s. The size of an antibody molecule is about 10 [[Nanometre|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slas.ac.cn/upload/20130815-4.pdf|title=Matching cellular dimensions with molecular sizes|last=Reth|first=Michael | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have sugar chains (glycans) added to conserved [[amino acid]] residues.&lt;ref name = &quot;immune_glycan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mattu TS, Pleass RJ, Willis AC, Kilian M, Wormald MR, Lellouch AC, Rudd PM, Woof JM, Dwek RA | title = The glycosylation and structure of human serum IgA1, Fab, and Fc regions and the role of N-glycosylation on Fcα receptor interactions | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 4 | pages = 2260–72 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9442070 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.4.2260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, antibodies are ''[[glycoprotein]]s''.&lt;ref name = &quot;immune_glycan&quot;/&gt; The attached glycans are critically important to the structure and function of the antibody.&lt;ref name = &quot;immune_glycan&quot;/&gt; Among other things the expressed glycans can modulate an antibody's affinity for its corresponding FcR(s).&lt;ref name = &quot;immune_glycan&quot;/&gt;

The basic functional unit of each antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) [[monomer]] (containing only one Ig unit); secreted antibodies can also be [[protein dimer|dimeric]] with two Ig units as with IgA, [[tetramer protein|tetrameric]] with four Ig units like [[teleost fish]] IgM, or [[pentamer]]ic with five Ig units, like mammalian IgM.&lt;ref name = roux&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roux KH | title = Immunoglobulin structure and function as revealed by electron microscopy | journal = International Archives of Allergy and Immunology | volume = 120 | issue = 2 | pages = 85–99 | date = October 1999 | pmid = 10545762 | doi = 10.1159/000024226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antibody IgG2.png|thumb|right|Several immunoglobulin domains make up the two heavy chains (red and blue) and the two light chains (green and yellow) of an antibody. The immunoglobulin domains are composed of between 7 (for constant domains) and 9 (for variable domains) [[β-strand]]s. ]] The variable parts of an antibody are its V regions, and the constant part is its C region.

===Immunoglobulin domains===
The Ig monomer is a &quot;Y&quot;-shaped molecule that consists of four [[polypeptide]] chains; two identical ''heavy chains'' and two identical ''light chains'' connected by [[disulfide bond]]s.&lt;ref name = woof/&gt;
Each chain is composed of [[structural domain]]s called [[immunoglobulin domain]]s. These domains contain about 70–110 [[amino acid]]s and are classified into different categories (for example, variable or IgV, and constant or IgC) according to their size and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barclay AN | title = Membrane proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains--a master superfamily of interaction molecules | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 215–23 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 14690046 | doi = 10.1016/S1044-5323(03)00047-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a characteristic [[immunoglobulin fold]] in which two [[beta sheet]]s create a &quot;sandwich&quot; shape, held together by interactions between conserved [[cysteine]]s and other charged amino acids.

===Heavy chain===
{{details|Immunoglobulin heavy chain}}
There are five types of mammalian Ig [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy chain]] denoted by the [[Greek letters]]: [[α]], [[δ]], [[ε]], [[γ]], and [[μ]].&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; The type of heavy chain present defines the ''class'' of antibody; these chains are found in IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM antibodies, respectively.&lt;ref name=Rhoades/&gt; Distinct heavy chains differ in size and composition; α and γ contain approximately 450 amino acids, whereas μ and ε have approximately 550 [[amino acid]]s.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt;

Each heavy chain has two regions, the ''constant region'' and the ''variable region''. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of ''three'' tandem (in a line) Ig [[Structural domain|domains]], and a hinge region for added flexibility;&lt;ref name = woof/&gt; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of ''four'' immunoglobulin domains.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but is the same for all antibodies produced by a single B cell or [[Clone (B-cell biology)|B cell clone]]. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.

===Light chain===
{{details|Immunoglobulin light chain}}
In mammals there are two types of [[immunoglobulin light chain]], which are called [[lambda]] (λ) and [[kappa]] (κ).&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; A light chain has two successive domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the [[iota]] (ι) chain, are found in other [[vertebrate]]s like sharks ([[Chondrichthyes]]) and bony fishes ([[Teleostei]]).

&lt;!-- several redirects lead here --&gt;

Different parts of an antibody have different functions. Specifically, the &quot;arms&quot; (which are generally identical) contain sites that can bind to specific molecules, enabling recognition of specific antigens. This region of the antibody is called the ''[[Fab region|Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region]]''. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.&lt;ref name= putnam79&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Putnam FW, Liu YS, Low TL | title = Primary structure of a human IgA1 immunoglobulin. IV. Streptococcal IgA1 protease, digestion, Fab and Fc fragments, and the complete amino acid sequence of the alpha 1 heavy chain | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 254 | issue = 8 | pages = 2865–74 | date = April 1979 | pmid = 107164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[paratope]] at the [[N-terminal end|amino terminal end]] of the antibody [[monomer]] is shaped by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is also referred to as the F&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable loops of β-strands, three each on the light (V&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and heavy (V&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the [[complementarity-determining region]]s (CDRs).
The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by Chothia et al.&lt;ref name= Chothia1997&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Lazikani B, Lesk AM, Chothia C | title = Standard conformations for the canonical structures of immunoglobulins | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 273 | issue = 4 | pages = 927–48 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9367782 | doi = 10.1006/jmbi.1997.1354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and more recently by North et al.&lt;ref name= North2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = North B, Lehmann A, Dunbrack RL | title = A new clustering of antibody CDR loop conformations | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 406 | issue = 2 | pages = 228–56 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21035459 | pmc = 3065967 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.10.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and Nikoloudis et al.&lt;ref name= Nikoloudis2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nikoloudis D, Pitts JE, Saldanha JW | title = A complete, multi-level conformational clustering of antibody complementarity-determining regions | journal = PeerJ | volume = 2 | issue = e456 | pages = e456 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25071986 | pmc = 4103072 | doi = 10.7717/peerj.456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the framework of the [[immune network theory]], CDRs are also called idiotypes. According to immune network theory, the adaptive immune system is regulated by interactions between idiotypes.

The base of the Y plays a role in modulating immune cell activity. This region is called the ''[[Fc region|Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region]]'', and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt; Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of [[Fc receptor]]s, and other immune molecules, such as [[Complement system|complement]] proteins. By doing this, it mediates different [[physiological]] effects, including recognition of [[opsonization|opsonized]] particles (binding to FcγR), [[lysis]] of cells (binding to complement), and [[degranulation]] of [[mast cell]]s, [[basophil]]s, and [[eosinophil]]s (binding to FcεR).&lt;ref name = woof/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heyman B | title = Complement and Fc-receptors in regulation of the antibody response | journal = Immunology Letters | volume = 54 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 195–9 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 9052877 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-2478(96)02672-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the Fab region of the antibody determines antigen specificity while the Fc region of the antibody determines the antibody's class effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an antibody, the classes of heavy chain in antibodies determine their class effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This implies different isotypes of antibodies have different class effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible class effects of antibodies include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).

== Function ==
{{further|Immune system}}

The main categories of antibody action include the following:

[[File:Antibody Opsonization.svg|thumb|1) Antibodies (A) and pathogens (B) free roam in the blood. 2) The antibodies bind to pathogens, and can do so in different formations such as: opsonization (2a), neutralisation (2b), and agglutination (2c). 3) A phagocyte (C) approaches the pathogen, and the Fc region (D) of the antibody binds to one of the Fc receptors (E) of the phagocyte. 4) Phagocytosis occurs as the pathogen is ingested.]]

* [[Neutralisation (immunology)|Neutralisation]], in which [[neutralizing antibody|neutralizing antibodies]] block parts of the surface of a bacterial cell or virion to render its attack ineffective
* [[Agglutination (biology)|Agglutination]], in which antibodies &quot;glue together&quot; foreign cells into clumps that are attractive targets for [[phagocytosis]]
* [[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]], in which antibodies &quot;glue together&quot; [[blood serum|serum]]-soluble antigens, forcing them to precipitate out of solution in clumps that are attractive targets for [[phagocytosis]]
* [[Complement system#Overview|Complement activation]] (fixation), in which antibodies that are latched onto a foreign cell encourage complement to attack it with a [[membrane attack complex]], which leads to the following:
** [[Lysis]] of the foreign cell 
** Encouragement of [[inflammation]] by [[chemotaxis|chemotactically]] attracting inflammatory cells

Activated B cells [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into either antibody-producing cells called [[plasma cell]]s that secrete soluble antibody or [[memory B cell|memory cells]] that survive in the body for years afterward in order to allow the immune system to remember an antigen and respond faster upon future exposures.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17337763&quot;/&gt;

At the [[prenatal]] and neonatal stages of life, the presence of antibodies is provided by [[passive immunization]] from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within the first years of life. Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said to be part of the [[humoral immune system]]. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one [[antigen]] (an example is a [[virus]] [[capsid|capsid protein]] fragment). Antibodies contribute to [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by [[macrophages]] and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other [[immune response]]s such as the [[complement system|complement pathway]].&lt;ref name=Ravetch&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravetch JV, Bolland S | title = IgG Fc receptors | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 275–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11244038 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.immunol.19.1.275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).

[[File:IgM white background.png|thumb|left|The secreted mammalian [[IgM]] has five Ig units. Each Ig unit (labeled 1) has two epitope binding [[Fab region]]s, so IgM is capable of binding up to 10 epitopes.]]

===Activation of complement===
Antibodies that bind to surface antigens (for example, on bacteria) will attract the first component of the [[complement cascade]] with their [[Fv region|Fc region]] and initiate activation of the &quot;classical&quot; complement system.&lt;ref name=Ravetch/&gt; This results in the killing of bacteria in two ways.&lt;ref name=Pier/&gt; First, the binding of the antibody and complement molecules marks the microbe for ingestion by [[phagocyte]]s in a process called [[opsonization]]; these phagocytes are attracted by certain complement molecules generated in the complement cascade. Second, some complement system components form a [[Complement membrane attack complex|membrane attack complex]] to assist antibodies to kill the bacterium directly (bacteriolysis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rus H, Cudrici C, Niculescu F | title = The role of the complement system in innate immunity | journal = Immunologic Research | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–12 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16234578 | doi = 10.1385/IR:33:2:103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activation of effector cells===
To combat pathogens that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link them together, causing them to [[Agglutination (biology)|agglutinate]]. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.&lt;ref name=Pier/&gt;

Those cells that recognize coated pathogens have Fc receptors, which, as the name suggests, interact with the [[Fc region]] of IgA, IgG, and IgE antibodies. The engagement of a particular antibody with the Fc receptor on a particular cell triggers an effector function of that cell; phagocytes will [[phagocytosis|phagocytose]], [[mast cell]]s and [[neutrophil]]s will [[degranulation|degranulate]], [[natural killer cell]]s will release [[cytokine]]s and [[cytotoxic]] molecules; that will ultimately result in destruction of the invading microbe. The activation of natural killer cells by antibodies initiates a cytotoxic mechanism known as [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]] (ADCC) – this process may explain the efficacy of [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] used in [[biopharmaceutical|biological]] therapies against [[cancer]]. The Fc receptors are isotype-specific, which gives greater flexibility to the immune system, invoking only the appropriate immune mechanisms for distinct pathogens.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt;

===Natural antibodies===
Humans and higher primates also produce &quot;natural antibodies&quot; that are present in serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or [[passive immunization]]. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of enveloped virus particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide [[galactose]] α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Racaniello, Vincent |url=http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/06/natural-antibody-protects-against-viral-infection/ |date=6 October 2009 |title=Natural antibody protects against viral infection |website=Virology Blog |access-date=22 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220015318/http://www.virology.ws/2009/10/06/natural-antibody-protects-against-viral-infection/ |archive-date=20 February 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejection of [[Organ xenotransplantation|xenotransplantated organs]] is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Milland J, Sandrin MS | title = ABO blood group and related antigens, natural antibodies and transplantation | journal = Tissue Antigens | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 459–66 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17176435 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2006.00721.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immunoglobulin diversity==
Virtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mian IS, Bradwell AR, Olson AJ | title = Structure, function and properties of antibody binding sites | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 217 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–51 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 1988675 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(91)90617-F }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that humans generate about 10&amp;nbsp;billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8612345&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fanning LJ, Connor AM, Wu GE | title = Development of the immunoglobulin repertoire | journal = Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8612345 | doi = 10.1006/clin.1996.0044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of [[gene]]s available to make these proteins is limited by the size of the human genome.

===Domain variability===
[[File:Complementarity determining regions.PNG|thumb|upright=1.25|The complementarity determining regions of the heavy chain are shown in red ({{PDB|1IGT}})]]
The chromosomal region that encodes an antibody is large and contains several distinct gene loci for each domain of the antibody—the chromosome region containing heavy chain genes ([[IGH@]]) is found on [[chromosome 14]], and the loci containing lambda and kappa light chain genes ([[IGL@]] and [[IGK@]]) are found on chromosomes [[chromosome 22|22]] and [[chromosome 2|2]] in humans. One of these domains is called the variable domain, which is present in each heavy and light chain of every antibody, but can differ in different antibodies generated from distinct B cells. Differences, between the variable domains, are located on three loops known as hypervariable regions (HV-1, HV-2 and HV-3) or [[complementarity-determining region]]s (CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3). CDRs are supported within the variable domains by conserved framework regions. The heavy chain locus contains about 65 different variable domain genes that all differ in their CDRs. Combining these genes with an array of genes for other domains of the antibody generates a large cavalry of antibodies with a high degree of variability. This combination is called V(D)J recombination discussed below.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Parham. ''The Immune System''. 2nd ed. Garland Science: New York, 2005. pg.47–62&lt;/ref&gt;

===V(D)J recombination===
{{details|V%28D%29J recombination}}
[[File:VDJ recombination.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Simplified overview of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin heavy chains]]
Somatic recombination of immunoglobulins, also known as ''V(D)J recombination'', involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments.&lt;ref name = namazee/&gt; V, D and J segments are found in [[immunoglobulin heavy chain|Ig heavy chains]], but only V and J segments are found in [[Immunoglobulin light chain|Ig light chains]]. Multiple copies of the V, D and J gene segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the [[genome]]s of [[mammal]]s. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one J gene segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments can be used to generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different [[wikt:paratope|paratopes]], and thus different antigen specificities.&lt;ref name=Market/&gt; The rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.

RAG proteins play an important role with V(D)J recombination in cutting DNA at a particular region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Market&quot;/&gt; Without the presence of these proteins, V(D)J recombination would not occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Market&quot;/&gt;

After a B cell produces a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a process known as [[allelic exclusion]]) thus each B cell can produce antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.&lt;ref name=Janeway5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergman Y, Cedar H | title = A stepwise epigenetic process controls immunoglobulin allelic exclusion | journal = Nature Reviews. Immunology | volume = 4 | issue = 10 | pages = 753–61 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15459667 | doi = 10.1038/nri1458 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation===
{{further|Somatic hypermutation|Affinity maturation}}

Following activation with antigen, B cells begin to [[Cell division|proliferate]] rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, the genes encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains undergo a high rate of [[point mutation]], by a process called ''somatic hypermutation'' (SHM). SHM results in approximately one [[nucleotide]] change per variable gene, per cell division.&lt;ref name=diaz/&gt; As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight [[amino acid]] differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.

This serves to increase the diversity of the antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding [[Chemical affinity|affinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Honjo T, Habu S | title = Origin of immune diversity: genetic variation and selection | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 803–30 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3927822 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.54.070185.004103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity).&lt;ref name=orguil&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Or-Guil M, Wittenbrink N, Weiser AA, Schuchhardt J | title = Recirculation of germinal center B cells: a multilevel selection strategy for antibody maturation | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 216 | pages = 130–41 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17367339 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2007.00507.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas those with low affinity antibodies will not, and will die by [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name=orguil/&gt; Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average affinity of antibodies to increase over time. The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called ''affinity maturation''. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from [[helper T cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neuberger MS, Ehrenstein MR, Rada C, Sale J, Batista FD, Williams G, Milstein C | title = Memory in the B-cell compartment: antibody affinity maturation | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

[[File:Class switch recombination.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Mechanism of class switch recombination that allows isotype switching in activated B cells]]

===Class switching===
[[Immunoglobulin class switching|Isotype or class switching]] is a [[biological process]] occurring after activation of the B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG).&lt;ref name=Market/&gt; The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stavnezer J, Amemiya CT | title = Evolution of isotype switching | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–75 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15522624 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2004.08.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Class switching occurs in the heavy chain gene [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved [[nucleotide]] motifs, called ''switch (S) regions'', found in [[DNA]] upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The DNA strand is broken by the activity of a series of [[enzyme]]s at two selected S-regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durandy A | title = Activation-induced cytidine deaminase: a dual role in class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation | journal = European Journal of Immunology | volume = 33 | issue = 8 | pages = 2069–73 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12884279 | doi = 10.1002/eji.200324133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casali P, Zan H | title = Class switching and Myc translocation: how does DNA break? | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 1101–3 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15496946 | pmc = 4625794 | doi = 10.1038/ni1104-1101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variable domain [[exon]] is rejoined through a process called [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lieber MR, Yu K, Raghavan SC | title = Roles of nonhomologous DNA end joining, V(D)J recombination, and class switch recombination in chromosomal translocations | journal = DNA Repair | volume = 5 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 1234–45 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16793349 | doi = 10.1016/j.dnarep.2006.05.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specificity designations===
{{anchor|valence}}An antibody can be called ''monospecific'' if it has specificity for the same antigen or epitope,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TfW5sUfeM5gC&amp;pg=PA22 page 22] in: {{Cite book |last1 = Shoenfeld | first1 = Yehuda. | last2 = Meroni | first2 = Pier-Luigi. | last3 = Gershwin | first3 = M.

&lt;/ref&gt; or bispecific if they have affinity for two different antigens or two different epitopes on the same antigen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spiess C, Zhai Q, Carter PJ | title = Alternative molecular formats and therapeutic applications for bispecific antibodies | journal = Molecular Immunology | volume = 67 | issue = 2 Pt A | pages = 95–106 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 25637431 | doi = 10.1016/j.molimm.2015.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of antibodies can be called ''polyvalent'' (or ''unspecific'') if they have affinity for various antigens&lt;ref name=farlex-polyvalent/&gt; or microorganisms.&lt;ref name=farlex-polyvalent&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/polyvalent Farlex dictionary &gt; polyvalent] Citing: The American Heritage Medical Dictionary. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]], if not otherwise noted, consists of a variety of different IgG (polyclonal IgG). In contrast, [[monoclonal antibodies]] are identical antibodies produced by a single B cell.

===Asymmetrical antibodies===
Heterodimeric antibodies, which are also asymmetrical and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. [[Single-chain variable fragment|Single chain variable fragments]] ([[scFv]]) are connected to the variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gunasekaran K, Pentony M, Shen M, Garrett L, Forte C, Woodward A, Ng SB, Born T, Retter M, Manchulenko K, Sweet H, Foltz IN, Wittekind M, Yan W | title = Enhancing antibody Fc heterodimer formation through electrostatic steering effects: applications to bispecific molecules and monovalent IgG | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 285 | issue = 25 | pages = 19637–46 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20400508 | pmc = 2885242 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M110.117382 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muller KM |title=The first constant domain (CH1 and CL) of an antibody used as heterodimerization domain for bispecific miniantibodies |journal=FEBS Letters |volume=422 |issue=2 |pages=259–264 |year=1998 | doi =  10.1016/s0014-5793(98)00021-0 |pmid=9490020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn't suppress homodimer formation.

To further improve the function of heterodimeric antibodies, many scientists are looking towards artificial constructs. Artificial antibodies are largely diverse protein motifs that use the functional strategy of the antibody molecule, but aren't limited by the loop and framework structural constraints of the natural antibody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao C, Mao S, Lo CH, Wirsching P, Lerner RA, Janda KD | title = Making artificial antibodies: a format for phage display of combinatorial heterodimeric arrays | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 11 | pages = 6025–30 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10339535 | pmc = 26829 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.11.6025 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.6025G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to control the combinational design of the sequence and three-dimensional space could transcend the natural design and allow for the attachment of different combinations of drugs to the arms.

Heterodimeric antibodies have a greater range in shapes they can take and the drugs that are attached to the arms don't have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of drugs to be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change of shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.

==Medical applications==

===Disease diagnosis===
Detection of particular antibodies is a very common form of medical [[medical diagnosis|diagnostics]], and applications such as [[serology]] depend on these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immunospot.eu/elisa-animation.html |title=Animated depictions of how antibodies are used in ELISA assays |access-date=8 May 2007 |website=Cellular Technology Ltd.—Europe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614091640/http://www.elispot-analyzers.de/english/elisa-animation.html |archive-date=14 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in biochemical assays for disease diagnosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immunospot.eu/elispot-animation.html |title=Animated depictions of how antibodies are used in ELISPOT assays |access-date=8 May 2007 |website=Cellular Technology Ltd.—Europe |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516142529/http://www.elispot-analyzers.de/english/elispot-animation.html |archive-date=16 May 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[titer]] of antibodies directed against [[Epstein-Barr virus]] or [[Lyme disease]] is estimated from the blood. If those antibodies are not present, either the person is not infected or the infection occurred a ''very'' long time ago, and the B cells generating these specific antibodies have naturally decayed.

In [[clinical immunology]], levels of individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by [[nephelometry]] (or turbidimetry) to characterize the antibody profile of patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stern P |title=Current possibilities of turbidimetry and nephelometry |journal=Klin Biochem Metab |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=146–151 |year=2006 |url=http://www.clsjep.cz/odkazy/kbm0603-146.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410032918/http://www.clsjep.cz/odkazy/kbm0603-146.pdf |archive-date=10 April 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of [[liver]] damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear.&lt;ref name=Rhoades/&gt; For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic [[cirrhosis]], elevated IgM indicates [[viral hepatitis]] and [[primary biliary cirrhosis]], while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, [[autoimmune hepatitis]] and cirrhosis.

[[Autoimmune disorder]]s can often be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own [[epitope]]s; many can be detected through [[blood test]]s. Antibodies directed against [[red blood cell]] surface antigens in immune mediated [[hemolytic anemia]] are detected with the [[Coombs test]].&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite book |last=Dean |first=Laura | name-list-format = vanc |title= Blood Groups and Red Cell Antigens| year= 2005|publisher=National Library of Medicine (US) |location=NCBI Bethesda (MD)|chapter= Chapter 4: Hemolytic disease of the newborn |chapterurl= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=rbcantigen.chapter.ch4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in [[blood transfusion]] preparation and also for antibody screening in [[antenatal]] women.&lt;ref name=Dean/&gt;

Practically, several immunodiagnostic methods based on detection of complex antigen-antibody are used to diagnose infectious diseases, for example [[ELISA]], [[immunofluorescence]], [[Western blot]], [[immunodiffusion]], [[immunoelectrophoresis]], and [[magnetic immunoassay]]. Antibodies raised against human chorionic gonadotropin are used in over the counter pregnancy tests.

===Prenatal therapy===
[[Rh factor]], also known as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on [[red blood cell]]s; individuals that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal [[childbirth]], delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from a [[fetus]] can enter the mother's system. In the case of an Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the [[pregnancy]], and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for [[hemolytic disease of the newborn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Urbaniak SJ, Greiss MA | title = RhD haemolytic disease of the fetus and the newborn | journal = Blood Reviews | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 44–61 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10805260 | doi = 10.1054/blre.1999.0123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of a mother with Anti-RhD antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and delivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother's system from the fetus. It is important to note that this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to &quot;remember&quot; Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her humoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack the Rh antigens of the current or subsequent babies. Rho(D) Immune Globulin treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to [[Rh disease]], but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself.&lt;ref name= Fung/&gt;

In research, purified antibodies are used in many applications. Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine. Research antibodies are most commonly used to identify and locate [[intracellular]] and [[extracellular]] proteins. Antibodies are used in [[flow cytometry]] to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of [[cluster of differentiation]] molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins.&lt;ref name=Stecher&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brehm-Stecher BF, Johnson EA | title = Single-cell microbiology: tools, technologies, and applications | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 538–59, table of contents | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15353569 | pmc = 515252 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.68.3.538-559.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in [[immunoprecipitation]] to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a [[cell lysate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Williams NE | title = Immunoprecipitation procedures | volume = 62 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/tetrahymenatherm62acad/page/449 449–53] | year = 2000 | pmid = 10503210 | doi = 10.1016/S0091-679X(08)61549-6 | isbn = 978-0-12-544164-3 | series = Methods in Cell Biology | url = https://archive.org/details/tetrahymenatherm62acad/page/449 | publisher = San Diego, CA : Academic Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Western blot]] analyses to identify proteins separated by [[electrophoresis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurien BT, Scofield RH | title = Western blotting | journal = Methods | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 283–93 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16483794 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2005.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[immunohistochemistry]] or [[immunofluorescence]] to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells with the assistance of a [[microscope]].&lt;ref name=Stecher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Scanziani E | title = Immunohistochemical staining of fixed tissues | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 104 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/mycoplasmaprotoc00roge/page/133 133–40] | year = 1998 | pmid = 9711649 | doi = 10.1385/0-89603-525-5:133 | isbn = 978-0-89603-525-6 | url = https://archive.org/details/mycoplasmaprotoc00roge/page/133 | publisher = Totowa, N.J. : Humana Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using [[ELISA]] and [[ELISpot]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Reen DJ | title = Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 32 | pages = 461–6 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7951745 | doi = 10.1385/0-89603-268-X:461 | isbn = 978-0-89603-268-2 | pmc = 2366430 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| vauthors = Kalyuzhny AE | title = Chemistry and biology of the ELISPOT assay | journal = Methods in Molecular Biology | volume = 302 | pages = 15–31 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15937343 | doi = 10.1385/1-59259-903-6:015 | isbn = 978-1-59259-903-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibodies used in research are some of the most powerful, yet most problematic reagents with a tremendous number of factors that must be controlled in any experiment including cross reactivity, or the antibody recognizing multiple epitopes and affinity, which can vary widely depending on experimental conditions such as pH, solvent, state of tissue etc. Multiple attempts have been made to improve both the way that researchers validate antibodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saper CB | title = An open letter to our readers on the use of antibodies | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 493 | issue = 4 | pages = 477–8 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16304632 | doi = 10.1002/cne.20839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-011.html|title=NOT-OD-16-011: Implementing Rigor and Transparency in NIH &amp; AHRQ Research Grant Applications|website=grants.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ways in which they report on antibodies. Researchers using antibodies in their work need to record them correctly in order to allow their research to be reproducible (and therefore tested, and qualified by other researchers).

==Regulations==
===Production and testing ===

Traditionally, most antibodies are produced by hybridoma [[cell (biology)|cell]] lines through immortalization of antibody-producing cells by chemically-induced fusion with myeloma cells. In some cases, additional fusions with other lines have created &quot;triomas&quot; and &quot;quadromas&quot;. The manufacturing process should be appropriately described and validated. Validation studies should
at least include:

* The demonstration that the process is able to produce in good quality (the process should be validated)
* 
* The [[efficiency]] of the antibody purification (all [[impurities]] and [[virus]] must be eliminated)
* 
* The characterization of purified antibody ([[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] characterization, [[immunological]] properties, [[biological]] activities, contaminants, ...)
* Determination of the virus clearance studies

===Before clinical trials===
 
* Product safety testing: Sterility (bacteria and fungi), In vitro and in vivo testing for adventitious viruses, Murine retrovirus testing... Product safety data needed before the initiation of feasibility trials in serious or immediately life-threatening conditions, it serves to evaluate dangerous potential of the product.
* Feasibility testing:  These are pilot studies whose objectives include, among others, early characterization of safety and initial proof of concept in a small specific patient population (in vitro or in vivo testing).

===Preclinical studies===

* Testing [[cross-reactivity]] of antibody: to highlight unwanted interactions (toxicity) of antibodies with previously characterized tissues. This study can be performed in vitro (Reactivity of the antibody or immunoconjugate should be determined with a quick-frozen adult tissues) or in vivo (with appropriates animal models). 
* Preclinical [[pharmacology]] and [[toxicity]] testing: [[preclinical]] safety testing of antibody is designed to identify possible toxicity in humans, to estimate the likelihood and severity of potential adverse events in humans, and to identify a safe starting dose and dose escalation, when possible. 
* Animal toxicity studies: Acute toxicity testing, Repeat-dose toxicity testing, Long-term toxicity testing
* Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics testing: Use for determinate clinical dosages, antibody activities, evaluation of the potential clinical effects

==Structure prediction and computational antibody design ==
The importance of antibodies in health care and the [[biotechnology]] industry demands knowledge of their structures at [[Image resolution|high resolution]]. This information is used for [[protein engineering]], modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. [[X-ray crystallography]] is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures. Online web servers such as ''Web Antibody Modeling'' (WAM)&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717212251/http://antibody.bath.ac.uk/abmod.html |date=17 July 2011 }}&lt;br /&gt; [http://antibody.bath.ac.uk/abmod.html WAM]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure'' (PIGS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marcatili P, Rosi A, Tramontano A | title = PIGS: automatic prediction of antibody structures | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 24 | issue = 17 | pages = 1953–4 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18641403 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn341 | url = http://biocomputing.it/pigs/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101126235204/http://arianna.bio.uniroma1.it/pigs/ | df = dmy | url-status = live | archive-date = 26 November 2010 }}&lt;br /&gt; [http://biocomputing.it/pigs/ Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure (PIGS)]&lt;/ref&gt; enables computational modeling of antibody variable regions.

==Antibody mimetic==
[[Antibody mimetic]]s are organic compounds, like antibodies, that can specifically bind antigens. They are usually artificial peptides or proteins with a molar mass of about 3 to 20 kDa. Nucleic acids and small molecules are sometimes considered antibody mimetics, but not artificial antibodies, antibody fragments and fusion proteins are composed from these. Common advantages over antibodies are better solubility, tissue penetration, stability towards heat and enzymes, and comparatively low production costs. Antibody mimetics such as the [[Affimer]] and the [[DARPin]] have being developed and commercialised as research, diagnostic and therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gebauer M, Skerra A | title = Engineered protein scaffolds as next-generation antibody therapeutics | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 245–55 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19501012 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.04.627 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
