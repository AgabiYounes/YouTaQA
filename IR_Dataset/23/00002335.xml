The '''Adamic language''' is, according to [[Jews|Jewish]] tradition (as recorded in the ''[[midrash]]im'') and some [[Christians]], the language spoken by [[Adam]] (and possibly [[Eve]]) in the [[Garden of Eden]]. It is variously interpreted as either the language used by [[God]] to address Adam (the [[divine language]]), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in the [[Genesis creation narrative|second Genesis creation myth]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|2:19|KJV}}).

In the Middle Ages, various Jewish commentators held that Adam spoke Hebrew, a view also addressed in various ways by the late medieval Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]]. In the early modern period, some authors continued to discuss the possibility of an Adamic language, some continuing to hold to the idea that it was Hebrew, while others such as John Locke were more skeptical. More recently, a variety of Mormon authors have expressed various opinions about the nature of the Adamic language.

Traditional Jewish exegesis such as [[Midrash]] ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 38) says that Adam spoke the [[Hebrew language]] because the names he gives Eve – ''Isha'' ([[Book of Genesis]] 2:23) and ''Chava'' (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew. By contrast, [[Kabbalism]] assumed an &quot;eternal Torah&quot; which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus, [[Abraham Abulafia]] in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in [[Paradise]] had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then-current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), p. 32 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Umberto Eco]] (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adam's descendants until the [[confusion of tongues]] (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]] addresses the topic in his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'' (1302-1305). He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing [[Serpents in the Bible|the serpent]], and not to Adam.&lt;ref&gt;''mulierem invenitur ante omnes fuisse locutam''. Umberto Eco, ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (1993), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' (c. 1308-1320), however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; This had the consequence that it could no longer be regarded as immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (''Paradiso'' XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, ''[[El (god)|El]]'', must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as ''[[Close front unrounded vowel|I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'' 26.133f.; Mazzocco, p. 178f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabethan scholar [[John Dee]] makes references to an [[occult]] or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of [[spirit medium]] [[Edward Kelley]]. Dee's journals did not describe the language as &quot;[[Enochian]]&quot;, instead preferring &quot;Angelical&quot;, the &quot;Celestial Speech&quot;, the &quot;Language of Angels&quot;, the &quot;First Language of God-Christ&quot;, the &quot;Holy Language&quot;, or &quot;Adamical&quot; because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dee's assertion that the [[Biblical Patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

Dutch physician, linguist, and humanist [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]] (1519–1572) theorized in ''Origines Antwerpianae'' (1569) that [[Antwerp]]ian [[Brabantic]], spoken in the region between the [[Scheldt]] and [[Meuse]] Rivers, was the original language spoken in Paradise. Goropius believed that the most ancient language on Earth would be the simplest language, and that the simplest language would contain mostly short words. Since Brabantic has a higher number of short words than do Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, Goropius reasoned that it was the older language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gorporius Becanus |first=Johannes |date=2014 |title=Van Adam tot Antwerpen: Een bloemlezing uit de Origines Antwerpianae en de Opera van Johannes Goropius Becanus |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=bgWyCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=265 |location=Hilversum |publisher=Uitgeverij Verloren |pages=265–77 |isbn=9789087044312 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced that of [[Simon Stevin]] (1548–1620), who espoused similar ideas in &quot;Uytspraeck van de weerdicheyt der Duytse tael&quot;, a chapter in ''[[De Beghinselen Der Weeghconst]]'' (1586).

=== Opponents ===
By the 17th century, the existence and nature of the alleged Adamic language was commonly discussed amongst European Jewish and Christian mystics and primitive linguists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noordegraaf&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Noordegraaf |first=Jan |date=1983 |title=Nog eens Hedendaagsch fetischisme |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_voo004198301_01/_voo004198301_01_0009.php |journal=Voortgang |publisher= Stichting Neerlandistiek VU |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=193–230 |accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691) was skeptical that Hebrew was the language best capable of describing the nature of things, stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I could never find, that the Hebrew names of animals, mentioned in the beginning of Genesis, argued a (much) clearer insight into their natures, than did the names of the same or some other animals in Greek, or other languages (1665:45).&lt;ref name=&quot;Noordegraaf&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Locke]] (1632–1704) expressed similar skepticism in his ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref name=&quot;Noordegraaf&quot;/&gt;

=== Latter Day Saint movement ===
[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], in his [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|revision of the Bible]], declared the Adamic language to have been &quot;pure and undefiled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Moses]] [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.6?lang=eng 6:6].&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Latter Day Saints]] believe it to be the language of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= John S. |last= Robertson |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5449 |contribution= Adamic Language |pages= 18–19 |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H.

However, this belief seems to have never been formally or officially adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, Lee. &quot;Speaking in Tongues in the Restoration Churches&quot;, ''Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought'', Vol 24, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apostle (LDS Church)|Apostle]] [[Orson Pratt]] declared that &quot;Ahman&quot;, part of the name of the settlement &quot;[[Adam-ondi-Ahman]]&quot; in [[Daviess County, Missouri]], was the name of God in the Adamic language.&lt;ref name = Pratt/&gt; An 1832 handwritten page from  the [[Joseph Smith Papers]], titled &quot;A Sample of the Pure Language&quot;, and reportedly dictated by Smith to &quot;Br.

Other words thought by some Latter Day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include ''[[Deseret (Book of Mormon)|deseret]]'' (&quot;honey bee&quot;), see [[Book of Ether|Ether]] [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.3?lang=eng 2:3] and ''Ahman'' (&quot;God&quot;) see [[Doctrine and Covenants]] [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/doctrineandcovenants/78.20?lang=eng 78:20]

It has also been claimed by some that [[Scottish Gaelic]] or [[Irish language|Irish]] was the language spoken in the Garden of Eden.
