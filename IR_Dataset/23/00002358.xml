'''Associazione Sportiva Roma''' ({{ISE|IT0001008876|ASR}}, {{lse|0MT1}}; ''Rome Sport Association''), commonly referred to as '''Roma''' ({{IPA-it|ˈroːma}}), is an [[Football in Italy|Italian]] professional [[Association football|football]] [[List of football clubs in Italy|club]] based in [[Rome]]. Founded by a merger in 1927, Roma have participated in the top-tier of Italian football for all of their existence except for [[1951–52 Serie B|1951–52]].

Roma have won [[Serie A]] three times, in [[1941–42 Serie A|1941–42]], [[1982–83 Serie A|1982–83]] and [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01]], as well as winning nine [[Coppa Italia]] titles and two [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles. In European competitions, Roma won the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in [[1960–61 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1960–61]] and were runners-up in the [[1983–84 European Cup]] and the [[1990–91 UEFA Cup]].

Fifteen players have won the [[FIFA World Cup]] while playing at Roma: Ferraris, Guaita and Masetti (1934); Donati, Monzeglio and Serantoni (1938); [[Bruno Conti]] (1982); [[Rudi Voller]] and Berthold (1990); Aldair (1994); Candela (1998); [[Cafu]] (2002); [[Daniele De Rossi]], [[Simone Perrotta]] and [[Francesco Totti]] (2006).

Since 1953, Roma have played their home matches at the [[Stadio Olimpico]], a venue they share with city rivals [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. With a capacity of over 72,000, it is the [[List of football stadiums in Italy|second-largest]] of its kind in Italy, with only the [[San Siro]] able to seat more. The club plan to move to a [[Stadio della Roma|new stadium]], though this is yet to start construction.

The club's home colours are [[Tyrian purple]] and gold, which gives Roma their nickname &quot;''I Giallorossi''&quot; (&quot;The Yellow and Reds&quot;). These colours have often been combined with white shorts. Their club badge features a she-wolf, an allusion to the [[Founding of Rome|founding myth of Rome]].

==History==
{{main|History of A.S. Roma}}
[[File:FerrarisIV.jpg|thumb|upright|Attilio Ferraris, Roma captain during their formative years]]
A.S. Roma was founded in the summer of 1927 when Italo Foschi&lt;ref name = lastoria/&gt; initiated the merger of three older [[Italian Football Championship]] clubs from the city of Rome: [[Roman F.C.|Roman FC]], [[S.S. Alba-Audace Roma|SS Alba-Audace]] and [[Fortitudo-Pro Roma S.G.S.|Fortitudo-Pro Roma SGS]].&lt;ref name = lastoria/&gt; The purpose of the merger was to give the Italian capital a strong club to rival that of the more dominant [[Northern Italy|Northern Italian]] clubs of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;lastoria&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asroma.it/DocList.aspx?Categoria=42|website=asroma.it|title=La Storia|archivedate=23 December 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223014855/http://www.asroma.it/DocList.aspx?Categoria=42 |publisher=AS Roma|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only major Roman club to resist the merger was [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] because of the intervention of the army General Vaccaro, a member of the club and executive of Italian Football Federation.
All three founding clubs were [[Serie B|relegated]], but the fascist-aligned FIGC bet over the capacity of the new team to give a stronger representation to the capital of Italy, and they were awarded a [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] for the [[Divisione Nazionale]], the [[Serie A]] forerunner. The club played its earliest seasons at the Motovelodromo Appio stadium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://albionroad.com/club-profiles/roma.html |publisher=AlbionRoad.com |title=A.S. Roma |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414212915/http://albionroad.com/club-profiles/roma.html |archivedate=14 April 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; before settling in the working-class streets of [[Testaccio]], where it built an all-wooden ground Campo Testaccio; this was opened in November 1929.&lt;ref name = &quot;Testaccio&quot; /&gt; An early season in which Roma made a large mark was the [[1930–31 Serie A|1930–31]] championship, where the club finished as runners-up behind [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; Captain [[Attilio Ferraris]], along with [[Guido Masetti]], [[Fulvio Bernardini]] and [[Rodolfo Volk]], were highly important players during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=

===First title victory and decline===
[[File:Associazione Sportiva Roma 1941-42.jpg|thumb|left|The Roma of the first scudetto in 1942]]
After a slump in league form and the departure of high key players, Roma eventually rebuilt their squad adding goalscorers such as the Argentine [[Enrique Guaita]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stars&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=calciatoriG.htm|publisher=Viva la Roma|title=Tutti i calciatori dell'A.S. Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the management of [[Luigi Barbesino]], the Roman club came close to their first title in [[1935–36 Serie A|1935–36]], finishing just one point behind champions [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asromaultras.it/35-36.html |publisher=ASRomaUltras.it |title=1935–'36: Io Faccio I Gol Non La Guerra! |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022183327/http://www.asromaultras.it/35-36.html |archivedate=22 October 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roma returned to form after being inconsistent for much of the late 1930s. Roma recorded an unexpected title triumph in the [[1941–42 Serie A|1941–42 season]] by winning their first ever ''Scudetto'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=campionato4142.htm|publisher=ASRTalenti|title=Campionato 1941–42 – Roma campione d'Italia|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18 goals scored by local player [[Amedeo Amadei]] were essential to the [[Alfréd Schaffer]]-coached Roma side winning the title. At the time, Italy was involved in [[World War II]] and Roma were playing at the [[Stadio Nazionale PNF|Stadio del Partito Nazionale Fascista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asromaultras.it/soprannomi.html |publisher=ASRomaUltras.it |title=I Campi da Gioco |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807000057/http://www.asromaultras.it/soprannomi.html |archivedate=7 August 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years just after the war, Roma were unable to recapture their league stature from the early 1940s. Roma finished in the lower half of Serie A for five seasons in a row, before eventually succumbing to their only ever relegation to [[Serie B]] at the end of the [[1950–51 Serie A|1950–51 season]],&lt;ref name = league/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ital52.html |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |title=Italy 1951–52 – Serie B |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509181203/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ital52.html |archivedate=9 May 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; around a decade after their championship victory. Under future [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] manager [[Giuseppe Viani]], promotion straight back up was achieved.&lt;ref name = &quot;managers&quot; /&gt;

After returning to the Serie A, Roma managed to stabilise themselves as a top half club again with players such as [[Egisto Pandolfini]], [[Dino Da Costa]] and Dane [[Helge Bronée]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; Their best finish of this period was under the management of Englishman [[Jesse Carver]], when in [[1954–55 Serie A|1954–55]], they finished as runners-up after [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]], who originally finished second were relegated for corruption.&lt;ref name = league/&gt; Although Roma were unable to break into the top four during the following decade, they did achieve some measure of cup success. Their first honour outside of Italy was recorded in [[1960–61 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1960–61]] when Roma won the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] by defeating [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 4–2 in the finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec196061.html#icfc|publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|title=Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1960–61|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, Roma won their first [[Coppa Italia]] trophy in 1963–64 after defeating [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] 1–0.&lt;ref name=&quot;coppaitalia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vilacom.net/football/coppa.php |publisher=Vilacom Sports |title=TIM Cup – Coppa Italia |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161909/http://www.vilacom.net/football/coppa.php |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their lowest point came during the 1964–65 season, when manager [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] announced the club could not pay its players and was unlikely to be able to afford to travel to [[Vicenza]] to fulfil its next fixture. Supporters kept the club going with a fundraiser at the Sistine Theatre and bankruptcy was avoided with the election of a new club president [[Franco Evangelisti (politician)|Franco Evangelisti]].

Their second Coppa Italia trophy was won in 1968–69, when it competed in a small, league-like system.&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; [[Giacomo Losi]] set a Roma appearance record in 1969 with 450 appearances in all competitions, a record that would last 38 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://asroma.hunsport.hu/?us=23 |publisher=ASRoma Hunsports |title=Rekordok, statisztikák |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011093920/http://asroma.hunsport.hu/?us=23 |archivedate=11 October 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time of mixed fortunes===

Roma were able to add another cup to their collection in 1972, with a 3–1 victory over [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the [[Anglo-Italian Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/angloit72.html |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |title=Anglo-Italian Cup 1972 |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529192231/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/angloit72.html |archivedate=29 May 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During much of the 1970s, Roma's appearance in the top half of Serie A was sporadic. The best place the club were able to achieve during the decade was third in [[1974–75 Serie A|1974–75]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; Notable players who turned out for the club during this period included midfielders [[Giancarlo De Sisti]] and [[Francesco Rocca]].

The dawning of a newly successful era in Roma's footballing history was brought in with another Coppa Italia victory, they defeated Torino on penalties to win the 1979–80 edition.&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; Roma would reach heights in the league which they had not touched since the 1940s by narrowly and [[Turone's goal|controversially]] finishing as runners-up to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in [[1980–81 Serie A|1980–81]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=420526 |publisher=Goal.com |title=Roma – Juventus: A Historical Look |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201012742/http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=420526 |archivedate=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[A.C.

After, a comparative decline began in the league, one of the few league highs from the following period being a third-place finish in [[1987–88 Serie A|1987–88]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; At the start of the 1990s, the club was involved in an all-Italian [[1991 UEFA Cup Final|UEFA Cup final]], where they lost 2–1 to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] in [[1990–91 UEFA Cup|1991]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=428273 |publisher=Goal.com |title=Roma – Inter: A Historical Look |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201012747/http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=428273 |archivedate=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same season, the club won its [[1990–91 Coppa Italia|seventh]] Coppa Italia&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; and ended runners-up to Sampdoria in the [[Supercoppa Italiana]]. Aside from finishing runners-up to Torino in a Coppa Italia final,&lt;ref name = &quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; the rest of the decade was largely sub-par in the history of Roma, particularly in the league, where the highest they could manage was fourth in [[1997–98 Serie A|1997–98]].&lt;ref name = league/&gt; The early 1990s also saw the emergence of homegrown striker [[Francesco Totti]], who would go on to be an important member of the team and the club's iconic captain.

Roma returned to form in the 2000s, beginning the decade in great style by winning their third ever Serie A title in [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01]].

On 9 July 2006, Roma's Francesco Totti, [[Daniele De Rossi]] and [[Simone Perrotta]] were part of the Italy national team which defeated [[France national football team|France]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4991652.stm|title=Football – World Cup 2006 – Zidane off as Italy win World Cup}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[2006 Serie A scandal|Serie A scandal]] was revealed during 2006; Roma were not one of the teams involved. After punishments were issued, Roma was re-classified as runners-up for [[2005–06 Serie A|2005–06]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5215178.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Punishments cut for Italian clubs|date=24 June 2007| accessdate=5 January 2010| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same season they finished second in the Coppa Italia losing to Internazionale.&lt;ref name=&quot;coppaitalia&quot; /&gt; In the two following seasons, [[2006–07 Serie A|2006–07]] and [[2007–08 Serie A|2007–08]], Roma finished as Serie A runners-up, meaning that in the 2000s, Roma have finished in the top two positions more than any other decade in their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/serie_a_2007/index.shtml|work=La Gazzetta dello Sport|title=Serie A 2006–07|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in the UEFA Champions League during both of these seasons, they reached the quarter-finals before going out to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. Despite the sloppy start in the [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|2008–09 Champions League]], Roma managed to reach the knockout stage ahead of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in their group, thus finishing for the first time in their history as winners of the group stage. However, the ''Giallorossi'', would lose to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the knockout stage on penalty kicks, ending their Champions League campaign.

After a disappointing start to the [[2009–10 A.S. Roma season|2009–10 season]], [[Claudio Ranieri]] replaced [[Luciano Spalletti]] as head coach. At the time of the switch, Roma lay bottom of the Serie A table after losses to Juventus and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]]. Despite this setback, Roma would later embark on an incredible unbeaten streak of 24 matches in the league – with the last of the 24 being a 2–1 win over rivals Lazio, whereby Roma came from 1–0 down at half-time to defeat their city rivals after Ranieri courageously substituted both Totti and De Rossi at the interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roma.theoffside.com/team-news/a-tribute-to-claudio-ranieris-coconuts.html |title=A Tribute To Claudio Ranieri's Coconuts – The Offside – AS Roma blog |publisher=Roma.theoffside.com |date=19 April 2010 |accessdate=19 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192623/http://roma.theoffside.com/team-news/a-tribute-to-claudio-ranieris-coconuts.html |archivedate=20 February 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Giallorossi'' were on top of the table at one point, before a loss to Sampdoria later in the season. Roma would finish runners-up to Internazionale yet again in both Serie A and the Coppa Italia. This rounded out a highly successful decade in Roma's history, following somewhat mediocre results of the 1990s. During the 2000s, Roma had finally recaptured the ''Scudetto'', two Coppa Italia trophies, and their first two Supercoppa Italiana titles. Other notable contributions to the club's history have included a return to the Champions League quarter-finals (in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League|2006–07]] and [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08]] editions) since 1984, six runners up positions in the league, four Coppa Italia finals and three Supercoppa finals – marking Roma's greatest ever decade.

====The &quot;AS Roma SPV LLC&quot; era====
In the summer of 2010, the Sensi family agreed to relinquish their control of Roma as part of a debt-settlement agreement. This brought an end to the presidential reign of the Sensi family, who had presided over the club since 1993. Until a new owner was appointed, Rosella Sensi would continue her directorial role of the club. The [[2010–11 A.S. Roma season|2010–11 season]] had once again seen Roma start off with mixed fortunes on both a domestic and European level. These included losses against [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]], [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] and a 2–0 defeat against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the group stages of the Champions League, a match which saw manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] openly criticized by his players. However, these were accompanied by victories against Inter and a sensational victory against Bayern Munich in the return fixture, which saw Roma fight back from 0–2 down at half-time to emerge as 3–2 winners. Following a series of poor results which saw Roma engage in a winless-streak of five consecutive matches, Ranieri resigned as head coach in February 2011, and former striker [[Vincenzo Montella]] was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season. It was also during this season that Roma icon Francesco Totti scored his 200th Serie A goal against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] in March 2011, becoming only the sixth ever player to achieve such a feat.

Roma records and statistics#All competitions appearances|most capped]] [[List of A.S. Roma players|player in Roma's history]]]]
On 16 April 2011, the takeover contract was closed with an American investment group led by [[Thomas R. DiBenedetto]], with [[James Pallotta]], Michael Ruane and Richard D'Amore as partners. DiBenedetto became the 22nd president of the club, serving from 27 September 2011 to 27 August 2012 and was succeeded by Pallotta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzettagiallorossa.it/2012/08/gazzetta-dello-sport-pallotta-e-tua-tra-basket-e-soccer-la-scalata-di-mister-james-per-fare-grande-la-roma/|title=GAZZETTA DELLO SPORT Pallotta, è tua! Tra basket e soccer. La scalata di mister James per fare grande la Roma – Gazzetta Giallorossa|date=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new intermediate holding company, NEEP Roma Holding, was 60% owned by American's &quot;AS Roma SPV, LLC&quot; and the rest (40%) was retained by the creditor of Sensi, [[UniCredit]]. In turn, NEEP owned all shares held previously by Sensi (about 67%) with the rest free float in the stock market. UniCredit later disinvested NEEP Roma Holding to sell to &quot;AS Roma SPV, LLC&quot; and Pallotta.

The new ownership immediately went into effect by making significant changes in the club, hiring [[Walter Sabatini]] as director of football and former [[Spain national football team|Spanish international]] and [[FC Barcelona B|Barcelona B]] coach [[Luis Enrique (footballer)|Luis Enrique]] as manager. The first high-profile player signings from the duo were attacking midfielder [[Erik Lamela]] from [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], forward [[Bojan Krkić|Bojan]] from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], goalkeeper [[Maarten Stekelenburg]] from [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and unattached defender [[Gabriel Heinze]]. The club also sold and released defender [[John Arne Riise]], goalkeeper [[Doni (footballer)|Doni]] and forwards [[Jérémy Ménez]] and [[Mirko Vučinić]]. At the financial level, the company had recapitalised for more than €100&amp;nbsp;million, the last recapitalisation occurring in the early 2000s.

Roma, however, was eliminated from [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League]] play-off round. After the formal takeover on 18 August, Roma bought forward [[Dani Osvaldo]], midfielders [[Miralem Pjanić]] and [[Fernando Gago]] and defender [[Simon Kjær]], as well as youngster [[Fabio Borini]], which cost the club more than €40&amp;nbsp;million. In 2012, Pallotta became the new president.

The 2012–13 pre-season started with the June hiring of former manager [[Zdeněk Zeman]]. Zeman replaced Luis Enrique who resigned at the end of the 2011–12 season. Luis Enrique's lone season reign had seen the disappointing loss to [[ŠK Slovan Bratislava|Slovan Bratislava]] in the [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], as well as the inability to qualify for international competitions for the 2012–13 season. Roma eventually finished seventh, losing the [[2012–13 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] chase to rivals Lazio, [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] and Internazionale. Zeman brought back his high-scoring 4–3–3 formation and his hard working ethic which successfully guided former team [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara]] to the Serie A. However, he was sacked on 2 February 2013. He was replaced by caretaker manager [[Aurelio Andreazzoli]], whose reign saw the continuation of a disappointing season, with the team ending up in sixth place in Serie A, while also losing 1–0 to rivals Lazio in the [[2012–13 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] final. As a result, Roma missed out on European competition for the second-straight season.
[[File:Luciano Spalletti.JPG|thumb|upright|Spalletti with Roma in 2009]]
On 12 June 2013, Pallotta announced that [[Rudi Garcia]] had been appointed the new manager of Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asroma.it/en/news/06/12/2013_rudi_garcia/|title=RUDI GARCIA|publisher=asroma.it|date=12 June 2013| accessdate = 2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed a fantastic start to his Roma career, winning his first ten matches (an all-time Serie A record) including a 2–0 derby win against Lazio, a 0–3 victory away to Internazionale and a 2–0 home win over title rivals Napoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24694928|title=Roma set record for best start to Serie A season|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=27 October 2013| accessdate = 28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this run, Roma scored 24 times while conceding just once, away to Parma. The 2013–14 season saw one of Roma's best ever in Serie A, the club tallying an impressive 85 points and finishing second to Juventus, who won the league with a record-breaking 102 points. Roma's defence was significantly better than in previous seasons, with only 25 goals conceded and a total of 21 clean sheets, including nine in their first ten matches.

In 2014–15, Roma finished second behind Juventus for the second consecutive season after a poor run of form in 2015. At the end of season the club was sanctioned for loss making and breaking [[UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations]].

On 13 January 2016, Garcia was sacked after a run of one win in seven Serie A matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/13/roma-sack-coach-rudi-garcia-serie-a|title=Roma sack coach Rudi García after run of one win in seven Serie A games|first=Guardian|last=sport|date=13 January 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luciano Spalletti]] was subsequently appointed manager of Roma for his second spell.&lt;ref name=roma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/78311/strootman-goodbye-garcia|title=Strootman: 'Goodbye Garcia' – Football Italia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February, Totti publicly criticised Spalletti due to his own lack of playing-time since returning from injury. Consequently, Totti was subsequently dropped by Spalletti for Roma's 5–0 win over [[U.S. Città di Palermo|Palermo]], with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/as-roma/104/blog/post/2812892/francesco-totti-faces-uncertain-roma-future|title=Francesco Totti faces uncertain Roma future after controversial comments|publisher=ESPNFC.com|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After their initial disagreements, Spalletti began to use Totti as an immediate impact substitute, which proved to be an effective decision, as the Roma number 10 rediscovered his form and contributed with four goals and one assist after coming off the bench in five consecutive Serie A matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/83762/serie-week-36-did-you-know|title=Serie A Week 36: Did You Know?|publisher=Football Italia|author1=Susy Campanale|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/italian-serie-a/match/431915/genoa-as-roma/report|title=Francesco Totti helps Roma rally to victory at Genoa|publisher=ESPN FC|date=2 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Spalletti was able to lead Roma from a mid-table spot to a third-place finish in [[2015–16 Serie A|Serie A]], clinching the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] play-off spot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Terry Daley|title=Higuain heroics mean Roma come up short in fight for second in Serie A|url=http://www.espnfc.com/club/as-roma/104/blog/post/2873087/higuain-heroics-mean-roma-come-up-short-in-fight-for-second|publisher=ESPN FC|accessdate=25 May 2016|date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2016, Roma lost star midfielder [[Miralem Pjanić]] to rivals Juventus to improve its financial position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36522742|title=Miralem Pjanic: Juventus sign Roma midfielder for £25.4m|date=13 June 2016|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 April 2017, Roma appointed [[Sevilla FC]]'s [[Sporting director]] [[Monchi]] as their new sporting director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beinsports.com/us/soccer/news/as-roma-appoint-sevilla-sporting-director-mon/521170|title=AS Roma Appoint Sevilla Sporting Director Monchi}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May 2017, on the last day of the [[2016–17 A.S. Roma season|2016–17 season]], Francesco Totti made his 786th and final appearance for Roma before retiring in a 3–2 home win against [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], coming on as a substitute for [[Mohamed Salah]] in the 54th minute and received a standing ovation from the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40036023|title=Roma 3–2 Genoa|work=BBC Sport|date=28 May 2017|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The win saw Roma finish second in Serie A behind Juventus.

The emblem of the team is currently the one which was used when the club was first founded. It portrays the female wolf with the two infant brothers [[Romulus and Remus]], illustrating the [[Founding of Rome|myth of the founding of Rome]],&lt;ref name=&quot;legend_rome&quot;/&gt; superimposed on a bipartite golden yellow over maroon red shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/search/?query_id=21223833&amp;page=2&amp;brand_id=30492|publisher=BrandsoftheWorld.com|title=Roma|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the myth from which the club takes their nickname and logo, the twins (sons of [[Mars (god)|Mars]] and [[Rhea Silvia]]) are thrown into the river [[Tiber]] by their uncle [[Amulius]]. A she-wolf then saved the twins and looked after them.&lt;ref name=&quot;legend_rome&quot;/&gt; Eventually, the two twins took revenge on Amulius before falling-out themselves – [[Romulus]] killed [[Remus]] and was thus made king of a new city named in his honour, Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;legend_rome&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/Reticulum/NORTHERNFRONTIER/WeCameWeSawWeConq/WhereDidTheyComeFrom/Story.htm |publisher=Newcastle University |title=The Legend of Romulus and Remus |date=24 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002172220/http://museums.ncl.ac.uk/Reticulum/NORTHERNFRONTIER/WeCameWeSawWeConq/WhereDidTheyComeFrom/Story.htm |archivedate=2 October 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first sport facility Roma used was the Motovelodromo Appio, previously used by [[S.S. Alba-Audace Roma|Alba-Audace]]. Roma only played the [[1927–28 Divisione Nazionale|1927–28 season]] there until they moved to [[Campo Testaccio]] the very next season. Campo Testaccio was used through 1929 to 1940. The team moved later to the [[Stadio Nazionale PNF|Stadio Nazionale del PNF]], where they spent 13 years before moving once again.

In the 1953–54 season, Roma moved to the Olympic arena, [[Stadio Olimpico]], which it shares with Lazio. The arena has undergone several changes over the years. The most significant change took place in the nineties when Stadio Olimpico was demolished and then reconstructed to for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], held in Italy. Roma have played almost every season since 1953–54, with exception of the 1989–90 seasons due to the reconstruction of Stadio Olimpico. That year, Roma played its home matches at [[Stadio Flaminio]].

On 30 December 2012, Roma club president [[James Pallotta]] announced the construction of a new stadium in the [[Tor di Valle]] area of Rome. The new stadium, [[Stadio della Roma]], will have a capacity of 52,500 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/asroma/roma_nuovo_stadio_tor_di_valle_totti_tifosi_sognavano/notizie/241248.shtml|title=HOME Il Messaggero}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 February 2017, the [[Lazio|Region of Lazio]] and the mayor of Rome rejected the proposal to build a new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/97831/official-stadio-della-roma-rejected|title=Official: Stadio della Roma rejected|publisher=Football Italia|date=2 February 2017|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later approved on 24 February after final review of the stadium's design adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/98837/mayor-historic-day-roma|title=Mayor: Historic day for Roma|publisher=Football Italia|date=24 February 2017|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the stadium suffered another delay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/107441/official-stadio-della-roma-delayed-again|title=Official: Stadio della Roma delayed again|publisher=Football Italia|date=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; forcing Roma to renew their lease with the Stadio Olimpico until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/108041/roma-stadio-olimpico-until-2020|title=Roma at Stadio Olimpico until 2020|publisher=Football Italia|date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presently uncertain when the stadium will open.&lt;ref name=uncertain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/98855/stadio-della-roma-still-faces-hurdles|title=Stadio della Roma still faces hurdles|publisher=Football Italia|date=25 February 2017|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2017 the [[Stadio della Roma]] project, after experiencing five years worth of delays due to conflicting interests from various parties in the Roman city government, was given the go-ahead to begin construction. It is slated to open in time for the 2020–21 season and will replace the Stadio Olimpico as Roma's ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto&quot;/&gt;

===Trigoria===
A sports centre located in [[:it: Trigoria|Trigoria]] at kilometre 3600 in south-east of Rome was purchased on 22 July 1977 by then club president [[Gaetano Anzalone]]. It was opened on 23 July 1979 as Anzalone's final act as president.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiviostorico.unita.it/cgi-bin/highlightPdf.cgi?t=ebook&amp;file=/archivio/uni_1979_07/19790724_0010.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517132649/http://archiviostorico.unita.it/cgi-bin/highlightPdf.cgi?t=ebook&amp;file=%2Farchivio%2Funi_1979_07%2F19790724_0010.pdf |date=17 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex had its first expansion in 1984 when the club was handled by [[Dino Viola]] and another in 1998 under the chairmanship of [[Franco Sensi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/roma/2011/11/4/TRIGORIA-Il-Trapezio-tra-i-Campi-della-Roma-e-il-Campus-Universitario/219070/|title=TRIGORIA/ Il 'Trapezio', tra i Campi della Roma e il Campus Universitario}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre's official name is the [[Fulvio Bernardini di Trigoria]], named after club icon [[Fulvio Bernardini]].

The centre is also known for hosting the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]] during the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], held in Italy.

==Supporters==
[[File:ASRomaOlimpico.jpg|thumb|left|Roma fans at the Stadio Olimpico]]
Roma is the fifth-most supported football club in Italy – behind Juventus, Internazionale, Milan and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] – with approximately 7% of Italian football fans supporting the club, according to the Doxa Institute-L'Espresso's research of April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio-archivio/163496 |publisher=L'Expresso |title=''L'altra metà del pallone'': Supporters of football clubs in Italy |date=April 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406030436/http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio-archivio/163496 |archivedate=6 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the largest section of Roma supporters in the city of Rome have come from the [[Inner city|inner-city]], especially [[Testaccio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Testaccio&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.asrtalenti.altervista.org/index.php?a=campo_testaccio.htm|publisher=Viva la Roma|title=Campo Testaccio|date=24 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional [[ultras]] group of the club was ''Commando Ultrà Curva Sud''&lt;ref name = &quot;fans&quot; /&gt; commonly abbreviated as ''CUCS''. This group was founded by the merger of many smaller groups and was considered one of the most historic in the history of [[European football]].&lt;ref name = &quot;fans&quot; /&gt; However, by the mid-1990s, ''CUCS'' had been usurped by rival factions and ultimately broke up. Since that time, the ''[[Curva (stadia)|Curva]] Sud'' of the Stadio Olimpico has been controlled by more right-wing groups,&lt;ref name = &quot;fans&quot; /&gt; including ''A.S. Roma Ultras'', ''Boys'' and ''Giovinezza'', among others. However, the oldest group, ''Fedayn'', is apolitical, and politics is not the main identity of Roma, just a part of their overall identity. Besides ultras groups, it is believed Roma fans support the [[left-wing politics|left]] as opposed to Lazio supporters, which are notoriously proud of their right-wing affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.bleacherreport.com/articles/1730264-why-roma-lazio-is-one-of-world-footballs-fiercest-rivalries|title=Why Roma-Lazio Is One of World Football's Fiercest Rivalries|first=Christopher|last=Impiglia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Roma's ultras and their Lazio counterparts boycotted Roma's 1–0 victory in the ''[[Derby della Capitale]]'' in protest at new safety measures imposed at the Stadio Olimpico. The measures – imposed by Rome's prefect, Franco Gabrielli – had involved plastic glass dividing walls being installed in both the Curva Sud and Curva Nord, splitting the sections behind each goal in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/nov/09/roma-deserted-derby-lazio-ultras-make-point|title=Roma win a deserted derby over Lazio as Ultras on both sides make point|first=Paolo|last=Bandini|date=9 November 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sets of ultras continued their protests for the rest of the season, including during Roma's 4–1 victory in the return fixture. Lazio's ultras returned to the Curva Nord for Roma's 1–4 victory in December 2016, but the Roma ultras continue to boycott matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/dec/05/lazio-roma-derby-serie-a|title=Not such a beautiful game: Lazio v Roma derby descends into disrepute|first=Paolo|last=Bandini|date=5 December 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OlimpicoRoma.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]] during a Roma match]]
The most known club anthem is &quot;Roma (non-si discute, si ama)&quot;, also known as &quot;Roma Roma&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonoromanista.it/wiki/Inno_As_Roma |title=Inno AS Roma |website=Sonoromanista.it (AS Roma fans' social network) |accessdate=26 October 2013 |language=it |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200229/http://www.sonoromanista.it/wiki/Inno_As_Roma |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-US/Squadra.aspx?IdSquadra=7&amp;SEOTeamName=AS+Roma |publisher=Goal.com |title=Roma Profile |date=April 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926103919/http://www.goal.com/en-us/Squadra.aspx?IdSquadra=7 |archivedate=26 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by singer [[Antonello Venditti]]. The title roughly means, &quot;Roma is not to be questioned, it is to be loved,&quot; and it is sung before each match. The song &quot;Grazie Roma&quot;, by the same singer, is played at the end of victorious home matches. Recently, the main riff of [[The White Stripes]]' song &quot;[[Seven Nation Army]]&quot; has also become widely popular at matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indie-rock.it/news_look.php?id=408|publisher=Indie-Rock.it|title='Seven Nation Army' coro dei tifosi romanisti|date=29 June 2007|access-date=20 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917074256/http://www.indie-rock.it/news_look.php?id=408|archive-date=17 September 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===
In Italian football, Roma is a club with many rivalries; first and foremost is their rivalry with Lazio, the club with whom they share the Stadio Olimpico. The [[Local derby|derby]] between the two is called the ''[[Derby della Capitale]]'', it is amongst the most heated and emotional [[Major football rivalries|footballing rivalries]] in the world. The fixture has seen some occasional instances of violence in the past, including the death of Lazio fan Vincenzo Paparelli in [[1979–80 Serie A|1979–80]] as a result of an [[Flare gun|emergency flare]] fired from the Curva Sud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ultraslazio.it/ukstory.htm |publisher=UltrasLazio.it |title=Ultras History |date=29 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616011746/http://www.ultraslazio.it/ukstory.htm |archivedate=16 June 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the abandonment of a match in March 2004 following unfounded rumours of a fatality which led to violence outside the stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;derby&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footballinrome.co.uk/news.html |publisher=FootballInRome.co.uk |title=22 March: Derby confusion |date=29 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921161253/http://www.footballinrome.co.uk/news.html |archivedate=21 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against Napoli, Roma also compete in the ''[[Derby del Sole]]'', meaning the &quot;Derby of the Sun&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.footballderbies.com/index.php?country=2|publisher=FootballDerbies.com|title=Football Derby matches in Italy|date=29 June 2007|access-date=20 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327170654/http://footballderbies.com/index.php?country=2|archive-date=27 March 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, fans also consider other Serie A giants like Juventus (a rivalry born especially in the 1980s), Milan and Internazionale (increased in recent years) among their rivals, as these four compete for the top four spots in the league table to secure a spot in the UEFA Champions League.&lt;ref name=&quot;fans&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://website.lineone.net/~view_from_the_terrace/italsce.html |publisher=View from the Terrace |title=Italian Ultras Scene |date=29 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508122124/http://website.lineone.net/~view_from_the_terrace/italsce.html |archivedate=8 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hooliganism===
Rivalries with other teams have escalated into serious violence. A group of ultras who label themselves the Fedayn — 'the devotees' — after a group of long-forgotten Iranian guerrilla fighters are regarded to be responsible for the organised hooliganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/champions-league/they-were-throwing-rocks-wielding-iron-bars-the-sordid-history-of-romas-ultras-as-liverpool-fans-head-to-rome-36863134.html|title='They were throwing rocks, wielding iron bars' - The sordid history of Roma's Ultras as Liverpool fans head to Rome|work=Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/liverpool-fans-roma-travel-advice-tickets-champions-league-semifinal-a8329076.html|title=Instead of 'why always Liverpool?’ we should be asking 'why always Rome?’|date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43910787|title=Roma v Liverpool: Roma's passionate support blighted by a violent minority|date=1 May 2018|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Daniele De Santis, a Roma ultra, was convicted of shooting Ciro Esposito and two others during clashes with Napoli fans who were in Rome for their club's [[2014 Coppa Italia Final|Coppa Italia final]] against Fiorentina. Esposito died of his wounds. De Santis was sentenced to 26 years in prison, later reduced to 16 years on appeal. Roma ultras have displayed banners celebrating De Santis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/football-hooligan-jailed-italy-2786699-May2016/|title=Notorious football hooligan given 26 years in prison for shooting rival fan|last=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been multiple instances of Roma [[ultras]] attacking supporters of foreign clubs when playing in Rome. These attacks have regularly featured the Roma ultras using knives, poles, flares, bottles and stones on unarmed foreign supporters, resulting in multiple hospitalisations. Home games against Liverpool in 1984 and 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/disgrace-of-rome-708305|title=DISGRACE OF ROME|work=Daily Mirror|date=5 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times call for final move&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesonline.typepad.com/thegame/2009/03/ahead-of-the-14.html|title=Times call for final move|date=19 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100915024920/http://timesonline.typepad.com/thegame/2009/03/ahead-of-the-14.html|archivedate=15 September 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middlesbrough in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/boro-fans-roma-flashback-disgusting-9804329|title=Boro fans in Roma: Flashback to disgusting treatment on European trip|last=Barley|first=Sophie|date=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manchester United in 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;inews.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/roma-vs-liverpool-2001-rome-travel-advice-warning-stabbings-ultras-carabinieri/|title=A warning to Liverpool fans travelling to Rome – from one who was there in 2001|date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/apr/05/world.championsleague20062007|title=Inquiry launched after violent clashes see English fans stabbed and beaten|last=Walker|first=Michael|date=5 April 2007|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal in 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;Times call for final move&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7938851.stm|title=Arsenal fan attacked in Rome|date=12 March 2009|accessdate=5 January 2010|work=BBC News|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tottenham Hotspur in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/10411146/Italian-football-hooligans-jailed-for-unprovoked-attack-on-Tottenham-Hotspur-fans-in-Rome.html|title=Italian football hooligans jailed for unprovoked attack on Tottenham Hotspur fans in Rome|last=Squires|first=Nick|date=29 October 2013|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20442906|title=Tottenham fans injured in Rome|date=22 November 2012|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chelsea in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/roma-fans-attack-chelsea-supporters-in-pub-brawl-in-rome-70895|title=Roma fans attack Chelsea supporters in pub brawl in Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt; have all resulted in multiple stabbings and other injuries to foreign supporters.

[[File:Storico AS Roma.svg|thumb|300px|Historical A.S. Roma positions in Serie A]]
Francesco Totti currently holds Roma's official appearance record, having made 785 appearances in all competitions, over the course of 25 seasons from 1993 until 2017.&lt;ref name = uefa/&gt; He also holds the record for Serie A appearances with 618, as he passed [[Giacomo Losi]] on 1 March 2008 during a home match against Parma.&lt;ref name=&quot;totti_record&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080301/sp_soccer_afp/fblita |work=[[Yahoo!

Including all competitions, Totti is the all-time leading goalscorer for Roma with 307 goals since joining the club, 250 of which were scored in Serie A (another Roma record).&lt;ref name = uefa/&gt; [[Roberto Pruzzo]], who was the all-time topscorer since 1988, comes in second in all competitions with 138. In 1930–31, [[Rodolfo Volk]] scored 29 goals in Serie A over the course of a single season. Not only was Volk the league's top scorer that year, he also set a Roma record for most goals scored in a season which would later be matched by [[Edin Džeko]] in [[2016–17 A.S. Roma season|2016–17]].

Its major founders Fortitudo and Alba having been relegated at the end of 1926–27 campaign, new-founded Roma had to take part to Southern First Division championship (Serie B) for its inaugural season. Nevertheless, the FIGC decided on a special enlargement of first level division re-admitting AS Roma and SSC Napoli. The first ever official matches participated in by Roma was in the [[Divisione Nazionale|National Division]], the predecessor of Serie A, of [[Divisione Nazionale 1927–28|1927–28]], against [[A.S.

Since 1999, during Franco Sensi's period in charge, Associazione Sportiva Roma has been a listed [[Società per azioni]] on [[Borsa Italiana]]. From 2004 to 2011, Roma's [[share (finance)|share]]s are distributed between; 67.1% to Compagnia Italpetroli SpA (the Sensi family ''[[Holding company|holding]]''; [[Banca di Roma]] later acquired 49% stake on Italpetroli due to debt restructuring) and 32.9% to other public shareholders.

Along with Lazio and Juventus, Roma is one of only three quotated Italian clubs. According to [[Deloitte Football Money League|The Football Money League]] published by consultants [[Deloitte]], in the 2010–11 season, Roma was the 15th highest-earning football club in the world with an [[Deloitte Football Money League#Full listing|estimated revenue]] of €143.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedKingdom/Local%20Assets/Documents/Industries/Sports%20Business%20Group/uk-sbg-dfml-2012-final.pdf |publisher=Deloitte |title=Football Money League |date=February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202185629/http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedKingdom/Local%20Assets/Documents/Industries/Sports%20Business%20Group/uk-sbg-dfml-2012-final.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, after months of speculation, [[George Soros]] was confirmed by Rosella Sensi, CEO of Italian Serie A association football club A.S. Roma, to be bidding for a takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Roma/Primo_Piano/2008/04_Aprile/18/puntoroma.shtml |language=Italian |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |accessdate=26 April 2008|date=18 April 2008| title=La stretta finale di Soros distrae lo sprint della Roma| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080421190310/http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Roma/Primo_Piano/2008/04_Aprile/18/puntoroma.shtml| archivedate= 21 April 2008|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The takeover bid was successively rejected by the Sensi family, who instead preferred to maintain the club's ownership. On 17 August 2008 club chairman and owner [[Franco Sensi]] died after a long illness; his place at the chairmanship of the club was successively taken by his daughter Rosella.

Since the takeover in 2011, NEEP Roma Holding S.p.A. has owned all shares Sensi previously hold. NEEP, itself a joint venture, was held by DiBenedetto AS Roma LLC (later renamed to AS Roma SPV, LLC) and [[Unicredit]] in 60–40 ratio from 2011 to 2013, which the former had four real person shareholders in equal ratio, led by future Roma president [[Thomas R. DiBenedetto]] (2011–12). The takeover also activated a mandatory bid of shares from the general public, however not all minority shareholders were willing to sell their shares. The mandatory bid meant NEEP held 78.038% of shares of AS Roma (increased from 67.1% of the Sensi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consob.it/mainen/issuers/listed_companies/index.html?codconsob=117470|publisher=Consob|title=A.S.

Since re-capitalization in 2003–04, Roma had a short-lived financial self-sustainability, until the takeover in 2011. The club had set up a special amortisation fund using [[Articolo 18-bis Legge 91/1981]] mainly for the abnormal signings prior 2002–03 season, (such as [[Davide Bombardini]] for €11&amp;nbsp;million account value in June 2002, when the flopped player exchange boosted 2001–02 season result) and the tax payment of 2002–03 was rescheduled. In 2004–05, Roma made a net profit of €10,091,689 and followed by €804,285 in 2005–06.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/bilanci_e_relazioni/2006-11-06_bilancio_di_esercizio_al_30_giugno_2006.pdf|title=Bilancio di esercizio al 30 giugno 2006|date=6 November 2006|accessdate=24 September 2011|work=AS Roma|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006–07 season the accounting method changed to IFRS, which meant that the 2005–06 result was reclassified as net loss of €4,051,905 and 2006–07 season was net income of €10,135,539 (€14.011&amp;nbsp;million as a group).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/bilanci_e_relazioni/2007-12-07_bilancio_di_esercizio_e_consolidato_al_30_giugno_2007.pdf |title=Bilancio di esercizio e consolidato al 30 giugno 2007 |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |work=AS Roma |language=Italian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608041017/http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/bilanci_e_relazioni/2007-12-07_bilancio_di_esercizio_e_consolidato_al_30_giugno_2007.pdf |archivedate=8 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the special fund (€80,189,123) was removed from the asset and co-currently for the equity as scheduled, meant Roma group had a negative equity of €8.795&amp;nbsp;million on 30 June 2007. Nevertheless, the club had sold the brand to a subsidiary which boost the profit in a separate financial statement, which ''[[La Repubblica]]'' described as &quot;doping&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/sport/calcio/doping-bilanci/doping-bilanci/doping-bilanci.html|title=Il &quot;doping&quot; nei conti dei big del pallone perdite complessive oltre i 68 milioni|date=9 November 2006|access-date=8 April 2018|work=La Repubblica|publisher=Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007–08, Roma made a net income of €18,699,219.

In the 2010–11 season, Roma was administrated by UniCredit as the Sensi family failed to repay the bank and the club was put on the market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c089b228-8786-11df-9f37-00144feabdc0|title= Roma football club on brink of UniCredit takeover |date=5 July 2010|access-date=8 April 2018|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were expected to have a quiet transfer window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-italy-roma/update-1-soccer-as-roma-set-for-sale-in-proposed-bank-deal-idUSLDE66726F20100708|title=AS Roma set for sale in proposed bank deal|date=9 July 2010|access-date=8 April 2018|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently with no selling profit on the players, Roma's net loss rose to €30,589,137 (€30.778&amp;nbsp;million as a group) and the new owner already planned a re-capitalization after the mandatory bid on the shares. On the positive side, TV income was increased from €75,150,744 to €78,041,642, and gate income increased from €23,821,218 to €31,017,179. This was because Roma entered [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|2010–11 Champions League]], which counter-weighed the effect of the new collective agreement of Serie A. In 2011–12, the renewal of squad and participation in [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League]] had worsened the financial result, which the €50&amp;nbsp;million capital increase (in advance) was counter-weighted totally by the net loss. In the 2012–13 season, the participation in domestic league only, was not only not harmful to the revenue but increase in gate income as well as decrease in wage bill, however Roma still did not yet break even (€40.130&amp;nbsp;million net loss in consolidated accounts). NEEP Roma also re-capitalized AS Roma in advance for another €26,550,000 during 2012–13.
