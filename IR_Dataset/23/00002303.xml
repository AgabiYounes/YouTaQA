More specifically, it is part of the [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic group]], which also includes the [[Canaanite languages]] such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. The [[Aramaic alphabet]] was widely adopted for other languages and is ancestral to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and [[Arabic alphabet]]s. During its approximately 3,100 years of written history,&lt;ref&gt;Beyer (1986: 11) suggests that written Aramaic probably dates from the 11th century BC, as it is established by the 10th century, to which he dates the oldest inscriptions of northern Syria. Heinrichs (1990: x) uses the less controversial date of the 9th century, for which there is clear and widespread attestation.&lt;/ref&gt; Aramaic has served variously as a language of administration of empires, as a language of divine worship and religious study, and as the spoken tongue of a number of [[Semitic people]]s from the [[Near East]].

Historically, Aramaic was the language of the [[Arameans]], a Semitic-speaking people of the region between the northern [[Levant]] and the northern [[Tigris]] valley. By around 1000 BC, the Arameans had a string of kingdoms in what is now part of [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Aramaic rose to prominence under the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC), under whose influence Aramaic became a prestige language, and its use spread throughout most of [[Mesopotamia]] and the Levant. At its height, variants of Aramaic were spoken all over in what is today [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Eastern Arabia]], Northern Arabia, and to a lesser extent parts of southeast and south central [[Turkey]], and parts of northwest [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tsZdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT253&amp;dq |first=Hilary |last=Kilpatrick |chapter=Modernity in a Classical Arabic ''Adab'' Work, the ''Kitāb al-Aghānī'' |page=253 |isbn=9781136788123 |title=Tradition and Modernity in Arabic Language And Literature |editor-first=J.

The scribes of the Neo-Assyrian bureaucracy had also used Aramaic, and this practice—together with other administrative practices—was subsequently inherited by the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonians]] (605–539 BC), and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]] (539–323 BC). Mediated by scribes that had been trained in the language, highly standardized ''written'' Aramaic (in its Achaemenid form called [[Imperial Aramaic]]) progressively also become the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of trade and commerce throughout the Achaemenid territories, which extended as far east as the Indus valley. (That use of ''written'' Aramaic subsequently led to the adoption of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] and—as [[logogram]]s—some Aramaic vocabulary in the [[Pahlavi scripts]], which were used by several [[Middle Iranian languages]], including [[Parthian language|Parthian]], [[Middle Persian]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], and [[Khwarazmian language|Khwarazmian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chyet |first=Michael L. |author-link=Michael L.

Aramaic's long history and diverse and widespread use has led to the development of many divergent varieties, which are sometimes considered [[dialect]]s, though they have become distinct enough over time that they are now sometimes considered as separate [[language]]s. Therefore, there is not one singular, static Aramaic language; each time and place rather has had its own variation. The more widely spoken [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] forms are today largely restricted to [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], northeastern Syria, northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey, whilst the severely endangered [[Western Neo-Aramaic]] is spoken by small communities in northwestern Syria.

Certain dialects of Aramaic are also retained as a [[sacred language]] by certain religious communities. One of those liturgical dialects is [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], which besides being a living variant of Aramaic is also the liturgical language of [[Mandaeism]]. Significantly more widespread is [[Syriac language|Syriac]], the liturgical language of [[Syriac Christianity]], in particular the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]], [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Catholic Church]], the [[Maronite Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Beyer 1986: 38–43; Casey 1998: 83–6, 88, 89–93; Eerdmans 1975: 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Saint Thomas Christian denominations]] of [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2016/may/09/Bengaluru-Youth-Learn-Dying-Language-Preserve-It-934452.html |title=City Youth Learn Dying Language, Preserve It |newspaper=[[The New Indian Express]] |date=9 May 2016|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syriac was also the liturgical language of several now-extinct [[gnosticism|gnostic]] faiths, such as [[Manichaeism]].

[[Neo-Aramaic languages]] are still spoken today as a [[first language]] by many communities of Syriac Christians, [[Jews]] (in particular, the [[Kurdish Jews]]), and [[Mandaeans]] of [[Western Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;Heinrichs 1990: xi–xv; Beyer 1986: 53.&lt;/ref&gt; most numerously by Chaldeans, Syriacs and Assyrians with numbers of fluent speakers ranging approximately from 1 million to 2 million, with the main languages among Assyrians being [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] (590,000 speakers), [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] (240,000 speakers) and [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] (100,000 speakers), together with a number of smaller closely related languages with no more than 5,000 to 10,000 speakers between them. They have retained use of the once dominant lingua franca despite subsequent [[language shift]]s experienced throughout the [[Middle East]]. However, the Aramaic languages are now considered [[endangered language|endangered]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naby |first=Eden |publisher=Assyrian International News Agency |url=http://www.aina.org/articles/flftel.pdf |format=PDF |title=From Lingua Franca to Endangered Language |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The languages are used by the older generation, all beyond retirement age, and so could go extinct within a generation.

==Etymology==
&quot;Aram&quot; is used as a proper name of several people in the [[Torah]] (Hebrew Bible) including descendants of Shem ({{bibleverse|Genesis|10:22|KJV}}), Nahor ({{bibleverse|Genesis|22:21|KJV}}), and Jacob ({{bibleverse|1 Chronicles|7:34|KJV}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aram&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abarim-publications.com/Meaning/Aram.html#.VNL6xJ3F-So |title=The name Aram in the Bible |work=Abarim Publications |access-date=10 October 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929233320/http://www.fsmitha.com/h1/ch03-hyk2.htm |archive-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greeks did not use the term Aramaic, instead referring to “Syrians”.&lt;ref name=TN&gt;Nöldeke, 1871, p.115: “Die Griechen haben den Namen „Aramäer&quot; nie eigentlich gekannt; ausser Posidonius (dem Strabo folgt) nennt ihn uns nur noch ein andrer Orientale, Josephus (Ant. 1, 6, 4). Dass Homer bei den 'Ερεμβοι oder in den Worten eiv 'Αρίμοις an sie dächte, ist sehr unwahrscheinlich. Die Griechen nannten das Volk „Syrer&quot;.”&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Josephus]] and [[Strabo]] (the latter citing [[Posidonius]]) both stated that the “Syrians” called themselves “Arameans”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrade2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrade|first=Nathanael J.|title=Syrian Identity in the Greco-Roman World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ROhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7|date=25 July 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-24456-6|pages=7|quote=In the first century ce, Josephus noted that the legendary figure Aramus had ruled the Arameans, whom the “Greeks call Syrians.” Strabo, citing Posidonius, stated that the people named Syrians by the Greeks called themselves Arameans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, [[Antiquities of the Jews]], 1.144: &quot;Aram had the Aramites, which the Greeks called Syrians&quot; ({{lang-gr|Ἀραμαίους δὲ Ἄραμος ἔσχεν, οὓς Ἕλληνες Σύρους προσαγορεύουσιν}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, [[Geographica]], 1.2.34: &quot;But it would seem that the view of Poseidonius is best, for here he derives an etymology of the words from the kinship of the peoples and their common characteristics. For the nation of the Armenians and that of the Syrians and Arabians betray a close affinity, not only in their language, but in their mode of life and in their bodily build, and particularly wherever they live as close neighbours. Mesopotamia, which is inhabited by these three nations, gives proof of this, for in the case of these nations the similarity is particularly noticeable. And if, comparing the differences of latitude, there does exist a greater difference between the northern and the southern people of Mesopotamia than between these two peoples and the Syrians in the centre, still the common characteristics prevail. And, too, the Assyrians, the Arians, and the Aramaeans display a certain likeness both to those just mentioned and to each other. Indeed, Poseidonius conjectures that the names of these nations also are akin; for, says he, the people whom we call Syrians are by the Syrians themselves called Arimaeans and Arammaeans; and there is a resemblance between this name and those of the Armenians, the Arabians and the Erembians, since perhaps the ancient Greeks gave the name of Erembians to the Arabians, and since the very etymology of the word &quot;Erembian&quot; contributes to this result.&quot; ({{lang-gr|ἄριστα δ᾽ ἂν δόξειεν εἰπεῖν ὁ Ποσειδώνιος κἀνταῦθα ἀπὸ τῆς τῶν ἐθνῶν συγγενείας καὶ κοινότητος ἐτυμολογῶν. τὸ γὰρ τῶν Ἀρμενίων ἔθνος καὶ τὸ τῶν Σύρων καὶ Ἀράβων πολλὴν ὁμοφυλίαν ἐμφαίνει κατά τε τὴν διάλεκτον καὶ τοὺς βίους καὶ τοὺς τῶν σωμάτων χαρακτῆρας͵ καὶ μάλιστα καθὸ πλησιόχωροί εἰσι. δηλοῖ δ᾽ ἡ Μεσοποταμία ἐκ τῶν τριῶν συνεστῶσα τούτων ἐθνῶν· μάλιστα γὰρ ἐν τούτοις ἡ ὁμοιότης διαφαίνεται. εἰ δέ τις παρὰ τὰ κλίματα γίνεται διαφορὰ τοῖς προσβόρροις ἐπὶ πλέον πρὸς τοὺς μεσημβρινοὺς καὶ τούτοις πρὸς μέσους τοὺς ὅρους͵ ἀλλ᾽ ἐπικρατεῖ γε τὸ κοινόν. καὶ οἱ Ἀσσύριοι δὲ καὶ οἱ Ἀριανοὶ παραπλησίως πως ἔχουσι καὶ πρὸς τούτους καὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους. εἰκάζει γε δὴ καὶ τὰς τῶν ἐθνῶν τούτων κατονομασίας ἐμφερεῖς ἀλλήλαις εἶναι. τοὺς γὰρ ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν Σύρους καλουμένους ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν τῶν Σύρων Ἀραμμαίους καλεῖσθαι· τούτωι δ᾽ ἐοικέναι τοὺς Ἀρμενίους καὶ τοὺς Ἄραβας καὶ Ἐρεμβούς͵ τάχα τῶν πάλαι Ἑλλήνων οὕτω καλούντων τοὺς Ἄραβας͵ ἅμα καὶ τοῦ ἐτύμου συνεργοῦντος πρὸς τοῦτο.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, [[Geographica]], 16.4.27: &quot;Poseidonius says that the Arabians consist of three tribes, that they are situated in succession, one after another, and that this indicates that they are homogeneous with one another, and that for this reason they were called by similar names — one tribe &quot;Armenians,&quot; another &quot;Aramaeans,&quot; and another &quot;Arambians.&quot; And just as one may suppose that the Arabians were divided into three tribes, according to the differences in the latitudes, which ever vary more and more, so also one may suppose that they used several names instead of one. Neither are those who write &quot;Eremni&quot; plausible; for that name is more peculiarly applicable to the Aethiopians. The poet also mentions &quot;Arimi,&quot;by which, according to Poseidonius, we should interpret the poet as meaning, not some place in Syria or in Cilicia or in some other land, but Syria itself; for the people in Syria are Aramaeans, though perhaps the Greeks called them Arimaeans or Arimi.&quot; ({{lang-gr|πιθανώτερον δὲ Ποσειδώνιος γράφει τῶι παρὰ μικρὸν ἀλλάξαι καὶ Σιδονίους καὶ Ἀραμβούς͵ ὡς τοῦ ποιητοῦ τοὺς νῦν Ἄραβας οὕτω καλέσαντος͵ καθάπερ καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλων ὠνομάζοντο κατ᾽ αὐτόν. φησὶ δὲ ταῦτα τρία ἔθνη συνεχῆ ἀλλήλοις ἱδρυμένα ὁμογένειάν τινα ἐμφαίνειν πρὸς ἄλληλα͵ καὶ διὰ [τοῦ]το παρακειμένοις ὀνόμασι κεκλῆσθαι͵ τοὺς μὲν Ἀρμενίους τοὺς δὲ Ἀραμαίους τοὺς δὲ Ἀραμβούς· ὥσπερ δὲ ἀπὸ ἔθνους [ἑνὸς] ὑπολαμβάνειν ἐστὶν εἰς τρία διηιρῆσθαι κατὰ τὰς τῶν κλιμάτων διαφορὰς ἀεὶ καὶ μᾶλλον ἐξαλλαττομένων͵ οὕτω καὶ τοῖς ὀνόμασι χρήσασθαι πλείοσιν ἀνθ᾽ ἑνός. οὐδ᾽ οἱ Ἐρεμνοὺς γράφοντες πιθανοί· τῶν γὰρ Αἰθιόπων μᾶλλον ἴδιον. λέγει δὲ καὶ τοὺς Ἀρίμους ὁ ποιητής͵ οὕς φησι Ποσειδώνιος δέχεσθαι δεῖν μὴ τόπον τινὰ τῆς Συρίας ἢ τῆς Κιλικίας ἢ ἄλλης τινὸς γῆς͵ ἀλλὰ τὴν Συρίαν αὐτήν· Ἀραμαῖοι γὰρ οἱ ἐν αὐτῆι· τάχα δ᾽ οἱ Ἕλληνες Ἀριμαίους ἐκάλουν ἢ Ἀρίμους.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between Chaldean, Syriac, and Samaritan as &quot;Aramaic&quot; was first identified in 1679 by German theologian [[:de:Johann Wilhelm Hilliger|Johann Wilhelm Hilliger]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Nathaniel. “Early Oriental Studies in Europe and the Work of the American Oriental Society, 1842-1922.” Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 43, 1923, pp. 1–14.

Les habitants des pays situés entre la Méditerranée et l'Euphrate, se voyant désignés par une dénomination qui leur était étrangère, mais qui se trouvait en quelque sorte consacrée par l'autorité des livres qu'ils vénéraient à tant de titres, ne crurent pas sans doute pouvoir rejeter ce nom, et l'adoptèrent sans répugnance. Ils se persuadèrent que, régénérés par un nouveau culte, ils devaient sous tous les rapports devenir un peuple nouveau et abjurer leur nom antique, qui semblait leur rappeler l'idolâtrie à laquelle le christianisme venait de les arracher. Cette conjecture est, si je ne me trompe, confirmée par un fait que je crois décisif. Dans la langue syriaque ecclésiastique, le mot armoïo, ܐܪܡܝܐ, qui ne diffère du nom ancien, ormoïo, ܐܪܡܝܐ, que par une seule voyelle, désigne un païen, un idolâtre.

Ancient [[Aram (region)|Aram]], bordering northern Israel and what is now called Syria, is considered the linguistic center of Aramaic, the language of the Arameans who settled the area during the [[Bronze Age]] circa 3500 BC. The language is often mistakenly considered to have originated within Assyria (Iraq). In fact, Arameans carried their language and writing into Mesopotamia by voluntary migration, by forced exile of conquering armies, and by nomadic [[Chaldea]]n invasions of Babylonia during the period from 1200 to 1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h1/ch03-hyk2.htm |title=Hittites, Assyrians and Aramaeans |work=fsmitha.com |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian [[New Testament]] uses the [[Koine Greek]] phrase {{lang|grc|Ἑβραϊστί}} ''Hebraïstí'' to denote &quot;Aramaic&quot;, as Aramaic was at that time the language commonly spoken by the [[Jews]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aram&quot;/&gt; The [[History of the Jews in Egypt#Ptolemaic and Roman|Hellenized Jewish community of Alexandria]] instead translated &quot;Aramaic&quot; to &quot;the Syrian tongue&quot;.

During the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]s, [[Arameans]], the native speakers of Aramaic, began to settle in greater numbers, at first in [[Babylonia]], and later in [[Assyria]] ([[Upper Mesopotamia]], modern-day northern [[Iraq]], northeast [[Syria]], northwest [[Iran]], and south eastern [[Turkey]] (what was Armenia at the time).&lt;ref name=Richardp69/&gt; The influx eventually resulted in the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC) adopting an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-influenced [[Old Aramaic language#Imperial Aramaic|Imperial Aramaic]] as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of its empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32HS_jUi4NEC&amp;pg=PA88 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |year=2008 |isbn=9781465316295 |first=George V. |last=Yana |title=Ancient and Modern Assyrians: A Scientific Analysis |page=88 |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was continued by the short-lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and [[Medes]], and all three empires became operationally bilingual in written sources, with Aramaic used alongside Akkadian.

Aramaic also continues to be spoken by the Assyrians of Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and northwest Iran, with diaspora communities in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and southern [[Russia]]. The [[Mandaeans]] also continue to use [[Mandaic language|Mandaic Aramaic]] as a liturgical language, although most now speak Arabic as their [[first language]]. There are still also a small number of first-language speakers of [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic varieties]] in isolated villages in western Syria.

The turbulence of the last two centuries (particularly the [[Assyrian genocide]]) has seen speakers of first-language and literary Aramaic dispersed throughout the world. However, there are a number of sizable Assyrian towns in northern Iraq such as [[Alqosh]], [[Bakhdida]], [[Bartella]], [[Tesqopa]], and [[Tel Keppe]], and numerous small villages, where Aramaic is still the main spoken language, and many large cities in this region also have Assyrian Aramaic-speaking communities, particularly [[Mosul]], [[Erbil]], [[Kirkuk]], [[Dohuk]], and [[al-Hasakah]]. In Modern Israel, the only native Aramaic speaking population are the [[Kurdish Jews]], although the language is dying out.&lt;ref&gt;[The last of the Aramaic speakers] By MIRIAM SHAVIV, 14 July 2013, Times of Israel&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aramaic is also experiencing a revival among [[Maronites in Israel]] in [[Jish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 November 2014 |title=Aramaic Israelis seek to revive endangered language of Jesus |url=https://www.jpost.com/Christian-News/Aramaic-Israelis-seek-to-revive-endangered-language-of-Jesus-381229 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aramaic languages and dialects===
[[File:YeshuaDSS.gif|thumb|&quot;[[Jesus]]&quot; in Jewish Aramaic]]
Aramaic is often spoken of as a single language, but is in reality a group of related languages.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Some Aramaic languages differ more from each other than the [[Romance languages]] do among themselves. Its long history, extensive literature, and use by different religious communities are all factors in the diversification of the language. Some Aramaic dialects are mutually intelligible, whereas others are not, not unlike the situation with modern [[varieties of Arabic]]. Some Aramaic languages are known under different names; for example, [[Syriac language|Syriac]] is particularly used to describe the [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic variety]] used in Christian ethnic communities in Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria, and northwestern Iran, and [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in India. Most dialects can be described as either &quot;Eastern&quot; or &quot;Western&quot;, the dividing line being roughly the [[Euphrates]], or slightly west of it. It is also helpful to draw a distinction between those Aramaic languages that are modern living languages (often called &quot;Neo-Aramaic&quot;), those that are still in use as literary languages, and those that are extinct and are only of interest to scholars. Although there are some exceptions to this rule, this classification gives &quot;Modern&quot;, &quot;Middle&quot;, and &quot;Old&quot; periods, alongside &quot;Eastern&quot; and &quot;Western&quot; areas, to distinguish between the various languages and dialects that are Aramaic.

==Writing system==
{{Main|Aramaic alphabet}}

[[File:Syriac Sertâ book script.jpg|left|thumb|11th century book in [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac Serto]]]]
The earliest Aramaic alphabet was based on the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In time, Aramaic developed its distinctive &quot;square&quot; style. The ancient Israelites and other peoples of [[Canaan]] adopted this alphabet for writing their own languages. Thus, it is better known as the [[Hebrew alphabet]] today. This is the writing system used in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and other Jewish writing in Aramaic. The other main writing system used for Aramaic was developed by Christian communities: a cursive form known as the [[Syriac alphabet]]. A highly modified form of the Aramaic alphabet, the [[Mandaic alphabet]], is used by the [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]].

In addition to these writing systems, certain derivatives of the Aramaic alphabet were used in ancient times by particular groups: the [[Nabataean alphabet]] in [[Petra]] and the [[Palmyrene alphabet]] in [[Palmyra]]. In modern times, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] (see [[#Modern Eastern Aramaic|below]]) has sometimes been written in a [[Latin script]].

The history of Aramaic is broken down into three broad periods:
*[[#Old Aramaic|Old Aramaic]] (1100 BC–200 AD), including:
** Ancient inscriptions of the [[Arameans|Aramean]] city-states.
**[[Imperial Aramaic]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].
**The [[Biblical Aramaic]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].
** The [[Language of Jesus|Aramaic of Jesus]] ([[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]]).
* [[#Middle Aramaic|Middle Aramaic]] (200–1200), including:
** Literary [[Syriac language|Syriac]].
** The Aramaic of the [[Talmud]]im, [[Targum]]im, and [[Midrash]]im.
** [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]].
* [[#Modern Aramaic|Modern Aramaic]] (1200–present), including:
** Various modern vernaculars.

This classification is based on that used by Klaus Beyer.

==Old Aramaic==
{{Main|Old Aramaic language}}
The term &quot;Old Aramaic&quot; is used to describe the varieties of the language from its first known use until the point roughly marked by the rise of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224 AD), dominating the influential, eastern dialect region. As such, the term covers over thirteen centuries of the development of Aramaic. This vast time span includes all Aramaic that is now effectively extinct.

The central phase in the development of Old Aramaic was its official use by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (500–330 BC). The period before this, dubbed &quot;Ancient Aramaic&quot;, saw the development of the language from being spoken in Aramaean city-states to become a major means of communication in diplomacy and trade throughout [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, local vernaculars became increasingly prominent, fanning the divergence of an Aramaic [[dialect continuum]] and the development of differing written standards.

===Ancient Aramaic===
&quot;Ancient Aramaic&quot; refers to the earliest known period of the language, from its origin until it becomes the lingua franca of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. It was the language of the Aramean city-states of [[Damascus]], [[Hama]]th and [[Arpad, Syria|Arpad]].

[[File:Bar-rakib.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ingot|Silver ingot]] of Bar-Rakib, son of Panammuwa II,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/Documents/pagedocs/JANES/1986%2018/Younger18.pdf |title=Panammuwa and Bar-Rakib: Two Structural Analyses |first=K.

There are inscriptions that evidence the earliest use of the language, dating from the 10th century BC. These inscriptions are mostly diplomatic documents between Aramaean city-states. The alphabet of Aramaic at this early period seems to be based on the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and there is a unity in the written language. It seems that, in time, a more refined alphabet, suited to the needs of the language, began to develop from this in the eastern regions of Aram. Due to increasing Aramean migration eastward, the Western periphery of Assyria became bilingual in Akkadian and Aramean at least as early as the mid-9th century BC. As the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] conquered Aramean lands west of the [[Euphrates]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] made Aramaic the Empire's second official language, and it eventually supplanted Akkadian completely.

From 700 BC, the language began to spread in all directions, but lost much of its unity. Different dialects emerged in Assyria, Babylonia, the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]. Around 600 BC, Adon, a [[Canaan]]ite king, used Aramaic to write to an Egyptian [[Pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Klaus |last=Beyer |title=The Aramaic Language, Its Distribution and Subdivisions |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht Gottingen |year=1986 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=gCFjAAAAMAAJ |translator-first=John F. |translator-last=Healey |isbn=9783525535738 |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Chaldee&quot; or &quot;Chaldean Aramaic&quot; used to be common terms for the Aramaic of the Chaldean dynasty of [[Babylonia]]. It was used to describe [[Biblical Aramaic]], which was, however, written in a later style. It is not to be confused with the modern language [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]].

===Imperial Aramaic===
{{Aramaeans}}
Around 500 BC, following the Achaemenid (Persian) conquest of Mesopotamia under [[Darius I]], Aramaic (as had been used in that region) was adopted by the conquerors as the &quot;vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed Official Aramaic or [[Old Aramaic language#Imperial Aramaic|Imperial Aramaic]], can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenids in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica |volume=2 |year=1987 |title=Aramaic |pages=251–252 |chapter=Aramaic |last=Shaked |first=Saul |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |location=New York |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/aramaic- |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Richard Frye questioned the classification of Imperial Aramaic as an &quot;official language&quot;, noting that no surviving edict expressly and unambiguously accorded that status to any particular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frye |first=Richard N. |title=Review of G. R. Driver's 'Aramaic Documents of the Fifth Century B. C.' |journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies |volume=18 |issue=3/4 |year=1955 |page=457 |doi=10.2307/2718444 |last2=Driver |first2=G. R. |jstor=2718444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frye reclassifies Imperial Aramaic as the lingua franca of the Achaemenid territories, suggesting then that the Achaemenid-era use of Aramaic was more pervasive than generally thought.

Imperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect, and the inevitable influence of [[Persian language|Persian]] gave the language a new clarity and robust flexibility. For centuries after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire (in 331 BC), Imperial Aramaic – or a version thereof near enough for it to be recognisable – would remain an influence on the various native [[Iranian languages]]. Aramaic script and – as ideograms – Aramaic vocabulary would survive as the essential characteristics of the [[Pahlavi scripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1-link= Wilhelm Geiger |first1= Wilhelm |last1= Geiger |first2= Ernst |last2= Kuhn |year= 2002 |title= Grundriss der iranischen Philologie: Band I. Abteilung 1 |location= Boston |publisher= Adamant |page= 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest collections of Imperial Aramaic texts is that of the [[Persepolis]] fortification tablets, which number about five hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= John A. Matthew |last= Stolper |title= What are the Persepolis Fortification Tablets? |journal= The Oriental Studies News &amp; Notes |issue= winter |year= 2007 |pages= 6–9 |url= https://persepolistablets.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-are-persepolis-fortication.html |access-date= 10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the extant documents witnessing to this form of Aramaic come from [[Egypt]], and [[Elephantine]] in particular (see [[Elephantine papyri]]). Of them, the best known is the ''[[Story of Ahikar]]'', a book of instructive aphorisms quite similar in style to the biblical [[Book of Proverbs]]. In addition, current consensus regards the Aramaic portion of the Biblical book of Daniel (i.e., 2:4b-7:28) as an example of Imperial (Official) Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=John J.|date=1993|title=Review of The Aramaic of Daniel in the Light of Old Aramaic|url=|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=112|pages=711, 712|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achaemenid Aramaic is sufficiently uniform that it is often difficult to know where any particular example of the language was written. Only careful examination reveals the occasional loan word from a local language.

A group of thirty Aramaic documents from [[Bactria]] have been discovered, and an analysis was published in November 2006. The texts, which were rendered on leather, reflect the use of Aramaic in the 4th century BC Achaemenid administration of Bactria and [[Sogdia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ancient Aramaic Documents from Bactria |series= Studies in the Khalili Collection |last1= Naveh |first1= Joseph |last2= Shaked |first2= Shaul |isbn= 1-874780-74-9 |publisher= Khalili Collections |location= Oxford |year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biblical Aramaic ===
[[Biblical Aramaic]] is the Aramaic found in four discrete sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]:

* [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] {{bibleref2-nb|Ezra|4:8–6:18|NKJV}} and {{bibleref2-nb|Ezra|7:12–26|KJV}} – documents from the Achaemenid period (5th century BC) concerning the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem.
* [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] {{bibleref2-nb|Daniel|2:4b–7:28|NKJV}} – five subversive tales and an apocalyptic vision.
* [[Jeremiah 10:11]] – a single sentence in the middle of a Hebrew text denouncing idolatry.
* [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleref2-nb|Genesis|31:47}} – translation of a Hebrew place-name.

Biblical Aramaic is a somewhat hybrid dialect. It is theorized that some Biblical Aramaic material originated in both Babylonia and Judaea before the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty.

===Post-Achaemenid Aramaic===
[[File:Alexander Aramaic coin.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Alexander the Great]] bearing an Aramaic language inscription]]
[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|Bilingual inscription (Greek and Aramaic) by the [[ancient India|Indian]] king [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]], 3rd century BC at [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
[[File:Targum.jpg|right|thumb|11th century [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Targum]] intercalated between verses of Hebrew text]]
The conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] did not destroy the unity of Aramaic language and literature immediately. Aramaic that bears a relatively close resemblance to that of the 5th century BC can be found right up to the early 2nd century BC. The [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] imposed [[Greek language|Greek]] in the administration of [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]] from the start of their rule. In the 3rd century BC, Greek overtook Aramaic as the common{{clarify|date=August 2016}}&lt;!--Common in what sense? Administrative? But that began in the 5th century. Vernacular / generally used? But Coptic was the vernacular of the non-Greek majority in Egypt, and Aramaic was the vernacular of the non-Greek majority in Syria.--&gt; language in Egypt and Syria. However, a post-Achaemenid Aramaic continued to flourish from [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]], Assyria, Mesopotamia, through the Syrian Desert and into northern [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].

Under the category of post-Achaemenid is Hasmonaean Aramaic, the official administrative language of [[Hasmonean|Hasmonaean]] Judaea (142–37 BC), alongside [[Hebrew]] which was the language preferred on coinage and other public uses. It influenced the Biblical Aramaic of the [[Qumran]] texts, and was the main language of non-biblical theological texts of that community. The major [[Targum]]s, translations of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, were originally composed in Hasmonaean. Hasmonaean also appears in quotations in the [[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]], although smoothed into its later context. It is written quite differently from Achaemenid Aramaic; there is an emphasis on writing as words are pronounced rather than using etymological forms.

Babylonian [[Targum]]ic is the later post-Achaemenid dialect found in the [[Targum Onkelos|Targum Onqelos]] and [[Targum Jonathan]], the &quot;official&quot; targums. The original, Hasmonaean targums had reached Babylon sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century AD. They were then reworked according to the contemporary dialect of Babylon to create the language of the standard targums. This combination formed the basis of Babylonian Jewish literature for centuries to follow.

Galilean Targumic is similar to Babylonian Targumic. It is the mixing of literary Hasmonaean with the dialect of [[Galilee]]. The Hasmonaean targums reached Galilee in the 2nd century AD, and were reworked into this Galilean dialect for local use. The Galilean Targum was not considered an authoritative work by other communities, and documentary evidence shows that its text was amended. From the 11th century AD onwards, once the Babylonian Targum had become normative, the Galilean version became heavily influenced by it.

Babylonian Documentary Aramaic is a dialect in use from the 3rd century AD onwards. It is the dialect of Babylonian private documents, and, from the 12th century, all Jewish private documents are in Aramaic. It is based on Hasmonaean with very few changes. This was perhaps because many of the documents in BDA are legal documents, the language in them had to be sensible throughout the Jewish community from the start, and Hasmonaean was the old standard.

[[Nabataean Aramaic]] is the language of the Arameo-Arab kingdom of [[Petra]]. The kingdom (''c.'' 200 BC – 106 AD) covered the east bank of the [[Jordan River]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northern Arabia. Perhaps because of the importance of the caravan trade, the Nabataeans began to use Aramaic in preference to [[Ancient North Arabian|Old North Arabic]]. The dialect is based on Achaemenid with a little influence from Arabic: &quot;l&quot; is often turned into &quot;n&quot;, and there are a few Arabic loanwords. Some Nabataean Aramaic inscriptions exist from the early days of the kingdom, but most are from the first four centuries AD The language is written in a [[cursive]] script that is the precursor to the modern [[Arabic alphabet]]. The number of Arabic loanwords increases through the centuries, until, in the 4th century, Nabataean merges seamlessly with [[Arabic]].

Palmyrene Aramaic is the dialect that was in use in the [[Syriac Christians|Syriac]] city state of [[Palmyra]] in the Syrian Desert from 44 BC to 274 AD. It was written in a rounded script, which later gave way to cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]]. Like Nabataean, Palmyrene was influenced by Arabic, but to a much lesser degree.

The use of ''written'' Aramaic in the Achaemenid bureaucracy also precipitated the adoption of Aramaic(-derived) scripts to render a number of [[Middle Iranian]] languages. Moreover, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, continued to written as Aramaic &quot;words&quot; even when writing Middle Iranian languages. In time, in Iranian usage, these Aramaic &quot;words&quot; became disassociated from the Aramaic language and came to be understood as ''signs'' (i.e. [[logograms]]), much like the symbol '&amp;' is read as &quot;and&quot; in English and the original Latin ''et'' is now no longer obvious. Under the early 3rd-century BC [[Arsacid Empire|Parthians Arsacids]], whose government used Greek but whose native language was [[Parthian language|Parthian]], the Parthian language and its Aramaic-derived writing system both gained prestige. This in turn also led to the adoption of the name '[[Pahlavi scripts|pahlavi]]' (&lt; ''parthawi'', &quot;of the Parthians&quot;) for that writing system. The [[Sassanid empire|Persian Sassanids]], who succeeded the Parthian Arsacids in the mid-3rd century AD, subsequently inherited/adopted the Parthian-mediated Aramaic-derived writing system for their own Middle Iranian ethnolect as well.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer. p. 28 n. 27; {{cite book |title=Ancient Persia |pages=118–120 |last1=Wiesehöfer |first1=Josef |translator-last=Azodi |translator-first=Azizeh |isbn=9781860646751 |publisher=I.B. Taurus |year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=yFocMaM49SgC |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That particular Middle Iranian dialect, [[Middle Persian]], i.e. the language of Persia proper, subsequently also became a prestige language. Following the conquest of the Sassanids by the Arabs in the 7th-century, the Aramaic-derived writing system was replaced by Arabic script in all but [[Middle Persian literature|Zoroastrian usage]], which continued to use the name 'pahlavi' for the Aramaic-derived writing system and went on to create the bulk of all Middle Iranian literature in that writing system.

===Late Old Eastern Aramaic===
{{Main|Eastern Aramaic languages}}
[[File:Mandaic.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mandaic language|Mandaic]] [[Incantation bowl|magical &quot;demon trap&quot;]]]]
The dialects mentioned in the last section were all descended from Achaemenid Imperial Aramaic. However, the diverse regional dialects of Late Ancient Aramaic continued alongside these, often as simple, spoken languages. Early evidence for these spoken dialects is known only through their influence on words and names in a more standard dialect. However, these regional dialects became written languages in the 2nd century BC. These dialects reflect a stream of Aramaic that is not dependent on Imperial Aramaic, and shows a clear division between the regions of Mesopotamia, Babylon and the east, and Judah, Syria, and the west.

In the East, the dialects of Palmyrene and Arsacid Aramaic merged with the regional languages to create languages with a foot in Imperial and a foot in regional Aramaic. The written form of [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]], the language of the [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion, was descended from the Arsacid chancery script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Häberl |first=Charles G. |title=Iranian Scripts for Aramaic Languages: The Origin of the Mandaic Script |journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |issue=341 |date=February 2006 |pages=53–62 |jstor=25066933 |doi=10.7282/T37D2SGZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the kingdom of [[Osroene]], centred on [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and founded in 132 BC, the regional dialect became the official language: Old [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. On the upper reaches of the [[Tigris]], East Mesopotamian Aramaic flourished, with evidence from [[Hatra]], [[Assur]] and the [[Tur Abdin]]. [[Tatian]], the author of the gospel harmony the [[Diatessaron]] came from Assyria, and perhaps wrote his work (172 AD) in East Mesopotamian rather than Syriac or Greek. In Babylonia, the regional dialect was used by the Jewish community, Jewish Old Babylonian (from ''c.'' 70 AD). This everyday language increasingly came under the influence of Biblical Aramaic and Babylonian Targumic.

===Late Old Western Aramaic===
{{Main|Western Aramaic languages}}
The western regional dialects of Aramaic followed a similar course to those of the east. They are quite distinct from the eastern dialects and Imperial Aramaic. Aramaic came to coexist with Canaanite dialects, eventually completely displacing [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] in the first century BC and [[Hebrew language#Aramaic displaces Hebrew as a spoken language|Hebrew]] around the turn of the fourth century AD.

The form of Late Old Western Aramaic used by the Jewish community is best attested, and is usually referred to as Jewish Old Palestinian. Its oldest form is Old East Jordanian, which probably comes from the region of [[Caesarea Philippi]]. This is the dialect of the oldest manuscript of the [[Book of Enoch]] (''c.'' 170 BC). The next distinct phase of the language is called Old Judaean into the second century AD. Old Judean literature can be found in various inscriptions and personal letters, preserved quotations in the [[Talmud]] and receipts from [[Qumran]]. [[Josephus]]' first, non-extant edition of his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' was written in Old Judean.

The Old East Jordanian dialect continued to be used into the first century AD by pagan communities living to the east of the Jordan. Their dialect is often then called Pagan Old Palestinian, and it was written in a cursive script somewhat similar to that used for Old Syriac. A Christian Old Palestinian dialect may have arisen from the pagan one, and this dialect may be behind some of the Western Aramaic tendencies found in the otherwise eastern Old Syriac gospels (see [[Peshitta]]).

====Languages during Jesus' lifetime====
{{Further|Language of Jesus}}
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

It is generally believed by Christian scholars that in the first century, Jews in [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] primarily spoke Aramaic with a decreasing number using [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as their first language, though many learned Hebrew as a liturgical language. Additionally, [[Koine Greek]] was the lingua franca of the Middle East in trade, among the Hellenized classes (much like French in the 18th,19th and 20th centuries in Europe), and in the Roman administration. [[Latin]], the language of the Roman army and higher levels of administration, had almost no impact on the linguistic landscape.

In addition to the formal, literary dialects of Aramaic based on [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] and Babylonian, there were a number of colloquial Aramaic dialects. Seven [[Western Aramaic languages|Western Aramaic varieties]] were spoken in the vicinity of Judea in [[Jesus]]' time. They were probably distinctive yet mutually intelligible. Old Judean was the prominent dialect of [[Jerusalem]] and Judaea. The region of [[Ein Gedi]] spoke the Southeast Judaean dialect. [[Samaria]] had its distinctive [[Samaritan Aramaic language|Samaritan Aramaic]], where the consonants &quot;[[he (letter)|he]]&quot;, &quot;{{Transl|sem|[[heth]]}}&quot; and &quot;‘[[ayin]]&quot; all became pronounced as &quot;[[aleph]]&quot;. Galilean Aramaic, the dialect of Jesus' home region, is only known from a few place names, the influences on Galilean Targumic, some rabbinic literature and a few private letters. It seems to have a number of distinctive features: [[diphthong]]s are never simplified into monophthongs. East of the Jordan, the various dialects of East Jordanian were spoken. In the region of [[Damascus]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]], Damascene Aramaic was spoken (deduced mostly from Modern Western Aramaic). Finally, as far north as [[Aleppo]], the western dialect of Orontes Aramaic was spoken.

The three languages, especially Hebrew and Aramaic, influenced one another through [[loanword]]s and [[semantic loans]]. Hebrew words entered Jewish Aramaic. Most were mostly technical religious words, but a few were everyday words like עץ ''{{transl|sem|ʿēṣ}}'' &quot;wood&quot;. Conversely, Aramaic words, such as ''māmmôn'' &quot;wealth&quot;, were borrowed into Hebrew, and Hebrew words acquired additional senses from Aramaic. For instance, Hebrew ראוי ''rā’ûi'' &quot;seen&quot; borrowed the sense &quot;worthy, seemly&quot; from the Aramaic ''{{Transl|sem|ḥzî}}'' meaning &quot;seen&quot; and &quot;worthy&quot;.

The Greek of the [[New Testament]] preserves some semiticisms, including transliterations of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] words. Some are Aramaic, like ''talitha'' (ταλιθα), which represents the noun טליתא ''{{Transl|sem|ṭalīṯā}}'' ({{Bibleverse|Mark|5:41|KJV}}), and others may be either Hebrew or Aramaic like רבוני ''Rabbounei'' (Ραββουνει), which means &quot;my master/great one/teacher&quot; in both languages ({{Bibleverse|John|20:16|KJV}}). Other examples:
* &quot;Talitha kumi&quot; (טליתא קומי) ({{Bibleverse|Mark|5:41|KJV}})
* &quot;Ephphatha&quot; (אתפתח) ({{Bibleverse|Mark|7:34|KJV}})
* &quot;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?&quot; (אלי, אלי, למה שבקתני?) ({{Bibleverse|Mark|15:34|KJV}})

The 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' used Aramaic for much of its dialogue, specially reconstructed by a scholar, [[William Fulco]], S.J. Where the appropriate words (in first-century Aramaic) were no longer known, he used the Aramaic of Daniel and fourth-century Syriac and Hebrew as the basis for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What's up with Aramaic? |date=25 February 2004 |url=http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/special_packages/passion_of_christ/8038021.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 April 2004 |access-date=10 October 2018 |work=Miami Herald |last=Darling |first=Cary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040403223353/http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/entertainment/special_packages/passion_of_christ/8038021.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Aramaic==
The 3rd century AD is taken as the threshold between Old and Middle Aramaic. During that century, the nature of the various Aramaic languages and dialects began to change. The descendants of Imperial Aramaic ceased to be living languages, and the eastern and western regional languages began to develop vital new literatures. Unlike many of the dialects of Old Aramaic, much is known about the vocabulary and grammar of Middle Aramaic.

===Eastern Middle Aramaic===
Only two of the Old Eastern Aramaic languages continued into this period. In the north of the region, Old Syriac transitioned into Middle Syriac. In the south, Jewish Old Babylonian became Jewish Middle Babylonian. The post-Achaemenid, Arsacid dialect became the background of the new [[Mandaic language]].

====Syriac====
{{Main|Syriac language}}
[[File:Estrangela.jpg|thumb|9th century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Syriac alphabet|Estrangela]] manuscript of [[John Chrysostom]]'s ''Homily on the [[Gospel of John]]'']]
{{listen|filename=aboun.ogg|title=Abun dbashmayo|description=The [[Lord's Prayer]], ''Abun dbashmayo'', sung in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]}}

Syriac (also &quot;Middle Syriac&quot;) is the classical, literary, liturgical and often spoken language of [[Syriac Christianity]] to this day, particularly the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Saint Thomas Christians]]. It originated in fifth century BC [[Achaemenid Assyria]], but its golden age was the fourth to sixth centuries. This period began with the translation of the Bible into the language: the [[Peshitta]] and the masterful prose and poetry of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. Middle Syriac became the language of those opposed to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] leadership of the [[Church of the East]]. Missionary activity by Assyrian and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christians]] led to the spread of Syriac from Mesopotamia and [[Iran|Persia]], into [[Central Asia]], [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and [[China]].

==== Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic ====
&lt;!-- This section is linked, this language was taken from the Aramaic language of the Byzantines from [[Halakha]] --&gt;
{{Main|Jewish Babylonian Aramaic}}
Jewish Middle Babylonian is the language employed by Jewish writers in Babylonia between the fourth and the eleventh century. It is most commonly identified with the language of the Babylonian [[Talmud]] (which was completed in the seventh century) and of post-Talmudic [[Geonim|Geonic]] literature, which are the most important cultural products of Babylonian Judaism. The most important epigraphic sources for the dialect are the hundreds of [[incantation bowl]]s written in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic.

====Mandaic====
{{Main|Mandaic language}}
The [[Mandaic language]], spoken by the [[Mandaeans]] of [[Iraq]], is a sister dialect to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, though it is both linguistically and culturally distinct. Classical Mandaic is the language in which the Mandaeans' [[gnosticism|gnostic]] religious literature was composed. It is characterized by a highly phonetic orthography.

===Western Middle Aramaic===
The dialects of Old Western Aramaic continued with Jewish Middle Palestinian (in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew &quot;square script&quot;]]), [[Samaritan Aramaic]] (in the [[Phoenician alphabet|old Hebrew script]]) and Christian Palestinian (in cursive [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]). Of these three, only Jewish Middle Palestinian continued as a written language.{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}&lt;!--So how do we know the other two if they weren't written? Also, at least Samaritan Aramaic certainly was written and lots of texts survive.--&gt;

====Jewish Middle Palestinian Aramaic====
[[File:Kennicott Bible fol 42v.jpg|thumb|right|Hebrew (left) and Aramaic (right) in parallel in a 1299 Hebrew Bible held by the [[Bodleian Library]]]]

{{Main|Jewish Palestinian Aramaic}}
In 135, after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], many [[Jew]]ish leaders, expelled from [[Jerusalem]], moved to [[Galilee]]. The Galilean dialect thus rose from obscurity to become the standard among Jews in the west. This dialect was spoken not only in Galilee, but also in the surrounding parts. It is the linguistic setting for the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (completed in the 5th century), Palestinian [[targum]]im (Jewish Aramaic versions of scripture), and [[midrash]]im (biblical commentaries and teaching). The standard [[niqqud|vowel pointing]] for the [[Hebrew Bible]], the Tiberian system (7th century), was developed by speakers of the Galilean dialect of Jewish Middle Palestinian. Classical Hebrew vocalisation, therefore, in representing the Hebrew of this period, probably reflects the contemporary pronunciation of this Aramaic dialect.

[[Middle Judaean Aramaic|Middle Judaean]], the descendant of [[Old Judaean Aramaic|Old Judaean]], was no longer the dominant dialect, and was used only in southern Judaea (the variant Engedi dialect continued throughout this period). Likewise, [[Middle East Jordanian Aramaic|Middle East Jordanian]] continued as a minor dialect from [[Old East Jordanian Aramaic|Old East Jordanian]]. The inscriptions in the synagogue at [[Dura-Europos]] are either in Middle East Jordanian or Middle Judaean.

====Samaritan Aramaic====
{{Main|Samaritan Aramaic language}}
The [[Samaritan Aramaic language|Samaritan Aramaic]] is earliest attested by the documentary tradition of the [[Samaritans]] that can be dated back to the fourth century. Its modern pronunciation is based on the form used in the tenth century.

====Christian Palestinian Aramaic====
{{main|Christian Palestinian Aramaic}}
This was the language of the Christian [[Melkite]] community from the 5th to the 8th century. It was also used from the 10th to 13th centuries, though probably only as a liturgical language. It is also been called &quot;Melkite Aramaic&quot; and &quot;Palestinian Syriac&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weninger2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan Weninger|title=The Semitic Languages: An International Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMzgBLT87MkC&amp;pg=PA628|date=23 December 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-025158-6|pages=628–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language itself comes from Old Christian Palestinian Aramaic, but its writing conventions were based on early [[Syriac language|Middle Syriac]], and it was heavily influenced by [[Greek language|Greek]]. For example, the name Jesus, although ישוע ''Yešua’'' in Jewish Aramaic, and ''Išo'' in Syriac, is written ''Yesûs'' (a transliteration of the Greek form) in Christian Palestinian.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Badawi2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Emran El-Badawi|title=The Qur'an and the Aramaic Gospel Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIhiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35|date=17 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-92933-8|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Aramaic==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
{{Main|Neo-Aramaic languages}}
As the [[Western Aramaic]] languages of the Levant and Lebanon have become nearly extinct in non-liturgical usage, the most prolific speakers of Aramaic dialects today are predominantly ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Eastern Neo-Aramaic speakers, the most numerous being the [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] speakers of Mesopotamia. This includes speakers of [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] (235,000 speakers), [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] (216,000 speakers), and [[Turoyo language|Turoyo (Surayt)]] (112,000 to 450,000 speakers).  Having largely lived in remote areas as insulated communities for over a millennium, the remaining modern Aramaic dialects, such as the Assyrians, and the [[Arameans]], escaped the linguistic pressures experienced by others during the large-scale [[language shift]]s that saw the proliferation of other tongues among those who previously did not speak them, most recently the [[Arabization]] of the Middle East and North Africa by [[Arabs]] beginning with the [[early Muslim conquests]] of the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;Turoyo at Ethnologue (17th ed., 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan 2008, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Eastern Aramaic language, Neo-Mandaean, is spoken by the Mandaeans of Iraq and Iran. They number some 50,000–75,000 people, but it is believed the Mandaic language may now be spoken fluently by as few as 5,000 people, with other Mandaeans having varying degrees of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mid |work=Ethnologue |title=Mandaic: A language of Iran |access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Eastern Aramaic===
{{main|Northeastern Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Mandaic}}
Modern Eastern Aramaic exists in a wide variety of dialects and languages. There is significant difference between the Aramaic spoken by Jews, Christians, and Mandaeans.

The Christian varieties are often called Modern Syriac (or Neo-Syriac, particularly when referring to their literature), being deeply influenced by the literary and liturgical language of Middle Syriac. However, they also have roots in numerous, previously unwritten, local Aramaic varieties, and are not purely the direct descendants of the language of [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. The varieties are not all mutually intelligible. The principal Christian varieties are [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], both used by the ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of Iraq, southeast Turkey, Iran, and northeast Syria.

The [[Judeo-Aramaic languages]] are now mostly spoken in [[Israel]], and most are facing extinction. The Jewish varieties that have come from communities that once lived between [[Lake Urmia]] and [[Mosul]] are not all mutually intelligible. In some places, for example [[Urmia]], Assyrian Christians and Jews speak mutually unintelligible varieties of Modern Eastern Aramaic in the same place. In others, the [[Nineveh plains]] around Mosul for example, the varieties of these two ethnic communities are similar enough to allow conversation.

Modern [[Central Neo-Aramaic]], being in between Western Neo-Aramaic and Eastern Neo-Aramaic) is generally represented by Turoyo, the language of the Assyrians of [[Tur Abdin]]. A related language, [[Mlahsô language|Mlahsô]], has recently become extinct.

Mandaeans living in the [[Khuzestan Province]] of Iran and scattered throughout Iraq, speak Modern Mandaic. It is quite distinct from any other Aramaic variety.

===Modern Central Aramaic===
{{main|Central Neo-Aramaic}}
Central Neo-Aramaic consists of [[Turoyo]] and the recently extinct [[Mlahsô]].

===Modern Western Aramaic===
{{Main|Western Neo-Aramaic}}
Very little remains of Western Aramaic. It is still spoken in the villages of [[Maaloula]], [[al-Sarkha (Bakhah)]], and [[Jubb'adin]] on [[Syria]]'s side of the [[Anti-Lebanon Mountains]], as well as by some people who migrated from these villages, to [[Damascus]] and other larger towns of Syria. All these speakers of Modern Western Aramaic are fluent in Arabic as well. [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]] and [[Samaritan Aramaic]] are preserved in liturgical and literary usage.

==Phonology==
{{IPA notice|section}}
Each dialect of Aramaic has its own distinctive pronunciation, and it would not be feasible here to go into all these properties. Aramaic has a phonological palette of 25 to 40 distinct phonemes. Some modern Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of &quot;emphatic&quot; consonants, and some have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

|}

As with most Semitic languages, Aramaic can be thought of as having three basic sets of vowels:
* Open ''a''-vowels
* Close front ''i''-vowels
* Close back ''u''-vowels
These vowel groups are relatively stable, but the exact articulation of any individual is most dependent on its consonantal setting.

The open vowel is an open near-front unrounded vowel (&quot;short&quot; ''a'', somewhat like the first vowel in the English &quot;batter&quot;, {{IPAblink|a}}). It usually has a back counterpart (&quot;long&quot; ''a'', like the ''a'' in &quot;father&quot;, {{IPAblink|ɑ}}, or even tending to the vowel in &quot;caught&quot;, {{IPAblink|ɔ}}), and a front counterpart (&quot;short&quot; ''e'', like the vowel in &quot;head&quot;, {{IPAblink|ɛ}}). There is much correspondence between these vowels between dialects. There is some evidence that Middle Babylonian dialects did not distinguish between the short ''a'' and short ''e''. In West Syriac dialects, and possibly Middle Galilean, the long ''a'' became the ''o'' sound. The open ''e'' and back ''a'' are often indicated in writing by the use of the letters א &quot;alaph&quot; (a [[glottal stop]]) or ה &quot;he&quot; (like the English ''h'').

The close front vowel is the &quot;long&quot; ''i'' (like the vowel in &quot;need&quot;, {{IPA|[i]}}). It has a slightly more open counterpart, the &quot;long&quot; ''e'', as in the final vowel of &quot;café&quot; ({{IPA|[e]}}). Both of these have shorter counterparts, which tend to be pronounced slightly more open. Thus, the short close ''e'' corresponds with the open ''e'' in some dialects. The close front vowels usually use the consonant י ''y'' as a [[mater lectionis]].

The close back vowel is the &quot;long&quot; ''u'' (like the vowel in &quot;school&quot;, {{IPA|[u]}}). It has a more open counterpart, the &quot;long&quot; ''o'', like the vowel in &quot;low&quot; ({{IPA|[o]}}). There are shorter, and thus more open, counterparts to each of these, with the short close ''o'' sometimes corresponding with the long open ''a''. The close back vowels often use the consonant ו ''w'' to indicate their quality.

Two basic [[diphthong]]s exist: an open vowel followed by י ''y'' (''ay''), and an open vowel followed by ו ''w'' (''aw''). These were originally full diphthongs, but many dialects have converted them to ''e'' and ''o'' respectively.

The so-called &quot;emphatic&quot; consonants (see the next section) cause all vowels to become mid-centralised.

The various alphabets used for writing Aramaic languages have twenty-two letters (all of which are consonants). Some of these letters, though, can stand for two or three different sounds (usually a [[stop consonant|stop]] and a [[fricative consonant|fricative]] at the same point of articulation). Aramaic classically uses a series of lightly contrasted plosives and fricatives:
* Labial set: '''פּ'''\'''פ''' ''p''/''f'' and '''בּ'''\'''ב''' ''b''/''v'',
* Dental set: '''תּ'''\'''ת''' ''t''/''θ'' and '''דּ'''\'''ד''' ''d''/''ð'',
* Velar set: '''כּ'''\'''כ''' ''k''/''x'' and '''גּ'''\'''ג''' ''g''/''ɣ''.
Each member of a certain pair is written with the same letter of the alphabet in most writing systems (that is, ''p'' and ''f'' are written with the same letter), and are near [[allophone]]s.

A distinguishing feature of Aramaic phonology (and that of Semitic languages in general) is the presence of &quot;emphatic&quot; consonants. These are consonants that are pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted, with varying degrees of [[pharyngealization]] and [[Velar consonant|velarization]]. Using their alphabetic names, these emphatics are:
* ח Ḥêṯ, a [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]], {{IPA|/ħ/}},
* ט Ṭêṯ, a pharyngealized ''t'', {{IPA|/tˤ/}},
* ע ʽAyin (or ʽE in some dialects), a pharyngealized [[glottal stop]] (sometimes considered to be a [[Voiced pharyngeal fricative|voiced pharyngeal approximant]]), {{IPA|[ʕ]}} or {{IPA|[ʔˤ]}},
* צ Ṣāḏê, a pharyngealized ''s'', {{IPA|/sˤ/}},
* ק Qôp, a [[voiceless uvular stop]], {{IPA|/q/}}.
{{listen|filename=Aramaic_emphatics.ogg|title=The emphatic consonants of Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Ancient Aramaic may have had a larger series of emphatics, and some Neo-Aramaic languages definitely do. Not all dialects of Aramaic give these consonants their historic values.

Overlapping with the set of emphatics are the &quot;guttural&quot; consonants. They include ח Ḥêṯ and ע ʽAyn from the emphatic set, and add א ʼĀlap̄ (a [[glottal stop]]) and ה Hê (as the English &quot;h&quot;).

Aramaic classically has a set of four [[sibilant]]s (ancient Aramaic may have had six):
* ס, שׂ {{IPA|/s/}} (as in English &quot;sea&quot;),
* ז {{IPA|/z/}} (as in English &quot;zero&quot;),
* שׁ {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (as in English &quot;ship&quot;),
* צ {{IPA|/sˤ/}} (the emphatic Ṣāḏê listed above).

In addition to these sets, Aramaic has the [[nasal consonant]]s מ ''m'' and נ ''n'', and the [[approximant consonant|approximants]] ר ''r'' (usually an [[Dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|alveolar trill]]), ל ''l'', י ''y'' and ו ''w''.

===Historical sound changes===
Six broad features of sound change can be seen as dialect differentials:
* '''Vowel change''' occurs almost too frequently to document fully, but is a major distinctive feature of different dialects.
* '''Plosive/fricative pair reduction'''.  Originally, Aramaic, like [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian Hebrew]], had fricatives as conditioned [[allophone]]s for each plosive. In the wake of vowel changes, the distinction eventually became phonemic; still later, it was often lost in certain dialects. For example, [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] has mostly lost {{IPA|/p/}}, using {{IPA|/f/}} instead, like Arabic; other dialects (for instance, standard [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]]) have lost {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} and replaced them with {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, as with Modern Hebrew. In most dialects of Modern Syriac, {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are realized as {{IPA|[w]}} after a vowel.
* '''Loss of emphatics'''. Some dialects have replaced emphatic consonants with non-emphatic counterparts, while those spoken in the [[Caucasus]] often have [[Ejective consonant|glottalized]] rather than [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] emphatics.
* '''Guttural assimilation''' is the main distinctive feature of Samaritan pronunciation, also found in [[Samaritan Hebrew]]: all the gutturals are reduced to a simple glottal stop. Some Modern Aramaic dialects do not pronounce ''h'' in all words (the third person masculine pronoun ''hu'' becomes ''ow'').
* Proto-Semitic */θ/ */ð/ are reflected in Aramaic as */t/, */d/, whereas they became sibilants in Hebrew (the number three is שלוש ''šālôš'' in Hebrew but תלת ''tlāṯ'' in Aramaic). Dental/sibilant shifts are still happening in the modern dialects.
* '''New phonetic inventory'''. Modern dialects have borrowed sounds from the dominant surrounding languages. The most frequent borrowings are {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (as the first consonant in &quot;azure&quot;), {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} (as in &quot;jam&quot;) and {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} (as in &quot;church&quot;). The [[Syriac alphabet]] has been adapted for writing these new sounds.

==Grammar==
{{listen|filename=kthovo.ogg|title=Aramaic words based on the triliteral&lt;br /&gt; root ''k-t-b'' |description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
As with other Semitic languages, Aramaic [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the way words are formed) is based on the consonantal [[Semitic root|root]]. The root generally consists of two or three consonants and has a basic meaning, for example, כת״ב ''k-t-b'' has the meaning of 'writing'. This is then modified by the addition of vowels and other consonants to create different nuances of the basic meaning:
* כתבה ''kṯāḇâ'', handwriting, inscription, script, book.
* כתבי ''kṯāḇê'', books, the Scriptures.
* כתובה ''kāṯûḇâ'', secretary, scribe.
* כתבת ''kiṯḇeṯ'', I wrote.
* אכתב '''eḵtûḇ'', I shall write.

===Nouns and adjectives===
Aramaic nouns and adjectives are inflected to show ''gender'', ''number'' and ''state''.

Aramaic has two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. The feminine absolute singular is often marked by the ending ה- ''-â''.

Nouns can be either singular or plural, but an additional &quot;dual&quot; number exists for nouns that usually come in pairs. The dual number gradually disappeared from Aramaic over time and has little influence in Middle and Modern Aramaic.

Aramaic nouns and adjectives can exist in one of three states. To a certain extent, these states correspond to the role of articles and cases in the [[Indo-European languages]]:
# The ''absolute'' state is the basic form of a noun. In early forms of Aramaic, the absolute state expresses indefiniteness, comparable to the English indefinite article a(n) (for example, כתבה ''kṯāḇâ'', &quot;'''a''' handwriting&quot;), and can be used in most syntactic roles. However, by the Middle Aramaic period, its use for nouns (but not adjectives) had been widely replaced by the emphatic state.
# The ''[[Status constructus|construct]]'' state is a form of the noun used to make possessive constructions (for example, '''כתבת''' מלכתא '''''kṯāḇat''' malkṯâ'', &quot;the handwriting of the queen&quot;). In the masculine singular the form of the construct is often the same as the absolute, but it may undergo vowel reduction in longer words. The feminine construct and masculine construct plural are marked by suffixes. Unlike a [[genitive case]], which marks the possessor, the construct state is marked on the possessed. This is mainly due to Aramaic word order: '''possessed[const.] possessor[abs./emph.]''' are treated as a speech unit, with the first unit (possessed) employing the construct state to link it to the following word. In Middle Aramaic, the use of the construct state for all but stock phrases (like בר נשא ''bar nāšâ'', &quot;son of man&quot;) begins to disappear.
# The ''emphatic'' or ''determined'' state is an extended form of the noun that functions similarly to the [[Article (grammar)|definite article]]. It is marked with a suffix (for example, כתבת'''א'''  ''kṯāḇtâ'', &quot;'''the''' handwriting&quot;). Although its original grammatical function seems to have been to mark definiteness, it is used already in Imperial Aramaic to mark all important nouns, even if they should be considered technically indefinite. This practice developed to the extent that the absolute state became extraordinarily rare in later varieties of Aramaic.

Whereas other [[Northwest Semitic languages]], like Hebrew, have the absolute and construct states, the emphatic/determined state is a unique feature to Aramaic. [[Inflection|Case endings]], as in [[Ugaritic grammar#Case|Ugaritic]], probably existed in a very early stage of the language, and glimpses of them can be seen in a few compound proper names. However, as most of those cases were expressed by short final vowels, they were never written, and the few characteristic long vowels of the masculine plural accusative and genitive are not clearly evidenced in inscriptions. Often, the [[Object (grammar)|direct object]] is marked by a prefixed -ל ''l-'' (the [[preposition and postposition|preposition]] &quot;to&quot;) if it is definite.

Adjectives agree with their nouns in number and gender but agree in state only if used attributively. Predicative adjectives are in the absolute state regardless of the state of their noun (a [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] may or may not be written). Thus, an attributive adjective to an emphatic noun, as in the phrase &quot;the good king&quot;, is written also in the emphatic state מלכא טבא ''malkâ ṭāḇâ''—king[emph.] good[emph.]. In comparison, the predicative adjective, as in the phrase &quot;the king is good&quot;, is written in the absolute state מלכא טב ''malkâ ṭāḇ''—king[emph.] good[abs.].

The final א- ''-â'' in a number of these suffixes is written with the letter [[aleph]]. However, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the letter [[he (letter)|he]] for the feminine absolute singular. Likewise, some Jewish Aramaic texts employ the Hebrew masculine absolute singular suffix ים- ''-îm'' instead of ין- ''-în''. The masculine determined plural suffix, יא- ''-ayyâ'', has an alternative version, ''-ê''. The alternative is sometimes called the &quot;gentilic plural&quot; for its prominent use in ethnonyms (יהודיא ''yəhûḏāyê'', 'the Jews', for example). This alternative plural is written with the letter [[aleph]], and came to be the only plural for nouns and adjectives of this type in Syriac and some other varieties of Aramaic. The masculine construct plural, ''-ê'', is written with [[yodh]]. In Syriac and some other variants this ending is [[diphthong]]ized to ''-ai''.

Possessive phrases in Aramaic can either be made with the construct state or by linking two nouns with the relative particle -[ד[י ''d[î]-''. As the use of the construct state almost disappears from the Middle Aramaic period on, the latter method became the main way of making possessive phrases.

{{listen|filename=kthovath malktho.ogg|title=Different variations of the possessive construction in Aramaic|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}
For example, the various forms of possessive phrases (for &quot;the handwriting of the queen&quot;) are:
# '''כתבת מלכתא''' '''kṯāḇaṯ malkṯâ''' – the oldest construction, also known as סמיכות səmîḵûṯ : the possessed object (כתבה kṯābâ, &quot;handwriting&quot;) is in the construct state (כתבת kṯāḇaṯ); the possessor (מלכה malkâ, &quot;queen&quot;) is in the emphatic state (מלכתא malkṯâ)
# '''כתבתא דמלכתא''' '''kṯāḇtâ d(î)-malkṯâ''' – both words are in the emphatic state and the relative particle -[ד[י ''d[î]-'' is used to mark the relationship
# '''כתבתה דמלכתא''' '''kṯāḇtāh d(î)-malkṯâ''' – both words are in the emphatic state, and the relative particle is used, but the possessed is given an anticipatory, pronominal ending (כתבתה kṯāḇtā-h, &quot;handwriting-her&quot;; literally, &quot;her writing, that (of) the queen&quot;).
In Modern Aramaic, the last form is by far the most common. In Biblical Aramaic, the last form is virtually absent.

===Verbs===
The Aramaic verb has gradually evolved in time and place, varying between varieties of the language. Verb forms are marked for [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third), [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural), [[grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine or feminine), [[grammatical tense|tense]] (perfect or imperfect), [[grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative, imperative, jussive or infinitive) and [[voice (grammar)|voice]] (active, reflexive or passive). Aramaic also employs a system of [[grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], or verbal stems, to mark intensive and extensive developments in the lexical meaning of verbs.

====Aspectual tense====
Aramaic has two proper [[grammatical tense|tenses]]: [[perfective aspect|perfect]] and [[imperfective aspect|imperfect]]. These were originally [[grammatical aspect|aspectual]], but developed into something more like a [[preterite]] and [[future tense|future]]. The perfect is [[Markedness|unmarked]], while the imperfect uses various [[prefix|preformatives]] that vary according to person, number and gender. In both tenses the third-person singular masculine is the unmarked form from which others are derived by addition of [[Suffix|afformatives]] (and preformatives in the imperfect). In the chart below (on the root כת״ב K-T-B, meaning &quot;to write&quot;), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]].

====Conjugations or verbal stems====
Like other Semitic languages, Aramaic employs a number of [[Derived stem|derived verb stems]], to extend the lexical coverage of verbs. The basic form of the verb is called the ''ground stem'', or ''G-stem''. Following the tradition of mediaeval Arabic grammarians, it is more often called the Pə‘al פעל (also written Pe‘al), using the form of the [[Semitic root]] פע״ל P-‘-L, meaning &quot;to do&quot;. This stem carries the basic lexical meaning of the verb.

By doubling of the second radical, or root letter, the D-stem or פעל Pa‘‘el is formed. This is often an intensive development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, ''qəṭal'' means &quot;he killed&quot;, whereas ''qaṭṭel'' means &quot;he slew&quot;. The precise relationship in meaning between the two stems differs for every verb.

A [[preformative]], which can be -ה ''ha-'', -א ''a-'' or -ש ''ša-'', creates the C-stem or variously the Hap̄‘el, Ap̄‘el or Šap̄‘el (also spelt הפעל Haph‘el, אפעל Aph‘el and שפעל Shaph‘el). This is often an extensive or causative development of the basic lexical meaning. For example, טעה ''ṭə‘â'' means &quot;he went astray&quot;, whereas אטעי ''aṭ‘î'' means &quot;he deceived&quot;. The Šap̄‘el שפעל is the least common variant of the C-stem. Because this variant is standard in Akkadian, it is possible that its use in Aramaic represents loanwords from that language. The difference between the variants הפעל Hap̄‘el and אפעל Ap̄‘el appears to be the gradual dropping of the initial ה ''h'' sound in later Old Aramaic. This is noted by the respelling of the older [[he (letter)|he]] preformative with א [[aleph]].

These three conjugations are supplemented with three further derived stems, produced by the preformative -הת ''hiṯ-'' or -את ''eṯ-''. The loss of the initial ה ''h'' sound occurs similarly to that in the form above. These three derived stems are the Gt-stem, התפעל Hiṯpə‘el or אתפעל Eṯpə‘el (also written Hithpe‘el or Ethpe‘el), the Dt-stem, התפעּל Hiṯpa‘‘al or אתפעּל Eṯpa‘‘al (also written Hithpa‘‘al or Ethpa‘‘al), and the Ct-stem, התהפעל Hiṯhap̄‘al, אתּפעל Ettap̄‘al, השתפעל Hištap̄‘al or אשתפעל Eštap̄‘al (also written Hithhaph‘al, Ettaph‘al, Hishtaph‘al or Eshtaph‘al). Their meaning is usually [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], but later became [[passive voice|passive]]. However, as with other stems, actual meaning differs from verb to verb.

Not all verbs use all of these conjugations, and, in some, the G-stem is not used. In the chart below (on the root כת״ב K-T-B, meaning &quot;to write&quot;), the first form given is the usual form in Imperial Aramaic, while the second is [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]].

In Imperial Aramaic, the [[participle]] began to be used for a [[historical present]]. Perhaps under influence from other languages, Middle Aramaic developed a system of composite tenses (combinations of forms of the verb with pronouns or an [[auxiliary verb]]), allowing for narrative that is more vivid. The syntax of Aramaic (the way sentences are put together) usually follows the order verb–subject–object (VSO).  Imperial (Persian) Aramaic, however, tended to follow a S-O-V pattern (similar to Akkadian), which was the result of Persian syntactic influence.
