'''Arthur Asher Miller''' (October 17, 1915&amp;nbsp;– February 10, 2005) was an American playwright, essayist, communist-sympathizer, and a controversial figure in the twentieth-century [[Theater in the United States|American theater]]. Among his most popular plays are ''[[All My Sons]]'' (1947), ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1949), ''[[The Crucible]]'' (1953) and ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' (1955, revised 1956). He wrote several [[screenplay]]s and was most noted for his work on ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961). The drama ''Death of a Salesman'' has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century.

Miller was often in the public eye, particularly during the late 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. During this time, he was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]], testified before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and was married to [[Marilyn Monroe]]. In 1980, Miller received the [[St. Louis Literary Award]] from the [[Saint Louis University]] Library Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slu.edu/libraries/associates/award.html Website of St. Louis Literary Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |title=Recipients of the Saint Louis Literary Award |website= |author=Saint Louis University Library Associates |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731082313/http://lib.slu.edu/about/associates/literary-award |archive-date=July 31, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[Prince of Asturias Award]], the Praemium Imperiale prize in 2002 and the [[Jerusalem Prize]] in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;Citing Arts' Power, Arthur Miller Accepts International Prize.&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'', 4 September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize]] in 1999.

The award brought him his first recognition and led him to begin to consider that he could have a career as a playwright.  Miller enrolled in a playwriting seminar taught by the influential [[Kenneth Thorpe Rowe|Professor Kenneth Rowe]], who instructed him in his early forays into playwriting;&lt;ref&gt;For Rowe's recollections of Miller's work as a student playwright, see Kenneth Thorpe Rowe, &quot;Shadows Cast Before,&quot; in Robert A.

Rowe's influential book ''Write That Play'' (Funk and Wagnalls, 1939), which appeared just a year after Miller's graduation, describes Rowe's approach to play construction.&lt;/ref&gt; Rowe emphasized how a play is built in order to achieve its intended effect, or what Miller called &quot;the dynamics of play construction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Miller, ''Timebends: A Life.''

After his graduation in 1938, he joined the [[Federal Theatre Project]], a [[New Deal]] agency established to provide jobs in the theater. He chose the theater project despite the more lucrative offer to work as a scriptwriter for [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt; However, [[United States Congress|Congress]], worried about possible Communist infiltration, closed the project in 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt; Miller began working in the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] while continuing to write [[radio plays]], some of which were broadcast on [[CBS Radio|CBS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt;

===Early career===

In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Ratcliffe |title=Obituary: Arthur Miller |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/feb/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |location=[[London]] |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=February 11, 2005 |accessdate=July 23, 2012 |archivedate=July 23, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723171424/http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/feb/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |url-status=live |page=25 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, Jane and Robert (born May 31, 1947). Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school [[American football|football]] injury to his left kneecap.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;
That same year his first play was produced; ''[[The Man Who Had All the Luck]]'' won the Theatre Guild's National Award.&lt;ref&gt;Royal National Theater: Platform Papers, 7. Arthur Miller (Battley Brothers Printers, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;shenton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2008/03/the-man-who-has-all-the-luck/#more|title=The man who HAS all the luck...|last=Shenton|first=Mark|date=March 14, 2008|work=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited|accessdate=May 6, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090519194515/http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2008/03/the-man-who-has-all-the-luck/| archivedate= May 19, 2009| url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Miller's play ''[[All My Sons]]'', the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] (earning him his first [[Tony Award]], [[Tony Award for Best Author|for Best Author]]) and his reputation as a playwright was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=2005|title=Arthur Miller: A Critical Study|author=Bigsby, C.

Retrieved on July 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Miller built a small studio in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]]. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]''. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play,&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt; one of the classics of world theater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Death of a Salesman'' premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the [[Morosco Theatre]], directed by [[Elia Kazan]], and starring [[Lee J. Cobb]] as [[Willy Loman]], [[Mildred Dunnock]] as Linda, [[Arthur Kennedy]] as Biff, and [[Cameron Mitchell (actor)|Cameron Mitchell]] as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Author]], the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle|New York Drama Circle Critics' Award]], and the [[1949 Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;

In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with [[Eugene O'Neill]] regarding Miller's production of ''All My Sons''. O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of ''Death of a Salesman''. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his [[Parkinson's disease]] made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, a trip that never occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Isaac, Founding Father: O'Neill's Correspondence with Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, The Eugene O'Neill Review, Vol. 17, No. 1/2 (Spring/Fall 1993), pp. 124–33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical years===
In 1955, a [[One-act play|one-act version]] of Miller's [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' opened on Broadway in a joint bill with one of Miller's lesser-known plays, ''[[A Memory of Two Mondays]]''. The following year, Miller revised ''A View from the Bridge'' as a two-act [[prose]] drama, which [[Peter Brook]] directed in London.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Arthur (1988) Introduction to ''Plays: One'', London: Methuen, p. 51, {{ISBN|0413175502}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A French-Italian co-production ''[[A View from the Bridge (film)|Vu du pont]]'', based on the play, was released in 1962.

====Marriages and family====
[[File:Monroe Miller Wedding.jpg|thumb|Miller and [[Marilyn Monroe]] tie the knot in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], New York, 1956]]

In June 1956, Miller left his first wife, Mary Slattery, whom he married in 1940, and married film star [[Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; They had met in 1951, had a brief affair, and remained in contact since.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times_obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; Monroe had just turned 30 when they married; she never had a real family of her own and was eager to join the family of her new husband.&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;Meyers, Jeffrey. ''The Genius and the Goddess: Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe.'' University of Illinois Press (2010) {{ISBN|978-0-252-03544-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|156}}

Monroe began to reconsider her career and the fact that trying to manage it made her feel helpless. She admitted to Miller, &quot;I hate Hollywood. I don't want it anymore. I want to live quietly in the country and just be there when you need me. I can't fight for myself anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;{{rp|154}}

She converted to Judaism to &quot;express her loyalty and get close to both Miller and his parents&quot;, writes biographer Jeffrey Meyers.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;{{rp|156}} Monroe told her close friend, [[Susan Strasberg]]: &quot;I can identify with the Jews. Everybody's always out to get them, no matter what they do, like me.&quot;&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;{{rp|156}} Soon after she converted, Egypt banned all of her movies.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;{{rp|157}}

Away from Hollywood and the culture of celebrity, Monroe's life became more normal; she began cooking, keeping house and giving Miller more attention and affection than he had been used to.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;{{rp|157}} His children, aged twelve and nine, adored her and were reluctant to return to their mother when the weekend was over.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;{{rp|157}} As she was also fond of older people, she got along well with his parents, and the feeling was mutual.&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt;{{rp|157}}

Later that year, Miller was subpoenaed by the [[HUAC]], and Monroe accompanied him.&lt;ref name=Cakirtas&gt;Çakırtaş, Önder. [http://www.ijla.net/Makaleler/1213426610_13-22%20%C3%96nder%20%C3%87ak%C4%B1rta%C5%9F%20(1)%20(2).pdf &quot;Double Portrayed: Tituba, Racism and Politics.&quot;] ''International Journal of Language Academy''. Volume 1/1 Winter 2013, pp. 13–22.&lt;/ref&gt; In her personal notes, she wrote about her worries during this period:
{{quote|I am so concerned about protecting Arthur.

''Fragments: Poems, Intimate Notes, Letters'' New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, (2010) pp. 89–101&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miller began work on writing the screenplay for ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' in 1960, directed by [[John Huston]] and starring Monroe. But it was during the filming that Miller and Monroe's relationship hit difficulties, and he later said that the filming was one of the lowest points in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Celizic |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Celizic |title=New footage of Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable revealed |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/new-footage-marilyn-monroe-clark-gable-revealed-wbna24927803 |date=2 June 2008 |access-date=22 April 2018 |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monroe was taking drugs to help her sleep and more drugs to help her wake up, which caused her to arrive on the set late and then have trouble remembering her lines. Huston was unaware that Miller and Monroe were having problems in their private life. He recalled later, &quot;I was impertinent enough to say to Arthur that to allow her to take drugs of any kind was criminal and utterly irresponsible. Shortly after that I realized that she wouldn't listen to Arthur at all; he had no say over her actions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Grobel, Lawrence. ''The Hustons'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York (1989) p. 489&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the film's premiere in 1961, Miller and Monroe divorced after their five years of marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot;/&gt; Nineteen months later, August 4, 1962, Monroe died of a likely drug overdose.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot;/&gt; Huston, who had also directed her in her first major role in ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'' in 1950, and who had seen her rise to stardom, put the blame for her death on her doctors as opposed to the stresses of being a star: &quot;The girl was an addict of sleeping pills and she was made so by the God-damn doctors. It had nothing to do with the Hollywood set-up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Badman, Keith. ''The Final Years of Marilyn Monroe: The Shocking True Story'', Aurum Press (2010) ebook, {{ISBN|9781781310519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller married photographer [[Inge Morath]] in February 1962. She had worked as a photographer documenting the production of ''The Misfits''. The first of their two children, [[Rebecca Miller|Rebecca]], was born September 15, 1962. Their son, Daniel, was born with [[Down syndrome]] in November 1966.

====HUAC controversy and ''The Crucible''====
In 1952, [[Elia Kazan]] appeared before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC). Kazan named eight members of the [[Group Theatre (New York City)|Group Theatre]], including [[Clifford Odets]], [[Paula Strasberg]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[J. Edward Bromberg]], and [[John Garfield]],&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller and Kazan were close friends throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, but after Kazan's testimony to the HUAC, the pair's friendship ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmMasters&quot; /&gt; After speaking with Kazan about his testimony, Miller traveled to [[Salem, Massachusetts]], to research the [[Salem witch trials|witch trials of 1692]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot; /&gt; He and Kazan did not speak to each other for the next ten years. Kazan later defended his own actions through his film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', in which a dockworker heroically testifies against a corrupt union boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/static/national-film-preservation-board/documents/on_the_waterfront.pdf|title=On The Waterfront|last=Sklar|first=Robert|date=|website=Library of Congress|access-date=2018-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller would retaliate to Kazan's work by writing [[A View from a Bridge]], a play where a longshoreman ousts his co-workers motivated only by jealousy and greed. He sent a copy of the initial script to Kazan and when the director asked in jest to direct the movie, Miller replied &quot;I only sent you the script to let you know what I think of Stool-Pigeons.&quot; The works and politics of Arthur Miller are taught in American Public Schools to this day. 

In ''The Crucible'', Miller likened the situation with the House Un-American Activities Committee to the witch hunt in Salem in 1692.&lt;ref&gt;For a frequently cited study of Miller's use of the Salem witchcraft episode, see Robert A.

The HUAC took an interest in Miller himself not long after ''The Crucible'' opened, denying him a passport to attend the play's London opening in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt; When Miller applied in 1956 for a routine renewal of his passport, the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] used this opportunity to [[subpoena]] him to appear before the committee.

Miller's experience with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s, he joined the other celebrities (including [[William Styron]] and [[Mike Nichols]]) who were brought together by the journalist Joan Barthel whose coverage of the highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case helped raise bail for Gibbons' son Peter Reilly who'd been convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a coerced confession and little other evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Barthel, Joan:''A Death in Canaan''.  New York:  E.P. Dutton. 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  Barthel documented the case in her book ''A Death in Canaan'' which was made as a television film of the same name and broadcast in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''[[A Death in Canaan]]'' |url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077412/&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[City Confidential]]'', an [[A&amp;E Network]] series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Miller 1966.jpg|thumb|Miller in 1966]]
In 1964, ''[[After the Fall (play)|After the Fall]]'' was produced, and is said to be a deeply personal view of Miller's experiences during his marriage to Monroe. The play reunited Miller with his former friend Kazan: they collaborated on both the script and the direction. ''After the Fall'' opened on January 23, 1964, at the ANTA Theatre in [[Washington Square Park]] amid a flurry of publicity and outrage at putting a Monroe-like character, called Maggie, on stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot; /&gt; Robert Brustein, in a review in the ''New Republic'', called ''After the Fall'' &quot;a three and one half hour breach of taste, a confessional autobiography of embarrassing explicitness ... there is a misogynistic strain in the play which the author does not seem to recognize. ... He has created a shameless piece of tabloid gossip, an act of exhibitionism which makes us all voyeurs, ... a wretched piece of dramatic writing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/258bqlwx.asp?page=2 The Moral of Arthur Miller]. The Weekly Standard (February 28, 2005). Retrieved on October 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Miller produced ''[[Incident at Vichy]]''. In 1965, Miller was elected the first American president of [[PEN International]], a position which he held for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

In 1969, Miller's works were banned in the [[Soviet Union]] after he campaigned for the freedom of dissident writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt; Throughout the 1970s, Miller spent much of his time experimenting with the theatre, producing one-act plays such as ''Fame'' and ''The Reason Why'', and traveling with his wife, producing ''In The Country'' and ''Chinese Encounters'' with her. Both his 1972 comedy ''[[The Creation of the World and Other Business]]'' and its musical adaptation, ''[[Up from Paradise]]'', were critical and commercial failures.&lt;ref&gt;

Miller was an unusually articulate commentator on his own work.  In 1978 he published a collection of his ''Theater Essays'', edited by Robert A. Martin and with a foreword by Miller.  Highlights of the collection included Miller's introduction to his ''Collected Plays'', his reflections on the theory of tragedy, comments on the McCarthy Era, and pieces arguing for a publicly supported theater.  Reviewing this collection in the ''Chicago Tribune,'' [[Studs Terkel]] remarked, &quot;in reading [the ''Theater Essays'']...you are exhilaratingly aware of a social critic, as well as a playwright, who knows what he's talking about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Robert A. (1978) ed., ''The Theater Essays of Arthur Miller.''  Viking, {{ISBN|0670698016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Miller traveled to China to produce and direct ''Death of a Salesman'' at the People's Art Theatre in Beijing. The play was a success in China&lt;ref name=&quot;UMICH_60s70s80s&quot; /&gt; and in 1984, ''Salesman in Beijing,'' a book about Miller's experiences in Beijing, was published. Around the same time, ''Death of a Salesman'' was made into [[Death of a Salesman (1985 film)|a TV movie]] starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as Willy Loman. Shown on CBS, it attracted 25 million viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of American Theatre: Post-World War II to the 1990s'', page 296 ([[Cambridge University Press]], 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1987, Miller's autobiographical work,
''Timebends'', was published. Before it was published, it was well known that Miller would not talk about Monroe in interviews; in ''Timebends'' Miller talks about his experiences with Monroe in detail.&lt;ref name=&quot;Observer_obit&quot; /&gt;

During the early-mid 1990s, Miller wrote three new plays: ''[[The Ride Down Mt. Morgan]]'' (1991), ''[[The Last Yankee]]'' (1992), and ''[[Broken Glass (play)|Broken Glass]]'' (1994). In 1996, [[The Crucible (1996 film)|a film]] of ''The Crucible'' starring [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Bruce Davison]], and [[Winona Ryder]] opened. Miller spent much of 1996 working on the screenplay for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronology&quot; /&gt;

''[[Mr. Peters' Connections]]'' was staged [[Off-Broadway]] in 1998, and ''Death of a Salesman'' was revived on Broadway in 1999 to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. The play, once again, was a large critical success, winning a Tony Award for best revival of a play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Foundation===

The Arthur Miller Foundation was founded to honor the legacy of Miller and his New York City Public School Education. The mission of the foundation is: &quot;Promoting increased access and equity to theater arts education in our schools and increasing the number of students receiving theater arts education as an integral part of their academic curriculum.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Miller Foundation, summary report and legitimacy information, guidestar.org&lt;/ref&gt; Other initiatives include certification of new theater teachers and their placement in public schools; increasing the number of theater teachers in the system from the current estimate of 180 teachers in 1800 schools; supporting professional development of all certified theater teachers; providing teaching artists, cultural partners, physical spaces, and theater ticket allocations for students. The foundation's primary purpose is to provide arts education in the New York City school system. The current chancellor of the foundation is Carmen Farina, a large proponent of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]]. The Master Arts Council includes, among others, [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Bradley Cooper]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Tony Kushner]], [[Julianne Moore]], [[Michael Moore]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[David O. Russell]], and [[Liev Schreiber]]. Son-in-law [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] serves on the current board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;The Arthur Miller Foundation, arthurmillerfoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation celebrated Miller's 100th birthday with a one-night-only performance of Miller's seminal works in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pen.org/blog/arthur-miller-centenary-events-guide|title=Celebrating Arthur Miller's Centenary: An Events Guide|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011021907/http://www.pen.org/blog/arthur-miller-centenary-events-guide|archivedate=October 11, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arthur Miller Foundation currently supports a pilot program in theater and film at the public school Quest to Learn in partnership with the Institute of Play. The model is being used as an in-school elective theater class and lab. The objective is to create a sustainable theater education model to disseminate to teachers at professional development workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Media Room, Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, hastypudding.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archive ===
Miller donated thirteen boxes of his earliest manuscripts to the [[Harry Ransom Center]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1961 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/fasearch/findingAid.cfm?eadid=00786|title=Arthur Miller: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Center|website=norman.hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection included the original handwritten notebooks and early typed drafts for ''Death of a Salesman'', ''The Crucible'', ''All My Sons'', and other works.

===Literary and public criticism===
[[Christopher Bigsby]] wrote ''Arthur Miller: The Definitive Biography'' based on boxes of papers Miller made available to him before his death in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3499774.ece|title=Unseen writings show anti-racist passions of young Arthur Miller|author=Alberge, Dalya |work=The Times |location=London |date=March 7, 2008|accessdate=March 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in November 2008, and is reported to reveal unpublished works in which Miller &quot;bitterly attack[ed] the injustices of American racism long before it was taken up by the civil rights movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot; /&gt;

In his book ''Trinity of Passion'', author [[Alan M. Wald]] conjectures that Miller was &quot;a member of a writer's unit of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] around 1946,&quot; using the pseudonym Matt Wayne, and editing a drama column in the magazine ''[[The New Masses]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wald01&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wald|first=Alan M|authorlink=Alan M.

In 1999 the writer [[Christopher Hitchens]] attacked Miller for comparing the [[Clinton–Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinsky investigation]] to the [[Salem witch hunt]]. Miller had asserted a parallel between the examination of physical evidence on Lewinsky's dress and the examinations of women's bodies for signs of the &quot;Devil's Marks&quot; in Salem. Hitchens scathingly disputed the parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hitchens|first1=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Hitchens|title=Bill Clinton: Is He the Most Crooked President in History?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/apr/18/clinton.usa|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 18, 1999|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, ''[[Hitch-22]]'', Hitchens bitterly noted that Miller, despite his prominence as a left-wing intellectual, had failed to support author [[Salman Rushdie]] during the Iranian [[fatwa]] involving ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Non-fiction===

* ''Situation Normal'' (1944) is based on his experiences researching the war correspondence of [[Ernie Pyle]].
* ''In Russia'' (1969), the first of three books created with his photographer wife Inge Morath, offers Miller's impressions of [[Russia]] and Russian society.
* ''In the Country'' (1977), with photographs by Morath and text by Miller, provides insight into how Miller spent his time in Roxbury, Connecticut and profiles of his various neighbors.
* ''Chinese Encounters'' (1979) is a travel journal with photographs by Morath. It depicts the Chinese society in the state of flux which followed the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Miller discusses the hardships of many writers, professors, and artists as they try to regain the sense of freedom and place they lost during [[Mao Zedong]]'s regime.
* ''Salesman in Beijing'' (1984) details Miller's experiences with the 1983 Beijing People's Theatre production of ''Death of a Salesman''. He describes the idiosyncrasies, understandings, and insights encountered in directing a Chinese cast in a decidedly American play.
* ''Timebends: A Life'', Methuen London (1987) {{ISBN|0-413-41480-9}}. Like ''Death of a Salesman'', the book follows the structure of memory itself, each passage linked to and triggered by the one before.
