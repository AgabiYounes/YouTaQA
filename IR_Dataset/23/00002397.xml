After graduating from the [[Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama]] in 1957, he trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London, and was then spotted by [[Laurence Olivier]] who invited him to join the [[Royal National Theatre]]. In 1968, he achieved renown, playing [[Richard the Lionheart]] in ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]''. In the mid-1970s, [[Richard Attenborough]], who would direct five Hopkins films, called him &quot;the greatest actor of his generation.&quot;

==Early life and education==

Hopkins was born on New Year's Eve, 1937, in [[Margam]], a suburb of [[Port Talbot]], [[Glamorgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/sir-anthony-hopkins-offers-buy-2496680 |title=Sir Anthony Hopkins offers to buy Welsh childhood home |work=[[WalesOnline]] |access-date=2 January 2016 |first=Robin |last=Turner |date=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Annie Muriel (''[[née]]'' Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He stated his father's working-class values have always underscored his life. &quot;Whenever I get a feeling that I may be special or different, I think of my father and I remember his hands – his hardened, broken hands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph 2015&quot;/&gt; His school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend [[West Monmouth School|Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School]] in [[Pontypool]]. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at [[Cowbridge Grammar School]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]]. In a 2002 interview he stated, &quot;I was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex. I grew up absolutely convinced I was stupid.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/29/movies/film-the-scenery-though-he-won-t-chew.html |title=FILM; The Scenery, Though, He Won't Chew |first=Franz |last=Lidz |author-link=Franz Lidz |date=29 September 2002 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=27 October 2017 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins was inspired by Welsh compatriot [[Richard Burton]], whom he met at the age of 15. Hopkins promptly enrolled at the [[Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama]] in [[Cardiff]], from which he graduated in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt; He later said of Burton, &quot;I don't know where everyone gets the idea we were good friends. I suppose it's because we are both Welsh and grew up near the same town [Port Talbot]. For the record, I didn't really know him at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian interview 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/23/anthony-hopkins-composing-music |title=Anthony Hopkins: 'I've never really been close to anyone' |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 January 2012 |access-date=23 January 2015 |last=Crace |first=John |author-link=John Crace (writer) |quote=I don't know where everyone gets the idea we were good friends.

I once went up to his sister's house to ask for his autograph which he gave me and the only other time I met him was in his dressing room in New York when he was performing in Equus. |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of his [[national service]], which he served in the [[British Army]], Hopkins moved to London where he studied at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;/&gt;

==Acting career==
[[File:I Rossellini A Hopkins.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Isabella Rossellini]] and Hopkins in Berlin to shoot scenes for ''[[The Innocent (1993 film)|The Innocent]]'' (1993)]]
Hopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the [[Palace Theatre, Swansea]], in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of ''Have a Cigarette''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Anthony Hopkins Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/anthony-hopkins.html |publisher=[[Bio.

Retrieved 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins became Olivier's [[understudy]], and filled in when Olivier was struck with [[appendicitis]] during a 1967 production of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''The Dance of Death''. Olivier later noted in his memoir, ''Confessions of an Actor'', that

Hopkins was nervous prior to going on stage, but since that night he has relaxed, quoting his mentor: &quot;He [Olivier] said: 'Remember: nerves is [sic] vanity – you’re wondering what people think of you; to hell with them, just jump off the edge’. It was great advice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph 2015&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Anthony Hopkins: 'I don't have a single friend who is an actor'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/actors/anthony-hopkins-interview-dresser/|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 [[BBC]] broadcast of ''[[A Flea in Her Ear]]''. His first starring role in a film came in 1964 in ''Changes'', a short directed by [[Drewe Henley]], written and produced by [[James Scott (artist)|James Scott]] and co-starring [[Jacqueline Pearce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Anthony Hopkins: The Authorized Biography|last = Falk|first = Quentin|publisher = Interlink Pub Group Inc|year = 1994|isbn = 1566561450|location = |pages = 24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Changes (1965)|url = http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b6feadd49|website = BFI|accessdate = 1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, he got his break in ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' playing [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]. Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in ''[[Pravda (play)|Pravda]]'' by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] and [[Howard Brenton]] and as Antony in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' opposite [[Judi Dench]] as well as in the Broadway production of [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'') he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. He portrayed [[Charles Dickens]] in the BBC television film ''[[The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens]]'' in 1970, and [[Pierre Bezukhov]] in the BBC's mini series ''[[War and Peace (1972 TV series)|War and Peace]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1204295/ BFI Screenonline: Sherrin, Ned (1931-2007) Biography].

He remained an enthusiastic member of the company and the Mirror's Producing Artistic Director Sabra Jones visited him in London in 1986 to discuss moving ''Pravda'' to New York from the National Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel. &quot;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/11/arts/theater-mirror-rep-in-a-revival-of-rain.html “THEATER: MIRROR REP, IN A REVIVAL OF 'RAIN'].&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 March 1984.

===Style of acting===
[[File:Anthony Hopkins-Tuscan Sun Festival.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hopkins at the [[Tuscan Sun Festival]], [[Cortona]], [[Italy]], August 2009]]
Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles. He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can &quot;do it without thinking&quot;. This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me&quot;&amp;nbsp;— ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for &quot;this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot; /&gt;

Renowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.&lt;ref name=&quot;RADA&quot;&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/dec/05/features A dark and stormy knight] ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2016 interview with the ''[[Radio Times]]'', Hopkins spoke of his ability to frighten people since he was a boy growing up in Port Talbot, Wales. &quot;I don't know why but I've always known what scares people. When I was a kid I’d tell the girls around the street the story about [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] and I’d go 'th-th-th' (the sucking noise which he reproduced in ''The Silence of the Lambs''). As a result, they’d run away screaming.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RT Interview&quot;&gt;[https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/sir-anthony-hopkins-reveals-scary-12079267 &quot;Anthony Hopkins reveals his scary Hannibal Lecter was born on the streets of Port Talbot when he was a boy&quot;]. Wales Online. Retrieved 1 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled going through the film's script for the first time with fellow cast members. &quot;I didn't know what they were going to make of it but I'd prepared it—my first line to Jodie Foster was: 'Good morning. You’re one of [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]]’s aren't you'?. Everyone froze. There was a silence. Then one of the producers said, 'Holy crap, don't change a thing'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RT Interview&quot;/&gt; On Hopkins’ approach to playing villains, [[Miranda Sawyer]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' writes, &quot;When he portrays deliberately scary people, he plays them quietly, emphasising their sinister control.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anthony Hopkins: 'Most of this is nonsense, most of this is a lie' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/26/anthony-hopkins-most-nonsense-most-lie-lear |accessdate=31 May 2019 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins is a well-known [[Impressionist (entertainment)|mimic]], adept at turning his native Welsh accent into whatever is required by a character. He duplicated the voice of his late mentor, Laurence Olivier, for additional scenes in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' in its 1991 restoration. His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' featured an impersonation of comedian [[Tommy Cooper]]. Hopkins has said acting &quot;like a submarine&quot; has helped him to deliver credible performances in his thrillers. He said, &quot;It's very difficult for an actor to avoid, you want to show a bit. But I think the less one shows the better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8512396.stm |title=Sir Anthony Hopkins acts 'like a submarine' |work=BBC News |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Hopkins directed a film about his Welsh compatriot, poet [[Dylan Thomas]], titled ''Dylan Thomas: Return Journey'', which was his directing debut for the screen. In the same year, as part of the restoration process for the [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', Hopkins was approached to re-record lines from a scene that was being added back to the film; this scene featured [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Tony Curtis]], with Hopkins recommended by Olivier's widow, [[Joan Plowright]] to perform her late husband's part thanks to his talent for mimicry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Universal Pictures&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Restoration of &quot;Spartacus&quot; - &quot;Spartacus&quot; Production Notes|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2009/spartacus/|publisher=Universal Pictures|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he directed ''[[August (1996 film)|August]]'', an adaptation of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' set in Wales. His first screenplay, an experimental drama called ''[[Slipstream (2007 film)|Slipstream]]'', which he also directed and scored, premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2007. In 1997, Hopkins narrated the [[BBC]] natural documentary series, ''[[Killing for a Living]]'', which showed predatory behaviour in nature. He narrated episode 1 through 3 before being replaced by [[John Shrapnel]].

Hopkins is a fan of the BBC sitcom ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', and once remarked in an interview how he would love to appear in the series. Writer [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]] saw the interview, and with Hopkins in mind created the character [[The Driscoll Brothers|Danny Driscoll]], a local villain.
