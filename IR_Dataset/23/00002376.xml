'''Abdul Rashid Dostum''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Abdul Rashid Dostum from Afghanistan pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|ˈ|ɑː|b|d|əl|_|r|ə|ˈ|ʃ|iː|d|_|d|oʊ|s|ˈ|t|uː|m}} {{respell|AHB|dəl|_|rə|SHEED|_|dohs|TOOM}}; {{lang-prs|عبدالرشید دوستم}}, [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] [[Uzbek alphabet|Latin]]: Abdul Rashid Do‘stum, [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] [[Uzbek alphabet|Cyrillic]]: Абдул Рашид Дўстум; born March 25, 1954) is an [[Afghanistani|Afghan]] politician and [[General (rank)|general]] in the [[Afghan National Army]] who has served as [[Vice President of Afghanistan]] from 2014 to 2020. An ethnic [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]], he is a former [[communist]] general and [[warlord]] known for siding with winners during different wars in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/dostum-a-former-warlord-who-was-once-americas-man-in-afghanistan-may-be-back/2014/04/23/9d1a7670-c63d-11e3-8b9a-8e0977a24aeb_story.html |title=He was America’s man in Afghanistan.

Now Abdurrashid Dostum may be back.|first=Joshua|last=Partlow|date=23 April 2014|access-date=4 January 2018|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the founder of the political party [[Junbish-e Milli]] (National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan).

During the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] in the 1980s, Dostum was part of the [[Afghan National Army]] and the regional commander of the country's north, commanding about 20,000 mostly Uzbek soldiers participating in battles against [[mujahideen]] rebels. In 1992, he deserted the [[Mohammad Najibullah]] government shortly before its collapse, joining the mujahideen, forming his Junbish-e Milli party and militia and becoming an independent warlord. He subsequently became the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of [[Ethnic groups in Afghanistan#Uzbek|Afghanistan's Uzbek community]], controlling the country's northern provinces and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], effectively creating his own [[proto-state]] with an army of up to 40,000 men with tanks supplied by [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Russia]] and jets. He initially supported the new government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] in [[Kabul]] but in 1994 switched sides and allied with [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. In 1995, he switched sides again and backed Rabbani. In 1997, he was forced to flee after his former aide [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] took Mazar-i-Sharif, before he fought back and regained control. In 1998, the city was overrun by the [[Taliban]] and he fled again. Dostum returned to Afghanistan in 2001 and joined the [[Northern Alliance]] after the [[US invasion of Afghanistan|US invasion]], leading his faction in the [[Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/rashid-dostum-the-treacherous-general-9224857.html|title=Rashid Dostum: The treacherous general|date=1 December 2001|website=Independent.co.uk|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Taliban, he joined [[Hamid Karzai]]'s presidential administration but spent most of his time in [[Turkey]]. He also served as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Afghan Army, a role often viewed as ceremonial.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|date=10 May 2007 |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=1acb5330-dfe8-4f0e-8a1b-4f581478244f&amp;k=44800&amp;p=1 |title=Former Afghan warlord says he can defeat Taliban |publisher=CanWest News Service |accessdate=22 April 2008 |last=David Pugliese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521102841/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=1acb5330-dfe8-4f0e-8a1b-4f581478244f&amp;k=44800&amp;p=1 |archivedate=21 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011, he was part of the leadership council of the [[National Front of Afghanistan]] along with [[Ahmad Zia Massoud]] and [[Mohammad Mohaqiq]]. In 2014, he joined [[Ashraf Ghani]]'s presidential administration as a vice president, but was forced to flee again in 2017 after being accused of sexually assaulting a political rival. In 2018, he narrowly escaped a suicide bombing by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Algeria Province|ISIL-KP]] as he returned to Afghanistan at [[Kabul airport]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rferl.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/afghan-vice-president-dostum-to-return-to-kabul-amid-torture-claims/29381984.html|title=Afghan Vice President Dostum Escapes Suicide Attack; 14 Others Killed|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, he escaped an hours-long attack by the Taliban on a convoy he was travelling in.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Early life ==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
Dostum was born in 1954 in [[Khwaja Du Koh]] near [[Sheberghan]] in [[Jowzjan Province]], Afghanistan. Coming from an impoverished [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] family, he received a very basic traditional education as he was forced to drop out of school at a young age. From there, he took up work in the village's major [[Natural gas field|gas fields]].

== Careers ==
Dostum began working in 1970 in a state-owned gas refinery in [[Sheberghan]], participating in [[Trade union|union]] [[politics]], as the new government started to arm the staff of the workers in the oil and gas [[refineries]]. The reason for this was to create &quot;groups for the defense of the [[Saur Revolution|revolution]]&quot;. Because of the new [[communist]] ideas entering Afghanistan in the 1970s, he enlisted in the [[Afghan National Army]] in 1978. Dostum received his basic military training in [[Jalalabad]]. His [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] was deployed in the rural areas around Sheberghan, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalsecurity&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/dostum.htm |title=Abdul Rashid Dostum |publisher=Global Security | accessdate=18 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090301152731/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/afghanistan/dostum.htm| archivedate= 1 March 2009 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet–Afghan War ===
{{Main|Soviet–Afghan War}}
By the mid-1980s, he commanded around 20,000 militia men and controlled the northern provinces of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1563344.stm |title=Profile: General Rashid Dostum |work=BBC News |accessdate=18 March 2009 |date=25 September 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408185925/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1563344.stm|archivedate=8 April 2009 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the unit recruited throughout Jowzjan and had a relatively broad base, many of its early troops and commanders came from Dostum's home village. He left the army after the purge of [[Parcham]]ites, but returned after the [[Soviet Army|Soviet]] occupation began.&lt;ref name=&quot;globalsecurity&quot; /&gt;

During the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], Dostum was commanding a militia battalion to fight and rout [[mujahideen]] forces; he had been appointed an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] due to prior military experience. This eventually became a regiment and later became incorporated into the defense forces as the [[53rd Division (Afghanistan)|53rd Infantry Division]]. Dostum and his new [[Division (military)|division]] reported directly to President [[Mohammad Najibullah]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Later on he became the commander of the [[military unit]] 374 in [[Jowzjan]]. He defended the Soviet-backed Afghan government against the mujahideen forces throughout the 1980s. While he was only a regional commander, he had largely raised his forces by himself. The Jowzjani militia Dostum controlled was one of the few in the country which was able to be deployed outside its own region. They were deployed in [[Kandahar]] in 1988 when [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|Soviet forces were withdrawing]] from Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.islamicrepublicofafghanistan.com/abdul-rashid-dostum/ |title=Abdul Rashid Dostum |publisher=Islamic Republic of Afghanistan |accessdate=18 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310122509/http://www.islamicrepublicofafghanistan.com/abdul-rashid-dostum/ |archivedate=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his efforts in the army, Dostum was awarded the title &quot;Hero of the Republic of Afghanistan&quot; by President Najibullah.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Afghanistan'' by Ludwig W. Adamec, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil war and northern Afghanistan autonomous state ===
{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1992–96)}}
Dostum's men would become an important force in the [[Siege of Kabul|fall of Kabul]] in 1992. In April 1992, the opposition forces began their march to Kabul against the government of Najibullah. Dostum had allied himself with the opposition commanders [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Sayed Jafar Naderi]],&lt;ref&gt;Vogelsang (2002), p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; the head of the [[Isma'ili]] community, and together they captured the capital city. He and Massoud fought in a coalition against [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot; /&gt; Massoud and Dostum's forces joined together to defend Kabul against Hekmatyar. Some 4000-5000 of his troops, units of his [[Sheberghan]]-based 53rd Division and [[Balkh]]-based Guards Division, garrisoning [[Bala Hissar, Kabul|Bala Hissar]] fort, Maranjan Hill, and [[Khwaja Rawash Airport]], where they stopped Najibullah from entering to flee.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Davis, 'The Battlegrounds of Northern Afghanistan,' [[Jane's Intelligence Review]], July 1994, p.323-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Dostum then left Kabul for his northern stronghold [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], where he ruled, in effect, an independent region (or '[[proto-state]]'), often referred as the Northern Autonomous Zone. He printed his own Afghan currency, ran a small airline named [[Balkh Air]],&lt;ref&gt;Vogelsang (2002), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; and formed relations with countries like [[Uzbekistan]]. While the rest of the country was in chaos, his region remained prosperous and functional, and it won him the support from people of all ethnic groups. Many people fled to his territory to escape the violence and fundamentalism imposed by the [[Taliban]] later on.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Warlord: The Life and Legend of Dostum, the Afghan Warrior Who Led US Special Forces to Topple the Taliban Regime'' by Brian Glyn Williams, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Dostum allied himself with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar against the government of [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] and Ahmad Shah Massoud, but in 1995 sided with the government again.&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot; /&gt;

=== Taliban era ===
{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1996–2001)}}
Following the rise of the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|Taliban]] and their capture of Kabul, Dostum aligned himself with the [[Northern Alliance]] (United Front) against the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot; /&gt; The Northern Alliance was assembled in late 1996 by Dostum, Massoud and [[Karim Khalili]] against the Taliban. At this point he is said to have had a force of some 50,000 men supported by both aircraft and tanks.

Much like other Northern Alliance leaders, Dostum also faced infighting within his group and was later forced to surrender his power to General [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]]. Malik entered into secret negotiations with the Taliban, who promised to respect his authority over much of northern Afghanistan, in exchange for the apprehension of [[Ismail Khan]], one of their enemies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Johnson |first=Thomas H. |url=http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/jul/johnsonJul04.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040811091257/http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/2004/jul/johnsonJul04.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 August 2004 |title=''Ismail Khan, Herat, and Iranian Influence'' |publisher=Center for Contemporary Conflict |accessdate=20 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Ponfilly, Christophe(2001); ''Massoud l'Afghan''; Gallimard; {{ISBN|2-07-042468-5}}; p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, on 25 May 1997, Malik arrested Khan, handed him over and let the Taliban enter Mazar-e-Sharif, giving them control over most of northern Afghanistan. Because of this, Dostum was forced to flee to Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardcastle_Book&quot;&gt;page 6-8 - {{Cite book| last = Nate Hardcastle| authorlink = Nate Hardcastle| title = American Soldier: Stories of Special Forces from Grenada to Afghanistan|edition= 2002|pages= 364 | publisher = Thunder's Mouth Press| isbn= 1-56025-438-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Malik soon realized that the Taliban were not sincere with their promises as he saw his men being disarmed. He then rejoined the Northern Alliance, and turned against his erstwhile allies, driving them from Mazar-e-Sharif. In October 1997, Dostum returned from exile and retook charge. After Dostum briefly regained control of Mazar-e-Sharif, the Taliban returned in 1998 and he again fled to [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;afghanistan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hri.ca/forthereCord1998/bilan1998/documentation/security/s-1998-222.htm|title=''La situation en Afghanistan et ses conséquences pour la paix et la sécurité internationales''|last=UN Security Council report|publisher=Human Rights Internet|accessdate=20 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165006/http://www.hri.ca/forthereCord1998/bilan1998/documentation/security/s-1998-222.htm|archivedate=30 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dostum returned to Afghanistan in May 2001 to open up a new front before the U.S.-led campaign against the Taliban joined him, along with Commander Massoud, [[Ismail Khan]] and [[Mohammad Mohaqiq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt; In November 2001, with the beginning of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and against the wishes of the [[CIA]] who distrusted Dostum, a team including [[Johnny Micheal Spann]] landed to set up communications in Dar-e-Suf. A few hours later 12 men of [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Operational Detachment Alpha (ODA) 595]] landed to begin the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationalgeographic&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|year=2007 |url = http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0203/story.html#story_3|title = The Legend of Heavy D &amp; the Boys:In the Field With an Afghan Warlord|publisher = [[National Geographic Society]]| accessdate = 22 April 2008 | author=Robert Young Pelton | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080406030343/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0203/story.html| archivedate= 6 April 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ODA595&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|year=2007 |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/campaign/interviews/595.html|title = ODA 595|publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| accessdate = 22 April 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080429063752/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/campaign/interviews/595.html| archivedate= 29 April 2008 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2001, 15,000 Taliban soldiers surrendered after the [[Siege of Kunduz]] to [[United States Army|American]] and Northern Alliance forces. The Taliban laid down their weapons a few kilometres from the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, and eventually surrendered to Dostum. A small group of armed foreign fighters were transferred to the 19th century [[prison|garrison]] fortress, [[Qala-i-Jangi]]. The Taliban used concealed weapons to start the [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi]] against the guards. The uprising was eventually brought under control.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Dasht-i-Leili massacre ===
{{Main|Dasht-i-Leili massacre}}
General Dostum has been accused by Western journalists of responsibility for the suffocating or otherwise killing of 2,000 [[Taliban]] prisoners in December 2001. Dostum denied the accusations in 2009. US President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] in 2009 ordered an investigation into the matter, which as yet has yielded no (published) results.

=== Karzai administration ===
{{Further|Presidency of Hamid Karzai}}
In the aftermath of Taliban's removal from northern Afghanistan, forces loyal to Dostum frequently clashed with [[Tajik people|Tajik]] forces loyal to [[Atta Muhammad Nur]]. Atta's men kidnapped and killed a number of Dostum's men, and constantly agitated to gain control of Mazar-e-Sharif. Through the political mediations of the Karzai administration, the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) and the United Nations, the Dostum-Atta feud has gradually declined. They are now aligned in a new political party

Dostum served as deputy defense minister the early period of the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]]. On 20 May 2003, Dostum narrowly escaped an assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dostum, Abdul Rashid|url=http://afghan-bios.info/index.php?option=com_afghanbios&amp;id=439&amp;task=view&amp;total=2001&amp;start=439&amp;Itemid=2|website=Afghan Biographies|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was often residing outside Afghanistan, mainly in Turkey. In February 2008, he was suspended after the apparent kidnapping and torture of a political rival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/03/world/africa/03iht-03afghan.9704363.html|title=Afghan police lay siege to home of former warlord|first=Abdul Waheed|last=Wafa|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time in Turkey ===
Some media reports in 2008 stated earlier that Dostum was &quot;seeking political asylum&quot; in Turkey&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://quqnoos.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2188&amp;Itemid=48 Dostum seeking asylum in Turkey – media reports],&quot; Quqnoos.com, 6 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; while others said he was exiled.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/244638,afghan-general-rashid-dostum-flies-to-exile-in-turkey.html Afghan general Rashid Dostum flies to exile in Turkey],&quot; Deutsche Presse-Agentur via earthtimes.org, 4 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One Turkish media outlet said Dostum was visiting after flying there with then Turkey's Foreign Minister [[Ali Babacan]] during a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=160690&amp;bolum=102 Afghan warlord in Turkey but not in exile, official says]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},&quot; Today's Zaman, 5 December 2008, retrieved 6 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 August 2009, Dostum was asked to return from exile to Afghanistan to support President Hamid Karzai in his bid for [[2009 Afghan presidential election|re-election]]. He later flew by helicopter to his northern stronghold of Sheberghan, where he was greeted by thousands of his supporters in the local stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|website=TheTimes.co.uk|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently made overtures to the United States, promising he could &quot;destroy the Taliban and al Qaeda&quot; if supported by the U.S., saying that &quot;the U.S. needs strong friends like Dostum.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/22/afghan-warlords-will-fight-if-us-gives-aid/?feat=home_headlines&amp;|title=Afghan warlords will fight if U.S. gives weapons|last=Motlagh|first=Jason|author2=Carter, Sara A. |date=22 September 2009|work=[[Washington Times]]|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ghani administration ===
{{Further|Ghani cabinet}}
On 7 October 2013, the day after filing his nomination for the [[2014 Afghan presidential election|2014 general elections]] as running mate of [[Ashraf Ghani]], Dostum issued a press statement that some news media were willing to welcome as &quot;apologies&quot;: &quot;Many mistakes were made during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|civil war]] (…) It is time we apologize to the Afghan people who were sacrificed due to our negative policies (…) I apologize to the people who suffered from the violence and civil war (…)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bezhan|first1=Frud|title=Former Afghan Warlord Apologizes For Past 'Mistakes'|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/afghanistan-dostum-warcrimes-apology/25130594.html|work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dostum was directly chosen as First [[Vice President of Afghanistan]] in the [[2014 Afghan presidential election|April–June 2014 Afghan presidential election]], next to [[Ashraf Ghani]] as President and [[Sarwar Danish]] as second Vice President.

In July 2016, [[Human Rights Watch]] accused Abdul Rashid Dostum's [[National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan]] of killing, abusing and looting civilians in the northern [[Faryab Province]] during June.&lt;ref&gt;July 31, 2016 12:00AM EDT, Afghanistan: Forces Linked to Vice President Terrorize Villagers, Prosecute Militia Members for Killings, https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/31/afghanistan-forces-linked-vice-president-terrorize-villagers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;australian0801&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban kills 24 police in two days|newspaper=The Australian|date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Militia forces loyal to Dostum stated that the civilians they targeted – at least 13 killed and 32 wounded – were supporters of the Taliban.&lt;ref name=australian0801 /&gt;

In November 2016, at a [[buzkashi]] match, he punched his political rival Ahmad Ischi, and then his bodyguards beat Ischi. In 2017, he was accused of having Ischi kidnapped in that incident and raped with a gun on camera during a five-day detention, claims that Dostum denies but that nevertheless forced him into exile in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Afghan VP 'punches, kidnaps' rival at traditional sporting event|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/blog/2016/11/28/afghan-vp-punches-kidnaps-rival-at-traditional-sporting-event|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=The New Arab|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/world/asia/afghanistan-dostum-ghani-plane.html|title=Afghan Vice President’s Return Thwarted as Plane Is Turned Back|first1=Mujib|last1=Mashal|first2=Najim|last2=Rahim|date=18 July 2017|publisher=|access-date=4 January 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 July 2018, he narrowly escaped a suicide bombing by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province|ISIL-KP]] as he returned to Afghanistan at [[Kabul airport]]. Just after Dostum's convoy departed the airport, an attacker armed with a [[suicide vest]] bombed a crowd of several hundred people celebrating his return at the entrance to the airport. The attack killed 14 and injured 50, including civilians and armed security.&lt;ref name=&quot;rferl.org&quot;/&gt;

On 30 March 2019, Dostum again escaped an expected assassination attempt while traveling from [[Mazar-e-Sharif]] to [[Jawzjan Province]], though two of his bodyguards were killed. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, the second in eight months.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-dostum/afghan-vice-president-narrowly-escapes-death-for-a-second-time-idUSKCN1RB0HO|title=Afghan vice president narrowly escapes death for a second time|last=Sahak |first=Abdul Matin|work=[[Reuters]]|access-date=2019-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political and social views ==
Dostum is considered to be [[liberalism|liberal]] and somewhat [[leftist]]. Being ethnic Uzbek, he has worked on the battlefield with leaders from all other major ethnic groups, Hazaras, Pashtuns and Tajiks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-glyn-williams/post_12508_b_10802718.html|title=The State Department Insults the Afghan Vice President (And All Afghan Uzbeks)|first=Brian Glyn|last=Williams|date=6 July 2016|website=HuffingtonPost.com|access-date=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Dostum was ruling his northern Afghanistan proto-state before the Taliban took over in 1998, women were able to go about unveiled, girls were allowed to go to school and study at the [[University of Balkh]], cinemas showed [[Indian film]]s, music played on television, and Russian [[vodka]] and German [[beer]] were openly available – activities which were all banned by the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;Vogelsang (2002) p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

He viewed the [[ISAF]] forces attempt to crush the Taliban as ineffective and has gone on record saying in 2007 that he could mop up the Taliban &quot;in six months&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot; /&gt; if allowed to raise a 10,000 strong army of Afghan veterans.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot; /&gt; Senior Afghan government officials do not trust Dostum as they are concerned that he might be secretly rearming his forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;canada.com&quot; /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
