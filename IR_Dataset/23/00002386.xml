{{Main|History of American Airlines}}

[[File:N834AA taking off from Sydney Airport July 2018.jpg|thumb|An American Airlines [[Boeing 787-9]] taking off from [[Sydney Airport]] in July 2018]]

American Airlines was started in 1930 via a union of more than eighty small airlines.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|last=Koenig|first=David|title=American Airlines parent seeks Ch. 11 protection|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gqSFH2Ou81RHegJYXJtAeU9CkyhA?docId=c6952820f230470692fc37e00d9d2d36 |accessdate=December 7, 2011 |newspaper=Google News |date= November 29, 2011|agency=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204004443/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gqSFH2Ou81RHegJYXJtAeU9CkyhA?docId=c6952820f230470692fc37e00d9d2d36|archivedate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two organizations from which American Airlines was originated were [[Robertson Aircraft Corporation]] and [[Colonial Air Transport]].  The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways.  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/01/10/deals/amr_twa/|title=TWA to be bought by American - Jan. 10, 2001|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American had a direct role in the development of the [[DC-3]], which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO [[C. R. Smith]] to Donald Douglas, when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the [[DC-2]] to replace American's [[Curtiss T-32 Condor II|Curtiss Condor II]] biplanes. (The existing DC-2's cabin was {{convert|66|in|m}} wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths.) Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American's intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The prototype DST ([[Douglas Sleeper Transport]]) first flew on December 17, 1935, (the 32nd anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' flight at Kitty Hawk). Its cabin was {{convert|92|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14–16 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. There was no prototype DC-3; the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line and was delivered to American Airlines.&lt;ref&gt;Pearcy, Arthur. ''Douglas DC-3 Survivors, Volume 1''. Bourne End, Bucks, UK: Aston Publications, 1987. {{ISBN|0-946627-13-4}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; American Airlines inaugurated passenger service on June 26, 1936, with simultaneous flights from [[Newark, New Jersey]], and [[Chicago]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Henry. [http://www.dc3history.org/douglasdc3.html &quot;DC-3 History&quot;]. dc3history.org. Retrieved October 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, due to a downturn in the airline industry, American Airlines' parent company [[AMR Corporation]] filed for bankruptcy protection.  In 2013, American Airlines merged with [[US Airways]] but kept the American Airlines name, as it was the better-recognized brand internationally; the combination of the two airlines resulted in the creation of the largest airline in the United States, and ultimately the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Airlines|title=American Airlines – American company|website=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some routes, American also offers [[Basic Economy]], the airline's lowest main cabin fare. Basic Economy is located in the main cabin but comes with restrictions. These restrictions include waiting until check-in for a seat assignment, no upgrades or refunds, and boarding in the last group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Economy|url=https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/seats/basic-economy.jsp|website=American Airlines|publisher=American Airlines}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2019}}

=== Admirals Club ===
The Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing promotion shortly after he was made an honorary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]. Inspired by the [[Kentucky colonel]]s and other [[Title of honor|honorary title]] designations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers &quot;admirals&quot; of the &quot;Flagship fleet&quot; (AA called its aircraft &quot;Flagships&quot; at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Li |first1=Lucy |title=Ultimate Guide to Admirals Club |url=http://www.loungebuddy.com/admirals-club-ultimate-guide/ |website=LoungeBuddy |publisher=LoungeBuddy, Inc |accessdate=July 20, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906212847/http://www.loungebuddy.com/admirals-club-ultimate-guide/ |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=January 2019}} The list of Admirals included many celebrities, politicians, and other VIPs, as well as more &quot;ordinary&quot; customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

There was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the &quot;Admirals Club&quot; in 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their liquor at the airport.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination,&lt;ref name=&quot;timeac&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Toward Equality for VIPs |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |work=TIME |date=July 15, 1966 |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114112519/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C836046%2C00.html?iid=chix-sphere |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |url-status=live |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Club (and most other airline lounges) switched to a paid membership program.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

On January 17, 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign with FutureBrand dubbed, &quot;A New American&quot;. This included a new logo replacing the logo used since 1967. American Airlines calls the new logo the &quot;Flight Symbol, incorporating the eagle, star, and the letter “A” of the classic logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com/newamerican?anchorLocation=HomePageHero1&amp;reportedTitle=Becoming%20a%20new%20American&amp;reportedPosition=0&amp;url=undefined&amp;_locale=en_US&amp;repositoryName=undefined&amp;repositoryId=undefined |title=Becoming a new American |website=Aa.com |date= |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2019}}

American Airlines faced difficulty obtaining copyright registration for their 2013 logo. On June 3, 2016, American Airlines sought to register it with the [[United States Copyright Office]],&lt;ref name=&quot;US Copyright Office Ruling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zaller Rowland|first1=Catherine|title=Re: Second Request for Reconsideration for Refusal to Register American Airlines Flight Symbol; Correspondence ID: 1-28H4ZFK; SR#: 1-3537494381|url=https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/american-airlines-flight-symbol.pdf|date=January 8, 2018|website=Copyright.gov|publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]]|accessdate=January 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in October of that year, the Copyright Office ruled that the logo was ineligible for copyright protection, as it did not pass the [[threshold of originality]], and was thus in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;US Copyright Office Ruling&quot; /&gt; American requested that the Copyright Office reconsider, but on January 8, 2018, the Copyright Office affirmed its initial determination.&lt;ref name=&quot;US Copyright Office Ruling&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Copyright Office Says What We're All Thinking: American Airlines Lacks Creativity – One Mile at a Time|url=http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2018/01/25/american-airlines-copyright/|website=One Mile at a Time|date=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After American Airlines submitted additional materials, the Copyright Office reversed its decision on December 7, 2018, and ruled that the logo contained enough creativity to merit copyright protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.copyright.gov/rulings-filings/review-board/docs/american-airlines.pdf |title=Re: Registration Decision Regarding American Airlines Flight Symbol; Correspondence ID 1-28H4ZFK; SR 1-3537494381 |date=December 7, 2018 |publisher=[[United States Copyright Office]] |access-date=June 23, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aircraft livery ====
American's early [[aircraft livery|liveries]] varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an [[eagle]] painted on the fuselage.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.airlinesanddestinations.com/aircraft/american-airlines-unveils-new-logo-and-livery/ | title = American Airlines Unveils New Logo and Livery | website = Airlines and Destinations | date = January 17, 2013 | accessdate = July 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of [[Envoy Air|American Eagle Airlines]]. Propeller aircraft featured an [[international orange]] lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

[[File:American Airlines Astrojet N951AA.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737 in the Astrojet livery]]

In the late 1960s, American commissioned designer [[Massimo Vignelli]] to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple &quot;AA&quot; logo, without an eagle, on the tail; instead, Vignelli created a highly stylized eagle, which remained the company's logo until January 16, 2013. In 1999, American painted a new [[Boeing 757]] (N679AN) in its 1959 international orange livery. One [[Boeing 777]] and one Boeing 757 were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and the tail, in support of [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]]. One Boeing 757 is painted with a yellow ribbon on the tailfin on the aircraft and the side of the body says &quot;Flagship Freedom&quot;. American Eagle, the airline's regional airline has the same special livery on ERJ-145 aircraft.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

On January 17, 2013, American unveiled a new livery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-american-airlines-livery-20130117,0,198977.story |title=American Airlines unveils new logo, livery |work=Chicago Tribune |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217030650/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-american-airlines-livery-20130117,0,198977.story |archive-date=February 17, 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before then, American had been the only major U.S. airline to leave most of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. This was because C. R. Smith would not say he liked painted aircraft and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industry.bnet.com/travel/1000148/paint-vs-bare-metal-on-airplanes/ |title=Delta, Air Canada Among Carriers Weighing Benefit of Paint Stripping |website=Industry.bnet.com |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign dubbed, &quot;The New American&quot;. In addition to a new logo, American Airlines introduced a new livery for its fleet. The airline calls the new livery and branding &quot;a clean and modern update&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The current design features an abstract American flag on the tail, along with a silver-painted fuselage, as a throw-back to the old livery. The new design was painted by [[Leading Edge Aviation Services]] in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahles |first=Andrea |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/01/17/4556563/american-airlines-shows-off-new.html |title=Star-Telegram 18 January 2013: &quot;American Airlines shows off new look for new era&quot; |website=Star-telegram.com |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=January 29, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310095631/http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/01/17/4556563/american-airlines-shows-off-new.html |archivedate=March 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doug Parker, the incoming CEO indicated that the new livery could be short-lived, stating that &quot;maybe we need to do something slightly different than that ... The only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle, which kind of makes it confusing, so that gives us an opportunity, actually, to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;King, Eric.

Nbcdfw.com. Retrieved on July 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The current logo and livery have had mixed criticism, with ''[[Design Shack]]'' editor Joshua Johnson writing that they 'boldly and proudly communicate the concepts of American pride and freedom wrapped into a shape that instantly makes you think about an airplane',&lt;ref name=&quot;designshackliverypraise&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Joshua |title=Check Out the New American Airlines Logo |url=https://designshack.net/articles/graphics/check-out-the-new-american-airlines-logo/ |website=Design Shack |accessdate=June 11, 2019 |date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[http://www.askthepilot.com/ AskThePilot.com]'' author Patrick Smith describing the logo as 'a linoleum knife poking through a shower curtain'.&lt;ref name=&quot;patricksmithcriticism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Patrick |title=The New American Airlines Livery |url=http://www.askthepilot.com/american-to-keep-new-livery/ |website=AskThePilot.com |accessdate=June 11, 2019 |date=January 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in January 2013, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] asked the designer of the 1968 American Airlines logo ([[Massimo Vignelli]]) on his opinion over the rebranding.&lt;ref name=&quot;vignelliqna&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mayo |first1=Keenan |title=Q&amp;A: Original American Airlines Designer Massimo Vignelli on the Redesigned Logo |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-18/q-and-a-original-american-airlines-designer-massimo-vignelli-on-the-redesigned-logo |accessdate=August 7, 2019 |work=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=January 19, 2013 |format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, American let its employees decide the new livery's fate. On an internal website for employees, American posted two options, one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery. All of the [[American Airlines Group]] employees (including US Airways and other affiliates) were able to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2013/12/16/doug-parker-to-let-american-airlines-employees-decide-whether-to-keep-the-new-aa-tail | title = Doug Parker to let American Airlines employees decide whether to keep the new AA tail | website = [[Dallas News]] | last = Maxon | first = Terry | date = December 2013 | accessdate = July 26, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American ultimately decided to keep the new look.

=== Worker relations ===
The main representatives of key groups of employees are:
* The [[Allied Pilots Association]] is an in-house union which represents the nearly 15,000 American Airlines pilots; it was created in 1963 after the pilots left the [[Air Line Pilots Association]] (ALPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alliedpilots.org/Public/AboutAPA/Background/background.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204003305/https://www.alliedpilots.org/Public/AboutAPA/Background/background.asp |archivedate=February 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the majority of American Eagle pilots are ALPA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alpa.org/en/about-alpa/our-pilot-groups/pilot-groups/envoy|title=Envoy Air – ALPA|website=alpa.org|access-date=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Association of Professional Flight Attendants]] represents American Airlines flight attendants, including former USAirways flight attendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/business/airline-industry/20141218-american-airlines-flight-attendants-to-get-bigger-pay-raises-after-all.ece|title=American Airlines flight attendants to get bigger pay raises after all|website=Dallasnews.com|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flight attendants at wholly owned Regional Carriers (Envoy, Piedmont and PSA) are all represented by [http://www.afacwa.org/ Association of Flight Attendants – Communications Workers of America] (AFA-CWA). US Airways flight attendants were active members of AFA-CWA before the merger, and they are honorary lifetime members. AFA-CWA is the largest flight attendant union in the industry.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}
* The [[Transport Workers Union of America|Transport Workers Union-International Association of Machinists alliance]] (TWU-IAM) represents the majority of American Airlines employed fleet service agents, mechanics and other ground workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/news/business/aviation/sky-talk-blog/article36302475.html|title=American CEO says contract proposals to ground workers to have &quot;double-digit&quot; pay increases|website=Star-telegram.com|accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns and conflicts ==
=== Environmental violations ===
Between October 1993 to July 1998, American Airlines was repeatedly cited for using high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around the country, a violation of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=American Airlines Will Make Clean Air Improvements at Logan Airport Reports to EPA the Use of Illegal High Sulfur Fuel in Motor Vehicles|url=http://epa.gov/NE/pr/1999/072099b.html |website=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=July 19, 1999|accessdate=January 25, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707175156/http://epa.gov/ne/pr/1999/072099b.html|archivedate=July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifetime AAirpass ===
Since 1981, as a means of creating revenue in a period of loss-making, American Airlines had offered a [[AAirpass|lifetime pass]] of unlimited travel, for the initial cost of $250,000. This entitled the pass holder to fly anywhere in the world. 28 were sold. However, after some time, the airline realised they were making losses on the tickets, with the ticketholders costing them up to $1 million each. Ticketholders were booking large amounts of flights, and some ticketholders flying interstate for lunch or flying to London multiple times a month. AA raised the cost of the lifetime pass to $3 million, and then finally stopped offering it in 2003. AA then used litigation to cancel two of the lifetime offers, saying the passes &quot;had been terminated due to fraudulent activity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pass&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Free’quent flier has wings clipped after American Airlines takes away his unlimited pass|url=https://nypost.com/2012/05/13/freequent-flier-has-wings-clipped-after-american-airlines-takes-away-his-unlimited-pass/ |publisher=New York Post|date=May 13, 2012|accessdate=October 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cabin fume events ===
* In 1988, on American Airlines Flight 132's approach into Nashville, flight attendants notified the cockpit that there was smoke in the cabin. The flight crew in the cockpit ignored the warning, as on a prior flight, a [[fume event]] had occurred due to a problem with the [[auxiliary power unit]]. However, the smoke on Flight 132 was caused by improperly packaged hazardous materials. According to the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] inquiry, the cockpit crew persistently refused to acknowledge that there was a serious threat to the aircraft or the passengers, even after they were told that floor was becoming soft and passengers had to be reseated. As a result, the aircraft was not evacuated immediately on landing, exposing the crew and passengers to the threat of smoke and fire longer than necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a02a/6b1ff0725d682e3ab0fa55681a1db46af4ad.pdf|title=Chute, Rebecca D., and Earl L.

* On April 11, 2007, toxic smoke and oil fumes leaked into the aircraft cabin as American Airlines Flight 843 taxied to the gate. A flight attendant who was present in the cabin subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing, stating that she was diagnosed with neurotoxic disorder due to her exposure to the fumes, which caused her to experience memory loss, tremors, and severe headaches. She settled with the company in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44777304/ns/travel-news/t/boeing-suit-settlement-stirs-jetliner-air-safety-debate/#.XFqZYVUzaUk Boeing suit settlement stirs jetliner air safety debate], NBC news, October 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, Mike Holland, deputy chairman for radiation and environmental issues at the [[Allied Pilots Association]] and an American Airlines pilot, said that the pilot union had started alerting pilots of the danger of contaminated [[bleed air]], including contacting crew members that the union thinks were exposed to contamination based on maintenance records and pilot logs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://zembla.bnnvara.nl/pdf/wsj_fume_events.pdf Nassauer, Sarah. &quot;Up in the Air: New Worries About ‘Fume Events’ on Planes.&quot;] The Wall Street Journal (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a January 2017 incident on American Airlines Flight 1896, seven flight attendants were hospitalized after a strange odor was detected in the cabin. The Airbus A330 involved subsequently underwent a &quot;thorough maintenance inspection,&quot; having been involved in three fume events in three months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/fume-incident-hospitalises-american-airlines-crew-and-raises-questions-over-safety-of-cabin-air/ ‘Fume event’ hospitalises American Airlines crew in latest incident concerning cabin air], Telegraph, January 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://abcnews.go.com/US/american-airlines-jet-suffers-fume-incident-months-flight/story?id=44535862 American Airlines Jet Has 3rd Fume Incident in 3 Months, 7 Flight Attendants Transported to Hospital and Released], ABC news, January 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrimination complaints ===
On October 24, 2017, the [[NAACP]] issued a travel advisory for American Airlines urging [[African Americans]] to &quot;exercise caution&quot; when traveling with the airline. The NAACP issued the advisory after four incidents. In one incident, a black woman was moved from First Class to coach while her white traveling companion was allowed to remain in First Class. In another incident, a black man was forced to give up his seats after being confronted by two unruly white passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS20171025&quot;&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/the-naacp-issues-travel-advisory-for-american-airlines-warning-black-passengers-of-disturbing-incidents The NAACP issues travel advisory for American Airlines, warning black passengers of ‘disturbing incidents’], PBS, October 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NAACP, while they did receive complaints on other airlines, most of their complaints in the year prior to their advisory were on American Airlines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/10/25/naacp-most-complaints-american-airlines-what-can-brands-learn/800300001/ NAACP: Most complaints about American Airlines.
