'''''Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny''''' ({{lang-de|'''Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny'''|links=no}}) is a political-satirical [[opera]] composed by [[Kurt Weill]] to a German [[libretto]] by [[Bertolt Brecht]]. It was first performed on 9 March [[1930 in music#Opera|1930]] at the {{Lang|de|[[Neues Theater (Leipzig)|Neues Theater]]|italic=no}} in Leipzig.

==Composition history==
Weill was asked by the 1927 [[Baden-Baden]] music festival committee to write a one act [[chamber opera]] for the festival. He ended up writing ''[[Mahagonny-Songspiel]]'', sometimes known as ''Das kleine Mahagonny'', a concert work for voices and small orchestra commissioned. The work was written in May 1927, and performed in June. The eleven numbers, which include the &quot;Alabama Song&quot; and &quot;Benares Song&quot;, were duly incorporated into the full opera as Weill worked through summer and autumn on the libretto. The opera had its premiere in Leipzig on 9 March 1930 and played in Berlin in December of the following year. The opera was banned by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in 1933 and did not have a significant production until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/03/when-brecht-met-weill-a-dazzling-but-doomed-partnership|title=When Brecht met Weill: a dazzling but doomed partnership|last=Hensher|first=Philip|date=2015-03-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/10/131932982/decadence-and-decay-kurt-weill-s-mahagonny|title=Decadence and Decay: Kurt Weill's 'Mahagonny'|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drew|first=David|date=January 1963|title=The History of Mahahonny|journal=The Musical Times|volume=184|issue=1439|pages=18{{em dash}}24|jstor=951087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weill's score uses a number of styles, including [[ragtime|rag-time]], [[jazz]] and formal [[counterpoint]], notably in the &quot;[[Alabama Song]]&quot; (which has been interpreted by a range of artists, notably [[Ute Lemper]], [[The Doors]] and [[David Bowie]]).

==Language==
The lyrics for the &quot;Alabama Song&quot; and another song, the &quot;Benares Song&quot; are in English (albeit specifically [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] English) and are performed in that language even when the opera is performed in its original ([[German language|German]]) language.

The name of the city itself is a hybrid of the English word [[mahogany]] and its German language equivalent, ''Mahagoni''.

==Performance history==
It has played in opera houses around the world. Never achieving the popularity of Weill and Brecht's ''[[The Threepenny Opera]],'' ''Mahagonny'' is still considered a work of stature with a haunting score. Herbert Lindenberger in his book ''Opera in History'', for example, views ''Mahagonny'' alongside Schoenberg's ''[[Moses und Aron]]'' as indicative of the two poles of modernist opera.

Following the Leipzig premiere, the opera was presented in Berlin in December 1931 at the [[Theater am Schiffbauerdamm]] conducted by [[Alexander von Zemlinsky]] with [[Lotte Lenya]] as Jenny, Trude Hesterberg as Begbick, and Harald Paulsen as Jimmy. Another production was presented in January 1934 in Copenhagen at the Det ny Teater. Other productions within Europe waited until the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], some notable ones being in January 1963 in London at [[Sadler's Wells Opera]] conducted by [[Colin Davis]] and in Berlin in September 1977 by the [[Komische Oper Berlin|Komische Oper]].

It was not presented in the United States until 1970, when a short-lived April production at the Phyllis Anderson Theatre off Broadway starred [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]] as Jenny, [[Frank Porretta]] as Jimmy, and [[Estelle Parsons]] as Begbick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w2sZLVpH_jwC&amp;pg=PA129|title=Off-Broadway Musicals since 1919: From Greenwich Village Follies to The Toxic Avenger|author=Thomas S. Hischak|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2011|page=129|isbn=9780810877726}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then presented in Boston in 1973 under the direction of Sarah Caldwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1973/2/15/nights-at-the-opera-pinsofar-as/|title=Nights at the Opera|author=|publisher=The Harvard Crimson|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A full version was presented at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1974, with [[Gilbert Price]] as Jimmy and Stephanie Cotsirilos as Jenny. [[Kurt Kasznar]] played Moses. The libretto was performed in an original translation by Michael Feingold; the production was directed by Alvin Epstein. In October 1978, Yale presented a &quot;chamber version&quot; adapted and directed by Keith Hack, with [[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]] as Jimmy and [[June Gable]] as Begbick. [[Mark Lynn-Baker]] played Fatty; [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] was Trinity Moses. In November 1979, ''Mahagonny'' debuted at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in a [[John Dexter]] production conducted by [[James Levine]]. The cast included [[Teresa Stratas]] as Jenny, [[Astrid Varnay]] as Begbick, [[Richard Cassilly]] as Jimmy, [[Cornell MacNeil]] as Moses, [[Ragnar Ulfung]] as Fatty and [[Paul Plishka]] as Joe. The production was televised in 1979 and was released on DVD in 2010.

The [[Los Angeles Opera]] presented the opera in September 1989 under conductor [[Kent Nagano]] and with a [[Jonathan Miller]] production. Other notable productions in Europe from the 1980s included the March 1986 presentation by the [[Scottish Opera]] in Glasgow; a June 1990 production in Florence by the [[Maggio Musicale Fiorentino]]. In October 1995 and 1997, the [[Paris Opera]] staged by [[Graham Vick]], under the baton of [[Jeffrey Tate]] starring [[Marie McLaughlin]] as Jenny, [[Felicity Palmer]] (1995) and Kathryn Harries (1997) as Begbick, and Kim Begley (1995)/Peter Straka (1997) as Jimmy.

The July 1998 [[Salzburg Festival]] production featured [[Catherine Malfitano]] as Jenny, [[Gwyneth Jones (soprano)|Gwyneth Jones]] as Begbick, and [[Jerry Hadley]] as Jimmy. The [[Vienna State Opera]] added it to its repertoire in January 2012 in a production by [[Jérôme Deschamps]] conducted by [[Ingo Metzmacher]] starring [[Christopher Ventris]] as Jimmy and [[Angelika Kirchschlager]] as Jenny, notably casting young mezzo-soprano [[Elisabeth Kulman]] as Begbick, breaking the tradition of having a veteran soprano (like Varnay or Jones) or musical theater singer (like [[Patti LuPone]]) perform the role.

Productions within the US have included those in November 1998 by the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] directed by [[David Alden]]. Catherine Malfitano repeated her role as Jenny, while [[Felicity Palmer]] sang Begbick, and Kim Begley sang the role of Jimmy. The Los Angeles Opera's February 2007 production directed by [[John Doyle (director)|John Doyle]] and conducted by [[James Conlon]] included [[Audra McDonald]] as Jenny, [[Patti LuPone]] as Begbick, and [[Anthony Dean Griffey]] as Jimmy. This production was recorded on [[DVD]], and subsequently won the 2009 [[Grammy Award]]s for &quot;Best Classical Album&quot; and &quot;Best Opera Recording.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The 51st Annual Grammy Awards Winners List |url=http://www.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx#30 | accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 it was performed using an alternate libretto as a &quot;wrestling opera&quot; at the Oakland Metro by the performers of [[Hoodslam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Hoodslam: The Opera |url=http://birdswillfall.com/ | accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major new production will have its world premiere in July 2019 at the [[Aix-en-Provence Festival]] in France conducted by [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]] with stage direction by [[Ivo van Hove]]. It is a co-production of [[Dutch National Opera]], [[Metropolitan Opera]], Opera Ballet Vlaanderen, and Les Theatres De La Ville De Luxembourg.  It will be fully staged in New York and Amsterdam in future seasons.&lt;ref&gt;https://festival-aix.com/en/event/rise-and-fall-city-mahagonny&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===
''Scene 1: A desolate no-man's land''

A truck breaks down. Three fugitives from justice get out and find themselves in the city of Mahagonny: Fatty the Bookkeeper, Trinity Moses, and Leocadia Begbick. Because the federal agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying where they are and founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because there is nothing else in the world to rely on.

{{listen|type=music|filename=Mahagonny Alabama Song.ogg|title=Alabama Song|description=Excerpt from the &quot;[[Alabama Song]]&quot; as sung in act 1, scene 2}}
''Scene 2''

The news of Mahagonny spreads quickly, and sharks from all over flock to the bait, including the whore Jenny Smith, who is seen, with six other girls, singing the &quot;[[Alabama Song]]&quot;, in which she waves goodbye to her home and sets out in pursuit of whiskey, dollars and pretty boys.

''Scene 3''

In the big cities, where men lead boring, purposeless lives, Fatty and Moses spread the gospel of Mahagonny, city of gold, among the disillusioned.

''Scene 4''

Four Alaskan Lumberjacks who have shared hard times together in the timberlands and made their fortunes set off together for Mahagonny. Jimmy Mahoney and his three friends&amp;nbsp;– Jacob Schmidt, Bank Account Billy, and Alaska Wolf Joe&amp;nbsp;– sing of the pleasures awaiting them in &quot;Off to Mahagonny&quot;, and look forward to the peace and pleasure they will find there.

''Scene 5''

The four friends arrive in Mahagonny, only to find other disappointed travelers already leaving. Begbick, well-informed about their personal tastes, marks down her prices, but for the penurious Billy they still seem too high. Jimmy impatiently calls for the girls of Mahagonny to show themselves, so he can make a choice. Begbick suggests Jenny as the right girl for Jack, who finds her rates too high. She pleads with Jack to reconsider (&quot;Havana Song&quot;), which arouses Jim's interest, and he chooses her. Jenny and the girls sing a tribute to &quot;the Jimmys from Alaska.&quot;

''Scene 6''

Jimmy and Jenny get to know one another as she asks him to define the terms of their contact: Does he wish her to wear her hair up or down, to wear fancy underwear or none at all? &quot;What is your wish?&quot; asks Jim, but Jenny evades answering.

''Scene 7''

Begbick, Fatty and Moses meet to discuss the pleasure city's financial crisis: People are leaving in droves, and the price of whiskey is sinking rapidly. Begbick suggests going back to civilization, but Fatty reminds her that the federal agents have been inquiring for her in nearby Pensacola. Money would solve everything, declares Begbick, and she decides to soak the four new arrivals for all they've got.

''Scene 8''

Jimmy, restless, attempts to leave Mahagonny, because he misses the wife he left in Alaska.

''Scene 9''

In front of the Rich Man's Hotel, Jimmy and the others sit lazily as a pianist plays [[Tekla Bądarzewska-Baranowska|Tekla Bądarzewska]]'s &quot;A Maiden's Prayer&quot;. With growing anger, Jimmy sings of how his hard work and suffering in Alaska have led only to this. Drawing a knife, he shouts for Begbick, while his friends try to disarm him and the other men call to have him thrown out. Calm again, he tells Begbick that Mahagonny can never make people happy: it has too much peace and quiet.

''Scene 10''

As if in answer to Jimmy's complaint, the city is threatened by a hurricane. Everyone sings in horror of the destruction awaiting them.

''Scene 11''

Tensely, people watch for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, if not for the pleasure of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick's enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks over someone else, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.

===Act 2===
''Scene 12''

Magically, the hurricane bypasses Mahagonny, and the people sing in awe of their miraculous rescue. This confirms Begbick's belief in the philosophy of &quot;Do what you want,&quot; and she proceeds to put it into effect.

{{listen|type=music|filename=Mahagonny Act2scene13.ogg|title=Jacob Schmidt's departure|description=Jacob Schmidt is gorging himself on food and is about to die in act 2, scene 13}}
''Scene 13 At the renovated &quot;Do It&quot; tavern.''

The men sing of the four pleasures of life: Eating, Lovemaking, Fighting and Drinking. First comes eating: To kitschy cafe music, Jimmy's friend Jacob gorges until he keels over and dies. The men sing a chorale over his body, saluting &quot;a man without fear&quot;.

''Scene 14: Loving.''

While Begbick collects money and issues tips on behavior, Moses placates the impatient men queuing to make love to Jenny and the other whores. The men sing the &quot;Mandalay Song&quot;, warning that love does not last forever, and urging those ahead of them to make it snappy.

''Scene 15: Fighting.''

The men flock to see a boxing match between Trinity Moses and Jim's friend Alaska Wolf Joe. While most of the men, including the ever-cautious Billy, bet on the burly Moses, Jim, out of friendship, bets heavily on Joe. The match is manifestly unfair; Moses not only wins but kills Joe in knocking him out.

''Scene 16: Drinking.''

In an effort to shake off the gloom of Joe's death, Jimmy invites everyone to have a drink on him. The men sing &quot;Life in Mahagonny&quot;, describing how one could live in the city for only five dollars a day, but those who wanted to have fun always needed more. Jim, increasingly drunk, dreams of sailing back to Alaska. He takes down a curtain rod for a mast and climbs on the pool table, pretending it is a ship; Jenny and Billy play along. Jimmy is abruptly sobered up when Begbick demands payment for the whiskey as well as for the damage to her property. Totally broke, he turns in a panic to Jenny, who explains her refusal to help him out in the song &quot;Make your own bed&quot;&amp;nbsp;– an adaptation of the ideas he proclaimed at the end of act 1. Jim is led off in chains as the chorus, singing another stanza of &quot;Life in Mahagonny&quot;, returns to its pastimes. Trinity Moses assures the crowd that Jimmy will pay for his crimes with his life.

''Scene 17''

At night, Jim alone and chained to a lamppost, sings a plea for the sun not to rise on the day of his impending trial.

===Act 3===

''Scene 18: In the courtroom''

Moses, like a carnival barker, sells tickets to the trials. He serves as prosecutor, Fatty as defense attorney, Begbick as judge. First comes the case of Toby Higgins, accused of premeditated murder for the purpose of testing an old revolver. Fatty invites the injured party to rise, but no one does so, since the dead do not speak. Toby bribes all three, and as a result, Begbick dismisses the case. Next Jimmy's case is called. Chained, he is led in by Billy, from whom he tries to borrow money; Billy of course refuses, despite Jim's plea to remember their time together in Alaska. In virtually the same speech he used to attack Higgins, Moses excoriates him for not paying his bills, for seducing Jenny (who presents herself as a plaintiff) to commit a &quot;carnal act&quot; with him for money, and for inciting the crowd with &quot;an illegal joyous song&quot; on the night of the typhoon. Billy, with the chorus's support, counters that, in committing the latter act, Jimmy discovered the laws by which Mahagonny lives. Moses argues that Jim hastened his friend Joe's death in a prizefight by betting on him, and Billy counters by asking who actually killed Joe. Moses does not reply. But there is no answer for the main count against him. Jim gets short sentences for his lesser crimes, but for having no money, he is sentenced to death. Begbick, Fatty and Moses, rising to identify themselves as the injured parties, proclaim &quot;in the whole human race / there is no greater criminal / than a man without money&quot;. As Jim is led off to await execution, everyone sings the &quot;Benares Song&quot;, in which they long for that exotic city &quot;where the sun is shining.&quot; But Benares has been destroyed by an earthquake. &quot;Where shall we go?&quot; they ask.

''Scene 19: At the gallows''

Jim says a tender goodbye to Jenny, who, dressed in white, declares herself his widow. He surrenders her to Billy, his last remaining companion from Alaska. When he tries to delay the execution by reminding the people of Mahagonny that God exists, they play out for him, under Moses' direction, the story of &quot;God in Mahagonny&quot;, in which the Almighty condemns the town and is overthrown by its citizens, who declare that they can not be sent to Hell because they are already in Hell. Jim, chastened, asks only for a glass of water, but is refused even this as Moses gives the signal for the trap to be sprung.

''Scene 20''

A caption advises that, after Jim's death, increasing hostility among the city's various factions has caused the destruction of Mahagonny. To a potpourri of themes from earlier in the opera, groups of protesters are seen on the march, in conflict with one another, while the city burns in the background. Jenny and the whores carry Jim's clothing and accessories like sacred relics; Billy and several men carry his coffin. In a new theme, they and the others declare, &quot;Nothing you can do will help a dead man&quot;. Begbick, Fatty and Moses appear with placards of their own, joining the entire company in its march and declaring &quot;Nothing will help him or us or you now,&quot; as the opera ends in chaos.

==In other media==
The 2005 movie ''[[Manderlay]]'', directed by [[Lars von Trier]], contains several references to the plot of ''Mahagonny''. The most notable of these is the threat of a hurricane approaching the city during the first act. Von Trier's earlier movie ''[[Dogville]]'', to which Manderlay is a sequel, was for a large part based on a song from Brecht's ''[[Threepenny Opera]]'' (&quot;[[Pirate Jenny]]&quot;). In the brothel scene in act 2 of ''Mahagonny'', the choir sings a &quot;Song von Mandelay&quot;. The play ''[[Happy End (musical)|Happy End]]'' (1929) by [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], Brecht and Weill, also contains a song called &quot;Der Song von Mandelay&quot;, which uses the same refrain as in the brothel scene of ''Mahagonny''. Brecht's use of the name Mandelay/Mandalay was inspired by [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem &quot;[[Mandalay (poem)|Mandalay]]&quot;.
