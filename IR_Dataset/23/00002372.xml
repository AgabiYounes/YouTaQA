'''''ALF Tales''''' is a 30-minute [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning animated series]] that aired on [[NBC]] from September 10, 1988 to December 9, 1989. The show is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[ALF: The Animated Series]]'' which featured characters from that series play various characters from [[fairy tale]]s. The fairy tale was usually altered for comedic effect in a manner akin to [[Fractured Fairy Tales]].

Each story typically spoofs a film genre, such as the &quot;Cinderella&quot; episode done as an Elvis movie. Some episodes featured a &quot;[[fourth wall]]&quot; effect where ALF is backstage preparing for the episode, and Rob Cowan would appear drawn as a TV executive (who introduced himself as &quot;Roger Cowan, network executive&quot;) to try to brief ALF on how to improve this episode. For instance Cowan once told ALF who was readying for a [[medieval]] themed episode that &quot;less than 2% of our audience lives in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]&quot;.
