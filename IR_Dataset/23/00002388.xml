==Medical uses==
Antidepressants are used to treat [[major depressive disorder]] and of other conditions, including some [[anxiety disorder]]s, some [[chronic pain]] conditions, and to help manage some addictions. Antidepressants are often used in combinations with one another.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jennings2018&quot;/&gt;

===Major depressive disorder===
The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommended that antidepressant treatment be considered for:
* People with a history of moderate or severe depression,
* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period,
* As a second-line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions,
* As a first-line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be used in combination with psychosocial interventions in most cases, should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are typically better tolerated than other antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/chapter/key-priorities-for-implementation |title=Depression in adults: The treatment and management of depression in adults |website=NICE guidelines [CG90] |date=October 2009 |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) |accessdate=23 September 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923150203/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/chapter/key-priorities-for-implementation |archivedate=23 September 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors that include severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and the person's preference. Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS) or light therapy. They recommended antidepressant medication as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, that should be given to all people with severe depression unless ECT is planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/mdd.pdf|title=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder|edition=Third|website=PsychiatryOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviews of antidepressants in adults with depression find benefits &lt;ref name=&quot;CiprianiFurukawa2018&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BarthKriston2018&quot;/&gt; while others do not.&lt;ref name=BMJ2019/&gt;

===Anxiety disorders===

====Generalized anxiety disorder====
Antidepressants are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD) that has failed to respond to conservative measures such as education and self-help activities. GAD is a common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events. Key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues, and difficulty controlling worrisome thoughts that persists for at least 6 months.

Antidepressants provide a modest-to-moderate reduction in anxiety in GAD.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlwww.nice.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13314/52599/52599.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |accessdate=20 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021044157/http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13314/52599/52599.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficacy of different antidepressants is similar.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlwww.nice.org.uk&quot; /&gt;

====Social anxiety disorder====

Some antidepressants are used as a treatment for [[social anxiety disorder]], but their efficacy is not entirely convincing, as only a small proportion of antidepressants showed some efficacy for this condition. [[Paroxetine]] was the first drug to be FDA-approved for this disorder. Its efficacy is considered beneficial, although not everyone responds favorably to the drug. Sertraline and [[fluvoxamine]] extended release were later approved for it as well, while escitalopram is used off-label with acceptable efficacy. However, there isn't enough evidence to support [[citalopram]] for treating social phobia, and fluoxetine was no better than placebo in clinical trials. SSRIs are used as a first-line treatment for social anxiety, but they don't work for everyone. One alternative would be venlafaxine, which is a SNRI. It showed benefits for social phobia in five clinical trials against placebo, while the other SNRIs are not considered particularly useful for this disorder as many of them didn't undergo testing for it. As of now, it is unclear if [[duloxetine]] and [[desvenlafaxine]] can provide benefits for social anxiety sufferers. However, another class of antidepressants called MAOIs are considered effective for social anxiety, but they come with many unwanted side effects and are rarely used. Phenelzine was shown to be a good treatment option, but its use is limited by dietary restrictions. [[Moclobemide]] is a RIMA and showed mixed results but still got approval in some European countries for social anxiety disorder. TCA antidepressants, such as [[clomipramine]] and imipramine, are not considered effective for this anxiety disorder in particular. This leaves out SSRIs such as [[paroxetine]], [[sertraline]] and [[fluvoxamine]] CR as acceptable and tolerated treatment options for this disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canton|first=John|last2=Scott|first2=Kate M|last3=Glue|first3=Paul|date=2012|title=Optimal treatment of social phobia: systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment|volume=8|pages=203–215|doi=10.2147/NDT.S23317|issn=1176-6328|pmc=3363138|pmid=22665997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Richard A.|last2=Gaynes|first2=Bradley N.|last3=Gartlehner|first3=Gerald|last4=Moore|first4=Charity G.|last5=Tiwari|first5=Ruchi|last6=Lohr|first6=Kathleen N.|date=May 2008|title=Efficacy and Tolerability of Second-Generation Antidepressants in Social Anxiety Disorder|journal=International Clinical Psychopharmacology|volume=23|issue=3|pages=170–179|doi=10.1097/YIC.0b013e3282f4224a|issn=0268-1315|pmc=2657552|pmid=18408531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Obsessive–compulsive disorder====
SSRIs are a second-line treatment of adult [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first-line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs are considered as a second-line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg031niceguideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206033654/https://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg031niceguideline.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRIs appear useful for OCD, at least in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soomro |first1=GM |last2=Altman |first2=D |last3=Rajagopal |first3=S |last4=Oakley-Browne |first4=M |title=Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=23 January 2008 |issue=1 |pages=CD001765 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001765.pub3 |pmid=18253995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term treatment trials of 6 to 24 weeks and in discontinuation trials of 28 to 52 weeks duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid=22226028| year=2012| last1=Fineberg| first1=N.

Despite this, it has not shown superiority to fluvoxamine in trials. All SSRIs can be used effectively for OCD, and in some cases, SNRIs can also be tried even though none of them is approved specifically for OCD.  However, even with all these treatment options, many people remain symptomatic after initiating the medication, and less than half of them do achieve remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kellner|first=Michael|date=June 2010|title=Drug treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=2|pages=187–197|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3181958|pmid=20623923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post traumatic stress disorder====
Antidepressants are one of the treatment options for PTSD, however their efficacy is not well established. Two antidepressants are FDA approved for it, [[paroxetine]] and [[sertraline]], they belong to the serotonin reuptake inhibitors class. Paroxetine has slightly higher response and remission rates than sertraline for this condition, however both drugs are not considered very helpful for every person that takes them. Fluoxetine and venlafaxine are used off label, with fluoxetine producing unsatisfactory mixed results and [[venlafaxine]], while having a response rates of 78%, which is significantly higher than what paroxetine and sertraline achieved, but it did not address all the symptoms of ptsd like the two drugs did, which is in part due to the fact the venlafaxine is an SNRI, this class of drugs inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine too, this could cause some anxiety in some people. Fluvoxamine, [[escitalopram]] and citalopram were not well tested in this disorder. MAOIs, while some of them may be helpful, are not used much because of their unwanted side effects. This leaves paroxetine and sertraline as acceptable treatment options for some people, although more effective antidepressants are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Walter|date=January 2012|title=Pharmacotherapy for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder In Combat Veterans|journal=Pharmacy and Therapeutics|volume=37|issue=1|pages=32–38|issn=1052-1372|pmc=3278188|pmid=22346334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Panic disorder====

[[Panic disorder]] is relatively treated well with medications compared with other disorders, several classes of antidepressants have shown efficacy for this disorder, however SSRIs and SNRIs are used first-line. Paroxetine, sertraline, [[fluoxetine]] are FDA approved for panic disorder, although fluvoxamine, escitalopram and citalopram are considered effective for it. The SNRI venlafaxine is also approved for this condition. Unlike with social anxiety and PTSD, some TCAs antidepressants, like [[clomipramine]] and imipramine, have shown efficacy for panic disorder. Moreover, the MAOI phenelzine is considered useful too. Panic disorder has many drugs for its treatment, however, the starting dose must be lower than the one used for major depressive disorder because people, in the initiation of treatment, have reported an increase in anxiety as a result of starting the medication. In conclusion, while panic disorder's treatment options seem acceptable and useful for this condition, many people are still symptomatic after treatment with residual symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bighelli|first=Irene|last2=Castellazzi|first2=Mariasole|last3=Cipriani|first3=Andrea|last4=Girlanda|first4=Francesca|last5=Guaiana|first5=Giuseppe|last6=Koesters|first6=Markus|last7=Turrini|first7=Giulia|last8=Furukawa|first8=Toshi A.|last9=Barbui|first9=Corrado|date=2018-04-05|title=Antidepressants versus placebo for panic disorder in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD010676|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010676.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6494573|pmid=29620793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bighelli|first=Irene|last2=Trespidi|first2=Carlotta|last3=Castellazzi|first3=Mariasole|last4=Cipriani|first4=Andrea|last5=Furukawa|first5=Toshi A.|last6=Girlanda|first6=Francesca|last7=Guaiana|first7=Giuseppe|last8=Koesters|first8=Markus|last9=Barbui|first9=Corrado|date=2016-09-12|title=Antidepressants and benzodiazepines for panic disorder in adults|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=9|pages=CD011567|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD011567.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6457579|pmid=27618521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrisano|first=Costanza|last2=Chiesa|first2=Alberto|last3=Serretti|first3=Alessandro|date=January 2013|title=Newer antidepressants and panic disorder: a meta-analysis|journal=International Clinical Psychopharmacology|volume=28|issue=1|pages=33–45|doi=10.1097/YIC.0b013e32835a5d2e|issn=1473-5857|pmid=23111544|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b371d67b77a0cd771cf94deb6563f53b0ce83fcf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===

====Fibromyalgia====

A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that antidepressants treatment favorably affects pain, health-related quality of life, depression, and sleep in [[fibromyalgia]] syndrome. Tricyclics appear to be the most effective class, with moderate effects on pain and sleep and small effects on fatigue and health-related quality of life. The fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction on tricyclics was 48% versus 28% for placebo. For SSRIs and SNRIs the fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction was 36% (20% in the placebo comparator arms) and 42% (32% in the corresponding placebo comparator arms). Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Häuser W, Wolfe F, Tölle T, Uçeyler N, Sommer C | title=The role of antidepressants in the management of fibromyalgia syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal=CNS Drugs | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=297–307 |date=April 2012 | pmid=22452526 | doi=10.2165/11598970-000000000-00000 | url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4f822246d44e376b2f096641a4ba8e09aed2da08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antidepressants including [[amitriptyline]], [[fluoxetine]], [[duloxetine]], [[milnacipran]], [[moclobemide]], and [[pirlindole]] are recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the treatment of fibromyalgia based on &quot;limited evidence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enfa-europe.eu/assets/downloads/eular.pdf|title=www.enfa-europe.eu|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230934/http://www.enfa-europe.eu/assets/downloads/eular.pdf|archivedate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuropathic pain====

A 2014 meta-analysis from the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found the antidepressant duloxetine to be effective for the treatment of pain resulting from [[diabetic neuropathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lunn MP, Hughes RA, Wiffen PJ | title=Duloxetine for treating painful neuropathy, chronic pain or fibromyalgia | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume=1 | issue=1| pages=CD007115 | year=2014 | pmid=24385423 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007115.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same group reviewed data for amitriptyline in the treatment of [[neuropathic pain]] and found limited useful randomized clinical trial data.

===Limitations and strategies===

Partial remission is characterized by the presence of poorly defined residual symptoms. These symptoms typically include depressed mood, anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue and diminished interest or pleasure. It is currently unclear which factors predict partial remission. However, it is clear that residual symptoms are powerful predictors of relapse, with relapse rates 3–6&amp;nbsp;times higher in people with residual symptoms than in those who experience full remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tranter R, O'Donovan C, Chandarana P, Kennedy S | title=Prevalence and outcome of partial remission in depression | journal=Journal of Psychiatry &amp; Neuroscience | volume=27 | issue=4 | pages=241–7 | year=2002 | pmid=12174733 | pmc=161658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, antidepressant drugs tend to lose efficacy over the course of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Byrne SE, Rothschild AJ | title=Loss of Antidepressant Efficacy During Maintenance Therapy | journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume=59 | issue=6 | pages=279–88 | year=1998 | pmid=9671339 | doi=10.4088/JCP.v59n0602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], less than one-third of Americans taking one antidepressant medication have seen a mental health professional in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Antidepressant Use in Persons Aged 12 and Over: United States, 2005–2008|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db76.htm|website=cdc.gov|access-date=4 February 2016|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|series=Products – Data Briefs – Number 76 – October 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204212849/http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db76.htm|archivedate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of strategies are used in clinical practice to try to overcome these limits and variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mischoulon D, Nierenberg AA, Kizilbash L, Rosenbaum JF, Fava M | title=Strategies for managing depression refractory to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: A survey of clinicians | journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume=45 | issue=5 | pages=476–81 | year=2000 | pmid=10900529 | doi=10.1177/070674370004500509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include switching medication, augmentation, and combination.

===Switching antidepressants===
{{see also|Treatment-resistant depression#Switching antidepressants}}

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant.  A 2006 meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for people who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug. However, the more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSRIswitch&quot; /&gt; However, a later meta-analysis found no difference between switching to a new drug and staying on the old medication; although 34% of treatment resistant people responded when switched to the new drug, 40% responded without being switched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bschor T, Baethge C | title=No evidence for switching the antidepressant: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of a common therapeutic strategy | journal= [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | volume=121 | issue=3 | pages=174–9 | year=2010 | pmid=19703121 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01458.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augmentation and combination===

For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines suggest augmentation, or adding a drug from a different class. These include [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] and [[thyroid]] augmentation, [[dopamine agonist]]s, [[sex steroid]]s, [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|NRIs]], [[glucocorticoid]]-specific agents, or the newer [[anticonvulsant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;augment&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeBattista C, Lembke A | title=Update on augmentation of antidepressant response in resistant depression | journal=Current Psychiatry Reports | volume=7 | issue=6 | pages=435–40 | year=2005 | pmid=16318821 | doi=10.1007/s11920-005-0064-x | url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9ed7c90f00a869ab3d1daa13080561a12c164833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination strategy involves adding another antidepressant, usually from a different class so as to have effect on other mechanisms. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lam RW, Wan DD, Cohen NL, Kennedy SH | title=Combining Antidepressants for Treatment-Resistant Depression | journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume=63 | issue=8 | pages=685–93 | year=2002 | pmid=12197448 | doi=10.4088/JCP.v63n0805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tests conducted include the use of [[psychostimulant]]s as an augmentation therapy. Several studies have shown the efficacy of combining [[modafinil]] for treatment-resistant people. It has been used to help combat SSRI-associated fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goss AJ, Kaser M, Costafreda SG, Sahakian BJ, Fu CH | title=Modafinil augmentation therapy in unipolar and bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume=74 | issue=11 | pages=1101–7| year=2013 | pmid=24330897 | doi=10.4088/JCP.13r08560 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7dada8432d119cefca40581f03c2326a24fad69a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term use===

The effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends. This results in a high rate of [[relapse]]. A 2003 [[meta-analysis]] found that 18% of people who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a [[placebo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Geddes JR, Carney SM, Davies C, Furukawa TA, Kupfer DJ, Frank E, Goodwin GM | title=Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: A systematic review | journal=The Lancet | volume=361 | issue=9358 | pages=653–61 | year=2003 | pmid=12606176 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8 | url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/74efe96a2b58774d2d1be35a944beb8fb7e1ee97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects==
Difficulty tolerating [[adverse effects]] is the most common reason for antidepressant discontinuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/depression/features/coping-with-side-effects-of-depression-treatment|title=Coping With Side Effects of Depression Treatment|last=Allen|first=Arthur|website=WebMD|access-date=2019-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost any medication involved with serotonin regulation has the potential to cause [[serotonin syndrome|serotonin toxicity]] (also known as ''serotonin syndrome'') — an excess of serotonin that can induce mania, restlessness, agitation, [[emotional lability]], insomnia and confusion as its primary symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12771076&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Birmes P, Coppin D, Schmitt L, Lauque D | title=Serotonin syndrome: a brief review | journal=CMAJ | volume=168 | issue=11 | pages=1439–42 | year=2003 | pmid=12771076 | pmc=155963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15784664&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyer EW, Shannon M | title=The serotonin syndrome | journal=N.

[[MAOIs]] tend to have pronounced (sometimes fatal) interactions with a wide variety of medications and [[over-the-counter drug]]s. If taken with foods that contain very high levels of [[tyramine]] (e.g., mature cheese, cured meats, or yeast extracts), they may cause a potentially lethal [[hypertensive crisis]]. At lower doses, the person may only experience a headache due to an increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19742203&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sathyanarayana Rao TS, Yeragani VK | title=Hypertensive crisis and cheese | journal=Indian J Psychiatry | volume=51 | issue=1 | pages=65–6 | year=2009 | pmid=19742203 | pmc=2738414 | doi=10.4103/0019-5545.44910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these adverse effects, a different type of MAOI has been developed: the [[reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A]] (RIMA) class of drugs. Their primary advantage is that they do not require the person to follow a special diet, while being purportedly effective as SSRIs and tricyclics in treating depressive disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7717091&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Paykel ES | title=Clinical efficacy of reversible and selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A in major depression | journal=Acta Psychiatr Scand Suppl | volume=386 | pages=22–7 | year=1995 | pmid=7717091 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb05920.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy===

SSRI use in pregnancy has been associated with a variety of risks with varying degrees of proof of causation. As depression is independently associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, determining the extent to which observed associations between antidepressant use and specific adverse outcomes reflects a causative relationship has been difficult in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Malm H | title=Prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and infant outcome | journal=Ther Drug Monit | volume=34 | issue=6 | pages=607–14 |date=December 2012 | pmid=23042258 | doi=10.1097/FTD.0b013e31826d07ea }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the attribution of adverse outcomes to antidepressant exposure seems fairly clear.

A 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found that antidepressant use during pregnancy was statistically significantly associated with some pregnancy outcomes, such as gestational age and preterm birth, but not with other outcomes. The same review cautioned that because differences between the exposed and unexposed groups were small, it was doubtful whether they were clinically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ross |first1=Lori E. |last2=Grigoriadis |first2=Sophie |last3=Mamisashvili |first3=Lana |last4=VonderPorten |first4=Emily H. |last5=Roerecke |first5=Michael |last6=Rehm |first6=Jürgen |last7=Dennis |first7=Cindy-Lee |last8=Koren |first8=Gideon |last9=Steiner |first9=Meir |last10=Mousmanis |first10=Patricia |last11=Cheung |first11=Amy |title=Selected Pregnancy and Delivery Outcomes After Exposure to Antidepressant Medication |journal=JAMA Psychiatry |date=1 April 2013 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=436–43 |doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.684|pmid=23446732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[neonate]] (infant less than 28&amp;nbsp;days old) may experience a withdrawal syndrome from abrupt discontinuation of the antidepressant at birth. Antidepressants have been shown to be present in varying amounts in breast milk, but their effects on infants are currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lanza di Scalea T, Wisner KL | title=Antidepressant Medication Use During Breastfeeding | journal=Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume=52 | issue=3 | pages=483–97 | year=2009 | pmid=19661763 | pmc=2902256 | doi=10.1097/GRF.0b013e3181b52bd6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, SSRIs inhibit nitric oxide synthesis, which plays an important role in setting vascular tone. Several studies have pointed to an increased risk of prematurity associated with SSRI use, and this association may be due to an increase risk of [[pre-eclampsia]] of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sivagnanam |first=G |title=Antidepressants |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics |year=2012 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=287–8 |url=http://www.jpharmacol.com/text.asp?2012/3/3/287/99452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antidepressant-induced mania===
Another possible problem with antidepressants is the chance of antidepressant-induced [[mania]] or [[hypomania]] in people with or without a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]]. Many cases of bipolar depression are very similar to those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the person can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of people with bipolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldberg JF, Truman CJ | title=Antidepressant-induced mania: An overview of current controversies | journal=Bipolar Disorders | volume=5 | issue=6 | pages=407–20 | year=2003 | pmid=14636364 | doi=10.1046/j.1399-5618.2003.00067.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For bipolar depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of [[hypomania]] and [[mania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9387089&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benazzi F | title=Antidepressant-associated hypomania in outpatient depression: a 203-case study in private practice | journal=J Affect Disord | volume=46 | issue=1 | pages=73–7 | year=1997 | pmid=9387089 | doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00082-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
{{Main|Antidepressants and suicide risk}}

Studies have shown that the use of antidepressants is correlated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior and thinking (suicidality) in those aged under 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;StoneETAL&quot; /&gt; This problem has been serious enough to warrant government intervention by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to warn of the increased risk of suicidality during antidepressant treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17485726&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Friedman RA, Leon AC | title=Expanding the black box – depression, antidepressants, and the risk of suicide | journal=N.

===Changes in weight===
Changes in appetite or weight are common among antidepressants, but are largely drug-dependent and related to which neurotransmitters they affect.

The [[antihistamine|antihistaminic]] properties of certain TCA- and TeCA-class antidepressants have been shown to contribute to the common side effects of increased appetite and weight gain associated with these classes of medication.

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{Main|Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome}}
Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, also called antidepressant withdrawal syndrome, is a condition that can occur following the interruption, reduction, or [[Medication discontinuation|discontinuation]] of antidepressant medication.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; The symptoms may include [[flu-like symptoms]], trouble sleeping, nausea, poor balance, sensory changes, and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dav2018&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=J|last2=Read|first2=J|date=4 September 2018|title=A systematic review into the incidence, severity and duration of antidepressant withdrawal effects: Are guidelines evidence-based?|journal=Addictive Behaviors|volume=97|pages=111–121|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.08.027|pmid=30292574}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem usually begins within three days and may last for several months.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dav2018/&gt; Rarely [[psychosis]] may occur.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;

&lt;!-- Risk factors and diagnosis --&gt;
A discontinuation syndrome can occur after stopping any antidepressant including [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs), and [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs).&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab2017/&gt; The risk is greater among those who have taken the medication for longer and when the medication in question has a short [[half-life]].&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; The underlying reason for its occurrence is unclear.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; The diagnosis is based on the symptoms.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Methods of prevention include gradually decreasing the dose among those who wish to stop, though it is possible for symptoms to occur with tapering.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wil2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dav2018 /&gt; Treatment may include restarting the medication and slowly decreasing the dose.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; People may also be switched to the long acting antidepressant [[fluoxetine]] which can then be gradually decreased.&lt;ref name=Wil2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
Approximately 20–50% of people who suddenly stop an antidepressant develop an antidepressant discontinuation syndrome.&lt;ref name=&quot;War2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Warner |first1=CH |last2=Bobo |first2=W |last3=Warner |first3=C |last4=Reid |first4=S |last5=Rachal |first5=J |title=Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome |journal=American Family Physician |date=1 August 2006 |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=449–56 |pmid=16913164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dav2018 /&gt; The condition is generally not serious.&lt;ref name=War2006/&gt; Though about half of people with symptoms describe them as severe.&lt;ref name=Dav2018/&gt; Some restart antidepressants due to the severity of the symptoms.&lt;ref name=Dav2018/&gt;

===Emotional blunting===
SSRIs appear to cause [[emotional blunting]], or numbness in some people who take them. This is a reduction in extremes of emotion, both positive and negative. While the person may feel less depressed, they may also feel less happiness or empathy. This may be cause for a dose reduction or medication change. The mechanism is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fornaro |first1=M |last2=Anastasia |first2=A |last3=Novello |first3=S |last4=Fusco |first4=A |last5=Pariano |first5=R |last6=De Berardis |first6=D |last7=Solmi |first7=M |last8=Veronese |first8=N |last9=Stubbs |first9=B |last10=Vieta |first10=E |last11=Berk |first11=M |last12=de Bartolomeis |first12=A |last13=Carvalho |first13=AF |title=The emergence of loss of efficacy during antidepressant drug treatment for major depressive disorder: An integrative review of evidence, mechanisms, and clinical implications. |journal=Pharmacological Research |volume=139 |pages=494–502 |date=29 October 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.phrs.2018.10.025 |pmid=30385364|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-emergence-of-loss-of-efficacy-during-antidepressant-drug-treatment-for-major-depressive-disorder(28b612ef-a584-4add-8629-6ad69ab0f709).html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pringle |first1=A |last2=McCabe |first2=C |last3=Cowen |first3=PJ |last4=Harmer |first4=CJ |title=Antidepressant treatment and emotional processing: can we dissociate the roles of serotonin and noradrenaline? |journal=Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England) |date=August 2013 |volume=27 |issue=8 |pages=719–31 |doi=10.1177/0269881112474523 |pmid=23392757|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/72ae72c1512dff3accc011f346461b3a677cdac4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest and probably most widely accepted scientific theory of antidepressant action is the [[monoamine hypothesis]] (which can be traced back to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (namely [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;GG&quot;&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format=vanc |editor1-last=Brunton |editor1-first=Laurence L. |editor2-last=Chabner |editor2-first=Bruce |editor3-last=Knollmann |editor3-first=Björn C. | title=Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics | year=2011 | publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn=978-0-07-162442-8 | edition=12th | location=New York |title-link=Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics }}{{update inline|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally proposed based on the observation that certain hydrazine anti-tuberculosis agents produce antidepressant effects, which was later linked to their inhibitory effects on [[monoamine oxidase]], the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name=GG /&gt; All currently marketed antidepressants have the monoamine hypothesis as their theoretical basis, with the possible exception of [[agomelatine]] which acts on a dual [[Melatonin|melatonergic]]-[[Serotonin|serotonergic]] pathway.&lt;ref name=GG /&gt; Despite the success of the monoamine hypothesis it has a number of limitations: for one, all monoaminergic antidepressants have a delayed onset of action of at least a week; and secondly, there are a sizeable portion (&gt;40%) of depressed patients that do not adequately respond to monoaminergic antidepressants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Infl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maes M, Yirmyia R, Noraberg J, Brene S, Hibbeln J, Perini G, Kubera M, Bob P, Lerer B, Maj M | title=The inflammatory &amp; neurodegenerative (I&amp;ND) hypothesis of depression: leads for future research and new drug developments in depression | journal=Metabolic Brain Disease | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=27–53 | date=March 2009 | pmid=19085093 | doi=10.1007/s11011-008-9118-1 | url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/16957997d6e4be7243d692e15f1f66d8c79fe40c }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;glut&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Gerard Sanacora |vauthors=Sanacora G, Treccani G, Popoli M | title=Towards a glutamate hypothesis of depression: an emerging frontier of neuropsychopharmacology for mood disorders | journal=Neuropharmacology | volume=62 | issue=1 | pages=63–77 | date=January 2012 | pmid=21827775 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.07.036 | pmc=3205453}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed, including the glutamate, neurogenic, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]], cortisol hypersecretion and inflammatory hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Infl /&gt;&lt;ref name=glut /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Epig&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Menke A, Klengel T, Binder EB | title=Epigenetics, depression and antidepressant treatment | journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume=18 | issue=36 | pages=5879–5889 | year=2012 | pmid=22681167 | doi=10.2174/138161212803523590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Epig2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vialou V, Feng J, Robison AJ, Nestler EJ | title=Epigenetic mechanisms of depression and antidepressant action | journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume=53 | issue=1 | pages=59–87 | date=January 2013 | pmid=23020296 | doi=10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010611-134540 | pmc=3711377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors===
[[File:Prozac.jpg|thumb|right|alt=refer to caption|[[Blister pack]] of Prozac ([[fluoxetine]]), a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]]]

[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) are believed to increase the [[extracellular]] level of the [[neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] by [[Reuptake inhibitor|limiting]] its [[reuptake|reabsorption]] into the [[presynaptic cell]], increasing the level of [[serotonin]] in the [[synaptic cleft]] available to bind to the [[postsynaptic receptor]]. They have varying degrees of selectivity for the other [[monoamine transporter]]s, with pure SSRIs having only weak affinity for the [[norepinephrine transporter|norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine transporter]]s.

SSRIs are the most widely prescribed antidepressants in many countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRESCORN2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Preskorn SH, Ross R, Stanga CY |chapter=Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=sO_hArhCxwMC&amp;pg=PA241 |editor1=Sheldon H.

===Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors===
[[File:Venlafaxine-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|alt=chemical structure of the SNRI drug venlafaxine|The chemical structure of [[venlafaxine]] (Effexor), an [[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SNRI]]]]

[[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) are potent inhibitors of the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]]. These [[neurotransmitter]]s are known to play an important role in mood. SNRIs can be contrasted with the more widely used [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), which act mostly upon serotonin alone.

The human [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) and [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) are [[membrane protein]]s that are responsible for the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Balanced dual inhibition of [[monoamine]] reuptake can possibly offer advantages over other antidepressants drugs by treating a wider range of symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19740668&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=19740668 |year=2009 |last1=Cashman |first1=JR |last2=Ghirmai |first2=S |title=Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and inhibition of phosphodiesterase by multi-target inhibitors as potential agents for depression |volume=17 |issue=19 |pages=6890–7 |doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2009.08.025 |journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SNRIs are sometimes also used to treat [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), chronic [[neuropathic pain]], and [[fibromyalgia syndrome]] (FMS), and for the relief of [[menopause|menopausal]] symptoms.

===Serotonin modulators and stimulators===

[[Serotonin modulator and stimulator]]s (SMSs), sometimes referred to more simply as &quot;serotonin modulators&quot;, are a type of [[drug]] with a multimodal action specific to the [[serotonin]] [[neurotransmitter]] system. To be precise, SMSs simultaneously modulate one or more [[serotonin receptor]]s and inhibit the [[reuptake]] of serotonin. The term was coined in reference to the [[mechanism of action]] of the serotonergic antidepressant [[vortioxetine]], which acts as a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI), [[partial agonist]] of the [[5-HT1A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], and [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[5-HT3 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[5-HT7 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24391391&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Goldenberg MM | title=Pharmaceutical approval update | journal=P T | volume=38 | issue=11 | pages=705–7 |date=November 2013 | pmid=24391391 | pmc=3875258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmerPharmAssoc2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pharmacist.com/vortioxetine-atypical-antidepressant | author=American Pharmacists Association | title=Vortioxetine: Atypical antidepressant | year=2013 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120095834/http://www.pharmacist.com/vortioxetine-atypical-antidepressant | archivedate=20 November 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LATimes2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-fda-approval-antidepressant-20130930-story.html | author=Los Angeles Times | title=FDA approves a new antidepressant: Brintellix | year=2013 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120162327/http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-fda-approval-antidepressant-20130930-story.html | archivedate=20 November 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can also technically be applied to [[vilazodone]], which is an antidepressant as well and acts as an SRI and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor partial agonist.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15740724&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hughes ZA, Starr KR, Langmead CJ, etal | title=Neurochemical evaluation of the novel 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist/serotonin reuptake inhibitor, vilazodone | journal=European Journal of Pharmacology | volume=510 | issue=1–2 | pages=49–57 |date=March 2005 | pmid=15740724 | doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.01.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative term is serotonin partial agonist/reuptake inhibitor (SPARI), which can be applied only to vilazodone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muntner |first1=Stephen M.

===Serotonin antagonists and reuptake inhibitors===

[[Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors]] (SARIs) while mainly used as antidepressants, are also [[anxiolytic]]s and [[hypnotic]]s. They act by [[receptor antagonist|antagonizing]] [[serotonin receptor]]s such as [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[reuptake inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[reuptake]] of [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and/or [[dopamine]]. Additionally, most also act as [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptor]] [[receptor antagonist|antagonists]]. The majority of the currently marketed SARIs belong to the [[phenylpiperazine]] class of compounds. They include [[trazodone]] and [[nefazodone]].

===Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors===
{{update|section|&lt;nowiki&gt;PMID 26411968&lt;/nowiki&gt;|date=January 2018}}
[[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NRIs or NERIs) are a type of [[drug]] that acts as a [[reuptake inhibitor]] for the [[neurotransmitter]] [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline) by blocking the [[drug action|action]] of the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET). This in turn leads to increased [[extracellular]] [[concentration]]s of norepinephrine.

NRIs are commonly used in the treatment of conditions like [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and [[narcolepsy]] due to their [[psychostimulant]] effects and in [[obesity]] due to their [[appetite suppressant]] effects. They are also frequently used as antidepressants for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]], [[anxiety disorder|anxiety]] and [[panic disorder]]. Additionally, many [[substance abuse|drugs of abuse]] such as [[cocaine]] and [[methylphenidate]] possess NRI activity, though it is important to mention that NRIs without combined [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]] (DRI) properties are not significantly rewarding and hence are considered to have a negligible [[abuse potential]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15283948&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wee S, Woolverton WL | title=Evaluation of the reinforcing effects of atomoxetine in monkeys: comparison to methylphenidate and desipramine | journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume=75 | issue=3 | pages=271–6 |date=September 2004 | pmid=15283948 | doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2004.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15526000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gasior M, Bergman J, Kallman MJ, Paronis CA | title=Evaluation of the reinforcing effects of monoamine reuptake inhibitors under a concurrent schedule of food and i.v. drug delivery in rhesus monkeys | journal=Neuropsychopharmacology | volume=30 | issue=4 | pages=758–64 |date=April 2005 | pmid=15526000 | doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300593 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, norepinephrine has been implicated as acting synergistically with dopamine when actions on the two neurotransmitters are combined (e.g., in the case of [[norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor|NDRI]]s) to produce rewarding effects in psychostimulant drugs of abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11071707&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rothman RB, Baumann MH, Dersch CM, etal | title=Amphetamine-type central nervous system stimulants release norepinephrine more potently than they release dopamine and serotonin | journal=Synapse | volume=39 | issue=1 | pages=32–41 |date=January 2001 | pmid=11071707 | doi=10.1002/1098-2396(20010101)39:1&lt;32::AID-SYN5&gt;3.0.CO;2-3 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6a277c37225f36d92c7d7a7fcc27bbf3cf7f62de }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors===

The only drug used of this class for depression is [[bupropion]].&lt;ref name=Schwasinger-Schmidt2018/&gt;

===Tricyclic antidepressants===
The majority of the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs) act primarily as [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) by blocking the [[serotonin transporter]] (SERT) and the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET), respectively, which results in an elevation of the [[Synapse|synaptic]] concentrations of these [[neurotransmitter]]s, and therefore an enhancement of [[neurotransmission]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9537821&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tatsumi M, Groshan K, Blakely RD, Richelson E | title=Pharmacological profile of antidepressants and related compounds at human monoamine transporters | journal=Eur J Pharmacol | volume=340 | issue=2–3 | pages=249–258 | year=1997 |pmid=9537821 | doi=10.1016/S0014-2999(97)01393-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17471183&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gillman PK | title=Tricyclic antidepressant pharmacology and therapeutic drug interactions updated | journal=[[British Journal of Pharmacology]] | volume=151 | issue=6 | pages=737–48 |date=July 2007 | pmid=17471183 | pmc=2014120 | doi=10.1038/sj.bjp.0707253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, with the sole exception of [[amineptine]], the TCAs have negligible [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] for the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT), and therefore have no efficacy as [[dopamine reuptake inhibitor]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9537821&quot; /&gt;

Although TCAs are sometimes [[medical prescription|prescribed]] for depressive disorders, they have been largely replaced in clinical use in most parts of the world by newer antidepressants such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs), [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (SNRIs) and [[norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor]]s (NRIs). Adverse effects have been found to be of a similar level between TCAs and SSRIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trindade |first1=E. |last2=Menon |first2=D. |last3=Topfer |first3=L.

===Tetracyclic antidepressants===

[[Tetracyclic antidepressants]] (TeCAs) are a class of antidepressants that were first introduced in the 1970s. They are named after their [[chemical structure]], which contains four [[cyclic compound|rings of atoms]], and are closely related to the [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs), which contain three rings of atoms.

===Monoamine oxidase inhibitors===

[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s (MAOIs) are chemicals which inhibit the activity of the [[monoamine oxidase|monoamine oxidase enzyme family]]. They have a long history of use as medications prescribed for the treatment of [[clinical depression|depression]]. They are particularly effective in treating [[atypical depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/major-depressive-disorder/atypical-depression-21st-century-diagnostic-and-treatment-issues | title=Atypical Depression in the 21st Century: Diagnostic and Treatment Issues | website=[[Psychiatric Times]] | accessdate=23 November 2013 | author=Cristancho, Mario | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202224433/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/major-depressive-disorder/atypical-depression-21st-century-diagnostic-and-treatment-issues | archivedate=2 December 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in the treatment of [[Parkinson's disease]] and several other disorders.

Because of potentially lethal dietary and drug interactions, [[monoamine oxidase]] inhibitors have historically been reserved as a last line of treatment, used only when other classes of antidepressant drugs (for example [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s and [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s) have failed.{{mcn|date=November 2018}}

MAOIs can also be used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease by targeting MAO-B in particular (therefore affecting [[dopaminergic neuron]]s), as well as providing an alternative for [[migraine]] [[prophylaxis]]. Inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B is used in the treatment of [[clinical depression]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s.

===NMDA receptor antagonists===
[[NMDA receptor antagonist]]s like [[ketamine]] and [[esketamine]] are [[rapid-acting antidepressant]]s and seem to work via [[receptor antagonist|blockade]] of the [[ionotropic glutamate receptor|ionotropic glutamate]] [[NMDA receptor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpravatoLabel&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = SPRAVATO™ (esketamine) nasal spray FDA label | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date = 5 March 2019 | url = https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2019/211243lbl.pdf | accessdate = 6 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjuncts==
Adjunct medications are an umbrella category of substances that increase the potency or &quot;enhance&quot; antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&amp;alt=sh#v1028590 |website=Merck Manual |title=Depressive Disorders |accessdate=30 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205163219/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&amp;alt=sh |archivedate=5 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They work by affecting variables very close to the antidepressant, sometimes affecting a completely different [[mechanism of action]]. This may be attempted when depression treatments have not been successful in the past.

Common types of adjunct medication techniques generally fall into the following categories:

* Two or more antidepressants taken together
** From the same class (affecting the same area of the brain, often at a much higher level)
** From different classes (affecting multiple parts of the brain not covered simultaneously by either drug alone)
* An [[antipsychotic]] combined with an antidepressant, particularly [[atypical antipsychotic]]s such as [[aripiprazole]] (Abilify), [[quetiapine]] (Seroquel), [[olanzapine]] (Zyprexa), and [[risperidone]] (Risperdal).&lt;ref name=&quot;Maudsley&quot;&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format=vanc |last1=Taylor |first1=D |last2=Carol |first2=P |last3=Shitij |first3=K |title=The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=West Sussex |isbn=978-0-470-97969-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--first added https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antidepressant&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=576824896--&gt;
It is unknown if undergoing [[psychological therapy]] at the same time as taking anti-depressants enhances the anti-depressive effect of the medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Georgina R.|last2=Callahan|first2=Patch|last3=Churchill|first3=Rachel|last4=Hunot|first4=Vivien|last5=Merry|first5=Sally N.|last6=Parker|first6=Alexandra G.|last7=Hetrick|first7=Sarah E.|date=30 November 2014|title=Psychological therapies versus antidepressant medication, alone and in combination for depression in children and adolescents|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=11|issue=11|pages=CD008324|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008324.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25433518|url=http://vuir.vu.edu.au/33744/1/Cox%20et%20al%202012%20Psychological%20therapies%20versus%20antidepressant%20medication%20%28Review%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Less common adjunct medication===
[[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] has been used to augment antidepressant therapy in those who have failed to respond to antidepressants alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10505584&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bauer M, Dopfmer S |year=1999 |title=Lithium augmentation in treatment-resistant depression: Meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=427–34 |pmid=10505584 |doi=10.1097/00004714-199910000-00006 |ref=harv|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4de1578d6b6ba9cb66ebcba6cd365d52bc18e5df }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, lithium dramatically decreases the suicide risk in recurrent depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17388706&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guzzetta F, Tondo L, Centorrino F, Baldessarini RJ |title=Lithium treatment reduces suicide risk in recurrent major depressive disorder |journal=J Clin Psychiatry |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=380–83 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17388706 |doi=10.4088/JCP.v68n0304 |ref=harv|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8be44f726ab098c8312d6c30cc3361175040e66a }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence for the addition of a thyroid hormone, [[triiodothyronine]], in patients with normal thyroid function.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16946176&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nierenberg AA, Fava M, Trivedi MH, Wisniewski SR, Thase ME, McGrath PJ, Alpert JE, Warden D, Luther JF, Niederehe G, Lebowitz B, Shores-Wilson K, Rush AJ |year=2006 |title=A comparison of lithium and T(3) augmentation following two failed medication treatments for depression: A STAR*D report |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=9 |pages=1519–30 |pmid=16946176 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.9.1519 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychopharmacologists have also tried adding a [[psychostimulant|stimulant]], in particular, [[d-amphetamine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stahl |first=Stephen M. |title=The Prescriber's Guide (Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology) |year=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of stimulants in cases of treatment-resistant depression is relatively controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1411740&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kraus MF, Burch EA | title=Methylphenidate hydrochloride as an antidepressant: controversy, case studies, and review | journal=South.

commented out 19 November 2013

However, the authors claim psychostimulants are likely to have a higher level of clinical effectiveness under circumstances in which the patient will probably die soon, so rapid relief is of great importance. In this situation, the patient is likely to die before dependence on, or tolerance of, the medication interferes with their care.

==History==
[[File:Saint John's wort flowers.jpg|thumb|alt=refer to caption|[[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]]]]

Before the 1950s, [[opioid]]s and [[amphetamine]]s were commonly used as antidepressants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weber 1988 255–66&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weber MM, Emrich HM | title=Current and Historical Concepts of Opiate Treatment in Psychiatric Disorders | journal=International Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume=3 | issue=3 | pages=255–66 | year=1988 | pmid=3153713 | doi=10.1097/00004850-198807000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amph Uses Dex&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heal DJ, Smith SL, Gosden J, Nutt DJ | title=Amphetamine, past and present – a pharmacological and clinical perspective | journal=J.

===Isoniazid, iproniazid, and imipramine===
In 1951, [[Irving Selikoff]] and {{interlanguage link|Edward H. Robitzek|de}}, working out of [[Sea View Hospital]] on [[Staten Island]], began clinical trials on two new [[tuberculosis|anti-tuberculosis]] agents developed by Hoffman-LaRoche, [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]]. Only patients with a poor [[prognosis]] were initially treated; nevertheless, their condition improved dramatically. Selikoff and Robitzek noted &quot;a subtle general stimulation ... the patients exhibited renewed vigor and indeed this occasionally served to introduce disciplinary problems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14906149&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Selikoff IJ, Robitzek EH | title=Tuberculosis Chemotherapy with Hydrazine Derivatives of Isonicotinic Acid | journal=Chest | volume=21 | issue=4 | pages=385–438 | year=1952 | pmid=14906149 | doi=10.1378/chest.21.4.385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of a cure for tuberculosis in the Sea View Hospital trials was excitedly discussed in the mainstream press.

In 1952, learning of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist [[Max Lurie]] tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and [[Harry Salzer]] reported that isoniazid improved depression in two-thirds of their patients and coined the term ''antidepressant'' to refer to its action.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-88048-397-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format=vanc |last=Healy |first=D |editor1-last=Weissman |editor1-first=M.M. |title=The treatment of depression: bridging the 21st century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LAmBVolIG5kC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |year=2001 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-0-88048-397-1 |pages=10–11 |chapter=The Antidepressant Drama |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAmBVolIG5kC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA7,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar incident took place in Paris, where [[Jean Delay]], head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his [[pulmonology]] colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952 (before Lurie and Salzer), Delay, with the resident {{interlanguage link|Jean-Francois Buisson|fr}}, reported the positive effect of isoniazid on depressed patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Healy96&quot;&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format=vanc |last=Healy |first=David |title=The psychopharmacologists: interviews |year=1996 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |isbn=978-1-86036-008-4 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of [[diamine oxidase]], coupled with a weak inhibition of [[monoamine oxidase A]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-86036-010-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format=vanc |last=Healy |first=David |title=The Psychopharmacologists: Volume 2 |publisher=A Hodder Arnold Publication |year=1998 |pages=132–4 |isbn=978-1-86036-010-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selikoff and Robitzek also experimented with another anti-tuberculosis drug, [[iproniazid]]; it showed a greater psychostimulant effect, but more pronounced toxicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12998444&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robitzek EH, Selikoff IJ, Mamlok E, Tendlau A | title=Isoniazid and Its Isopropyl Derivative in the Therapy of Tuberculosis in Humans: Comparative Therapeutic and Toxicologic Properties | journal=Chest | volume=23 | issue=1 | pages=1–15 | year=1953 | pmid=12998444 | doi=10.1378/chest.23.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Jackson Smith]], [[Gordon Kamman]], [[George E. Crane]], and [[Frank Ayd]], described the psychiatric applications of iproniazid. [[Ernst Zeller]] found iproniazid to be a potent [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18004120&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Muñoz F, Alamo C, Juckel G, Assion HJ | title=Half a Century of Antidepressant Drugs | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume=27 | issue=6 | pages=555–9 | year=2007 | pmid=18004120 | doi=10.1097/jcp.0b013e3181bb617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, iproniazid remained relatively obscure until [[Nathan S. Kline]], the influential head of research at [[Rockland State Hospital]], began to popularize it in the medical and popular press as a &quot;psychic energizer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18004120&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psychic Energizer |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862555,00.html |date=15 April 1957 |work=Time |accessdate=28 May 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811223331/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C862555%2C00.html |archivedate=11 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roche put a significant marketing effort behind iproniazid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18004120&quot; /&gt; Its sales grew until it was recalled in 1961, due to reports of lethal [[hepatotoxicity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18004120&quot; /&gt;

The antidepressant effect of a [[tricyclic]], a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by [[Roland Kuhn]] in a Swiss [[psychiatric hospital]]. [[Antihistamine]] derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as [[neuroleptics]]. Although in 1955 [[reserpine]] was shown to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics were being developed as [[sedatives]] and [[antipsychotics]].{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Attempting to improve the effectiveness of [[chlorpromazine]], Kuhn{{spaced ndash}} in conjunction with the [[Geigy]] [[Pharmaceutical Company]]{{spaced ndash}} discovered the compound &quot;G 22355&quot;, later renamed [[imipramine]]. Imipramine had a beneficial effect in patients with depression who showed mental and [[motor retardation]]. Kuhn described his new compound as a &quot;thymoleptic&quot; &quot;taking hold of the emotions,&quot; in contrast with neuroleptics, &quot;taking hold of the nerves&quot; in 1955–56. These gradually became established, resulting in the patent and manufacture in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and SchinderA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kuhn R | title=The treatment of depressive states with G 22355 (imipramine hydrochloride) | journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume=115 | issue=5 | pages=459–64 | year=1958 | pmid=13583250 | doi=10.1176/ajp.115.5.459 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second generation antidepressants===
{{Main|Second-generation antidepressants}}

Antidepressants became [[prescription drug]]s in the 1950s. It was estimated that no more than 50 to 100 individuals per million suffered from the kind of depression that these new drugs would treat, and pharmaceutical companies were not enthusiastic in marketing for this small market. Sales through the 1960s remained poor compared to the sales of tranquilizers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tranquilizers |url=http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm |website=Cumberland Mountain Community Services |publisher=cmcsb.com |accessdate=20 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916074410/http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm |archivedate=16 September 2012}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were being marketed for different uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;3faces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Healy D | title=The Three Faces of the Antidepressants: A Critical Commentary on the Clinical-Economic Context of Diagnosis | journal=The Journal of Nervous &amp; Mental Disease | volume=187 | issue=3 | pages=174–80 | year=1999 | pmid=10086474 | doi=10.1097/00005053-199903000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imipramine remained in common use and numerous successors were introduced. The use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) increased after the development and introduction of &quot;reversible&quot; forms affecting only the MAO-A subtype of inhibitors, making this drug safer to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;3faces&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Pletscher A | title=The discovery of antidepressants: A winding path | journal=Experientia | volume=47 | issue=1 | pages=4–8 | year=1991 | pmid=1999242 | doi=10.1007/BF02041242 | url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/763824fe61194e14a24bc6632b20a8388b8258ef }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, it was thought that the mode of action of tricyclics was to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. However, norepinephrine reuptake became associated with stimulating effects. Later tricyclics were thought to affect [[serotonin]] as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Researchers began a process of [[rational drug design]] to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would selectively target these systems.

[[Fluoxetine]] was approved for commercial use by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1988, becoming the first [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster]] SSRI.

[[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]] fell out of favor in most countries through the 19th and 20th centuries, except in [[Germany]], where [[Hypericum]] extracts were eventually licensed, packaged and prescribed.

===Rapid-acting antidepressants===
[[Esketamine]] (brand name Spravato), the first rapid-acting antidepressant to be approved for clinical treatment of depression, was introduced for this indication in March 2019 in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SpravatoLabel&quot; /&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Prescription trends===

In the United States, antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed medication in 2013.&lt;ref name=AJantidepressantstatsUS /&gt; Of the estimated 16 million &quot;long term&quot; (over 24 months) users, roughly 70 percent are female.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJantidepressantstatsUS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Rebecca|title=Waking up from sadness: Many find trouble getting off antidepressants|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/22/patients-mostly-womenfindtroublegettingoffofantidepressants.html|website=Al Jazeera|accessdate=8 June 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714142717/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/22/patients-mostly-womenfindtroublegettingoffofantidepressants.html|archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, about 16.5% of white people in the United States took antidepressants compared with 5.6% of black people in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;APP2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=By the numbers: Antidepressant use on the rise |url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/11/numbers.aspx |website=apa.org |accessdate=1 February 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, figures reported in 2010 indicated that the number of antidepressants prescribed by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) almost doubled over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession |title=Antidepressant Use Rises as Recession Feeds Wave of Worry |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2010 |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Rowenna |last=Davis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615165456/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession |archivedate=15 June 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis published in 2014 showed that number of antidepressants dispensed annually in the community went up by 25 million in the 14 years between 1998 and 2012, rising from 15 million to 40 million. Nearly 50% of this rise occurred in the four years after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 banking crash]], during which time the annual increase in prescriptions rose from 6.7% to 8.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Ruth|title=Focus on: Antidepressant prescribing|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/focus-on/antidepressant-prescribing|website=QualityWatch|publisher=QualityWatch (Nuffield Trust/Health Foundation)|accessdate=12 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204194028/http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/focus-on/antidepressant-prescribing|archivedate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources also suggest that aside from the recession, other factors that may influence changes in prescribing rates may include: improvements in diagnosis, a reduction of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding mental health, broader prescribing trends, GP characteristics, geographical location and housing status. Another factor that may contribute to increasing consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for other conditions including [[social anxiety]] and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].

'''Netherlands:''' In the Netherlands, [[paroxetine]] is the most prescribed antidepressant, followed by [[amitriptyline]], [[citalopram]] and [[venlafaxine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gipdatabank.nl/index.asp?scherm=tabellenFrameSet&amp;infoType=g&amp;tabel=01-basis&amp;item=N06AB |title=GIPdatabank |publisher=Gipdatabank.nl |accessdate=6 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206123718/http://www.gipdatabank.nl/index.asp?scherm=tabellenFrameSet&amp;infoType=g&amp;tabel=01-basis&amp;item=N06AB |archivedate=6 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adherence ===
{{main|Adherence (medicine)}}
As of 2003, worldwide, 30 to 60% of people didn't follow their practitioner's instructions about taking their antidepressants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf?ua=1|title=Adherence to Long Term Therapies: Evidence for Action|date=2003|website=World Health Organization|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2013 in the US, it appeared that around 50% of people did not take their antidepressants as directed by their practitioner.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Jessica E.|last2=Keeley|first2=Robert D.|last3=Engel|first3=Matthew|last4=Emsermann|first4=Caroline|last5=Brody|first5=David|date=July 2013|title=Aspects of patient and clinician language predict adherence to antidepressant medication|journal=Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine: JABFM|volume=26|issue=4|pages=409–420|doi=10.3122/jabfm.2013.04.120201|pmid=23833156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When people fail to take their antidepressants, there is a greater risk that the drug won't help, that symptoms get worse, that they miss work or are less productive at work, and that the person may be hospitalized.&lt;ref name=Ho2016/&gt; This also increases costs for caring for them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ho2016&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=SC|last2=Chong|first2=HY|last3=Chaiyakunapruk|first3=N|last4=Tangiisuran|first4=B|last5=Jacob|first5=SA|title=Clinical and economic impact of non-adherence to antidepressants in major depressive disorder: A systematic review|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|date=15 March 2016|volume=193|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2015.12.029|pmid=26748881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social science perspective===
Some academics have highlighted the need to examine the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross-cultural terms, due to the fact that various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecks_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ecks S | title=Pharmaceutical Citizenship: Antidepressant Marketing and the Promise of Demarginalization in India | journal=Anthropology &amp; Medicine | year=2005 | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=239–254 | doi=10.1080/13648470500291360| pmid=26873669 | url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/01f35b92905bf6a9bb6b33bac190af89ec9c9294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lock_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book | name-list-format=vanc |vauthors=Lock M, Nguyen VK | title=An anthropology of biomedicine | date=2010 | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Chichester, West Sussex | isbn=978-1-4051-1071-6 | edition=1st| chapter=&quot;Local Biologies and Human Difference | pages=83–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other strategies in the treatment of depression in these different cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecks_2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lock_2010&quot; /&gt; In India, antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to reintegrate into society through their use—a view and association not observed in the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecks_2005&quot; /&gt;
