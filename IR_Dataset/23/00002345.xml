The '''Archbishop of Canterbury''' is the senior [[bishop]] and principal leader of the [[Church of England]], the symbolic head of the worldwide [[Anglican Communion]] and the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]]. The current archbishop is [[Justin Welby]], who was enthroned at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] on 21 March 2013. Welby is the [[List of Archbishops of Canterbury|105th in a line]] which goes back more than 1400 years to [[Augustine of Canterbury]], the &quot;Apostle to the English&quot;, sent from [[Rome]] in the year 597. Welby succeeded [[Rowan Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/2692/announcement-of-the-105th-archbishop-of-canterbury|title=Announcement of the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury|date=9 November 2012|work=Archbishop of Canterbury Website|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of Augustine until the 16th century, the archbishops of Canterbury were in [[full communion]] with the [[See of Rome]] and usually received the [[pallium]] from the [[Pope]]. During the [[English Reformation]], the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope. [[Thomas Cranmer]] became the first holder of the office following the English Reformation in 1533, while [[Reginald Pole]] was the last Roman Catholic in the position, serving from 1556 to 1558 during the [[Counter-Reformation]]. In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other [[bishop]]s. At various times the choice was made by the [[canons of Canterbury Cathedral]], the Pope, or the [[King of England]]. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a [[state church]] and the choice is legally that of [[the Crown]]; today it is made by the reigning monarch on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]], who in turn receives a shortlist of two names from an ''ad hoc'' committee called the [[Appointment of Church of England bishops|Crown Nominations Commission]].

==Present roles and status==
Today the archbishop fills four main roles:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/104 Archbishop's Roles and Responsibilities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214105116/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/104 |date=14 February 2008 }}, Archbishop of Canterbury website. Retrieved 8 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

# He is the diocesan bishop of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]], which covers the [[East Kent|eastern]] parts of the County of [[Kent]]. Founded in 597, it is the oldest [[episcopal see|see]] in the English church.
# He is the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan archbishop]] of the [[Province of Canterbury]], which covers the southern two-thirds of England.
# He is the senior [[primate (bishop)|primate]] and chief religious figure of the Church of England (the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British sovereign]] is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|supreme governor]] of the church). Along with his colleague the [[Archbishop of York]] he chairs the [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]] and sits on or chairs many of the church's important boards and committees; power in the church is not highly centralised, however, so the two archbishops can often lead only through persuasion. The Archbishop of Canterbury plays a central part in national ceremonies such as [[coronation of the British monarch|coronations]]; due to his high public profile, his opinions are often in demand by the [[news media]].
# As spiritual leader of the [[Anglican Communion]], the archbishop, although without legal authority outside England, is recognised by convention as ''[[primus inter pares]]'' (&quot;first among equals&quot;) of all Anglican [[primate (bishop)|primates]] worldwide. Since 1867 he has convened more or less decennial meetings of worldwide Anglican bishops, the [[Lambeth Conferences]].

In the last two of these functions, he has an important [[ecumenical]] and [[interfaith]] role, speaking on behalf of Anglicans in England and worldwide.

The archbishop's main residence is [[Lambeth Palace]] in the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. He also has lodgings in the Old Palace, [[Canterbury]], located beside [[Canterbury Cathedral]], where the [[Chair of St Augustine]] sits.

As holder of one of the &quot;five great sees&quot; (the others being [[Archbishop of York|York]], [[Bishop of London|London]], [[Bishop of Durham|Durham]] and [[Bishop of Winchester|Winchester]]), the archbishop of Canterbury is ''ex officio'' one of the [[Lords Spiritual]] of the [[House of Lords]]. He is one of the highest-ranking men in England and the highest ranking non-royal in the [[United Kingdom order of precedence|United Kingdom's order of precedence]].

Since [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke with [[Catholic Church|Rome]], the archbishops of Canterbury have been selected by the English (British since the Act of Union in 1707) monarch. Since the 20th century, the appointment of archbishops of Canterbury conventionally alternates between [[Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Evangelicals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archbishopofyork.org/154?q=archbishops The Archbishop of Canterbury] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722105024/http://www.archbishopofyork.org/154?q=archbishops |date=22 July 2011 }}, website of the Archbishop of York. Retrieved 31 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The current archbishop, Justin Welby, the 105th archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 4 February 2013. As archbishop he signs himself as ''+ Justin Cantuar''. His predecessor, Rowan Williams, 104th archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 27 February 2003. Immediately prior to his appointment to Canterbury, Williams was the [[bishop of Monmouth]] and [[archbishop of Wales]]. On 18 March 2012, Williams announced he would be stepping down as archbishop of Canterbury at the end of 2012 to become [[Master (college)|Master]] of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2012/16-march/news/uk/dr-williams-resigns|title=Dr Williams resigns|website=www.churchtimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional roles===
In addition to his office, the archbishop also holds a number of other positions; for example, he is joint president of the [[Council of Christians and Jews]] in the United Kingdom. Some positions he formally holds ''[[ex officio]]'' and others virtually so (the incumbent of the day, although appointed personally, is appointed because of his office). Amongst these are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldreg/reg06.htm|title=Register of Lords' interests|accessdate=15 August 2007|publisher=[[House of Lords]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807023334/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldreg/reg06.htm|archivedate=7 August 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecumenical and interfaith===
The archbishop of Canterbury is also a president of [[Churches Together in England]] (an [[ecumenical]] organisation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Presidents of Churches Together in England|url=http://www.churches-together.net/Articles/61446/Churches_Together_in/About_Us/The_Presidents_of.aspx|publisher=Churches Together in England|accessdate=23 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226205837/http://www.churches-together.net/Articles/61446/Churches_Together_in/About_Us/The_Presidents_of.aspx|archive-date=26 February 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Fisher]], 99th Archbishop of Canterbury, was the first since 1397 to visit Rome, where he held private talks with [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1960. In 2005, Rowan Williams became the first archbishop of Canterbury to attend a papal funeral since the Reformation. He also attended the inauguration of [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. The 101st archbishop, [[Donald Coggan]], was the first to attend a papal inauguration, that of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickman|first=Baden|title=Lord Coggan of Canterbury|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/may/19/guardianobituaries.religion|accessdate=23 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2002, the archbishop of Canterbury has co-sponsored the Alexandria Middle East Peace process with the Grand Mufti of Egypt. In July 2008, the archbishop attended a conference of Christians, Jews and Muslims convened by the King of Saudi Arabia at which the notion of the &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; was rejected. Delegates agreed &quot;on international guidelines for dialogue among the followers of religions and cultures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2008/special-reports/080719-madrid-conference.html |title=Madrid Interfaith Dialogue Conference: Beginning of a Process|publisher=Saudi-US Relations Information Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515085122/http://www.saudi-us-relations.org/articles/2008/special-reports/080719-madrid-conference.html|archivedate=15 May 2010 |url-status=dead |accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates said that &quot;the deepening of moral values and ethical principles, which are common denominators among such followers, would help strengthen stability and achieve prosperity for all humans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Niles|first=D.

==Origins==
[[File:Angl-Canterbury-Arms.svg|thumb|right|upright|Arms of the [[episcopal see|see]] of Canterbury. Nearly 500 years after the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], the arms still depict the [[pallium]], a symbol of the authority of the [[Pope]] and metropolitan archbishops.]]
It has been suggested that the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] had four archbishops, seated at [[Londinium]] ([[London]]), [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]), [[Lindum Colonia]] ([[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]) and [[Corinium Dobunnorum]] ([[Cirencester]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wacher, J., ''The Towns of Roman Britain'', Batsford, 1974, especially pp. 84–6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 5th and 6th centuries Britannia began to be overrun by [[paganism|pagan]], [[Germanic peoples]] who came to be known collectively as the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. Of the kingdoms they created, [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]] arguably had the closest links with European politics, trade and culture, because it was conveniently situated for communication with [[continental Europe]]. In the late 6th century, King [[Æthelberht of Kent]] married a Christian [[Franks|Frankish]] princess named [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], possibly before becoming king, and certainly a number of years before the arrival of the first Christian mission to England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02519a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Bertha&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; He permitted the preaching of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bede]], ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'', i, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Archbishop of Canterbury was [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] (not to be confused with [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine of Hippo]]), who arrived in Kent in 597 AD, having been sent by [[Pope Gregory I]] on a mission to the English. He was accepted by King Æthelbert, on his conversion to Christianity, about the year 598. It seems that Pope Gregory, ignorant of recent developments in the former Roman province, including the spread of the [[Pelagianism|Pelagian heresy]], had intended the new archiepiscopal sees for England to be established in London and York.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, ''Ecclesiastical History'', i, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, Canterbury was chosen instead of London, owing to political circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, N., ''The Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', Leicester University Press, 1984, pp. 3–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Archbishops of Canterbury have been referred to as occupying the [[Chair of St. Augustine]].

A gospel book believed to be directly associated with St Augustine's mission survives in the [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College]], [[Cambridge University]], England. Catalogued as Cambridge ''Manuscript 286'', it has been positively dated to 6th century Italy and this bound book, the [[St Augustine Gospels]], is still used during the swearing-in ceremony of new archbishops of Canterbury.

Before the break with papal authority in the 16th century, the Church of England was an integral part of the [[Western Christianity|Western European church]]. Since the break the Church of England, an [[Christian state|established national church]], still considers itself part of the broader Western Catholic tradition (although this is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church which regards Anglicanism as schismatic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5JBSw4m9azYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=+Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20+Anglicanism%20+schismatic&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=+Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20+Anglicanism%20+schismatic&amp;f=false|title=Anglicans and the Roman Catholic Church: Reflections on Recent Developments|last=Cavanaugh|first=Stephen E.|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-1-58617-499-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not accept Anglican holy orders as valid) as well as being the &quot;mother church&quot; of the worldwide Anglican Communion.

The ''Report of the Commissioners appointed by his Majesty to inquire into the Ecclesiatical Revenues of England and Wales'' (1835) noted the net annual revenue for the Canterbury see was £19,182.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Enclopaedia of Useful Knowledge'', Vol.III, Charles Knight, London, 1847, p.362&lt;/ref&gt;

==Province and Diocese of Canterbury==
The Archbishop of Canterbury exercises metropolitical (or supervisory) jurisdiction over the [[Province of Canterbury]], which encompasses thirty of the forty-two dioceses of the Church of England, with the rest falling within the [[Province of York]]. The four Welsh dioceses were also under the Province of Canterbury until 1920 when they were transferred from the [[established church|established Church]] of England to the [[Disestablishment of the Church in Wales|disestablished]] [[Church in Wales]].

[[File:CanterburyCathedral.png|thumb|left|View of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] from the north west {{circa|1890–1900}}]]
The Archbishop of Canterbury has a ceremonial provincial ''curia'', or court, consisting of some of the senior bishops of his province.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/events/EnthronementofRW2003.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202170108/http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/events/EnthronementofRW2003.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Order of Service from the Enthronement of the 104th Archbishop in 2003|archivedate=2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bishop of London]]—the most senior cleric of the church with the exception of the two archbishops—serves as Canterbury's provincial [[Dean (Church)|dean]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] as [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]], the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] as vice-chancellor, the [[Bishop of Salisbury]] as [[precentor]], the [[Bishop of Worcester]] as [[chaplain]] and the [[Bishop of Rochester]] as [[crucifer|cross-bearer]].

Along with [[Primacy of Canterbury|primacy over the Archbishop of York]], the Archbishop of Canterbury also has a precedence of honour over the other bishops of the Anglican Communion. He is recognised as ''primus inter pares'', or first amongst equals. He does not, however, exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside England, except in certain minor roles dictated by Canon in those provinces (for example, he is the judge in the event of an ecclesiastical prosecution against the Archbishop of Wales). He does hold [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitical]] authority over several [[extra-provincial Anglican churches]], and he serves as ''ex officio'' [[Bishop of the Falkland Islands]].

At present the archbishop has three [[suffragan]] bishops:
{{clear}}
* The [[Bishop of Dover]] is given the additional title of &quot;Bishop in Canterbury&quot; and empowered to act almost as if the Bishop of Dover were the [[diocesan bishop]] of the [[Diocese of Canterbury]], since the archbishop is so frequently away fulfilling national and international duties.
* Two further suffragans, the [[Bishop of Ebbsfleet]] and the [[Bishop of Richborough]], are [[provincial episcopal visitor]]s for the whole [[Province of Canterbury]], licensed by the archbishop as &quot;flying bishops&quot; to provide oversight throughout the province to parishes who hold to the Church Catholic's teaching on the Sacrament of Ordination. 

The [[Bishop of Maidstone]] was previously a second actual suffragan bishop working in the diocese, until it was decided at the diocesan synod of November 2010 that a new bishop will not be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canterburydiocese.org/diocesansynodnews/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615003605/http://www.canterburydiocese.org/diocesansynodnews/index.htm|url-status=dead|title=Canterbury Diocese — Synod News|archivedate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles and privileges==
{{Hatnote|&quot;Primate of All England&quot; redirects here.}}
The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York are both styled as &quot;The Most Reverend&quot;; retired archbishops are styled as &quot;The Right Reverend&quot;. Archbishops are, by convention, appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] and may, therefore, also use the style of &quot;[[The Right Honourable]]&quot; for life (unless they are later removed from the council). In formal documents, the Archbishop of Canterbury is referred to as &quot;The Most Reverend &lt;!--Father in God, is now omitted--&gt;[[Given name|Forenames]], by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan&quot;. In debates in the House of Lords, the archbishop is referred to as &quot;The Most Reverend Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury&quot;. &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; is not used in either instance. He may also be formally addressed as &quot;Your Grace&quot;—or, more often these days, simply as &quot;Archbishop&quot;, or &quot;Father&quot;.

The surname of the Archbishop of Canterbury is not always used in formal documents; often only the first name and see are mentioned. The archbishop is legally entitled to sign his name as &quot;Cantuar&quot; (from the [[Latin]] for Canterbury). The right to use a title as a legal signature is only permitted to bishops, [[Peers of the Realm]] and peers by courtesy. The current Archbishop of Canterbury usually signs as &quot;''+Justin Cantuar:''&quot;.

In the [[Order of Precedence in England and Wales|English and Welsh order of precedence]], the Archbishop of Canterbury is ranked above all individuals in the realm, with the exception of the Sovereign and members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', 2008, p43 – (Precedence, England and Wales)&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately below him is the [[Lord Chancellor]] and then the Archbishop of York.

===Lambeth degrees===
The Archbishop of Canterbury awards academic degrees, commonly called &quot;[[Lambeth degree]]s&quot;.

==Residences==
[[File:Lambeth Palace London 240404.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=1.4|The Archbishop of Canterbury's official London residence is [[Lambeth Palace]], photographed looking east across the [[River Thames]]]]
The Archbishop of Canterbury's official residence in London is [[Lambeth Palace]].
He also has a residence, named [[Old Palace, Canterbury|The Old Palace]], next to [[Canterbury Cathedral]] on the site of the medieval Archbishop's Palace.
The archbishops had palaces on the periphery of London and on the route between London and Canterbury.

Former palaces of the archbishops include
* [[Croydon Palace]]: the summer residence of the Archbishops from the 15th to the 18th centuries.
* [[Addington Palace]]: purchased as a replacement for Croydon Palace in 1807; sold in 1897.
* [[Archbishop's Palace, Maidstone]]: constructed in the 1390s, the palace was seized by the Crown at the time of the Reformation.
* [[Otford Palace]]: a medieval palace, rebuilt by Archbishop Warham {{circa|1515}} and forfeited to the Crown by Thomas Cranmer in 1537.
* [[Archbishop's Palace, Charing]]: a palace existed from at least the 13th century; seized by the Crown after the Dissolution.
* [[Knole House]]: built by Archbishop Bourchier in the second half of the 15th century, it was forfeited to the Crown by Archbishop Cranmer in 1538.
