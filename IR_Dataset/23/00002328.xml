''B. caapi'' contains several alkaloids that act as [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]]s ([[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]]).  Another common ingredient in ayahuasca is the shrub ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' which contains the primary psychoactive, [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT). MAOIs are required for DMT to be orally active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riba|title=Human Pharmacology of Ayahuasca: Subjective and Cardiovascular Effects, Monoamine Metabolite Excretion, and Pharmacokinetics|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=Jul 2003|volume=306|issue=1|pages=73–85|doi=10.1124/jpet.103.049882|display-authors=etal|pmid=12660312|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c4959f19d1e160a9fb97676fd43c660c3df896f4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
[[File:Ayahuasca prep.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca]]
Ayahuasca is known by many names throughout Northern [[South America]] and [[Brazil]].

''Ayahuasca'' is the [[hispanicized]] spelling of a word in the [[Quechua languages]], which are spoken in the [[Andean states]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Colombia]]. Speakers of Quechua languages or of the [[Aymara language]] align with the alternative spelling ''ayawaska''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanz-Biset|first=Jaume|last2=Cañigueral|first2=Salvador|date=2013-01-09|title=Plants as medicinal stressors, the case of depurative practices in Chazuta valley (Peruvian Amazonia)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874112007295|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|language=en|volume=145|issue=1|pages=67–76|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2012.09.053|issn=0378-8741}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word refers both to the [[liana]] ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', and to the brew prepared from it. In the Quechua languages, ''aya'' means &quot;spirit, soul&quot;, &quot;corpse, dead body&quot;, and ''waska'' means &quot;rope&quot; and &quot;woody vine&quot;, &quot;liana&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''ayahuasca'' has been variously translated as &quot;liana of the soul&quot;, &quot;liana of the dead&quot;, and &quot;spirit liana&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cairn.info/revue-psychotropes-2002-1-page-79.htm Ayahuasca : une synthèse interdisciplinaire]. {{lang|fr|Por Frédérick Bois-Mariage}}. ''Psychotropes'' 1/2002 (Vol. 8), p. 79-113. {{doi|10.3917/psyt.081.0079}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, the brew and the [[liana]] are informally called either '''''caapi''''' or '''''cipó'''''; the latter is the Portuguese word for [[liana]] (or woody climbing vine). In the [[União do Vegetal]] of Brazil, an organised spiritual tradition in which people drink ayahuasca, the brew is prepared exclusively from ''B. caapi'' and ''[[Psychotria viridis]]''. Adherents of União do Vegetal call this brew '''''hoasca''''' or '''''vegetal'''''; Brazilian Yawanawa call the brew &quot;uní&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grob|first1=CS|last2=McKenna|first2=DJ|last3=Callaway|first3=JC|last4=Brito|first4=GS|last5=Oberlaender|first5=G|last6=Saide|first6=OL|last7=Labigalini|first7=E|last8=Tacla|first8=C|last9=Miranda|first9=CT|last10=Strassman|first10=RJ|last11=Boone|first11=KB|title=Human Psychopharmacology of Hoasca: a plant hallucinogen used in ritual context in Brazil|journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders|date=1996|volume=184|issue=2|pages=86–94|url=https://erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_journal1.shtml|accessdate=January 22, 2017|doi=10.1097/00005053-199602000-00004|pmid=8596116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Evidence of Ayahuasca use dates to at least 1000 A.D., such as a bundle containing the residue of ayahuasca ingredients and various other preserved shamanic substances in a cave in southwestern Bolivia, discovered in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;nati_Anci&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ancient hallucinogens found in 1,000-year-old shamanic pouch |author=Erin Blakemore|work=nationalgeographic.com |date=6 May 2019 |access-date=7 May 2019 |url= https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/05/ancient-hallucinogens-oldest-ayahuasca-found-shaman-pouch/ |language=en |quote=A SMALL POUCH, made from three fox snouts neatly sewn together, may contain the world’s earliest archaeological evidence for the consumption of ayahuasca, a psychoactive plant preparation indigenous to peoples of the Amazon basin that produces potent hallucinations. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pnas_Chem&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Melanie J. |last2=Albarracin-Jordan |first2=Juan |last3=Moore |first3=Christine |last4=Capriles |first4=José M. |title=Chemical evidence for the use of multiple psychotropic plants in a 1,000-year-old ritual bundle from South America |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=4 June 2019 |volume=116 |issue=23 |pages=11207–11212 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1902174116 |pmid=31061128 |pmc=6561276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain first encountered indigenous western Amazonian basin South Americans (modern Peru/Ecuador) using ayahuasca; their earliest reports described it as &quot;the work of the devil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975, p. 48 as cited in Soibelman 1995, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of ''B. caapi'' was named ''[[telepathine]]'', but it was found to be identical to a chemical already isolated from ''Peganum harmala'' and was given the name [[harmine]].  Beat writer [[William S. Burroughs]] read a paper by [[Richard Evans Schultes]] on the subject and while traveling through South America in the early 1950s sought out ayahuasca in the hopes that it could relieve or cure [[opiate]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] (see ''[[The Yage Letters]]''). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in ''True Hallucinations''.  [[Dennis McKenna]] later studied pharmacology, [[botany]], and [[chemistry]] of ayahuasca and [[oo-koo-he]], which became the subject of his master's thesis.

[[Richard Evans Schultes]] allowed [[Claudio Naranjo]] to make a special journey by canoe up the Amazon River to study ayahuasca with the South American Indians. He brought back samples of the beverage and published the first scientific description of the effects of its active alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naranjo|first1=Claudio|title=The Healing Journey|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=9780394488264|pages=X|url=https://archive.org/details/healingjourneyne00nara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous being [[Santo Daime]] and the [[União do Vegetal]] (or UDV), usually in an [[Spiritism|animistic]] context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with [[Christianity]]. Both Santo Daime and União do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world.  Similarly, the US and Europe have started to see new religious groups develop in relation to increased ayahuasca use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Labate, B.C. |author2=Rose, I.S. |author3=Santos, R.G.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ayahuasca Religions: a comprehensive bibliography and critical essays |location=Santa Cruz |publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies – MAPS |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9798622-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Westerners have teamed up with shamans in the Amazon forest regions, forming ayahuasca healing retreats that claim to be able to cure mental and physical illness and allow communication with the spirit world.

In recent years, the brew has been popularized by [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]] (''One River),'' English novelist [[Martin J. Goodman|Martin Goodman]] in ''I Was Carlos Castaneda'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/19/featuresreviews.guardianreview3 |title=Letters: Mar 19 &amp;#124; Books |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2005-03-19 |accessdate=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilean novelist [[Isabel Allende]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3672060/Isabel-Allende-kith-and-tell.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Isabel Allende: kith and tell |first=Catherine |last=Elsworth |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; writer [[Kira Salak]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Salak's Article&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/Peru.html |title=Hell And Back |author=Salak, Kira |accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salak's Summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/Ayahuasca.html |title=Ayahuasca Healing in Peru |author=Salak, Kira |accessdate=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; author Jeremy Narby (''The Cosmic Serpent''), author [[Jay Griffiths]] (&quot;Wild: An Elemental Journey&quot;), American novelist Steven Peck, radio personality [[Robin Quivers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.wcqj.com/ |title=stern show blog, podcast and videos |publisher=wcqj.com |accessdate=2012-01-14}}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and writer [[Paul Theroux]] (''[[Figures in a Landscape: People and Places]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Theroux|title=Figures in a Landscape: People &amp; Places|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt / Eamon Dolan|location=Boston|date=2018|isbn=9780544870307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparation ==
Sections of ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' vine are [[Maceration (food)|macerated]] and boiled alone or with leaves from any of a number of other plants, including ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (''chacruna''), ''[[Diplopterys cabrerana]]'' (also known as ''chaliponga'' and ''chacropanga''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.spiritvine.net/ayahuasca/ |title=Ayahuasca Vine Facts {{!}} Spirit Vine Ayahuasca Retreats |work=Spirit Vine |access-date=2017-05-25 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mimosa tenuiflora]]'', among other ingredients which can vary greatly from one shaman to the next.  The resulting brew may contain the powerful [[psychedelic drug]] [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibiting]] [[harmala alkaloid]]s, which are necessary to make the DMT orally active. The traditional making of ayahuasca follows a ritual process that requires the user to pick the lower Chacruna leaf at sunrise, then say a prayer. The vine must be &quot;cleaned meticulously with wooden spoons&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;levy&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Ariel |title=The Drug of Choice for the Age of Kale |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/12/the-ayahuasca-boom-in-the-u-s |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pounded &quot;with wooden mallets until it's fibre.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;levy&quot;/&gt;

Brews can also be made with plants that do not contain DMT, ''Psychotria viridis'' being replaced by plants such as ''[[Justicia pectoralis]]'', ''[[Brugmansia]]'', or sacred tobacco, also known as ''mapacho'' ([[Nicotiana rustica]]), or sometimes left out with no replacement. This brew varies radically from one batch to the next, both in potency and psychoactive effect, based mainly on the skill of the shaman or brewer, as well as other admixtures sometimes added and the intent of the ceremony.  Natural variations in plant alkaloid content and profiles also affect the final concentration of alkaloids in the brew, and the physical act of cooking may also serve to modify the alkaloid profile of [[harmala]] alkaloids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callaway2005b&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Callaway |first=J.

The actual preparation of the brew takes several hours, often taking place over the course of more than one day.  After adding the plant material, each separately at this stage, to a large pot of water it is boiled until the water is reduced by half in volume.  The individual brews are then added together and brewed until reduced significantly.  This combined brew is what is taken by participants in Ayahuasca ceremonies.

== Traditional use ==
[[File:Ayahuasca preparation.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca]]

Ayahuasca is used largely as a treasured aid to spiritual practice.  People who work with ayahuasca in non-traditional contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with ayahuasca [[shamanism]], as practiced among [[indigenous people]]s like the [[Urarina]] of the [[Peruvian Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dean |first1= Bartholomew |year=2009 |title=Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |isbn=978-0-8130-3378-5 |url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of ayahuasca, a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of ayahuasca. When used for its medicinal purposes, ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for less than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption and peaking after two hours. In some cases, individuals experience significant psychological stress during the experience. Ayahuasca also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing  heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. It is for this reason that extreme caution should be taken with those who may be at risk of heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tafur |first=Joseph |title=Ayahuasca |url=http://www.nihuerao.com/eng/ayawaska.htm |access-date=2012-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215211929/http://www.nihuerao.com/eng/ayawaska.htm |archive-date=2012-02-15 |url-status=dead |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, the mixing of sensory modalities, and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as ''la purga'' or &quot;the purge&quot;). The intense [[vomiting]] and occasional [[diarrhea]] it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical [[parasite]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Andritzky1989&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andritzky |first=Walter |title=Sociopsychotherapeutic Functions of Ayahuasca Healing in Amazonia |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |issn=0279-1072 |oclc=7565359 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=77–89 |date=January–March 1989 |pmid=2656954 |doi=10.1080/02791072.1989.10472145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmala alkaloids themselves have been shown to be [[anthelmintic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hassan, I. |year=1967 |title=Some folk uses of Peganum harmala in India and Pakistan |journal=Economic Botany |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=384 |doi=10.1007/BF02860378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, this action is twofold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in ayahuasca) works to kill the parasites, and parasites are expelled through the increased intestinal motility caused by these alkaloids.

Dietary taboos are often associated with the use of ayahuasca.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Ott, 1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ott |first1= J. |title=Ayahuasca Analogues: Pangaean Entheogens |location=Kennewick, WA |publisher=Natural Books |year=1994  |isbn=978-0-9614234-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self – abstaining from spicy and heavily seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in [[Tyramine#Occurrence|foods containing tyramine]] has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of [[tyramine]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOIs]] could lead to a [[hypertensive crisis]]; however, evidence indicates that [[harmala alkaloids]] act only on [[Monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]], in a reversible way similar to [[moclobemide]] (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church [[União do Vegetal]], suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived and probably non-existent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jonathan Ott, 1994&quot;/&gt;

=== Ceremony and the role of shamans ===
[[shamanism|Shamans]] and experienced users of ayahuasca advise against consuming ayahuasca when not in the presence of one or several well-trained shamans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campos 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman &amp; Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, there are purported ''brujos'' (Spanish for &quot;[[witch]]es&quot;) who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campos 2011&quot;/&gt;

The shamans lead the ceremonial consumption of the ayahuasca beverage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/fashion/ayahuasca-a-strong-cup-of-tea.html|title=Ayahuasca: A Strong Cup of Tea |date=13 June 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Bob Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a rite that typically takes place over the entire night. During the ceremony, the effect of the drink lasts for hours. Prior to the ceremony, participant are instructed to abstain from spicy foods, red meat and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ayahuascahealings.com/ayahuasca-retreats-usa-ayahuasca-church/ayahuasca-ceremony-trip-preparation/ |title=Ayahuasca Ceremony Preparation |year=|publisher=ayahuascahealings.com |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=5 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony is usually accompanied with [[Vomiting|purging]] which include vomiting and diarrhea, which is believed to release built up emotions and [[Energy (esotericism)|negative energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/news/a8965/ayahuasca-new-power-trip/ |title=The New Power Trip: Inside the World of Ayahuasca |year=2014|magazine= [[Marie Claire]] |access-date=5 January 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional ayahuasca brews are usually made with ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' as an [[MAOI]], while [[dimethyltryptamine]] sources and other admixtures vary from region to region.  There are several [[Banisteriopsis caapi#Types of vine|varieties of caapi]], often known as different &quot;colors&quot;, with varying effects, potencies, and uses.

== Non-traditional usage ==
In the late 20th century, the practice of ayahuasca drinking began spreading to [[Europe]], [[North America]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tupper&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|date=August 2008|title=The Globalization of Ayahuasca: Harm Reduction or Benefit Maximization?|journal=International Journal of Drug Policy|volume=19|issue=4|pages=297–303|citeseerx=10.1.1.517.9508|doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2006.11.001|pmid=18638702}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-12-12--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first ayahuasca churches, affiliated with the [[Brazil]]ian [[Santo Daime]], were established in the [[Netherlands]]. A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, Hans Bogers (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and Geraldine Fijneman (the head of the [[Amsterdam]] Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a [[controlled substance]] (DMT); however, the prosecution was unable to prove that the use of ayahuasca by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order such that it warranted denying their rights to [[religious freedom]] under [[ECHR#Article 9 - conscience and religion|ECHR Article 9]]. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used ayahuasca, and a number of different &quot;styles&quot; have been developed, including non-religious approaches&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alì|first=Maurizio|year=2015|title=How to Disappear Completely.

=== Ayahuasca analogs ===
[[File:Syrian Rue Seeds.jpg|thumb|right|[[Syrian rue]] seeds can be used to provide an MAOI]]
In modern Europe and North America, ayahuasca analogs are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the Syrian rue plant can be used as a substitute for the ayahuasca vine, and the DMT-rich ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' is used in place of ''[[chacruna]]''. Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of ''[[Acacia]]''.

The name &quot;ayahuasca&quot; specifically refers to a botanical decoction that contains ''Banisteriopsis caapi''. A synthetic version, known as [[pharmahuasca]], is a combination of an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the DMT is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. In contrast, traditionally among Amazonian tribes, the ''B. Caapi'' vine is considered to be the &quot;spirit&quot; of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper, and guide to the otherworldly realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ayahuasca-recipe.com/ayahuasca-espana-dmt-molecula-dio-espiritual/ |title=Ayahuasca DMT La Molecula Dios |publisher=Ayahuasca-Recipe.com |date=2017-07-29 |accessdate=2017-07-31 |url-status=dead |archivedate=July 31, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731120620/http://ayahuasca-recipe.com/ayahuasca-espana-dmt-molecula-dio-espiritual/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brews similar to ayahuasca may be prepared using several plants not traditionally used in South America:

DMT admixtures:
* ''[[Acacia maidenii]]'' (Maiden's wattle) – bark *not all plants are &quot;active strains&quot;,  meaning some plants will have very little DMT and others larger amounts
* ''[[Acacia phlebophylla]]'', and other [[Acacia]]s, most commonly employed in [[Australia]] – bark
* ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]'', ''A. colubrina, A. excelsa, A. macrocarpa''
* ''[[Desmanthus illinoensis]]'' (Illinois bundleflower) – root bark is mixed with a native source of [[beta-Carboline]]s (e.g., [[Passiflora|passion flower]] in North America) to produce a hallucinogenic drink called prairiehuasca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hegnauer, R. |author2=Hegnauer, M. |year=1996  |title=Caesalpinioideae und Mimosoideae Volume 1 Part 2 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=9783764351656 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=bUV8C6iLFkEC |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who have consumed ayahuasca report having mystical or religious experiences and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the [[universe]], and deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gorman |first=Peter |title=Ayahuasca in My Blood: 25 Years of Medicine Dreaming |year=2010 |isbn=978-1452882901}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is viewed by many as a spiritual awakening and what is often described as a rebirth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campos 2011&quot;/&gt;{{rp|67–70}} It is often reported that individuals feel they gain access to higher spiritual [[dimension]]s and make contact with various spiritual or extra-dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzner |first=Ralph |title=Ayahuasca: Human Consciousness and the Spirits of Nature |year=1999 |pages=46–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, ayahuasca has been found to interact specifically with the visual cortex of the brain. In one study, de Araujo et al., measured the activity in the visual cortex of brain when they showed participants photographs. Then, they measured the activity when the individuals closed their eyes. In the control group, the cortex was activated when looking at the photos, and less active when the participant closed his eyes; however, under the influence of ayahuasca and DMT, even with closed eyes, the cortex was just as active as when looking at the photographs. This study suggests that ayahuasca activates a complicated network of vision and memory which heightens the internal reality of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Araujo |first1=DB |last2=Ribeiro |first2=S |last3=Cecchi |first3=GA |last4=Carvalho |first4=FM |last5=Sanchez |first5=TA |last6=Pinto |first6=JP |last7=de Martinis |first7=BS |last8=Crippa |first8=JA |last9=Hallack |first9=JE |last10=Santos |first10=AC |title=Seeing with the eyes shut: neural basis of enhanced imagery following Ayahuasca ingestion |journal=Human Brain Mapping |date=November 2012 |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=2550–60 |doi=10.1002/hbm.21381 |pmid=21922603 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/764bea9cc9e22ca0a6c03090652cdfc6678cf707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that people may experience profound positive life changes subsequent to consuming ayahuasca, by author Don Jose Campos&lt;ref name=&quot;Campos 2011&quot;/&gt;{{rp|25–28}} and others.&lt;ref&gt;Billen, Andrew (19 April 2019).

[[Vomiting]] can follow ayahuasca ingestion; this is considered by many [[Shamanism|shamans]] and experienced users of ayahuasca to be a purging and an essential part of the experience, representing the release of negative energy and emotions built up over the course of one's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campos 2011&quot;/&gt;{{rp|81–85}} Others report purging in the form of [[diarrhoea]] and hot/cold flushes.

The ingestion of ayahuasca can also cause significant but temporary emotional and psychological distress. Excessive use could possibly lead to [[serotonin syndrome]] (although serotonin syndrome has never been specifically caused by ayahuasca except in conjunction with certain anti-depressants like SSRIs). Depending on dosage, the temporary non-entheogenic effects of ayahuasca can include tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, [[autonomic instability]], [[hyperthermia]], sweating, motor function impairment, sedation, relaxation, vertigo, dizziness, and muscle spasms which are primarily caused by the harmala alkaloids in ayahuasca.

[[Harmala alkaloid]]s are MAO-inhibiting [[beta-Carboline|''beta''-carboline]]s. The three most studied harmala alkaloids in the ''B. caapi'' vine are [[harmine]], [[harmaline]] and [[tetrahydroharmine]]. Harmine and harmaline are [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Selectivity|selective]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Reversibility|reversible]] inhibitors of [[monoamine oxidase A]] (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pharmacokinetics&quot;/&gt;

This inhibition of MAO-A allows [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, and eventually cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|RIMA]]s or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition by drugs like [[phenelzine]] and [[tranylcypromine]], DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIBA, J 2003&quot;&gt;RIBA, J.

Internationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing it are not subject to international control:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html |title=DMT – UN report |publisher=MAPS |date=2001-03-31 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121083150/http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html |archivedate=January 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention... Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the [[Peyote]] cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principals, [[mescaline]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[psilocin]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[fax]] from the Secretary of the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health sent in 2001 goes on to state that &quot;Consequently, preparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca, are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law10.shtml |title=Ayahuasca Vault : Law : UNDCP's Ayahuasca Fax |publisher=Erowid.org |date=2001-01-17 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the INCB's 2001 affirmation that ayahuasca is not subject to drug control by international convention, in its 2010 Annual Report the Board recommended that governments consider controlling (i.e. criminalizing) ayahuasca at the national level. This recommendation by the INCB has been criticized as an attempt by the Board to overstep its legitimate mandate and as establishing a reason for governments to violate the human rights (i.e., religious freedom) of ceremonial ayahuasca drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tupper|first1=Kenneth W.|last2=Labate|first2=Beatriz C.|title=Plants, Psychoactive Substances and the International Narcotics Control Board: The Control of Nature and the Nature of Control|journal=Human Rights &amp; Drugs|volume=2|issue=1|pages=17–28|year=2012|accessdate=2012-12-12

Under American federal law, DMT is a Schedule I drug that is illegal to possess or consume; however, certain religious groups have been legally permitted to consume ayahuascha.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/orangebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A court case allowing the [[União do Vegetal]] to import and use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', was heard by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies pursuant to the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]]. In a similar case an Ashland, Oregon-based Santo Daime church sued for their right to import and consume ayahuasca tea. In March 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Panner ruled in favor of the Santo Daime, acknowledging its protection from prosecution under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://csp.org/society/docs/SantoDaimeAshland20090318.pdf |title=Ruling by District Court Judge Panner in Santo Daime case in Oregon |accessdate=2012-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003151720/http://csp.org/society/docs/SantoDaimeAshland20090318.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the [[Santo Daime]] Church Céu do Montréal in Canada received religious exemption to use Ayahuasca as a sacrament in their rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chacruna.net/how-ayahuasca-church-received-religious-exemption-canada/|title=How Our Santo Daime Church Received Religious Exemption to Use Ayahuasca in Canada|last=Rochester|first=Rev Dr Jessica|date=2017-07-17|website=Chacruna|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.&lt;ref&gt;More on the legal status of ayahuasca can be found in the [[Erowid]] vault on the [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law.shtml legality of ayahuasca].&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, [[Santo Daime]] won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060510000632/http://www.santodaime.it/Library/LAW/Francia/courdapeldeparis05_france.pdf ''Cour d'appel de Paris, 10ème chambre, section B,  dossier n° 04/01888.  Arrêt du 13 janvier 2005''] Court of Appeal of Paris, 10th Chamber, Section B, File No. 04/01888. Judgement of 13 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared ''stupéfiants'', or narcotic schedule I substances, making the tea and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.&lt;ref&gt;''JO'', 2005-05-03.

In June 2019, [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California, decriminalized natural entheogens. The City Council passed the resolution in a unanimous vote, ending the investigation and imposition of criminal penalties for use and possession of entheogens derived from plants or fungi. The resolution states: &quot;Practices with Entheogenic Plants have long existed and have been considered to be sacred to human cultures and human interrelationships with nature for thousands of years, and continue to be enhanced and improved to this day by religious and spiritual leaders, practicing professionals, mentors, and healers throughout the world, many of whom have been forced underground.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-oakland-magic-mushroom-legal-20190605-story.html|title=Oakland becomes 2nd U.S. city to decriminalize magic mushrooms|last=Shalby|first=Colleen|website=latimes.com|access-date=2019-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- NPR reported in August 2010 that it was legal, is that wrong?
In Peru, the government is undergoing the legislation process of legalizing and regulating ayahuasca usage and monitoring ayahuasca centers. Currently (April 2010) the use of ayahuasca is not technically legal but since it is an accepted practice of its indigenous cultures the Peruvian government is going through of the process maintaining the continuity of its culture whilst avoiding international issues.
--&gt;

== Intellectual property issues ==

Ayahuasca has also stirred debate regarding intellectual property protection of traditional knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|date=January 2009|title=Ayahuasca Healing Beyond the Amazon: The Globalization of a Traditional Indigenous Entheogenic Practice|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a10e962c59616ed475b2f8e11c4ca774fd4c2984|journal=Global Networks: A Journal of Transnational Affairs|volume=9|issue=1|pages=117–136|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0374.2009.00245.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-12-12--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 the US Patent and Trademarks Office allowed the granting of a patent on the ayahuasca vine ''B. caapi''. It allowed this patent based on the assumption that ayahuasca's properties had not been previously described in writing. Several public interest groups, including the ''Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin'' (COICA) and the ''Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment (Amazon Coalition)'' objected. In 1999 they brought a legal challenge to this patent which had granted a private US citizen &quot;ownership&quot; of the knowledge of a plant that is well-known and sacred to many indigenous peoples of the Amazon, and used by them in religious and healing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ciel.org/Bio/Biodiversity_Accomplishments.html |title=CIEL Biodiversity Program Accomplishments |publisher=Ciel.org |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year the PTO issued a decision rejecting the patent, on the basis that the petitioners' arguments that the plant was not &quot;distinctive or novel&quot; were valid; however, the decision did not acknowledge the argument that the plant's religious or cultural values prohibited a patent. In 2001, after an appeal by the patent holder, the US Patent Office reinstated the patent. The law at the time did not allow a third party such as COICA to participate in that part of the reexamination process. The patent, held by US entrepreneur Loren Miller, expired in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ayahuasca Patent Case |url=http://www.ciel.org/reports/legal-elements-of-the-ayahuasca-patent-case-november-1999-wiser-bw99-10-2/  |work=Our Programs: Biodiversity |publisher=The Centre for International Environmental Law |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
