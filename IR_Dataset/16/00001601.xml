'''Alexander''' is a male [[given name]]. From the male name Alexander derive the names Alex and Xander. The most prominent bearer of the name is [[Alexander the Great]], who created one of the largest empires in ancient history.

==Etymology==
The name ''Alexander'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;{{lang|grc|Ἀλέξανδρος}}&quot; (Aléxandros), meaning &quot;Defender of the people&quot; or &quot;Defending men&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)le/candros|Ἀλέξανδρος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and also, &quot;Protector of men&quot;, a compound of the verb {{lang|grc|ἀλέξειν}} ''aléxein'', &quot;to ward off, to avert, to defend&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)le/cw|ἀλέξειν|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the noun {{lang|grc|ἀνήρ}} ''anḗr'', &quot;man&quot; (&lt;small&gt;[[Genitive|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|grc|ἀνδρός}} ''andrós'').&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)nh/r|ἀνήρ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of the widespread motif of Greek names expressing &quot;battle-prowess&quot;, in this case the ability to withstand or push back an enemy [[shield wall|battle line]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The earliest [[Attested language|attested form]] of the name is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] feminine [[anthroponym]] {{lang|gmy|𐀀𐀩𐀏𐀭𐀅𐀨}}, ''a-re-ka-sa-da-ra'' (transcribed as ''[[Alexandra]]''), written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;Tablet [[Mycenae|MY]] V 659 (61). {{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=217|title=The Linear B word a-re-ka-sa-da-ra|website=Palaeolexicon.

The name was one of the titles (&quot;epithets&quot;) given to the Greek goddess [[Hera]] and as such is usually taken to mean &quot;one who comes to save warriors&quot;. In the [[Iliad]], the character [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] is known also as Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*%29ale%2Fcandros Ἀλέξανδρος],
Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The name's popularity was spread throughout the Greek world by the military conquests of [[Alexander the Great|King Alexander III, commonly known as &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;]]. Most later Alexanders in various countries were directly or indirectly named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.behindthename.com/name/alexander|title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Alexander|last=Campbell|first=Mike|website=Behind the Name|access-date=2019-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
