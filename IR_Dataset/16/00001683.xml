'''Alfonso III''' (4 November 1265, in [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] &amp;ndash; 18 June 1291), called '''the Liberal''' (''el Liberal'') or '''the Free''' (also &quot;the Frank,&quot; from ''el Franc''), was the [[King of Aragon]] and [[Count of Barcelona]] (as '''Alfons II''') from 1285. He conquered the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] between his succession and 1287.

He was a son of King [[Peter III of Aragon]] and [[Constance of Sicily, Queen of Aragon|Constance]], daughter and heiress of King [[Manfred of Sicily]].

Soon after assuming the throne, he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the [[Balearic Islands]] into the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] - which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather, [[James I of Aragon]]. Thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle, [[James II of Majorca]], and conquered both Majorca  (1285) and Ibiza (1286), effectively reassuming suzerainty over the [[Kingdom of Majorca]]. He followed this with the conquest of [[Menorca]] - until then, an autonomous [[Muslim]] state (Manûrqa) within the Kingdom of Majorca - on 17 January 1287, the anniversary of which now serves as Menorca's national holiday.

He initially sought to maintain Aragonese control over Sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to the island of his brother, [[James II of Aragon]]. However, he later retracted the support for his brother shortly before his death and instead tried to make peace with the [[Papal States]] France.{{sfn|Jones|2000|page=595}}

His reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the Aragonese nobles, which eventually culminated in the articles of the [[Union of Aragon]] - the so-called &quot;Magna Carta of Aragon&quot;, which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles. His inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in Aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility, who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne, and brought the Kingdom of Aragon close to anarchy.

During his lifetime a dynastic marriage with [[Eleanor of England (1269-1298)|Eleanor]], daughter of King [[Edward I of England]], was arranged. However Alfonso died before meeting his bride. He died at the age of 25 in 1291, and was buried in the Franciscan convent in Barcelona; since 1852 his remains have been buried in Barcelona Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LOS1c0w91AcC&amp;dq=Alfonso+III+of+Aragon|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 6, C.1300-c.1415|last=Reuter|first=Timothy|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521362900|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The chronicle of San Juan de la Peña : a fourteenth-century official history of the crown of Aragon|last=Pedro IV, King of Aragon, 1319?-1387.|date=1991|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|others=Nelson, Lynn H.
