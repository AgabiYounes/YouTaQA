'''Alyattes''' (Greek {{lang|grc|·ºàŒªœÖŒ¨œÑœÑŒ∑œÇ}}  ''Alu√°ttƒìs'', likely from a Lydian ''{{lang|xld|Walwates}}''; reigned c. 610‚Äì560 BC), sometimes described as '''Alyattes I''', was the fourth king of the [[List of kings of Lydia#Mermnadae|Mermnad dynasty]] in [[Lydia]], the son of [[Sadyattes]] and grandson of [[Ardys of Lydia|Ardys]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Croesus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H46&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Herodotus | de S√©lincourt | 1954 | p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Battle of the Eclipse|battle]] between his forces and those of [[Cyaxares]], king of [[Media (region)|Media]], was interrupted by the [[Eclipse of Thales|solar eclipse of 28 May 584 BC]]. After this, a truce was agreed and Alyattes married his daughter [[Aryenis of Lydia|Aryenis]] to [[Astyages]], the son of Cyaxares. The alliance preserved Lydia for another generation, during which it enjoyed its most brilliant period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | pp=142‚Äì143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alyattes continued to wage a war against [[Miletus]] for many years but eventually he heeded the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and rebuilt a temple, dedicated to [[Athena]], which his soldiers had destroyed. He then made peace with Miletus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alyattes was the first monarch who issued [[coin]]s, made from [[electrum]] (and his successor Croesus was the first to issue [[gold coin]]s). Alyattes is therefore sometimes mentioned as the originator of coinage, or of [[currency]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Ramage, &quot;Golden Sardis&quot;, King Croesus' Gold: Excavations at Sardis and the History of Gold Refining, edited by A. Ramage and P. Craddock, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek form {{lang|grc|·ºàŒªœÖŒ¨œÑœÑŒ∑œÇ}} is most likely derived from a name with initial digamma, {{lang|grc|œùŒ±ŒªœÖŒ¨œÑœÑŒ∑œÇ}} (''walwattes''), from a [[Lydian language|Lydian]] ''{{lang|xld|walwet-}}'' ([[Lydian alphabet]]: {{lang|xld|ê§•ê§†ê§©ê§•ê§§ê§Ø}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Kadmos'' 34-35 (1995), 51f. The name ''WALWET'' is inscribed on some of the coins of the [[Artemision deposit]]. Robert W.

==Chronology==
[[File:Electrum trite, Alyattes II, Lydia, 610-560 BC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Electrum trite, Alyattes, Lydia, 610-560 BCE. (inscribed ''KUKALI[M]''&lt;ref&gt;Interpreted as the given name ''Kukas'', equivalent to ''Gyges'', but identification with king [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]] himself is untenable. It is more likely that this &quot;Gyges&quot; was a  provincial governor or otherwise in charge of the mint workshop that produced this particular coin.
Wallace, ‚ÄúKUKALI·πÇ‚Äù, pl. 1, 1‚Äì4 = Weidauer Group XVIII, ''Triton'' XV no. 1241 (3 January 2012).

Dates for the Mermnad kings are uncertain and are based on a computation by [[J. B. Bury]] and [[Russell Meiggs]] (1975) who estimated c.687‚Äìc.652 BC for the reign of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | pp=82‚Äì83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus gave reign lengths for Gyges' successors,&lt;ref name=&quot;H46&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Herodotus | de S√©lincourt | 1954 | p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there is uncertainty about these as the total exceeds the timespan between 652 (probable death of Gyges, fighting the [[Cimmerians]]) and 547/546 (fall of [[Sardis]] to [[Cyrus the Great]]). Bury and Meiggs concluded that Ardys and Sadyattes reigned through an unspecified period in the second half of the 7th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they did not propose dates for Alyattes except their assertion that his son [[Croesus]] succeeded him in 560 BC. The timespan 560‚Äì546 BC for the reign of Croesus is almost certainly accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
For several years Alyattes continued the war against the Greek colony of [[Miletus]] begun by his father [[Sadyattes]], but was obliged to turn his attention towards the [[Medes]] and [[Babylonians]]. On 28 May 585 BC, during the [[Battle of Halys (585 BC)|Battle of Halys]] fought against [[Cyaxares]], king of [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Eclipse of Thales|a solar eclipse]] occurred; hostilities were suspended, peace concluded, and the [[Halys River]] was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

Alyattes drove the [[Cimmerians]] from [[Asia Minor]],&lt;ref name=&quot;H47&quot;/&gt; with the help of [[war dogs]].&lt;ref&gt;Polyaenus, 7.2&lt;/ref&gt; He further subdued the [[Carians]], and took several [[Ionia]]n cities, including [[Smyrna]] and [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]. Smyrna was sacked and destroyed with its inhabitants forced to move into the countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

He created the first coins in history made from [[electrum]], a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver. The weight of either precious metal could not just be weighed so they contained an imprint that identified the issuer who guaranteed the value of its contents.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sapiens: a Brief History of Humankind|last=Harari|first=Yuval Noah|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-0-06-231609-7|location=First U.S. Edition|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today we still use a token currency, where the value is guaranteed by the state and not by the value of the metal used in the coins.&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Dowler, Curator, British Museum; A History of the World; http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/7cEz771FSeOLptGIElaquA&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all coins used today descended from his invention after the technology passed into Greek usage through [[Hermodike II]] - a Greek princess from Cyme who was likely one of his wives (assuming he was referred to a dynastic 'Midas' because of the wealth his coinage amassed and because the electrum was sourced from Midas' famed river [[Pactolus]]; she was also likely the mother of Croesus (see [[croeseid]] symbolism. He standardised the weight of coins (1 [[stater]] = 168 grains of wheat). The coins were produced using an [[hammered coinage|anvil die]] technique and stamped with a lion's head, the symbol of the Mermnadae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mundall |first1=Robert A. |title=The birth of coinage |url=https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D8Q531TK |website=Columbia Academic Commons|doi=10.7916/D8Q531TK |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bin Tepe, large tumulus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Tomb of Alyattes today.]]
Alyattes' tomb still exists on the plateau between [[Lake Marmara|Lake Gygaea]] and the [[Gediz River|river Hermus]] to the north of the Lydian capital [[Sardis]] &amp;mdash; a large mound of earth with a substructure of huge stones.  It was excavated by [[Spiegelthal]] in 1854, who found that it covered a large vault of finely cut marble blocks approached by a flat-roofed passage of the same stone from the south. The [[sarcophagus]] and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb. All that was left were some broken alabaster vases, pottery and charcoal. On the summit of the mound were large [[phallus|phalli]] of stone.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Chisholm |1911 | p=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] described the tomb:

{{quote|But there is one building to be seen there which is more notable than any, saving those of Egypt and Babylon. There is in Lydia the tomb of Alyattes the father of Croesus, the base whereof is made of great stones and the rest of it of mounded earth. It was built by the men of the market and the artificers and the prostitutes. There remained till my time five corner-stones set on the top of the tomb, and on these was graven the record of the work done by each kind: and measurement showed that the prostitutes' share of the work was the greatest.|Herodotus 1-93.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/1B*.html#93 Herodotus 1-93]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some authors have suggested that Buddhist [[stupas]] were derived from a wider cultural tradition from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Indus valley]], and can be related to the funeral conical mounds on circular bases that can be found in [[Lydia]] or in [[Phoenicia]] from the 8th century BCE, such as the tomb of Alyattes.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It is probably traceable to a common cultural inheritance, stretching from the Mediterranean to the Ganges valley, and manifested by the sepulchres, conical mounds of earth on a circular foundation, of about the eighth century B.C. found in [[Erythrae|Eritrea]] and [[Lydia]].&quot; {{cite book |last1=Rao |first1=P.

==Appearance in ''The Histories''==
In ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [[Herodotus]] recounts how Alyattes continued his father's war against Miletus. According to Herodotus, Sadyattes had invaded Miletus annually to burn their crops over the course of six years. The troops left the horses and houses untouched so that the Milesians could plant a new crop, which the Lydians would then burn the following year. Alyattes did the same over the next five years until the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;H47&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Herodotus | de S√©lincourt | 1954 | pp=47‚Äì48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end came about because of a Lydian fire which, driven out of control by a strong wind, destroyed the temple of [[Athene]] at [[Assesos]]. Soon afterwards, Alyattes became seriously ill and decided to asked the Delphic Oracle for advice. The priestess refused to answer his emissary until the Lydians had rebuilt the temple. Alyattes immediately sent an embassy to Miletus and agreed a peace treaty. The temple was rebuilt and Alyattes recovered his health.&lt;ref name=&quot;H47&quot;/&gt;
