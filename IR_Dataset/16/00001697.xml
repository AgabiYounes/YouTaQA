'''Ambergris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|b|ər|g|r|iː|s|}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|b|ər|g|r|I|s|}}, {{lang-la|ambra grisea}}, {{lang-fro|ambre gris}}), ''ambergrease'', or ''grey amber'', is a solid, waxy, flammable substance of a dull grey or blackish colour produced in the digestive system of [[sperm whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18871/ambergris |title=Ambergris |encyclopedia=Britannica |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshly produced ambergris has a marine, [[feces|fecal]] odor. It acquires a sweet, earthy scent as it ages, commonly likened to the fragrance of [[Isopropyl alcohol|rubbing alcohol]] without the vaporous chemical astringency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burr&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Burr, Chandler | title=The Emperor of Scent: A Story of Perfume, Obsession, and the Last Mystery of the Senses | year=2003 | location=New York | publisher=Random House | isbn=978-0-375-50797-7 | url=https://archive.org/details/emperorofscentst00burr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambergris has been highly valued by perfumers as a fixative that allows the scent to endure much longer, although it has been mostly replaced by synthetic [[ambroxan]].&lt;ref&gt;Panten, J. and Surburg, H. 2016.

==Etymology==
The word ''ambergris'' comes from the [[Old French]] &quot;ambre gris&quot; or &quot;grey [[amber]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ambergris|volume=1|page=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=76|year=1855|issue=6|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;amber&quot; comes from the same source, but it has been applied almost exclusively to fossilized tree resins from the [[Baltic region]] since the late 13th century in Europe.

==Formation==
Ambergris is formed from a secretion of the [[biliary|bile duct]] in the [[intestines]] of the sperm whale, and can be found floating on the sea or washed up on coastlines. It is sometimes found in the [[abdomen]]s of dead sperm whales.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; Because the beaks of [[giant squid]]s have been discovered within lumps of ambergris, scientists have theorized that the substance is produced by the whale's gastrointestinal tract to ease the passage of hard, sharp objects that it may have eaten. The sperm whale usually vomits these, but if one travels further down the gut, it will be covered in ambergris.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/books/excerpt/2012/kemp_floating.html|title=The Origin of Ambergris|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|-ChivtjDjh4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambergris is usually passed in the fecal matter. It is speculated that an ambergris mass too large to be passed through the intestines is expelled via the mouth, leading to the reputation of ambergris as primarily coming from whale vomit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=William F. Perrin |author2=Bernd Wursig |author3=J. G.M. [[Hans Thewissen|Thewissen]]|title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0080919935 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambergris takes years to form. Christopher Kemp, the author of ''Floating Gold: A Natural (and Unnatural) History of Ambergris'', says that it is only produced by sperm whales, and only by an estimated one percent of them. Ambergris is rare; once expelled by a whale, it often floats for years before making landfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Christopher|title=Floating Gold: A Natural (and Unnatural) History of Ambergris|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0CKIxwLT-oC|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-43036-2|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=F0CKIxwLT–oC&amp;pg=PA12 12–13]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very small chance of finding ambergris, and the legal ambiguity involved led perfume makers away from ambergris and led chemists on a quest to find viable alternatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daley 2016&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Daley | first=Jason | title=Your High-End Perfume Is Likely Part Whale Mucus | website=Smithsonian | date=14 April 2016 | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/your-high-end-perfume-likely-part-whale-mucus-180958767/ | access-date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambergris is primarily found in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and on the coasts of [[South Africa]], [[Brazil]], [[Madagascar]], the [[East Indies]], [[The Maldives]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca Islands]]. Most commercially collected ambergris comes from the [[Bahamas]] in the Atlantic, particularly [[New Providence]].  Fossilised ambergris from 1.75 million years ago has also been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldanza|first=Angela|first2=Roberto |last2=Bizzarri |first3=Federico |last3=Famiani |first4=Paolo |last4=Monaco |first5=Roberto |last5=Pellegrino |first6=Paola |last6=Sassi|title=Enigmatic, biogenically induced structures in Pleistocene marine deposits: A first record of fossil ambergris|journal=Geology|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1075|date=30 July 2013|doi=10.1130/G34731.1|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254559304 |bibcode=2013Geo....41.1075B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Ambergris is found in lumps of various shapes and sizes, usually weighing from 15&amp;nbsp;g (~½&amp;nbsp;oz) to 50&amp;nbsp;kg (110&amp;nbsp;pounds), sometimes more.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt; When initially expelled by or removed from the whale, the fatty precursor of ambergris is pale white in colour (sometimes streaked with black), soft, with a strong fecal smell. Following months to years of [[photodegradation]] and [[oxidation]] in the ocean, this precursor gradually hardens, developing a dark grey or black colour, a crusty and waxy texture, and a peculiar odour that is at once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic. Its scent has been generally described as a vastly richer and smoother version of [[isopropanol]] without its stinging harshness. In this developed condition, ambergris has a [[specific gravity]] ranging from 0.780 to 0.926. It melts at about 62&amp;nbsp;°C (143.6&amp;nbsp;°F) to a fatty, yellow resinous liquid; and at {{convert|100|C|0|abbr=on}} it is volatilised into a white vapour. It is soluble in [[diethyl ether|ether]], and in volatile and fixed oils.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Ambergris is relatively nonreactive to acid. White crystals of a [[terpene]] known as [[ambrein]] can be separated from ambergris by heating raw ambergris in alcohol, then allowing the resulting solution to cool. Breakdown of the relatively scentless ambrein through oxidation produces [[ambroxan]] and ambrinol, the main odor components of ambergris.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Ambroxan]] is now produced synthetically and used extensively in the perfume industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://perfumeshrine.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/ambroxambroxan-modern-fascination-on.html |title=Ambrox/Ambroxan: a Modern Fascination on an Elegant Material |date=5 November 2010 |publisher=Perfume Shrine |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Ambergris has been mostly known for its use in creating perfume and fragrance much like [[musk]]. Perfumes can still be found with ambergris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/ambergris-treasure-of-the-deep-01122012.html |title=Ambergris, Treasure of the Deep |date=January 12, 2012 |first=Eric |last=Spitznagel |magazine=Bloomberg Businessweek |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is collected from remains found at sea and on beaches, although its precursor originates from the sperm whale, which is a vulnerable species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/41755/0 |title=Physeter macrocephalus |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |accessdate=31 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambergris has historically been used in food and drink. A serving of eggs and ambergris was reportedly King [[Charles II of England]]'s favorite dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Lord Macaulay |title=The History of England from the Accession of James II |year=1848 |publisher=Harper |isbn= |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1468 |volume=1 |chapter=IV |page=222 |author-link=Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recipe for [[Shrub (drink)|Rum Shrub]] liqueur from the mid 19th century called for a thread of ambergris to be added to rum, almonds, cloves, cassia, and the peel of oranges in making a cocktail from ''[[The English and Australian Cookery Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbott |first=Edward |url= https://archive.org/details/b21505524/page/272 |title=The English and Australian Cookery Book |date=1864 |page= 272 (at the top)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used as a flavoring agent in Turkish coffee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theguideistanbul.com/istanbul-historic-coffeehouses/ |title=The starting point of Turkish coffee: Istanbul's historic coffeehouses |website=The Istanbul Guide|date=  |author= |accessdate= 26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in hot chocolate in 18th century Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Matthew|title=How the decadence and depravity of London's 18th century elite was fuelled by hot chocolate|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/london/articles/surprising-history-of-london-chocolate-houses/|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=July 15, 2017|date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The substance is considered an [[aphrodisiac]] in some cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago1&quot;/&gt;

[[Ancient Egypt]]ians burned ambergris as incense, while in modern [[Egypt]] ambergris is used for scenting cigarettes.&lt;ref name=&quot;MatHB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ambergris |title=Materials Handbook: An Encyclopedia for Managers, Technical Professionals, Purchasing and Production Managers, Technicians, and Supervisors |page=64 |last1=Brady |first1=George Stuart |last2=Clauser |first2=Henry R. |last3=Vaccari |first3=John A. |isbn=978-0-07-136076-0 |year=2002 |publisher=McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] called the substance &quot;dragon's spittle fragrance&quot;.&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-whale-waste-is-valuable |title=Strange but True: Whale Waste Is Extremely Valuable |date=April 26, 2007 |first=Cynthia |last=Graber |magazine=Scientific American |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Black Death]] in [[Europe]], people believed that carrying a ball of ambergris could help prevent them from contracting plague.  This was because the fragrance covered the smell of the air which was believed to be a [[Miasma theory of disease|cause of plague]].

During the [[Middle Ages]], Europeans used ambergris as a [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]] for [[headache]]s, [[Common cold|colds]], [[epilepsy]], and other ailments.&lt;ref name=sciam /&gt;

===Legality===
{{Main|International Whaling Commission#1982 moratorium}}
From the 18th to the mid-19th century, the whaling industry prospered. By some reports, nearly 50,000 whales, including sperm whales, were killed each year. Throughout the 1800s, &quot;millions of whales were killed for their oil, whalebone, and ambergris&quot; to fuel profits, and they soon became endangered as a species as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=For Appearance' Sake: The Historical Encyclopedia of Good Looks, Beauty, and Grooming|last=Sherrow|first=Victoria L.|publisher=Greenwood|year=2001|isbn=9781573562041|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/forappearancesak00sher/page/129 129]|url=https://archive.org/details/forappearancesak00sher/page/129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to studies showing that the whale populations were being threatened, the International Whaling Commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. Although ambergris is not harvested from whales, many countries also ban the trade of ambergris as part of the more general ban on the hunting and exploitation of whales.

Urine, faeces and ambergris (that has been naturally excreted by a sperm whale) are waste products not considered parts or derivatives of a [[CITES]] species and are therefore not covered by the provisions of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cites.org/sites/default/files/common/cop/16/sum/E-CoP16-Com-II-Rec-02.pdf CITES CoP16 Com.

===Historical===
The knowledge of ambergris and how it is produced may have been a kept secret. [[Glaswegian]] [[apothecary]] [[John Spreul (apothecary)|John Spreul]] told the historian [[Robert Wodrow]] about the substance but said he had never told anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Wodrow |first1=Robert |last2=Leishman |first2=Matthew |title=Analecta: or, Materials for a history of remarkable providences; mostly relating to Scotch ministers and Christians |date=1842 |publisher=Maitland Club |location=Glasgow |page=7 |volume=1 |chapter=May 28|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/analecta01wodr/page/6 |accessdate=8 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] wrote about ambergris, &quot;I sent along with them all the things that I valued and the gems and ambergris...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
In chapter 91 of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), Stubb, one of the mates of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]],'' fools the captain of a French whaler (''Rose-bud'') into abandoning the corpse of a sperm whale found floating in the sea. His plan is to recover the corpse himself in hopes that it contains ambergris. His hope proves well founded, and the ''Pequod'''s crew recovers a valuable quantity of the substance.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 91|''Moby-Dick'', Chapter 91]] at [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; Melville devotes the following chapter to a discussion of ambergris, with special attention to the irony that &quot;fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Moby-Dick/Chapter 92|''Moby-Dick'', Chapter 92]] at [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;A Romance of Perfume Lands or the Search for Capt. Jacob Cole&quot;, F. S. Clifford, October 1881, the last chapter concerns one of the novel's characters discovering an area of a remote island which contains large amounts of ambergris. He hopes to use this knowledge to help make his fortune in the manufacture of perfumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/romanceofperfume00clifuoft|title=The Romance of Perfume|last=Perfumer|first=Clifford|publisher=Clifford, Perfumer|year=1875|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=284–295 (360–373 in the PDF)|quote=|access-date=January 31, 2017|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' 1963 episode &quot;[[Killer Whale (The Avengers)|Killer Whale]]&quot; revolves around an ambergris smuggling operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mills|first=Kim|title=Killer Whale|date=1991-03-02|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0516856/|others=Patrick Macnee, Honor Blackman, Patrick Magee|accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 [[Bob's Burgers|''Bob’s Burgers'']] episode “[[Ambergris (Bob's Burgers)|Ambergris]]“ centers on an attempt by the Belcher children to illegally sell a large piece of ambergris that they find on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=&quot;Bob's Burgers&quot; Ambergris (TV Episode 2014) - IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3653426/|language=en|access-date=2020-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
