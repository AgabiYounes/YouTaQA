      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alypius of Antioch''' was a [[geographer]] and a [[vicarius]] of [[Roman Britain]], probably in the late 350s AD. He replaced [[Flavius Martinus]] after that vicarius' suicide. His rule is recorded is [[Ammianus]] XXIII 1, 3.

==Life==
He came from [[Antioch]] and served under [[Constantius II]] and was probably appointed to ensure that nobody with western associations was serving in Britain during a time of mistrust, rebellion and suppression symbolised by the brutal acts of the imperial notary [[Paulus Catena]]. He may have had to deal with the insurrection of the usurper named [[Carausius II]].

Alypius was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] as part of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]]'s systematic attempt to reverse the [[Christianization]] of the [[Roman Empire]] by restoring [[Paganism|pagan]] and, in this case, [[Judaism|Jewish]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus#Work|Res Gestae]]'', XXIII.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to [[Rome]], the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Alypius (geographer)|display=Alypius|volume=1|page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt;
