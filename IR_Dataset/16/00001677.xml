'''Alfonso XIII''' (17 May 1886&amp;nbsp;– 28 February 1941), also known as '''El Africano''' or '''the African''', was [[King of Spain]] from 1886 until the proclamation of the [[Second Republic of Spain|Second Republic]] in 1931. Alfonso was monarch from birth as his father, [[Alfonso XII]], had died the previous year. Alfonso's mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.

During Alfonso's reign Spain experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups; the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants; problems arising from the [[Rif War]]; and [[Catalan nationalism]]. The political and social turbulence that began with the [[Spanish–American War]] prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true [[liberal democracy]], which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. With the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime. Nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the king's support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera.

He left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931, which were taken as a plebiscite on abolishing the monarchy.

== Reign ==

=== Birth and regency ===

[[File:Alfonso_XIII,_cadete,_de_Manuel_García_Hispaleto.jpg|thumb|left|Alfonso XIII as a child]]

Alfonso was born at [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] in [[Madrid]] on 17 May 1886. He was the posthumous son of [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], who had died in November 1885, and became King of Spain upon his birth. Just after he was born, he was carried naked to the Spanish prime minister on a silver tray.

Five days later he was carried in a solemn court procession with a golden fleece round his neck and was baptized with water specially brought from the River Jordan in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;''Magnificent Monarchs'' (Fact Attack series) p.21 by [[Ian Locke]]; published by [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] in 1999; {{ISBN|978-0330-374965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' described the young king in 1889 as &quot;the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Happiest Living Monarch&quot;, ''New York Times.'' 14 August 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, [[Maria Christina of Austria]], served as his regent until his 16th birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] to the United States as a result of the [[Spanish–American War]].

When he came of age in May 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1902/03/29/archives/alfonsos-reign-begins-may-17-he-will-take-the-oath-on-that-day.html?sq=Alfonso+XIII&amp;scp=101&amp;st=p &quot;Alfonso's Reign Begins on 17 May; He Will Take the Oath on That Day – Festivities to Last a Week,&quot;] ''New York Times,'' 29 March 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; He took his oath to the constitution before members of the Cortes on 17 May.

===Engagement and marriage===

Standing, from left to right: [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII of Norway]], [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Tsar Ferdinand of the Bulgarians]], [[Manuel II of Portugal|King Manuel II of Portugal and the Algarve]], [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and Prussia]], [[George I of Greece|King George I of the Hellenes]] and [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I of the Belgians]]. Seated, from left to right: King Alfonso XIII of Spain, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] and [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]]]]
By 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], he stayed at [[Buckingham Palace]] with King [[Edward VII]]. There he met Princess [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]], the daughter of Edward's youngest sister [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]], and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria's brother Leopold was a [[haemophilia]]c, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally, Alfonso's mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the [[House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic.

Victoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in [[Biarritz]], [[France]], later that month, and converted to Catholicism in [[San Sebastián]] in March.

[[File:Anarchist attack on the King of Spain Alfonso XIII (1906).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Photograph taken moments after the assassination attempt on Alfonso and [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] on their wedding day]]
In May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the [[San Jerónimo el Real|Royal Monastery of San Jerónimo]] in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victoria's cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]). The wedding was marked by [[Morral affair|an assassination attempt]] on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan [[anarchist]] Mateu Morral. As the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured many bystanders and members of the procession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edwardianpromenade.com/weddings/royal-wedding-1-victoria-eugenie-alfonso-xiii/|title=Royal Wedding #1: Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg &amp; King Alfonso XIII of Spain|work=Edwardian Promenade|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 1907, the couple's first child, [[Alfonso, Prince of Asturias (1907–1938)|Alfonso, Prince of Asturias]], was born. However, Victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and Alfonso inherited the condition.

Neither of the two daughters born to the King and Queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons, [[Gonzalo of Spain|Gonzalo]] (1914–1934), had the condition. Alfonso distanced himself from his wife for transmitting the condition to their sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2002/339/1018871276.html|title=Reinas Borbones de cuidado|work=elmundo.es|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children. A sixth illegitimate child had been born before his marriage.

===World War I===
{{See also|European War Office}}
During [[World War I]], because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion, Spain remained neutral.&lt;ref&gt;his wife was British, his mother Austrian, amongst other family relationships.&lt;/ref&gt; The King established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides. This office used the Spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of POWs – transmitting and receiving letters for them, and other services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/international-collections/2018/01/royal-knight-of-charity-king-alfonso-xiii-of-spain-in-wwi/|title=“Royal Knight of Charity”: King Alfonso XIII of Spain in WWI|work=loc.gov|accessdate=19 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office was located in the [[Palacio Real|Royal Palace]].

Alfonso became gravely ill during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed. This gave the misleading impression that Spain was the most-affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed &quot;the Spanish Flu.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barry&quot;&gt;Barry 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rif War and Miguel Primo de Rivera===

Following World War I, Spain entered the lengthy yet victorious [[Rif War]] (1920–1926) to preserve its colonial rule over northern Morocco. Critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed Alfonso ''el Africano'' (&quot;the African&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=28088|title=Rebelion. Prlogo para &quot;Alfonso XIII: un enemigo del pueblo&quot; de Pedro L. Angosto|work=rebelion.org|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfonso had not acted as a strict constitutional monarch, and supported the [[Africanist (Spain)|Africanists]] who wanted to conquer for Spain a new empire in Africa to compensate for the lost empire in the Americas and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 274&lt;/ref&gt; The Rif War had starkly polarized Spanish society between the [[Africanist (Spain)|Africanists]] who wanted to conquer an empire in Africa vs. the ''abandonistas'' who wanted to abandon Morocco as not worth the blood and treasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, James page 286&quot;&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfonso liked to play favourites with his generals, and one of his most favored generals was [[Manuel Fernández Silvestre]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 276&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, when Silvestre advanced up into the [[Rif|Rif mountains]] of Morocco, Alfonso sent him a telegram whose first line read &quot;Hurrah for real men!&quot;, urging Silvestre not to retreat at a time when Silvestre was experiencing major difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Silvestre stayed the course, leading his men into the [[Battle of Annual]], one of Spain's worst defeats. Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the &quot;Disaster of the Annual&quot; while he was playing golf. Reportedly, Alfonso's response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say &quot;Chicken meat is cheap&quot;, before resuming his game of golf.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, James ''Arrogant Armies Great Military Disasters and the Generals Behind Them'', Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the &quot;Disaster of the Annual&quot;, which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King couldn't care less about the lives of his soldiers. In 1922, the ''Cortes'' started an investigation into the responsibility for the Annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the King had been one of the main supporters of Silvestre's advance into the Rif mountains.

After the &quot;Disaster of the Annual&quot;, Spain's war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging onto Morocco, support for the ''abandonistas'' grew as many people could see no point to the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, James page 286&quot;/&gt; In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied, other soldiers in [[Malaga]] simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the [[Republic of the Rif|Rif Republic]] was waved about.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, James page 286&quot;/&gt; With the [[Africanist (Spain)|Africanists]] comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the ''abandonistas'' forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the [[Miguel_Primo_de_Rivera#Military_establishes_dictatorship|military coup d'état later in 1923]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, James page 286&quot;/&gt; On September 13, 1923, General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Miguel Primo de Rivera]], seized power in a military coup. He ruled as a dictator with Alfonso's support until 1930. It is believed that one of Alfonso's main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning ''Cortes'' report into the Annual disaster. The poetic [[Generation of '27]] as well as Catalan and Basque nationalism grew in this era.

=== Downfall and Second Republic ===
In January 1930, due to economic problems and general unpopularity, Miguel Primo de Rivera resigned as Prime Minister. Alfonso, as the Prime Minister's ally, shared the popular dislike. The King had so closely associated with the [[Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime he had supported for almost seven years. In April 1931, [[General]] [[José Sanjurjo]] told him even the army was not loyal. On 12 April, the republican parties won a landslide victory in municipal elections. The municipal elections were fought as a virtual referendum on the future of the monarchy. Alfonso left the country on 14 April as the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed, but did not formally abdicate. He eventually settled in Rome.

By a law of 26 November 1931, Alfonso was accused by the Cortes of high treason.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1931/332/A01250-01250.pdf Ley aprobando el acta acusatoria contra D. Alfonso de Borbón Habsurgo-Lorena, dictando sentencia condenatoria en la forma que se inserta.] Gaceta de Madrid no. 332, 28/11/1931, p. 1250&lt;/ref&gt; This law would later be repealed by a new law dated 15 December 1938, signed by [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://boe.es/datos/pdfs/BOE//1938/173/A03039-03039.pdf Ley concediendo la nacionalidad española a D. Alfonso de Borbón.] Boletín Oficial del Estado no. 173, 20/12/1938, p. 3039.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exile==
In 1933, his two eldest sons, Alfonso and Jaime, renounced their claims to the defunct throne, and in 1934 his youngest son Gonzalo died. This left his third son [[Juan, Count of Barcelona]] his only male heir. Juan later was the father of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]].

===Civil War===
When the Army rose up against the democratically elected Republican Government &lt;ref&gt;Paul Preston, History of the Spanish Civil War&lt;/ref&gt; and war broke out, Alfonso made it clear he favoured the &quot;Nationalist&quot; military rebels against the Republic. But in September 1936 the Nationalist leader, General [[Francisco Franco]], declared that the Nationalists would not restore Alfonso as king. (The Nationalist army included many [[Carlism|Carlist]] supporters of a rival pretender.) Nevertheless, Alfonso sent his son Juan to Spain in 1936, to participate in the uprising. However, General [[Emilio Mola|Mola]] had Juan arrested near the French border and expelled from the country.

On 29 September 1936, upon the death of [[Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime]] (the Carlist pretender), Alfonso also became the senior heir of [[Hugh Capet]] and so was hailed by some French [[legitimists]] as King Alphonse I of France and Navarre.

===Renunciation of claims to the defunct throne and death===
On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII renounced his rights to the defunct Spanish throne in favour of Juan. He died in Rome on 28 February of that year.

In Spain, the ''[[caudillo]]'' Franco ordered three days of national mourning.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mourning in Spain&quot;, ''The Times'' (3 March 1941): 3.&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was held in Rome in the Church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]]. Alfonso was buried in the Church of [[Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli]], the Spanish national church in Rome, immediately below the tombs of Popes [[Pope Callixtus III|Callixtus III]] and [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1941/03/02/archives/italians-to-mourn-death-of-alfonso-threeday-period-is-orderedtroops.html?sq=Italians+to+Mourn+Death+of+Alfonso&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p &quot;Italians to Mourn Death of Alfonso,&quot;] ''The New York Times.'' 2 March 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1980 his remains were transferred to [[El Escorial]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;21 Guns for Dead King's Homecoming&quot;, ''The Times'' (21 January 1980): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Palace Hotel (Madrid) 03.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Madrid's [[Hotel Palace]] was built on Alfonso's wishes in 1912]]

Alfonso was a promoter of tourism in Spain. The need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxurious [[Hotel Palace]] in Madrid. He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges, [[parador]]es, in historic buildings of Spain. His fondness for the sport of [[Association football|football]] led to the patronage of several &quot;Royal&quot; (&quot;Real&quot; in Spanish) football clubs, the first being [[Real Club Deportivo de La Coruña]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-espana.net/clubs/Deportivo/history|title=Deportivo history – Football Espana|work=football-espana.net|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected others include [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Real Betis]], [[Real Unión]], [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] and [[Real Zaragoza]].

An avenue in the northern Madrid neighbourhood of Chamartín, Avenida de Alfonso XIII, is named after him. A plaza or town center in [[Iloilo City]], [[Philippines]] (now Plaza Libertad) was named in his honour called Plaza Alfonso XIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iloiloilove.com/plaza-libertad-face-ilonggo-history/|title=Plaza Libertad: The face of Ilonggo History|work=Iloilo I LOVE!|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A street in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], in [[Wales]], was built especially to house Spanish immigrants in the mining industry and named Alphonso Street after Alfonso XIII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=The Matter of Wales|publisher=Penguin Books|edition=1986|page=339|ISBN=0-14-008263-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfonso XIII appears as &quot;King Buby&quot; in [[Luis Coloma]]'s story of [[Ratoncito Pérez]] (1894), which was written for the King when he was 8 years old. The story of Ratoncito Pérez has been adapted into further literary works and movies since then, with the character of Alfonso XIII appearing in some. Alfonso XIII is also mentioned on the plaque to Ratoncito Pérez on the second floor of &quot;[[la calle del Arenal]]&quot;.

==Marriage and children==

On 31 May 1906, Alfonso married [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]-born [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] (1887–1969). Only entitled to the [[style (manner of address)|style]] of ''[[Serene Highness]]'' by birth, Ena, as she was known, was granted the higher honorific of ''[[Royal Highness]]'' one month before her wedding.

Alfonso and Ena had six surviving children:

* {{flag|Empire of Japan}}: Collar of the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], ''1930'' – Emperor Hirohito's second brother, [[Prince Takamatsu]], travelled to Madrid to confer the Great Collar of the Chrysanthemum on King Alfonso. This honour was intended, in part, to commemorate the diplomatic and trading history which existed long before other Western nations were officially aware of Japan's existence. [[Prince Takamatsu]] travelled with his wife, [[Princess Takamatsu]], to Spain. Her symbolic role in this unique mission to the Spanish Court was intended to emphasize the international links which were forged by her 16th-century ancestor, [[Ieyasu Tokugawa]]. In the years before the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], that innovative ''[[daimyō]]'' from Western Japan had been actively involved in negotiating trade and diplomatic treaties with Spain and with the colonies of New Spain (Mexico) and the Philippines; and it was anticipated that the mere presence of the Princess could serve to underscore the range of possibilities which could be inferred from that little-known history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1930/11/03/archives/japan-to-decorate-kind-alfonso-today-emperors-brother-nears-madrid.html?sq=order+of+the+chrysanthemum+&amp;scp=4&amp;st=p &quot;Japan to Decorate King Alfonso Today; Emperor's Brother Nears Madrid With Collar of the Chrysanthemum for Spanish King,&quot;] ''New York Times,'' 3 November 1930; ''see also'' Nutail, Zelia.
