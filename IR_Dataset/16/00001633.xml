{{Catholic Church sidebar|controversies}}
An '''antipope''' ({{lang-la|antipapa}}) is a person who, in opposition to the lawful [[pope]], makes a significant attempt to occupy the position of [[Diocese of Rome|Bishop of Rome]] and leader of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;One who opposes the legitimately elected bishop of Rome, endeavours to secure the papal throne, and to some degree succeeds materially in the attempt&quot; ([http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/28501/antipope Encyclopædia Britannica: ''Antipope'']).&lt;/ref&gt; At times between the 3rd and mid-15th centuries, antipopes were supported by important factions within the Church itself and by secular rulers.

Sometimes it was difficult to distinguish which of two claimants should be called pope and which antipope, as in the case of [[Pope Leo VIII]] and [[Pope Benedict V]].&lt;ref&gt;Of Pope Leo VIII, the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', the [[Holy See]]'s yearbook, says: &quot;At this point, as again in the mid-eleventh century, we come across elections in which problems of harmonizing historical criteria and those of theology and canon law make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the Successors of Saint Peter. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the Popes&quot; (note 19 to the list of popes in the ''Annuario Pontificio''). Of Pope Benedict V it says: &quot;If Pope Leo VIII was lawful Pope, [...] Benedict V is an antipope&quot; (note 20 to the list of popes).&lt;/ref&gt;

Persons who merely claim to be pope and have few followers, such as the modern [[Sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] antipopes, are not classified with the historical antipopes.

==History==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] ([[died|d.]]&amp;nbsp;235) is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope, as he headed a separate group within the Church in Rome against [[Pope Callixtus I]]. Hippolytus was reconciled to Callixtus's second successor, [[Pope Pontian]], and both he and Pontian are honoured as [[saint]]s by the Catholic Church with a shared [[feast day]] on 13 August. Whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of Hippolytus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01091997_p-70_en.html|title= The catacombs the destination of the great jubilee|publisher=[[Vatican City]]|accessdate=3 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070910175629/http://www.vatican.va/jubilee_2000/magazine/documents/ju_mag_01091997_p-70_en.html| archivedate= 10 September 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and whether Hippolytus actually declared himself to be the Bishop of Rome, remains unclear, since no such claim by Hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him.

[[Eusebius]] quotes&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'', V, 28&lt;/ref&gt; from an unnamed earlier writer the story of Natalius, a [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd-century]] priest who accepted the bishopric of the [[Adoptionism|Adoptionists]],&lt;ref name=Dix&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dix|first1=Gregory|last2=Chadwick|first2=Henry|title=The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition of St Hippolytus of Rome, Bishop and Martyr|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136101465|page=xvii|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=l8syjXASpNwC&amp;pg=PR27|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a heretical group in Rome. Natalius soon repented and tearfully begged [[Pope Zephyrinus]] to receive him into communion.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century/Dictionary/Z/Zephyrinus|Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature: Zephyrinus]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm|title=Monarchians – Dynamists, or Adoptionists|publisher=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=3 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930012741/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10448a.htm| archivedate= 30 September 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Novatian]] (d. 258), another third-century figure, certainly claimed the See of Rome in opposition to [[Pope Cornelius]], and if Natalius and Hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them, Novatian could then be said to be the first antipope.

The period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s of the 11th and 12th centuries. The emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes. The popes, likewise, sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants ([[anti-king]]s) in Germany to overcome a particular emperor.

The [[Western Schism]]—which began in 1378, when the French cardinals, claiming that the election of [[Pope Urban VI]] was invalid, elected antipope [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as a rival to the Roman Pope—led eventually to two competing lines of antipopes: the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon line]] (Clement VII took up residence in [[Avignon]], France), and the [[Council of Pisa|Pisan]] line. The Pisan line, which began in 1409, was named after the town of Pisa, Italy, where the (Pisan) council had elected antipope [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] as a third claimant. To end the schism, in May 1415, the [[Council of Constance]] deposed antipope [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] of the Pisan line. [[Pope Gregory XII]] of the Roman line resigned in July 1415. In 1417, the Council also formally deposed antipope [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] of Avignon, but he refused to resign. Afterwards, [[Pope Martin V]] was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to Benedict XIII. The scandal of the Western Schism created anti-papal sentiment and fed into the [[Protestant Reformation]] at the turn of the 16th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== List of historical antipopes ==

The following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', with the addition of the names of Natalius (in spite of doubts about his historicity) and [[Antipope Clement VIII]] (whose following was insignificant).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09725a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Martin V|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later Popes who took the same name. More commonly, the antipope is ignored in later papal regnal numbers; for example, there was an [[Antipope John XXIII]], but the new Pope John elected in 1958 was also called [[Pope John XXIII|John XXIII]]. For the additional confusion regarding Popes named John, see [[Pope John (numbering)]].

The list of popes and antipopes in the ''Annuario Pontificio'' attaches the following note to the name of [[Pope Leo VIII]] (963–965):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At this point, as again in the mid-11th century, we come across [[Papal conclave|elections]] in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of [[theology]] and [[canon law]] make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of [[Saint Peter]]. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes.&lt;ref&gt;Annuario Pontificio 2012 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2008 {{ISBN|978-88-209-8722-0}}), p.&amp;nbsp;12*&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, because of the obscurities about mid-11th-century canon law and the historical facts, the ''Annuario Pontificio'' lists [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester III]] as a pope, without thereby expressing a judgement on his legitimacy. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' places him in its ''List of Popes'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: List of Popes|publisher=|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with the annotation: &quot;Considered by some to be an antipope&quot;. Other sources classify him as an antipope.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles William Previté-Orton]] ''The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History'' (Cambridge University Press 1952, republished 1975 {{ISBN|0-521-20962-5}}), vol. 1, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=+Darras+%22title+of+sylvester+iii%22&amp;btnG=|title=Darras &quot;title of sylvester iii&quot; - Google Search|website=www.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern claimants to papacy ==
{{details|Conclavism}}

In modern times various people claim to be pope and, though they do not fit the technical definition of &quot;antipope&quot;, are sometimes referred to as such. They are usually leaders of [[sedevacantism|sedevacantist]] groups who view the See of Rome as vacant and elect someone to fill it. They are sometimes referred to as [[conclavism|conclavists]] because of their claim, on the basis of an election by a &quot;conclave&quot; of perhaps half a dozen laypeople, as in the case of [[David Bawden]] (&quot;Pope Michael I&quot;), to have rendered the See no longer vacant. A significant number of these have taken the name &quot;[[Pope Peter II|Peter II]]&quot;, owing to its special significance. From the point of view of the [[Catholic Church]], they are [[schism]]atics, and as such are [[Latae sententiae|automatically excommunicated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P52.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collinites ===
{{details|Apostles of Infinite Love}}
* [[Michel Collin (antipope)|Michel Collin]], self-proclaimed Pope Clement XV (1961–1974) in France, founder of the Apostles of Infinite Love&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=24 June 1974 |title=Self-styled 'Pope' dies in France |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10248452/michel_collin/ |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago, IL |agency=Reuters|via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=16 February 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190217040614/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10248452/michel_collin/ |archivedate=17 February 2019 |url-status=live }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jean-Gaston Tremblay]], Gregory XVII (1968–2011), in Canada

=== Palmarian Catholic Church ===
{{details|Palmarian Catholic Church}}
* [[Clemente Domínguez y Gómez]] (Pope Gregory XVII), mystically self-proclaimed (1978–2005) in Spain
* [[Manuel Corral]] (Pope Peter II) (2005–11)
* [[Ginés Jesús Hernández]] (Pope Gregory XVIII) (2011–2016)
* [[Joseph Odermatt]] (Pope Peter III) (2016–present)

The Palmarian Catholic Church regards [[Pope Paul VI]], whom they revere as a martyr, and his predecessors as true popes, but hold, on the grounds of claimed apparitions, that the Pope of Rome is excommunicated and that the position of the [[Holy See]] has, since 1978, been transferred to the See of [[El Palmar de Troya]].

=== Other examples ===
The following were elected by allegedly faithful Catholics, none of whom were [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]]:
* Popes of the &quot;[[Legio Maria]]&quot;, based in western [[Kenya]] (not technically Conclavist):
** Timothy Joseph Blasio Atila (1963–1998)
** Pius Lawrence Jairo Chiaji Adera (1998–2004)
** Raphael Titus Otieno (2004–present; disputed since 2010)
** Romanus Ong’ombe (2010–present; disputed)
* [[David Bawden]] (Pope Michael I), (1990–present) elected in [[Kansas]], USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;10 Most Bizarre People on Earth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oddee.com/item_65612.aspx|title=10 Most Bizarre People on Earth|work=Oddee|accessdate=20 August 2015|date=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Victor von Pentz (Pope Linus II), (1994–present). Another conclave, this time held in Assisi, Italy, elected the South African Victor von Pentz, an ex-seminarian of the [[Society of Saint Pius X]], as ''Pope Linus II'' in 1994. Linus took up residence in Hertfordshire, England.
* Pope of the &quot;True Catholic Church&quot;: [[Lucian Pulvermacher]] (Pope Pius XIII), (1998–2009), elected in [[Montana]], USA.
* Mirko Fabris (Pope Krav I), (1978–2012), elected in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LgvvaMgTsZ0C&amp;pg=PT75&amp;dq=%22Victor+von+Pentz%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2FSPUbfuF-bD7AbczYH4BA&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Historical Dictionary of New Religious Movements|first=George D.|last=Chryssides|date=25 November 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Popes of the &quot;[[Iglesia Católica Apostólica Remanente]]&quot;, based in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]:

== Antipope of Alexandria ==
As the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], has historically also held the [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria#Episcopal title|title of Pope]], a person who, in opposition to someone who is generally accepted as a legitimate [[Pope of Alexandria]], claims to hold that position may also be considered an Antipope. In 2006, the defrocked [[marriage|married]] [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] [[lector]] Max Michel became an Antipope of Alexandria, calling himself Maximos I. His claim to the Alexandrine Papacy was dismissed by both the [[Coptic Orthodox]] [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria|Pope Shenouda III]] and [[Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria|Pope Theodore II]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa|Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copticpope.org/downloads/commondec/commondec-2-2006eng.pdf|title=Common Statement Between The Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria and all Africa Regarding Max Michel|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511170645/http://www.copticpope.org/downloads/commondec/commondec-2-2006eng.pdf|archive-date=2008-05-11|access-date=3 October 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coptic Pope of Alexandria and the Greek Pope of Alexandria currently view one another, not as Antipopes, but rather as successors to differing lines of [[apostolic succession]] that formed as a result of [[christology|christological]] disputes in the fifth century.

Another Coptic (Alexandrian) Antipope is known to have laid claim in the fourth century. His name was [[Gregory of Cappadocia]].

== In fiction ==
Antipopes have appeared as fictional characters. These may be either in [[historical fiction]], as fictional portraits of well-known historical antipopes or as purely imaginary antipopes.
* [[Jean Raspail]]'s novel ''[[l'Anneau du pêcheur]]'' (The Fisherman's Ring), and [[Gérard Bavoux]]'s ''Le Porteur de lumière'' (The Light-bringer).&lt;ref&gt;Jean Raspail, ''L'Anneau du pêcheur'', Paris: Albin Michel, 1994. 403 p. {{ISBN|2-226-07590-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Bavoux, ''Le Porteur de lumière'', Paris: Pygmalion, 1996. 329 p. {{ISBN|2-85704-488-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fictional synth-pop artist [[Santo Cilauro|Zladko Vladcik]] claims to be &quot;The Anti-Pope&quot; in one of his songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYo5SHzIz5s|title=Zladko Vladcik – I am the Antipope|date=21 January 2007|work=YouTube|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dan Simmons]]'s novels ''[[Endymion (Simmons novel)|Endymion]]'' and ''[[The Rise of Endymion]]'' feature a Father Paul Duré who is the routinely murdered antipope Teilhard I. At the end of the last novel, it is mentioned that the person calling himself the pope of the Technocore loyal Catholics is recognized by very few even among those, and he is referred to as an antipope.
* In the ''[[Girl Genius]]'' comics series, set in a [[gaslamp fantasy]] version of Europe thrown into chaos by mad science (among other things), there is a brief reference to the existence of seven Popes—all of whom apparently ordered a particular text [[Book burning|burned]].
* [[Ralph McInerny]]'s novel ''The Red Hat'' features a schism between liberals and conservatives following the election of a conservative African Pope; the liberal faction elect an Italian cardinal who calls himself &quot;Pius XIII&quot;.
* In the video game ''[[Crusader Kings II]]'' by Swedish developer [[Paradox Interactive]], Catholic rulers may appoint one of their bishops as an antipope. An emperor-tier ruler such as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] may declare war on the [[Papal States]] to install their antipope as the &quot;true&quot; pope, thereby [[vassal]]izing the Papacy.
* In the video game ''[[Age of Empires II]]'' the third scenario in the game's [[Frederick Barbarossa|Barbarossa]] campaign is called &quot;Pope and Antipope&quot; and is based on the [[Siege of Crema]] and the subsequent [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines]]. 
* In episode 3 of ''[[The Black Adder]]'' (set in the late 15th century), &quot;[[The Archbishop]]&quot;, [[Baldrick]] remarks on selling counterfeit papal pardons, that one for the highest crimes requires the signatures of &quot;both popes&quot; (implying one pope and one antipope). At the end of the episode, the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]] of the local [[convent]] informs [[Edmund Blackadder|Edmund]] that he has been [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by &quot;all three popes&quot;.
*''The Last Fisherman'' by Randy England features an anti-pope John XXIV elected in opposition to Pope Brendan I
*Bud McFarlane's ''Pierced by a Sword'' includes an anti-pope John XXIV who is elected when the assassination attempt on Pope Patrick (fictional successor to [[John Paul II]]) is believed to have succeeded. He commits suicide at the end of the book.
