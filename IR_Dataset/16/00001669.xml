'''Amarasimha''' ([[IAST]]: '''Amara-siṃha''', c. CE 375) was a [[Sanskrit]] [[grammar]]ian and [[poet]] from [[ancient India]], of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been &quot;one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of [[Vikramaditya]],&quot; and according to the evidence of [[Xuanzang]], this is the [[Chandragupta Vikramaditya]] ([[Chandragupta II]]) who flourished about CE 375.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}&lt;ref name=Rice1970&gt;''Amarakosha'' compiled by [[Benjamin L. Rice|B. L. Rice]], edited by N. Balasubramanya, 1970, page X&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources describe him as belonging to the period of [[Vikramaditya]] of 7th century.&lt;ref name=Rice1970/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;&quot;Amara-Simha&quot; in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Amarasiṃha's work was destroyed, with the exception of the celebrated ''[[Amara-Kosha]]'' (IAST: ''Amarakośa'') (''Treasury of Amara''). The first reliable mention of the ''Amarakosha'' is in the Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of [[Amoghavarsha]] (814-867CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mirashi|first1=Vasudev Vishnu|authorlink1=Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi|title=Literary and Historical Studies in Indology|date=1975|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|isbn=9788120804173|pages=50–51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0JUwf2BXVAC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Amarakosha'' is a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called ''Trikanda'' or the &quot;Tripartite&quot;. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} It is also known as &quot;Namalinganushasana&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Sujit|title=A Dictionary of Indian Literature: Beginnings-1850|date=1998|publisher=Orient Blackswan|isbn=9788125014539|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCJrUfVtZxoC|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Amarakosha'' contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.

The first chapter of the ''Kosha'' was printed at [[Rome]] in Tamil character in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|HT Colebrooke]] appeared at [[Serampore]] in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] in 1831. A French translation by [[Auguste-Louis-Armand Loiseleur-Deslongchamps|ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps]] was published at [[Paris]] in 1839. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Benjamin L. Rice|B. L. Rice]] compiled the text in [[Kannada script|Kannada]] script with meanings in English and Kannada in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Benjamin Lewis|authorlink1=Benjamin Lewis Rice|title=Amarakōśa vemba nāmaliṅgānuśāsanavu, Iṅglish Kannaḍa artha mattu padagaḷa paṭṭi sahita|date=1927|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120602601|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuujuWMmv0wC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
