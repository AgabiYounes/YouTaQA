The '''Apache HTTP Server''', colloquially called '''Apache''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|p|æ|tʃ|i}} {{Respell|ə|PATCH|ee}}), is a [[free and open-source]] [[cross-platform]] [[web server]] software, released under the terms of [[Apache License]] 2.0. Apache is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the [[Apache Software Foundation]].

The vast majority of Apache HTTP Server instances run on a [[Linux distribution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://secure1.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.201808/apacheos.html|title=OS/Linux Distributions using Apache|website=secure1.securityspace.com|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but current versions also run on [[Microsoft Windows]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/platform/index.html.en|title=Platform Specific Notes - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4|website=httpd.apache.org|access-date=2019-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a wide variety of [[Unix-like]] systems. Past versions also ran on [[OpenVMS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://h41379.www4.hpe.com/openvms/products/ips/apache/ |website=h41379.www4.hpe.com |title=HP OpenVMS systems - Secure Web Server (based on Apache)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NetWare]], [[OS/2]] and other operating systems,&lt;ref name=older/&gt; including ports to mainframes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/platform/ebcdic.html.en|title=The Apache EBCDIC Port - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.4|website=httpd.apache.org|access-date=2019-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally based on the [[NCSA HTTPd]] server, development of Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code stalled. Apache played a key role in the initial growth of the [[World Wide Web]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html Netcraft Market Share] for Top Servers Across All Domains August 1995 - today (monthly updated)&lt;/ref&gt; quickly overtaking NCSA HTTPd as the dominant [[HTTP]] server, and has remained most popular since April 1996. In 2009, it became the first web server software to serve more than 100 million [[website]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;100millionsites&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/02/18/february_2009_web_server_survey.html|title=February 2009 Web Server Survey|publisher=[[Netcraft]]|accessdate=2009-03-29|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226092501/http://news.netcraft.com//archives//2009//02//18//february_2009_web_server_survey.html|archivedate= 26 February 2009 |url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2019|08}}, it was estimated to serve 29% of all active websites, ranked 2nd after [[nginx]] at 32%, and &lt;!--31.46%, strangely in graph rounding up so I go with that--&gt;32% of the top million websites, ranked 2nd after &quot;Other&quot; with 33%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2019/08/15/august-2019-web-server-survey.html|title=August 2019 Web Server Survey|publisher=Netcraft|access-date=2019-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
A number of explanations for the origin of the Apache name have been offered over the years.

From the inception of the Apache project in 1995 the official documentation stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=//www.apache.org/info.html |title=Information on the Apache HTTP Server Project |date=1997-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970415054031/http://www.apache.org/info.html |archivedate=April 15, 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apache Server Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#relate|accessdate=15 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970106233141/http://www.apache.org/docs/misc/FAQ.html#relate|archivedate=1997-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|Apache is a cute name which stuck. It was based on some existing code and a series of [[Patch (computing)|software patches]], a pun on “A PAtCHy” server.
}}

In an April 2000 interview, [[Brian Behlendorf]], one of the creators of Apache said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-mag.com/id/472/|title=Apache Power|work=Linux Magazine |first = Robert|last = McMillan|date = 15 April 2000|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190128065900/http://www.linux-mag.com/id/472/ |archivedate = 28 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|The name literally came out of the blue. I wish I could say that it was something fantastic, but it was out of the blue. I put it on a page and then a few months later when this project started, I pointed people to this page and said: &quot;Hey, what do you think of that idea?&quot; ... Someone said they liked the name and that it was a really good pun. And I was like, &quot;A pun? What do you mean?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, we're building a server out of a bunch of software patches, right? So it's a patchy Web server.&quot; I went, &quot;Oh, all right.&quot; ... When I thought of the name, no. It just sort of connotated: &quot;Take no prisoners. Be kind of aggressive and kick some ass.&quot;
}}

Since 2013 the Apache Foundation has explained the origin of the name as:&lt;ref name=&quot;Apache Foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Apache Foundation |url=https://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html#name |website=www.apache.org |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote
|The name 'Apache' was chosen from respect for the various Native American nations collectively referred to as Apache, well-known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance. It also makes a cute pun on &quot;a patchy web server&quot;—a server made from a series of patches—but this was not its origin. The group of developers who released this new software soon started to call themselves the &quot;Apache Group&quot;.
}}

When Apache is running under Unix, its process name is {{code|httpd}}, which is short for &quot;HTTP [[Daemon (computing)|daemon]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apache Docs |url=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/invoking.html |website=httpd.apache.org |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feature overview==
Apache supports a variety of features, many implemented as [[Compiler|compiled]] [[Modular programming|modules]] which extend the core functionality. These can range from [[authentication]] schemes to supporting [[server-side]] programming languages such as &lt;!-- ATTENTION AUTO-EDITORS, THESE UNDERSCORES ARE INTENTIONAL --&gt;[[mod perl|Perl]], [[mod python|Python]], [[Tcl]] and [[PHP]]. Popular authentication modules include mod_access, mod_auth, mod_digest, and mod_auth_digest, the successor to mod_digest. A sample of other features include [[Secure Sockets Layer]] and [[Transport Layer Security]] support ([[mod_ssl]]), a [[proxy server|proxy]] module ([[mod_proxy]]), a [[URL rewriting]] module (mod_rewrite), custom log files (mod_log_config), and filtering support (mod_include and mod_ext_filter).

Popular compression methods on Apache include the external extension module, mod_gzip&lt;!-- redirects to here --&gt;, implemented to help with reduction of the size (weight) of web pages served over [[HTTP]]. [[ModSecurity]] is an open source intrusion detection and prevention engine for Web applications. Apache logs can be analyzed through a Web browser using free scripts, such as [[AWStats]]/[[W3Perl]] or Visitors.

[[Virtual hosting]] allows one Apache installation to serve many different [[websites]]. For example, one computer with one Apache installation could simultaneously serve &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;example.org&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;test47.test-server.example.edu&lt;/code&gt;, etc.

Apache features configurable error messages, [[Database management system|DBMS]]-based authentication databases, [[content negotiation]] and supports several [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs).

It supports password authentication and [[digital certificate]] authentication. Because the source code is freely available, anyone can adapt the server for specific needs, and there is a large public library of Apache add-ons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/Apache_Web_server.html|title=What is Apache Web Server?

==Performance==
Instead of implementing a single architecture, Apache provides a variety of MultiProcessing Modules (MPMs), which allow it to run in either a [[Process (computing)|process]]-based mode, a hybrid (process and [[Thread (computing)|thread]]) mode, or an event-hybrid mode, in order to better match the demands of each particular infrastructure. Choice of MPM and configuration is therefore important. Where compromises in performance must be made, Apache is designed to reduce [[Latency (engineering)#Computer hardware and operating system latency|latency]] and increase [[throughput]] relative to simply handling more requests, thus ensuring consistent and reliable processing of requests within reasonable time-frames.{{clarify |date=August 2018 |reason=It isn't clear to a non-specialist like me why increasing throughput is different from handling more requests or why reducing latency (which sounds like increasing speed) wouldn't enable you to handle more requests. It also isn't clear how either of these represent a compromise in performance. Also, is Apache doing something that decreases latency and increases throughput _relative_ to what you would get by handling more requests, or is it decreasing latency and increasing throughput _rather_ than handling more requests? If the latter, &quot;rather than&quot; should replace &quot;relative to&quot; in that sentence.}}

For delivering static pages, Apache 2.2 series was considered significantly slower than [[nginx]] and [[Varnish (software)|varnish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbonvin.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/apache-vs-nginx-vs-varnish-vs-gwan/|title=Serving static files: a comparison between Apache, Nginx, Varnish and G-WAN|work=Spoot!}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address this issue, the Apache developers created the Event MPM, which mixes the use of several processes and several threads per process in an [[Asynchrony (computer programming)|asynchronous]] [[Event loop|event-based loop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/worker.html|title=worker - Apache HTTP Server Version 2.2|work=apache.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=August 2018 |reason=Mixes the use of xyz with what? Or, if (a) several processes and (b) several processes per thread are the things being mixed, the sentence should read &quot;...Event MPM, which uses several processes and several threads per process...&quot;. Also, can someone with more technical knowledge please explain why this approach is advantageous?}} This architecture as implemented in the Apache 2.4 series performs at least as well as event-based web servers, according to [[Jim Jagielski]] and other independent sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.apache.org/~jim/presos/ACNA11/Apache_httpd_cloud.pdf Apache httpd 2.4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bryan_call/choosing-a-proxy-server-apachecon-2014|title=Picking a Proxy Server}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.matsumoto-r.jp/?p=1812|title=Throughput evaluation of Apache 2.4.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some independent but significantly outdated benchmarks show that it is still half as fast as nginx, e.g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eschrade.com/page/performance-of-apache-2-4-with-the-event-mpm-compared-to-nginx/|title=Performance of Apache 2.4 with the event MPM compared to Nginx|work=eschrade.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing==
The Apache HTTP Server [[codebase]] was [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] to the [[Apache License|Apache 2.0 License]] (from the previous 1.1 license) in January 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html|title=Apache License, Version 2.0|publisher=The Apache Software Foundation|date=January 2004|accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Apache HTTP Server 1.3.31 and 2.0.49 were the first [[Software release life cycle|releases]] using the new license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newsgroup|title=FYI: Apache HTTP Server 2.0.49 Released|last=Burton|first=Richard Antony|newsgroup=alt.apache.configuration|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.apache.configuration/042hhGcLWUs/rDJdt5b927cJ|accessdate=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OpenBSD]] project did not like the change and continued the use of pre-2.0 Apache versions, effectively [[Fork (software development)|forking]] Apache 1.3.x for its purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite mailing list|url=http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=107714762916291|title=The new apache license|last=de Raadt|first=Theo|authorlink=Theo de Raadt|mailinglist=openbsd-misc|date=18 February 2004|accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html|title=Copyright Policy|publisher=OpenBSD|accessdate=2013-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ports.su/www/apache-httpd-openbsd |title=apache-httpd-openbsd-1.3.20140502p2 – OpenBSD improved and secured version of Apache 1.3 |website=OpenBSD ports |date=|accessdate=2014-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They initially replaced it with [[Nginx]], and soon after made their own replacement, OpenBSD Httpd, based on the relayed project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marvin |first1=Rob |title=Inside OpenBSD’s new httpd Web server |url=https://sdtimes.com/httpd/inside-openbsds-new-httpd-web-server/ |accessdate=12 October 2019 |work=SD Times |date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade52.html#nginx|title=OpenBSD Upgrade Guide: 5.1 to 5.2|work=openbsd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20140314080734|date=2014-03-14|title= Heads Up: Apache Removed from Base |website=[[OpenBSD Journal]]|editor=jj}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade56.html#ToPorts|title=OpenBSD Upgrade Guide: 5.5 to 5.6|work=openbsd.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versions===

Version 1.1:
The Apache License 1.1 was approved by the ASF in 2000: The primary change from the 1.0 license is in the 'advertising clause' (section 3 of the 1.0 license); derived products are no longer required to include attribution in their advertising materials, only in their documentation.

Version 2.0:
The ASF adopted the Apache License 2.0 in January 2004. The stated goals of the license included making the license easier for non-ASF projects to use, improving compatibility with GPL-based software, allowing the license to be included by reference instead of listed in every file, clarifying the license on contributions, and requiring a patent license on contributions that necessarily infringe a contributor's own patents.

The Apache HTTP Server Project is a collaborative software development effort aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, feature-rich and freely available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server. The project is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet and the Web to communicate, plan, and develop the server and its related documentation. This project is part of the Apache Software Foundation.
