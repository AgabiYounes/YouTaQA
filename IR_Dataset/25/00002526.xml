'''Agostino Carracci''' (or '''Caracci''') (16 August 1557 – 22 March 1602) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]], [[printmaker]], tapestry designer, and art teacher. He was, together with his brother, [[Annibale Carracci]], and cousin, [[Ludovico Carracci]], one of the founders of the [[Accademia degli Incamminati]] (Academy of the Progressives) in Bologna. This teaching academy promoted the Carracci emphasized drawing from life.  It promoted progressive tendencies in art and was a reaction to the Mannerist distortion of anatomy and space.&lt;ref name=getty&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/488/agostino-carracci-italian-1557-1602/ Agostino Carracci] at Getty&lt;/ref&gt; The academy helped propel painters of the [[Bolognese School (painting)|School of Bologna]] to prominence.

Agostino Carracci was born in [[Bologna]] as the son of a tailor. He was the elder brother of Annibale Carracci and the cousin of Ludovico Carracci.  He initially trained as a goldsmith.  He later studied painting, first with [[Prospero Fontana]], who had been Lodovico's master, and later with [[Bartolomeo Passarotti]]. He traveled to Parma to study the works of [[Correggio]]. Accompanied by his brother Annibale, he spent a long time in Venice, where he trained as an engraver under the renowned [[Cornelis Cort]].&lt;ref name=cat&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03374c.htm Carracci] at the ''Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting from 1574 he worked as a reproductive [[engraver]], copying works of 16th century masters such as [[Federico Barocci]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Antonio Campi]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] and [[Correggio]]. He also produced some original prints, including two [[etching]]s.

He traveled to [[Venice]] (1582, 1587–1589) and [[Parma]] (1586–1587). Together with Annibale and Ludovico he worked in Bologna on the fresco cycles in [[Palazzo Fava]] (''Histories of Jason and Medea'', 1584) and [[Palazzo Magnani, Bologna|Palazzo Magnani]] (''Histories of [[Romulus]]'', 1590–1592). In 1592 he also painted the ''Communion of St. Jerome'', now in the [[Pinacoteca di Bologna]] and considered his masterwork. In 1620, [[Giovanni Lanfranco]], a pupil of the Carracci, famously accused another Carracci student, [[Domenichino]], of [[The Last Communion of Saint Jerome (Domenichino)|plagiarizing this painting]]. From 1586 is his altarpiece of the ''Madonna with Child and Saints'', in the National Gallery of [[Parma]].  In 1598 Carracci joined his brother Annibale in Rome, to collaborate on the decoration of the Gallery in [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Palazzo Farnese]]. From 1598–1600 is a ''triple Portrait'', now in [[Naples]], an example of genre painting.  In 1600 he was called to Parma by Duke [[Ranuccio I Farnese]] to begin the decoration of the Palazzo del Giardino, but he died before it was finished.

Agostino's son [[Antonio Marziale Carracci|Antonio Carracci]] was also a painter, and attempted to compete with his father's Academy.

An engraving by Agostino Carraci after the painting ''Love in the Golden Age'' by the 16th-century Flemish painter [[Paolo Fiammingo]] was the inspiration for [[Matisse]]'s ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' (Joy of Life).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Puttfarken, &quot;Mutual Love and Golden Age: Matisse and 'gli Amori de' Carracci&quot;, ''The Burlington Magazine'', 124 (Apr. 1982): 203–208.&lt;/ref&gt;
