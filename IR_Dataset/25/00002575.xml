'''André René Roussimoff''' (May 19, 1946 – January 27, 1993), best known as '''André the Giant''', was a French [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] and [[actor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OWO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/andre-the-giant.html|title=André the Giant Profile|accessdate=September 22, 2008|website=Online World of Wrestling|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921232831/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/a/andre-the-giant.html|archivedate=September 21, 2008|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He famously feuded with [[Hulk Hogan]], culminating at [[WrestleMania III]] in 1987. His best-remembered film role was that of Fezzik, the giant in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot; /&gt; His size was a result of [[gigantism]] caused by excess growth hormone, which later resulted in [[acromegaly]]. It also led to his being called &quot;The [[Eighth Wonder of the World]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwearchive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Andre the Giant: Bio |website=WWE |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/andrethegiant|accessdate=April 2, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501202657/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/andrethegiant/bio/|archivedate=May 1, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AndreWebsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrethegiant.com/|title=André the Giant official website |accessdate=July 8, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022027/http://www.andrethegiant.com/|archivedate=July 4, 2007|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as [[WWE]]), Roussimoff was a [[List of WWE Champions|one-time]] [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] and a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|one-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Champion]]. In 1993, he was the inaugural inductee into the newly created [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]] and he was later a charter member of the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] and the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame|''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wwebio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Andre the Giant: Bio|website=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/andrethegiant |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;{{cite book |title=WWE Legends |last=Solomon |first=Brian |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wwelegends00solo/page/68 68–71] |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7434-9033-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/wwelegends00solo/page/68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
André René Roussimoff ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe ʁəne ʁusimɔf|lang}}) was born in [[Grenoble]] of [[Slavs|Slavic]] heritage, the third of five children, to Boris and Marianne Roussimoff. His parents were immigrants to France; his father was [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] and his mother was [[Poles|Polish]]. His nickname growing up was Dédé ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|d|eɪ}}, {{IPA-fr|dede|lang}}). As a child, he displayed symptoms of [[gigantism]] very early, reaching a height of {{convert|6|ft|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and a weight of {{convert|208|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} by the age of 12.

Roussimoff was a good student, particularly in [[mathematics]], but he dropped out after the eighth grade since he did not think having a [[Secondary school|high school]] education was necessary for a farm labourer. He spent years working on his father's farm in [[Ussy-sur-Marne|Molien]], where, according to his brother Jacques, he could perform the work of three men. He also completed an [[apprenticeship]] in [[woodworking]], and next worked in a factory that manufactured engines for [[baler|hay balers]]. None of these occupations, however, brought him any satisfaction.&lt;ref name=AEbio&gt;{{cite episode |title=André the Giant |series=Biography |network=[[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E Network]] | airdate=January 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he lived in the French town of [[Ussy-sur-Marne]] in the 1950s, the Irish playwright and [[Nobel Prize]] Laureate in Literature, [[Samuel Beckett]] was one of several adults who sometimes drove local children to school, including André and his siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/samuel-beckett-andre-the-giant/|website=www.themarysue.com|access-date=February 27, 2020|title=Samuel Beckett Used to Drive André the Giant to School, All They Talked About Was Cricket}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irishman and Bulgarian-born French boy had a surprising common ground, their love of cricket, with André recalling that the two rarely talked about anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/american-sports/andre-the-giant-and-samuel-beckett-knew-each-other-and-loved-cricket-89483|title=Andre The Giant And Samuel Beckett Knew Each Other And Loved Cricket|last=O'Keeffe|first=Emmet|website=Balls.ie|language=en|access-date=February 27, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1964-1973) ===
[[File:Jean Ferré - Wrestling Annual n.4 - 1973.jpg|thumb|André the Giant in the early 1970s]]
At the age of 18, Roussimoff moved to Paris and was taught [[professional wrestling]] by a local promoter, Obert Lageat, who recognized the earning potential of Roussimoff's size. He trained at night and worked as a mover during the day to pay living expenses.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt; Roussimoff was billed as &quot;Géant Ferré&quot;, a name based on the [[Picardy|Picardian]] folk hero [[:fr:Grand Ferré|Grand Ferré]],{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=4}} and began wrestling in Paris and nearby areas. Canadian promoter and wrestler Frank Valois met Roussimoff in 1966, becoming his business manager and adviser. Roussimoff began making a name for himself wrestling in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=4}}{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt;

He made his Japanese debut in 1970, billed as &quot;Monster Roussimoff&quot;, wrestling for the [[International Wrestling Enterprise]]. Wrestling as both a singles and tag-team competitor, he quickly was made the company's tag-team champion alongside Michael Nador.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}&lt;ref name=IWAtagchamp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/iwe/iwe-t.html |title=IWA World Tag Team Title |website=Wrestling Titles |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Japan, doctors first informed Roussimoff that he suffered from [[acromegaly]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=7}}&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt;

Roussimoff next moved to [[Montreal]], Canada in 1971, where he became an immediate success, regularly selling out the [[Montreal Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pain and Passion |last=McCoy |first=Heath |page=96 |publisher=[[ECW Press]] | year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55022-787-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, promoters eventually ran out of plausible opponents for him and, as the novelty of his size wore off, the gate receipts dwindled.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt; Roussimoff was defeated by [[Adnan Al-Kaissie]] in [[Baghdad]] in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;''The Sheik of Baghdad: Tales of Celebrity and Terror from Pro Wrestling's General Adnan'' Triumph Books 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and wrestled numerous times in 1971 for Verne Gagne's [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) as a special attraction until Valois appealed to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.|Vince McMahon Sr.]], founder of the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF), for advice.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=9}} McMahon suggested several changes. He felt Roussimoff should be portrayed as a large, immovable monster, and to enhance the perception of his size, McMahon discouraged Roussimoff from performing maneuvers such as [[dropkick]]s (although he was capable of performing such agile maneuvers before his health deteriorated in later life). He also began billing Roussimoff as &quot;André the Giant&quot; and set up a travel-intensive schedule, lending him to wrestling associations around the world,&lt;ref name=Legends /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dusty: Reflections of an American Dream |last=Rhodes |first=Dusty |authorlink=Dusty Rhodes (wrestler) |pages=95–96 |publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2005 |isbn=978-1-58261-907-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Assael|Mooneyham|2002|p=71}} to keep him from becoming overexposed in any area.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt; Promoters had to guarantee Roussimoff a certain amount of money as well as pay McMahon's WWF booking fee.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=12–13}}

==== Undefeated streak (1973–1986) ====
[[File:A &quot;Destroyer&quot; and André the Giant - Wrestling Revue June 1973 page 18 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Roussimoff wrestling a &quot;local competitor&quot; in June 1973]]
On March 26, 1973, Roussimoff debuted in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later World Wrestling Federation) as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], defeating [[Buddy Wolfe]] in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WWWF73&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/73.htm |title=WWWF @ New York City, NY – Madison Square Garden – March 26, 1973 |website=The History of WWE |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff was one of professional wrestling's most beloved &quot;babyfaces&quot; throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. As such, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] often stated that Roussimoff had not been defeated in 15 years by pinfall or submission prior to [[WrestleMania III]]; however, he had lost in matches outside of the WWF: a pinfall loss in Mexico to [[Canek (wrestler)|Canek]] in 1984 and a submission loss in Japan to [[Antonio Inoki]] in 1986.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/inoki.html |title=Antonio Inoki: Career History |website=Puroresu Central |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had sixty-minute time-limit draws with the two major world champions of the day, [[Harley Race]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]].

In 1976, Roussimoff fought professional [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Chuck Wepner]] in an unscripted boxer-versus-wrestler fight. The wild fight was shown via telecast as part of the undercard of the [[Muhammad Ali]] versus Antonio Inoki fight and ended when he threw Wepner over the top rope and outside the ring and won via count-out.

In 1980 he feuded with [[Hulk Hogan]], when, unlike their more famous matches in the late 1980s, Hogan was the villain and Roussimoff was the hero, wrestling him at Shea Stadium's [[Showdown at Shea (1980)|Showdown at Shea]] and in Pennsylvania, where after Roussimoff pinned Hogan to win the match, Hogan bodyslammed him much like their legendary WrestleMania III match in 1987. The feud continued in Japan in 1982 and 1983 with their roles reversed and with Antonio Inoki also involved.

In 1982, Vince McMahon, Sr. sold the World Wide Wrestling Federation to his son, [[Vince McMahon]], Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling |last=Hornbaker |first=Tim |page=193 |publisher=[[ECW Press]] | year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As McMahon began to expand his newly acquired promotion to the national level, he required his wrestlers to appear exclusively for him. McMahon signed Roussimoff to these terms in 1984, although he still allowed him to work in Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW).{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=69–70}}

One of Roussimoff's feuds pitted him against the &quot;Mongolian Giant&quot; [[Killer Khan]]. According to the storyline, Khan had snapped Roussimoff's ankle during a match on May 2, 1981, in [[Rochester, New York]], by leaping off the top rope and crashing down upon it with his knee-drop.&lt;ref name=MainEvent&gt;{{cite book |title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s |last=Shields |first=Brian |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/55 55–58] |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/mainevent00bria/page/55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, he had broken his ankle getting out of bed the morning before the match.&lt;ref name=AEbio /&gt;{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=48}} The injury and subsequent rehabilitation was worked into the existing Roussimoff/Khan storyline. After a stay at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, Roussimoff returned with payback on his mind. The two battled on July 20, 1981, at Madison Square Garden in a match that resulted in a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|double disqualification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |pages=339 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their feud continued as fans filled arenas up and down the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] to witness their matches. On November 14, 1981, at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Philadelphia Spectrum]], he decisively defeated Khan in what was billed as a &quot;Mongolian stretcher match&quot;, in which the loser must be taken to the dressing room on a stretcher.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=48–60}} The same type of match was also held in Toronto. In early 1982 the two also fought in a series of matches in Japan with Arnold Skaaland in Roussimoff's corner.

[[File:Andre the Giant.jpg|thumb|Roussimoff feuded with [[Big John Studd]] (left) in the build towards [[WrestleMania I]], and later with [[King Kong Bundy]] (second from left)]]
Another feud involved a man who considered himself to be the &quot;true giant&quot; of wrestling: [[Big John Studd]].&lt;ref name=MainEvent /&gt; Throughout the early to mid-1980s, Roussimoff and Studd fought all over the world, battling to try to determine who the real giant of wrestling was. In 1984, Studd took the feud to a new level when he and partner [[Ken Patera]] knocked out Roussimoff during a televised tag-team match and proceeded to cut off his hair.&lt;ref name=MainEvent /&gt; After gaining revenge on Patera, Roussimoff met Studd in a &quot;[[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|body slam]] challenge&quot; at the first [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]], held March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shields2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Shields |title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ktv7Nj2C9QUC&amp;pg=PA150 |date=June 15, 2010 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4516-0467-2 |pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roussimoff slammed Studd to win the match and collect the [[United States dollar|$]]15,000 prize, then proceeded to throw cash to the fans before having the bag taken from him by Studd's manager, [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan]].&lt;ref name=WMIfacts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/ |title=WrestleMania I Facts/Stats |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051021042204/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/ |archivedate=October 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, at [[WrestleMania 2]], on April 7, 1986, Roussimoff continued to display his dominance by winning a twenty-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] which featured top [[National Football League]] stars and wrestlers.&lt;ref name=WM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results/ |title=WrestleMania 2 results |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051029102035/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results/ |archivedate=October 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He last eliminated [[Bret Hart]] to win the contest.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=107}}

After WrestleMania 2, Roussimoff continued his feud with Studd and [[King Kong Bundy]]. Around this time, Roussimoff requested a leave of absence to tend to his health, effects from his acromegaly that were beginning to take their toll, as well as tour Japan. He had also been cast in the film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. To explain his absence, a storyline was developed in which Heenan—suggesting that Roussimoff was secretly afraid of Studd and Bundy, whom Heenan bragged were unbeatable—challenged Roussimoff and a partner of his choosing to wrestle Studd and Bundy in a televised tag-team match. When Roussimoff failed to show, WWF president [[Jack Tunney]] indefinitely suspended him.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |title=WWE Encyclopedia |last1=Shields |first1=Brian |last2=Sullivan |first2=Kevin |pages=12–13 |publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]] | year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the summer of 1986, upon Roussimoff's return to the United States, he began wearing a mask and competing as the &quot;Giant Machine&quot; in a stable known as [[The Machines (professional wrestling)|the Machines]]. ([[Blackjack Mulligan|Big Machine]] and [[Bill Eadie|Super Machine]] were the other members, (Hulk Hogan (as &quot;Hulk Machine&quot;) and [[Roddy Piper]] (as &quot;Piper Machine&quot;) were also one-time members).  The WWF's television announcers sold the Machines—a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that was copied from the [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] character &quot;Super Strong Machine&quot;, played by Japanese wrestler [[Junji Hirata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html |title=The Machines' Profile |website=Online World of Wrestling |accessdate=July 8, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621210036/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html |archivedate=June 21, 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; —as &quot;a new tag-team from Japan&quot; and claimed not to know the identities of the wrestlers, even though it was obvious to fans that it was Roussimoff competing as the Giant Machine. Heenan, Studd, and Bundy complained to Tunney, who eventually told Heenan that if it could be proven that Roussimoff and the Giant Machine were the same person, Roussimoff would be fired. Roussimoff thwarted Heenan, Studd, and Bundy at every turn. Then, in late 1986, the Giant Machine &quot;disappeared,&quot; and Roussimoff was reinstated. Foreshadowing Roussimoff's heel turn, Heenan expressed his approval of the reinstatement but did not explain why.

{{see also|André the Giant–Hulk Hogan rivalry}}
[[File:Andre and Bobby Heenan.jpg|thumb|right|Roussimoff was managed by [[Bobby Heenan]] (foreground) during parts of his feud with [[Hulk Hogan]].]]

Roussimoff agreed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in early 1987 to be the counter to the biggest &quot;[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]&quot; in professional wrestling at that time, [[Hulk Hogan]].{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=131}} On an edition of ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' in 1987, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the [[WWE World Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] for three years; Roussimoff came out to congratulate him, shaking Hogan's hand with a strong grip, which surprised the Hulkster.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=132–133}} On the following week's ''Piper's Pit'', Roussimoff was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being &quot;the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history.&quot; Although he had suffered a handful of [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] losses in WWF, he had never been pinned or forced to submit in a WWF ring. Hogan came out to congratulate him and ended up being the focal point of the interview.

Speaking on behalf of his new protégé, Heenan accused Hogan of being Roussimoff's friend only so he would not have to defend his title against him. Hogan tried to reason with Roussimoff, but his pleas were ignored as he challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at [[WrestleMania III]]. Hogan was still seemingly in disbelief as to what Roussimoff was doing, prompting Heenan to say &quot;You can't believe it, maybe you'll believe this, Hogan&quot; before Roussimoff ripped off the T-shirt and crucifix from Hogan, with the crucifix scratching Hogan's chest, causing him to bleed.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=136–139}}

Following Hogan's acceptance of his challenge on a later edition of ''Piper's Pit'', the two were part of a 20-man over-the-top-rope battle-royal on March 14 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event X]]'' at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history623&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Professional Wrestling: The Results WWF 1963–1989 |last=Cawthon |first=Graham |pages=623 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4928-2597-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the battle royal was won by [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], Roussimoff claimed to have gained a psychological advantage over Hogan when he threw the WWF World Heavyweight Champion over the top rope. The match, which was actually taped on February 21, 1987,&lt;ref name=&quot;history623&quot; /&gt; aired only two weeks before WrestleMania III to make it seem like Hogan had met his match in André the Giant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIfSsZa186w |title=Battle Royal with Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant |date=July 8, 2013 |author=WWE |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At WrestleMania III, he was billed at {{convert|520|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}},&lt;ref name=WMIII&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/mainevent/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116004246/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/mainevent/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 16, 2006 |title=WrestleMania III – André the Giant vs. Hulk Hogan – WWE Championship |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011|quote=It was billed as the biggest main event in the history of sports entertainment: Hollywood Hogan vs. André the Giant.

Another myth about the match is that no one, not even WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], knew until the day of the event whether Roussimoff would lose the match. In reality, he had agreed to lose the match sometime before, mostly for health reasons. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully body-slammed him in a WWF match. A then-heel Hogan had slammed a then-face Roussimoff following their match at the [[Showdown at Shea (1980)|Showdown at Shea]] on August 9, 1980, though Roussimoff was somewhat lighter (around {{convert|470|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}) and more athletic at the time (Hogan also slammed him in a match in [[Hamburg, Pennsylvania]], a month later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology|medium=DVD |publisher=[[WWE]] | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in the territorial days of American wrestling three years before WWF began national expansion, so many of those who watched WrestleMania III had never seen the Giant slammed (Roussimoff had also previously allowed [[Harley Race]], [[Canek (wrestler)|El Canek]] and [[Stan Hansen]], among others, to slam him).{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=157}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story |last=Race |first=Harley |authorlink=Harley Race |page=90 |publisher=Sports Publishing L.L.C. |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58261-818-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of WrestleMania III, the WWF had gone national, giving more meaning to the Roussimoff–Hogan match that took place then. The feud between Roussimoff and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud began heating up again when wrestlers were named the captains of rival teams at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event. During their approximately one minute of battling each other during the match, Hogan dominated Roussimoff and was on the brink of knocking him from the ring, but was tripped up by his partners, Bundy and [[One Man Gang]], and would be counted out. Roussimoff went on to be the sole survivor of the match, pinning [[Bam Bam Bigelow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/mainevent/ |title=Survivor Series 1987 – Main Event |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; before Hogan returned to the ring to attack André and knock him out of the ring. Roussimoff later got revenge when, after Hogan won a match against Bundy on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'', he snuck up from behind and began choking Hogan to the brink of unconsciousness, not letting go even after an army of seven face-aligned wrestlers ran to the ring to try to pull him away; it took Hacksaw Jim Duggan breaking a piece of wood over his back (which he [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|no-sold]]) for him to let go, after which Hogan was pulled to safety. As was the case with the ''SNME'' battle royal a year earlier, the series of events was one of the pieces that helped build interest in a possible one-on-one rematch between Hogan and Roussimoff, and to make it seem that Roussimoff was certain to win easily when they did meet.

In the meantime, [[Ted DiBiase|the &quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase]] failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to Roussimoff to win it for him.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=172–175}} He and DiBiase had teamed several times in the past, including in Japan and in the WWF in the late 1970s and early 1980s when both were faces, but this was not acknowledged during this new storyline. The earlier attack and DiBiase's insertion into the feud set up the Hogan-Roussimoff rematch on ''The Main Event'', to air February 5, 1988, on a live broadcast on NBC. Acting as his hired gun, Roussimoff won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hogan (his first singles title) in a match where it was later revealed that appointed referee [[Dave Hebner]] was &quot;detained backstage&quot;, and a replacement (whom Hogan afterwards initially accused of having been paid by DiBiase to get plastic surgery to look like Dave,&lt;ref&gt;Hulk Hogan postmatch interview, ''The Main Event'' NBC television, February 5, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; but was revealed to have been his evil twin brother, [[Earl Hebner]]),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A ''WWF Magazine'' Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow,&quot; ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'', June 1988, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat.

After winning, Roussimoff &quot;sold&quot; the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures|WWF president]] Jack Tunney and the title was declared vacant.&lt;ref name=wwechamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |title=Andre the Giant's first reign |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=February 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050624001310/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122 |archivedate=June 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was shown on WWF's [[NBC]] program ''[[The Main Event (1988)|The Main Event]]''. At [[WrestleMania IV]], Roussimoff and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that Roussimoff was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, Roussimoff and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'' on July 31, 1988, in Milwaukee.

At the inaugural SummerSlam pay-per-view held at [[Madison Square Garden]], Roussimoff and DiBiase (billed as [[The Mega Bucks]]) faced Hogan and WWF World Heavyweight Champion [[Randy Savage|&quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage]] (known as [[The Mega Powers]]) in the main event, with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura]] as the special guest referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/ |title=SummerSlam 1988 main event match details |website=[[WWE]] | accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, the Mega Powers' manager, [[Miss Elizabeth]], distracted the Mega Bucks and Ventura when she climbed up on the ring apron, removed her yellow skirt and walked around in a pair of red panties. This allowed Hogan and Savage time to recover and eventually win the match with Hogan pinning DiBiase. Savage forced Ventura's hand down for the final three-count, due to Ventura's character historically being at odds with Hogan, and his unwillingness to count the fall.

Concurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, Roussimoff was placed in a feud with [[Jim Duggan]], which began after Duggan knocked out Roussimoff with a two-by-four board during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, Roussimoff regularly got the upper hand in the feud.

[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|Roussimoff's feud with [[Jake Roberts]] derived from Roussimoff's [[ophidiophobia|fear of snakes]].]]
Roussimoff's next major feud was against [[Jake Roberts|Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts]]. In this storyline, it was said Roussimoff was [[Ophidiophobia|afraid of snakes]], something Roberts exposed on ''Saturday Night's Main Event'' when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened Roussimoff; as a result, he suffered a [[kayfabe]] mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside carrying his snake in its bag during Roussimoff's matches, causing the latter to run from the ring in fright. Throughout their feud (which culminated at [[WrestleMania V]]), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger Roussimoff.

In 1989, Roussimoff and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, beginning at WrestleMania V, when Studd was the referee in the match with Roberts, this time with Studd as a face and Roussimoff as the heel. During the late summer and Autumn of 1989, he engaged in a brief feud, consisting almost entirely of [[house show]]s (non-televised events), with then-[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Champion]] [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. The younger Warrior, WWF's rising star, regularly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squashed]] the aging Roussimoff in an attempt to showcase his star quality and promote him as the &quot;next big thing&quot;.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=297–300}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling |last=Hart |first=Bret |authorlink=Bret Hart |page=[https://archive.org/details/hitmanmyreallife00hart/page/233 233] |publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA#Current imprints|Grand Central Publishing]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-446-53972-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/hitmanmyreallife00hart/page/233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Colossal Connection (1989–1990) ====
{{Main|The Colossal Connection|l1=The Colossal Connection}}
In late 1989, Roussimoff was joined with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] to form a new tag team called [[the Colossal Connection]], in part to fill a void left by the departure of [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Arn Anderson]] ([[the Brain Busters]], who were also members of Heenan's stable) from the WWF, and also to continue to keep the aging Roussimoff in the main event spotlight. The Colossal Connection immediately targeted WWF Tag Team Champions [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] (who had recently won the belts from the Brain Busters). At a television taping on December 13, 1989, the Colossal Connection defeated Demolition to win the titles.&lt;ref name=tagchamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111121 |title=Andre the Giant and Haku's first reign |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050720013735/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111121 |archivedate=July 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roussimoff and Haku successfully defended their title, mostly against Demolition, until [[WrestleMania VI]] on April 1, 1990, when Demolition took advantage of a mistimed move by the champions to regain the belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321241 |title=Demolition's third reign |website=[[WWE]] |accessdate=February 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128115003/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321241 |archivedate=November 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, a furious Heenan blamed Roussimoff for the title loss and after shouting at him, slapped him in the face; an angry Roussimoff responded with a slap of his own that sent Heenan staggering from the ring.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=321–322}} Roussimoff also caught Haku's kick attempt, sending him reeling from the ring as well, prompting support for Roussimoff and turning him face for the first time since 1987. Due to his ongoing health issues, Roussimoff was not able to wrestle at the time of Wrestlemania VI and Haku actually wrestled the entire match against Demolition without tagging him in.

On weekend television shows following WrestleMania VI, Bobby Heenan vowed to spit in Roussimoff's face when he came crawling back to the Heenan Family. However Roussimoff would wrestle one more time with Haku, teaming up to face Demolition on a house show in Honolulu, HI, on April 10, Roussimoff was knocked out of the ring and The Colossal Connection lost via count-out. After the match, Roussimoff and Haku would fight each other, marking the end of the team. His final match of 1990 came at a combined WWF/All Japan/New Japan show on April 13 in Tokyo, Japan when he teamed with [[Giant Baba]] to defeat Demolition in a non-title match. Roussimoff would win by gaining the pinfall on [[Barry Darsow|Smash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm |title=1990 |work=The History of WWE |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sporadic appearances (1990–1991) ====
Roussimoff returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, Roussimoff made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11 in Reseda, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/indy/uwf/uwfcards.html |title=Herb Abram's Universal Wrestling Federation Cards |work=Pro-Wrestling History |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with [[Captain Lou Albano]] and put over the UWF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSE0klOkkII |title=Andre the Giant &amp; Lou Albano UWF January 1991 |author=Andre The Giant |date=October 23, 2014 |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, on November 30 at a house show in Miami, Florida, the World Wrestling Federation announced his return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). Roussimoff was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-VFCvdFtbc |title=WWF Primetime 1991 Royal Rumble Report |author=MrYoyo123321 |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2016 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His on-air return finally took place at the WWF's ''Super-Stars &amp; Stripes Forever'' [[USA Network]] special on March 17, 1991, when he came out to shake the hand of [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]] after an altercation with [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, at [[WrestleMania VII]], he came to the aid of the Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=326}} Roussimoff finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;thehistoryofwwe.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=1991 |work=The History of WWE |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10 he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit, which was won by Kerry Von Erich. &lt;ref name=&quot;thehistoryofwwe.com&quot; /&gt; This was Andre's final WWF match, although he was involved in several subsequent storylines. His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], and [[Mr. Fuji]]) trying to recruit Roussimoff one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Roussimoff and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, [[Jimmy Hart]] appeared live on ''WWF Superstars'' to announce that he had successfully signed Roussimoff to tag-team with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]]. However, when asked to confirm this by [[Gene Okerlund]], Roussimoff denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Roussimoff from behind (injuring his knee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=WWF Show Results 1991 |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |first=Graham |last=Cawthon |quote=(Date: May 6, 1991 Shown: June 1, 1991) Included an in-ring interview by Gene Okerlund in which André the Giant refused Jimmy Hart's offer to become his manager only to have his knee attacked by Earthquake, using Hart's megaphone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing [[Fred Ottman|Tugboat]] and forming [[the Natural Disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm |title=WWF Show Results 1991 |accessdate=March 5, 2011 |first=Graham |last=Cawthon |quote=(Date: May 28, 1991 Shown: June 15, 1991)Earthquake &amp; WWF Tag Team Champions the Nasty Boys (w/ Jimmy Hart) defeated Tugboat &amp; the Bushwhackers at 4:05 when Earthquake pinned Luke with a sit-down splash after Tugboat attacked both of his teammates; after the match, Tugboat embraced with his new friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Roussimoff's final major WWF appearance at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam '91]], where he seconded [[the Bushwhackers]] in their match against the Disasters.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=333}} Roussimoff was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack him, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Roussimoff, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Roussimoff's crutch, allowing Smith to win.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1992) ===
His last U.S. television appearance was in a brief interview on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s (WCW) ''[[Clash of the Champions XX]]'' special that aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 2, 1992.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=336}}

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling and Universal Wrestling Association (1990–1992) ===
After WrestleMania VI, Roussimoff spent the rest of his in-ring career in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and Mexico's [[Universal Wrestling Association]] (UWA), where he performed under the name &quot;André el Gigante.&quot; He toured with AJPW three times per year, from 1990 to 1992, usually teaming with [[Giant Baba]] in tag-team matches.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=335}} He also made a couple of guest appearances for Herb Abrams' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]], in 1991, feuding with [[Big John Studd]], though he never had a match in the promotion. He did his final tour of Mexico in 1992 in a selection of six-man tag matches alongside [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and a variety of Lucha Libre stars facing among others [[Bad News Allen]] and future WWF Champions [[Mick Foley]] &amp; [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=926&amp;page=4&amp;year=1992&amp;promotion=68 |title=Matches: Andre The Giant: Wrestlers Database |work=The Internet Wrestling Database |first=Philip |last=Kreikenbohm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roussimoff wrestled his final match for AJPW in 1992, after which he retired from professional wrestling.

== Acting career ==
Roussimoff branched out into acting again in the 1970s and 1980s, after a 1967 French boxing film, making his USA acting debut playing a Sasquatch (&quot;[[Bigfoot]]&quot;) in a two-part episode aired in 1976 on the television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=18–19}} He appeared in other television shows, including ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'', ''[[B. J. and the Bear]]'', ''[[The Fall Guy]]'' and 1990's ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]''.

Towards the end of his career, Roussimoff starred in several films. He had an uncredited appearance in the 1984 film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' as Dagoth,{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=79}} the resurrected horned giant god who is killed by Conan ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]). That same year, he also made an appearance in ''[[Micki &amp; Maude]]'' (billed as André Rousimmoff). He appeared most notably as Fezzik, his own favorite role,&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot; /&gt; in the 1987 film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. Both the film and his performance retain a devoted following. In shoot interviews, wrestlers have stated that he was so proud of being in &quot;Princess Bride&quot;, he carried a copy of the movie everywhere he went, to watch whenever he could.

In his last film, he appeared in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo role]] as a [[circus]] giant in the comedy ''[[Trading Mom]]'', which was released in 1994, a year after his death.

==Personal life==
Roussimoff was mentioned in the ''[[Guinness World Records|1974 Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the highest-paid wrestler in history at that time. He had earned US$400,000 in one year during the early 1970s.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=18}}

Robin Christensen is Roussimoff's only child. Her mother Jean (who died in 2008) became acquainted with her father through the wrestling business around 1972 or 1973. Christensen had almost no connection with her father and saw him only five times in her life, despite occasional televised and printed news pieces criticizing his absentee fatherhood. While she gave some interviews about the subject in her childhood, Christensen is reportedly reluctant to discuss her father publicly today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/being-andre-the-giant/ |title=Being Andre the Giant |website=[[CBS Sports]] |author= Denny Burkholder |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=February 22, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff has been unofficially crowned &quot;the greatest drunk on Earth&quot;{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=123}} for once consuming 119 {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} beers (over {{convert|41|l|imppt}}) in six hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madconomist.com/5-coolest-beer-records |title=5 Coolest Beer Records |website=MadConomist |last=Davydov |first=Dmitri|date=May 20, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an episode of WWE's ''Legends of Wrestling'', [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] said Roussimoff once drank 156 {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} beers (over {{convert|73|l|imppt}}) in one sitting, which was confirmed by [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]. [[The Fabulous Moolah]] wrote in her autobiography that Roussimoff drank 127 beers in a [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], hotel bar and later passed out in the lobby. The staff could not move him and had to leave him there until he awoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ellison |first=Lillian |authorlink=The Fabulous Moolah |title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003 |isbn=978-0-06-001258-8 |publisher=ReaganBooks |page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a shoot interview, [[Ken Patera]] recalled an occasion where Roussimoff was challenged by [[Dick Murdoch]] to a beer drinking contest.

An [[urban legend]] exists surrounding Roussimoff's 1987 surgery in which his size made it impossible for the [[anesthesiologist]] to estimate a dosage via standard methods; consequently, his alcohol tolerance was used as a guideline instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nypost.com/2013/10/27/true-stories-from-the-fake-world-of-pro-wrestling/ True stories from the fake world of wrestling], by David Shoemaker, at the ''[[New York Post]]''; published October 27, 2013; retrieved March 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff was arrested in 1989 by the sheriff of [[Linn County, Iowa]]; and charged with assault after he allegedly roughed up a local television cameraman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/andregiantmug1.html |title=The Smoking Gun |accessdate=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530034919/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/andregiantmug1.html |archivedate=May 30, 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=300}}

[[William Goldman]], the author of the novel and the screenplay of ''The Princess Bride'', wrote in his nonfiction work ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'' that Roussimoff was one of the gentlest and most generous people he ever knew. Whenever Roussimoff ate with someone in a restaurant, he would pay, but he would also insist on paying when he was a guest. On one occasion, after Roussimoff attended a dinner with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Wilt Chamberlain]], Schwarzenegger had quietly moved to the cashier to pay before Roussimoff could, but then found himself being physically lifted, carried from his table and deposited on top of his car by Roussimoff and Chamberlain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uproxx.com/videos/2012/09/arnold-schwarzeneggers-dinner-wilt-chamberlain-andre-giant/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dinner With Wilt Chamberlain and Andre the Giant |first= |last= |website=Uproxx |date=September 25, 2012 |accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff owned a ranch in [[Ellerbe, North Carolina]], looked after by two of his close friends, when he was not on the road. He loved spending time at the ranch tending to his cattle, playing with his dogs and entertaining company. While there were custom-made chairs and a few other modifications in his home to account for his size, tales that everything in his home was custom-made for a large man are said to be exaggerated. Since Roussimoff could not easily go shopping due to his fame and size, he was known to spend hours watching [[QVC]] and made frequent purchases from the shopping channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Being Andre the Giant&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/general/feature/25122751/being-andre-the-giant|title=Being Andre the Giant|work=CBSSports.com|access-date=March 18, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roussimoff had a passion for card games, mainly cribbage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/being-andre-the-giant/ | title=Being Andre the Giant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Roussimoff died in his sleep of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] on the night of January 27, 1993, in a Paris hotel room. He was found by his [[chauffeur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt;{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|p=337}} He was in Paris to attend his father's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D6113AF932A05752C0A965958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Andre&amp;st=nyt |title=Andre the Giant, 46, Professional Wrestler (Obituary) |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 31, 1993 |accessdate=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Roussimoff decided to stay in France longer to be with his mother on her birthday. He spent the day before his death visiting and playing cards with some of his oldest friends in Molien.&lt;ref name=&quot;Being Andre the Giant&quot;/&gt;

In his will, Roussimoff specified that his remains be cremated and &quot;disposed of&quot;. Upon his death in Paris, his family in France held a funeral for him, intending to bury him near his father. When they learned of his wish to be cremated, his body was flown to the United States, where he was [[cremated]] according to his wishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Being Andre the Giant&quot;/&gt; His ashes were scattered at his ranch ({{coord|35.116211|-79.80634|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-NC|name=Roussimoff Ranch}}) in [[Ellerbe, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AEbio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/video/4797970/ |title=Andre the Giant lived, died in small N.C. town |website=WRAL News |location=Raleigh, NC |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in accordance with his will, he left his estate to his sole beneficiary: his daughter Robin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=HBO|title=Andre The Giant|url=https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/andre-the-giant|website=HBO|accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other media ==

Roussimoff made numerous appearances as himself in video games, starting with ''[[WWF WrestleMania (1989 video game)|WWF WrestleMania]]''. He also appears posthumously in ''[[Virtual Pro Wrestling 64]]'', ''[[WWF No Mercy]]'', ''[[WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw]]'', ''[[WWE All Stars]]'', ''[[WWE 2K14]]'', ''[[WWE 2K15]]'', ''[[WWE 2K16]]'', ''[[WWE 2K17]]'', ''[[WWE 2K18]]'', ''[[WWE 2K19]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cole |first1=Caitlin |title=Complete WWE 2K19 Roster |url=https://rumbleramble.com/complete-wwe-2k19-roster/ |website=Rumble Ramble |accessdate=April 30, 2019 |date=December 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[WWE 2K20]]'' and many others.

In January 2005, WWE released ''André The Giant'', a [[DVD]] focusing on the life and career of Roussimoff. The DVD is a reissue of the out-of-print ''André The Giant'' [[VHS]] made by [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum Video]] in 1985, with commentary by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] and [[Tazz]] replacing Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse Ventura's commentary on his WrestleMania match with Big John Studd. The video is hosted by [[Lord Alfred Hayes]]. Later matches, including his battles against Hulk Hogan while a heel, are not included on this VHS.

== Legacy ==
[[File:Big Show with Andre the Giant trophy.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Big Show]] – a wrestler often compared with Roussimoff due to his size – was the winner of the 2015 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at [[WrestleMania 31]], and is posing alongside the [[André the Giant Memorial Trophy]], which goes to the winner of the annual match.]]
* In 1993, when the then-World Wrestling Federation created the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]], André the Giant was the inaugural and sole inductee in the [[WWE Hall of Fame (1993)|class of 1993]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wwebio&quot; /&gt;
* Roussimoff was the inspiration for the [[1998 in film|1998 film]] ''[[My Giant]]'', written by his friend [[Billy Crystal]], whom he had met during the filming of ''The Princess Bride''.
* Paul Wight, better known as [[Big Show]], is more similar in body structure to Roussimoff than any other wrestler since Roussimoff's death. He was originally billed as the son of André during his stint in WCW (when he was known as simply &quot;the Giant&quot;) despite there being no biological relationship.{{sfnp|Krugman|2009|pp=341–342}} While also suffering from acromegaly, unlike Roussimoff, Wight did get surgery on his [[pituitary gland]] in the early 1990s, which successfully halted the progress of his condition. The former wrestler [[Jorge González (wrestler)|Giant González]] suffered from problems similar to those that Roussimoff had near the end of his life and died in 2010 due to [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] complications.
* In 1999, he was the subject of an episode of ''[[Biography (TV series)|A&amp;E Biography]]'', titled ''André the Giant: Larger Than Life''. The documentary covered his childhood and early life in France, as well as the beginning of his wrestling career, his struggles with acromegaly, his personal life, and his final years. His brother, Jacques Roussimoff, was interviewed for the documentary, as were fellow wrestling personalities [[Gorilla Monsoon]], [[Tim White (wrestling)|Tim White]], [[Arnold Skaaland]], [[Vince McMahon]], [[Freddie Blassie]], [[Killer Kowalski]], [[Rene Goulet]], and Frenchy Bernard, as well as wrestling historian Sheldon Goldberg. Several of his longtime hometown friends were interviewed as well. The documentary described Roussimoff as pro wrestling's &quot;first and only international attraction&quot; and that &quot;on his broad shoulders, wrestling rose from its status as a questionable sport to become big business, and some might argue, performance art.&quot;
* The [[Andre the Giant Has a Posse|Obey]] brand icon originated from wheatpaste posters that artist [[Shepard Fairey]] created based upon a photo of André the Giant that he had found in a newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/features/20071230-9999-mz1a30art.html |title=Social ferment not always reflected in fermentation of artworks |first=Robert L. |last=Pincus |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022111844/http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/features/20071230-9999-mz1a30art.html |archive-date=October 22, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Capcom]]'s video game character [[Hugo (Street Fighter)|Hugo]], from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series (known as Andore in the ''[[Final Fight]]'' series) is based on him.
* The 2014 graphic novel ''André The Giant: The Life and The Legend'' (First Second Books), written and drawn by [[Box Brown]], tells the story of his life and career. Research for the book included interviews with his fellow wrestlers and actors such as [[Christopher Guest]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and others.
* On the March 10, 2014, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', [[WrestleMania XXX]] host Hulk Hogan announced that in honor of Roussimoff's legacy, WWE was establishing the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, that would take place at the event, with the winner receiving the [[André the Giant Memorial Trophy]] (made in the likeness of Roussimoff).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2014-03-10/wwe-raw-results-26193637 |title=Raw results: Bryan occupies Raw and Triple H says 'YES!' ... with a twist |work=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 6, 2014, at WrestleMania XXX, [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] won the match after eliminating Big Show using a body slam similar to the body slam Hulk Hogan used on Roussimoff at WrestleMania III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/466849-and-the-winner-of-the-andre-the-giant-battle-royal-is |title=And the Winner of the Andre the Giant Battle Royal Is… |first=Nick |last=Paglino |date=April 6, 2014 |work=Wrestlezone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2016, it was announced that a movie based on the 2015 authorized graphic novel biography ''André the Giant: Closer to Heaven'' was in the plans made by Lion Forge Comics along with producers [[Scott Steindorff]], [[Dylan Russell]] and consulted by Roussimoff's daughter, Robin Christensen-Roussimoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/andre-the-giant-biopic-1201769286/|title=Andre The Giant Biopic in the Works (EXCLUSIVE)|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=May 9, 2016|work=Variety|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
