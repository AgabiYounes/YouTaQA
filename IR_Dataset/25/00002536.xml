'''Articolo 31''' was a band from [[Milan]], [[Italy]], formed in 1990 by [[J-Ax]] and DJ Jad, combining [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[funk]], pop and traditional Italian musical forms. They are one of the most popular Italian hip hop groups.

==Band history==
Articolo 31 were formed by rapper [[J-Ax]] (real name Alessandro Aleotti) and DJ Jad (Vito Luca Perrini).&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/articolo-31-mn0000933462/biography|title=Articolo 31 - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the spoken intro of the album ''Strade di Città'' (&quot;City Streets&quot;), it is stated that the band is named after the article of the [[Irish constitution]] guaranteeing freedom of the press, although article 31 of the Irish constitution is not about the freedom of the press. They probably meant the [[Censorship_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland#The_Troubles|Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act]].

Articolo 31 released one of the first Italian hip hop records, ''Strade di città'', in 1993.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; Soon, they signed with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Ricordi]] and started to mix rap with pop music - a move that earned them great commercial success but that alienated the underground hip hop scene, who perceived them as traitors.
In 1997, [[DJ Gruff]] dissed Articolo 31 in a track titled ''1 vs 2'' on the first album of the beatmaker Fritz da Cat,  starting a feud that would go on for years. 

In 2001, Articolo 31 collaborated with the American [[old school hip hop|old school]] rapper [[Kurtis Blow]] on the album ''XChé SI!''. In the same year, they made the film ''[[Senza filtro]]'' (in English, ''&quot;[[Without filter]]&quot;'').&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; Their producer was [[Franco Godi]], who also produced the music for the ''Signor Rossi'' animated series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fabio Bernabei|title=Hip Hop Italia: Il rap italiano dalla breakdance alle rapstar|publisher=Imprimatur editore, 2014|isbn=8868301709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their 2002 album ''Domani smetto'' represented a further departure from hip hop, increasingly relying on the formula of rapping over pop music samples.&lt;ref name=ajaa&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/j-ax-mn0002080046/biography|title=J-Ax - Biography &amp; History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of their songs rotate around the theme of soft drugs legalization in Italy (pointing strongly in favour).&lt;ref name=ajaa/&gt;

Following their 2003 album &quot;Italiano medio&quot;, the band took a break. Both J Ax and DJ Jad have been involved with solo projects. In 2006, the group declared an indefinite [[Recess (break)|hiatus]].&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

Their posse, ''[[Spaghetti Funk]]'', includes other popular performers like Space One and pop rappers [[Gemelli DiVersi]].
