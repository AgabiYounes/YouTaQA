The '''African National Congress''' ('''ANC''') is the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa's]] governing political party. It has been the ruling party of [[History of South Africa (1994–present)|post-apartheid South Africa]] since the election of [[Nelson Mandela]] in the [[1994 South African general election|1994 election]], winning every election since then. [[Cyril Ramaphosa]], the incumbent [[President of South Africa]], has served as leader of the ANC since 18 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/18/cyril-ramaphosa-chosen-to-lead-south-africas-ruling-anc-party|title=Cyril Ramaphosa chosen to lead South Africa's ruling ANC party|last=Burke|first=Jason|date=2017-12-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=19 December 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded on 8 January 1912 by [[John Langalibalele Dube]] in [[Bloemfontein]] as the '''South African Native National Congress (SANNC)''', its primary mission was to bring all Africans together as one people, to defend their rights and freedoms. This included giving full voting rights to [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|black South Africans]] and [[mixed-race South Africans]] and, from 1948 onwards, to end the system of [[apartheid]] introduced by the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist Party government]] after their election (by White voters only) in that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=African National Congress (ANC)|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/African-National-Congress|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC originally attempted to use non-violent protests to end apartheid; however, the [[Sharpeville massacre]] in March 1960, in which 69 black Africans were shot and killed by police and hundreds wounded during a peaceful protest, contributed to deteriorating relations with the South African government. On 8 April 1960, the administration of [[Charles Robberts Swart]] banned the ANC in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa Bans African National Congress|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/south-africa-bans-african-national-congress|website=African American Registry|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ban, the ANC formed the [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (Spear of the Nation) to fight against apartheid utilising [[guerrilla warfare]] and [[sabotage]].

After 30 years of exiled struggle, during which many ANC members had been imprisoned or forced abroad, the country began its move towards full democracy. On 3 February 1990, State President [[F. W. de Klerk]] lifted the ban on the ANC and released [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison on 11 February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ottaway|first1=David|title=S. Africa Lifts Ban on ANC, Other Groups|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/s_africa/stories/anc020390.htm|website=Washington Post|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 March 1992, the [[1992 South African apartheid referendum|apartheid referendum]] was passed by the white only electorate, removing apartheid and allowing the ANC to run in the 1994 election, which for the first time allowed all South Africans to vote for their national government. Since the 1994 election the ANC has performed better than 55% in all general elections, including the most recent [[2019 South African general election|2019 election]]. However the party has been embroiled in a number of controversies since 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the African National Congress}}
The founding of the SANNC was in direct response to injustice against [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|black South Africans]] at the hands of the government then in power. It can be said that the SANNC had its origins in a pronouncement by [[Pixley ka Isaka Seme]] who said in 1911, &quot;Forget all the past differences among Africans and unite in one national organisation.&quot; The SANNC was founded the following year on 8 January 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?include=docs/misc/2010/umzabalazo.html The African National Congress]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225042601/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?include=docs%2Fmisc%2F2010%2Fumzabalazo.html|date=25 February 2011}}. Anc.org.za. Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of the newly formed [[Union of South Africa]] began a systematic oppression of black people in South Africa. The [[Natives Land Act, 1913|Land Act]] was promulgated in 1913 forcing many black South Africans from their farms into the cities and towns to work, and to restrict their movement within South Africa.

By 1919, the SANNC was leading a campaign against passes (an ID which black South Africans had to possess). However, it then became dormant in the mid-1920s. During that time, black people were also represented by the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union|ICU]] and the previously white-only Communist party. In 1923, the organisation became the African National Congress, and in 1929 the ANC supported a militant mineworkers' strike.

By 1927, [[Josiah Tshangana Gumede|J.T. Gumede]] (president of the ANC) proposed co-operation with the Communists in a bid to revitalise the organisation, but he was voted out of power in the 1930s. This led to the ANC becoming largely ineffectual and inactive, until the mid-1940s when the ANC was remodelled as a mass movement.

The ANC responded to attacks on the rights of black South Africans, as well as calling for strikes, boycotts, and defiance. This led to a later [[Defiance Campaign]] in the 1950s, a mass movement of resistance to [[apartheid]]. The government tried to stop the ANC by banning party leaders and enacting new laws to stop the ANC, however these measures ultimately proved to be ineffective.

In 1955, the [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] officially adopted the [[Freedom Charter]], stating the core principles of the South African [[Congress Alliance]], which consisted of the African National Congress and its allies the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP), the [[South African Indian Congress]], the [[South African Congress of Democrats]] (COD) and the Coloured People's Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;pil-lut&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pillay|first=Gerald J.|title=Voices of Liberation: Albert Lutuli|year=1993|publisher=HSRC Press|isbn=0-7969-1356-0|pages=82–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government claimed that this was a communist document, and consequently leaders of the ANC and Congress were arrested. 1960 saw the [[Sharpeville massacre]], in which 69 people were killed when police opened fire on anti-apartheid protesters.

===uMkhonto we Sizwe===
{{main|uMkhonto we Sizwe}}
[[uMkhonto we Sizwe]] or MK, translated &quot;The Spear of the Nation&quot;, was the military wing of the ANC. Partly in response to the [[Sharpeville massacre]] of 1960, individual members of the ANC found it necessary to consider violence to combat what passive protests had failed to quell.

In co-operation with the [[South African Communist Party]], MK was founded in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/umkhonto-we-sizwe-mk SAhistory.org.za] Retrieved 26 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; MK commenced the military struggle against apartheid with acts of sabotage aimed at the installations of the state, and in the early stages was reluctant to target civilian targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv02424/04lv02730/05lv02918/06lv02925.htm|title=Documented proof of ANC's sabotage plans - The O'Malley Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MK was responsible for the deaths of both civilians and members of the military. Acts committed by MK include the [[Church Street bombing]], the [[Durban beach-front bombing|Magoo's Bar bombing]] and bombing a branch of the Standard Bank in Roodepoort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/magoo039s-bar-bombed Magoo's Bar is bombed, South African History Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC1983&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=1983: Car bomb in South Africa kills 16|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 March 2015|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/20/newsid_4326000/4326975.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/04/world/4-die-in-worst-south-africa-bombing-in-a-year.html 4 Die in Worst South Africa Bombing in a Year],''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 June 1988&lt;/ref&gt; It was integrated into the [[South African National Defence Force]] by 1994.&lt;!--Citations on [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] and [[South African National Defence Force]] pages.--&gt;

The ANC and its members were officially removed from the US terrorism watch list in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7484517.stm Mandela taken off US terror list], [[BBC News]], 1 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The ANC deems itself a force of national liberation in the post-apartheid era; it officially defines its agenda as the ''National Democratic Revolution''. The ANC is a member of the [[Socialist International]].&lt;ref name=socialistinternational/&gt; It also sets forth the redressing of socio-economic differences stemming from colonial- and apartheid-era policies as a central focus of ANC policy.

The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is described as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; a society in which people are intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using contour plots or [[Concentric objects|concentric circles]] the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out of the success of the NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include [[Joe Slovo]], [[Joel Netshitenzhe]] and [[Tshilidzi Marwala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Slovo|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/slovo/1988/national-democratic-revolution.htm|title=The South African Working Class and the National Democratic Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Joel|last=Netshitenzhe|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo25/tasks.html|title=Understanding the tasks of the moment|work=Umrabulo|volume=25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622025249/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pubs/umrabulo/umrabulo25/tasks.html|archivedate=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marwala|first=T|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2844|title=The anatomy of capital and the national democratic revolution|work=Umrabulo|volume=29|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018065656/http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=2844 |archivedate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the ANC declared itself to be a social democratic party.&lt;ref&gt;The Mail &amp; Guardian A-Z of South African Politics by Barbara Ludman, Paul Stober, and Ferial Haffagee&lt;/ref&gt;

The 53rd National Conference of the ANC, held in 2015, stated in its &quot;Discussion Document&quot; that &quot;China economic development trajectory remains a leading example of the triumph of humanity over adversity. The exemplary role of the collective leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] in this regard should be a guiding lodestar of our own struggle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.anc.org.za/docs/umrabulo/2015/ngc_disc_docsy.pdf |title=page 161 |access-date=27 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827210636/http://www.anc.org.za/docs/umrabulo/2015/ngc_disc_docsy.pdf |archive-date=27 August 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to state that &quot;The collapse of the [[Berlin Wall]] and socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern European States influenced our transition towards the negotiated political settlement in our country. The cause of events in the world changed tremendously in favour of the US led imperialism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.anc.org.za/docs/umrabulo/2015/ngc_disc_docsy.pdf |title=page 189 |access-date=27 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827210636/http://www.anc.org.za/docs/umrabulo/2015/ngc_disc_docsy.pdf |archive-date=27 August 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tripartite Alliance===
{{main|Tripartite Alliance}}
The ANC holds a historic alliance with the [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP) and [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]] (COSATU), known as the ''Tripartite Alliance''. The SACP and COSATU have not contested any election in South Africa, but field candidates through the ANC, hold senior positions in the ANC, and influence party policy and dialogue. During Mbeki's presidency, the government took a more pro-capitalist stance, often running counter to the demands of the SACP and COSATU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ever-fasternews.com/index.php?php_action=read_article&amp;article_id=397|title=ANC 'At Fork in the Road'|author=Paul Trewhela|date=8 May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205932/http://www.ever-fasternews.com/index.php?php_action=read_article&amp;article_id=397|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.disa.ukzn.ac.za/index.php?option=com_displaytei&amp;id=21131&amp;title=How%20the%20tripartite%20alliance%20works&amp;creator=|title=How the Tripartite Alliance works|work=Mayibuye|volume=2|year=1991|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=COSATU and the Tripartite Alliance since 1994|first=Dale|last=McKinley|work=Rethinking the Labour Movement in the 'New' South Africa|editor=T.

===2008 schism===
Following Zuma's accession to the ANC leadership in 2007 and Mbeki's resignation as president in 2008, a number of former ANC leaders led by [[Mosiuoa Lekota]] split away from the ANC to form the [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]].

===2013 NUMSA split from Cosatu===
On 20 December 2013, a special congress of the [[National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa]] (NUMSA), the country's biggest trade union with 338,000 members,&lt;ref name=NUMSA&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/world/africa/south-africas-biggest-union-pulls-support-for-anc.html|title=South Africa's Biggest Trade Union Pulls Its Support for A.N.C.|first=Lydia|last=Polgreen|date=20 December 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; voted to withdraw support from the ANC and SACP, and form a socialist party to protect the interests of the working class. NUMSA secretary general Irvin Jim condemned the ANC and SACP's support for big business and stated: &quot;It is clear that the working class cannot any longer see the ANC or the SACP as its class allies in any meaningful sense.&quot;&lt;ref name=NUMSA/&gt;

==ANC flag==
[[File:Flag of the African National Congress.svg|thumb|The ANC flag with three equal horizontal bands]]
The ANC flag comprises three equal horizontal stripes – black, green and gold. Black symbolises the native people of South Africa, green represents the land and gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/content/anc-logo-colours-and-flag|title=The Flag of the African National Congress|publisher= African National Congress|accessdate= 8 January 2017|quote=The flag of the ANC is made of equal horizontal bands of black, green and gold. The black symbolises the people of South Africa who, for generations, have fought for freedom. The green represents the land, which sustained our people for centuries and from which they were removed by colonial and apartheid governments. The gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of South Africa, which belongs to all its people, but which has been used to benefit only a small racial minority.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flag was also the [[War flag|battle flag]] of [[uMkhonto we Sizwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/kids/anc-logo-colours-and-flag|title=ANC logo, colours and flag {{!}} African National Congress|website=www.anc.org.za|language=en|access-date=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] used an unrelated but identical flag from 1813 to 1897.
The black, green and gold tricolor was also used on the flag of the [[KwaZulu]] [[bantustan]].

Although the colours of the new national [[Flag of South Africa]] since the transition from apartheid in 1994 have no official meaning, the three colours of the ANC flag were included in it, together with red, white and blue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chibba2014&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Fred Brownell and the creation of the South African flag |last=Chibba |first=Shamin |work=mediaclubsouthafrica.com |date=15 June 2014 |access-date=26 August 2018 |url= http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/democracy/3878-fred-brownell-and-the-creation-of-the-south-african-flag |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Party list==
Politicians in the party win a place in parliament by being on the ''Party List'', which is drawn up before the elections and enumerates, in order, the party's preferred MPs. The number of seats allocated is proportional to the popular national vote, and this determines the cut-off point.

The ANC has also gained members through the controversial [[floor crossing (South Africa)|floor crossing]] process.

Although most South African parties announced their candidate list for provincial premierships in the 2009 election, the ANC did not, as it is not required for parties to do so.&lt;ref&gt;James Myburgh [http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71619?oid=120071&amp;sn=Detail The ANC's secret premier candidates]. Politicsweb.co.za. 6 March 2009. Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''ANC Today''==
In 2001, the ANC launched an online weekly web-based [[newsletter]], ''ANC Today – Online Voice of the African National Congress'' to offset the alleged bias of the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fourie|first=Pieter J.|year=2008|title=Media Studies Volume 2: Policy, management and media representation|edition=second|publisher=Juta and Company|location=Cape Town|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=7531OTEpD_wC&amp;pg=PA44 44]|isbn=978-0-7021-7675-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists mainly of updates on current programmes and initiatives of the ANC.

==Role of the ANC in resolving the conflict==
[[File:Old ANC logo 1990.svg|right|thumb|150px|Old logo of the ANC from 1990]]
The ANC represented the main opposition to the government during [[apartheid]] and therefore they played a major role in resolving the conflict through participating in the peacemaking and peace-building processes. Initially intelligence agents of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] met in secret with ANC leaders, including Nelson Mandela, to judge whether conflict resolution was possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-226016/apartheid apartheid] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220054317/http://student.britannica.com/comptons/article-226016/apartheid |date=20 December 2008 }}. Student.britannica.com (8 May 1996). Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions and negotiations took place leading to the eventual unbanning of the ANC and other opposing political parties by then President [[F. W. de Klerk|de Klerk]] on 2 February 1990.

The next official step towards rebuilding South Africa was the Groote Schuur Minute where the government and the ANC agreed on a common commitment towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and intimidation, as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations. The ANC negotiated the release of political prisoners and the indemnity from prosecution for returning exiles and moreover channels of communication were established between the Government and the ANC.

Later the Pretoria Minute represented another step towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards setting up an interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC – the Umkhonto we Sizwe. This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa. Another agreement that came out of the Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that a new way of governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However, violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.&lt;ref name=concise&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof00ross|url-access=registration|first=Robert|last=Ross|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next significant steps towards resolution were the Repeal of the Population Registration Act, the repeal of the Group Areas and the Native Land Acts and a catch-all [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed.&lt;ref name=concise/&gt; These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.

In December 1991 the Convention for a Democratic South Africa ([[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|CODESA]]) was held with the aim of establishing an interim government. However, a few months later in June 1992 the [[Boipatong massacre]] occurred and all negotiations crumbled as the ANC pulled out. After this negotiations proceeded between two agents, [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] of the ANC, and [[Roelf Meyer]] of the National Party. In over 40 sessions the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system, the fate of over 40,000 government employees and if/how the country would be divided. The result of these negotiations was an interim constitution that meant the transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that the rule of law and state sovereignty remained intact during the transition, which was vital for stability within the country. A date was set for the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994.&lt;ref name=concise/&gt; The ANC won 62.5% of the votes and has been in power ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanhistory.about.com/od/apartheidfaq/f/HowEnded.htm Apartheid FAQ: When Did Apartheid End?].

==Criticism and controversy==

===Corruption controversies===
{{details|South African Arms Deal}}
The most prominent corruption case involving the ANC relates to a series of bribes paid to companies involved in the ongoing R55 billion [[South African Arms Deal|Arms Deal saga]], which resulted in a long term jail sentence to then Deputy President [[Jacob Zuma]]'s legal adviser [[Schabir Shaik]]. Zuma, the former South African President, was charged with fraud, bribery and corruption in the Arms Deal, but the charges were subsequently withdrawn by the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa due to their delay in prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pretorianews.co.za/?fSectionId=&amp;fArticleId=vn20081009055615571C284334|date=9 October 2008|title=Opposition hails challenge to ANC rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ANC has also been criticised for its subsequent abolition of the [[Scorpions (South Africa)|Scorpions]], the multidisciplinary agency that investigated and prosecuted organised crime and corruption, and was heavily involved in the investigation into Zuma and Shaik. Tony Yengeni, in his position as chief whip of the ANC and head of the Parliaments defence committee has recently been named as being involved in bribing the German company [[ThyssenKrupp]] over the purchase of four corvettes for the SANDF.

Other recent corruption issues include the sexual misconduct and criminal charges of [[Beaufort West Local Municipality|Beaufort West]] municipal manager [[Truman Prince]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,,2-7-1442_1700232,00.html|title=Action against Prince 'a farce'|date=5 May 2005|first=Ronel|last=Bester|work=[[Die Burger]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507032712/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0%2C%2C2-7-1442_1700232%2C00.html|archivedate=7 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Oilgate]] scandal, in which millions of Rand in funds from a state-owned company were funnelled into ANC coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Special Report: Oilgate|url=http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=oilgate|work=Mail &amp; Guardian |accessdate=27 April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814083114/http://www.mg.co.za/specialreport.aspx?area=oilgate|archivedate=14 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ANC has also been accused of using government and civil society to fight its political battles against opposition parties such as the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]. The result has been a number of complaints and allegations that none of the political parties truly represent the interests of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=vn20080220113540685C199776|title=DA councillor's role in Delft is 'criminal'|work=Cape Argus|date=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capeargus.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=3571&amp;fArticleId=vn20080228113641490C401174|title=DA's Delft councillor denies claims|work=Cape Argus|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in the &quot;No Land! No House! No Vote!&quot; Campaign which became very prominent during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009|title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009|date=5 May 2005|work=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antieviction.org.za/2005/12/12/indymedia-presents-no-land-no-house-no-vote/|title=IndyMedia Presents: No Land!

In 2018, the ''New York Times'' reported on the killings of ANC corruption whistleblowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Norimitsu Onishi |last2=Selam Gebrekidan |title=Hit Men and Power: South Africa's Leaders Are Killing One Another |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/world/africa/south-africa-anc-killings.html?stream=world |accessdate=2 October 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=30 September 2018 |quote=&quot;If you understand the Cosa Nostra, you don't only kill the person, but you also send a strong message,&quot; said Thabiso Zulu, another A.N.C. whistle-blower who, fearing for his life, is now in hiding.  &quot;We broke the rule of omertà,&quot; he added, saying that the party of Nelson Mandela had become like the Mafia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condemnation over Secrecy Bill===
{{further|Protection of State Information Bill}}
In late 2011 the ANC was heavily criticised over the passage of the [[Protection of State Information Bill]], which opponents claimed would improperly restrict the [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Charl|last=du Plessis|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2011/11/22/secrecy-bill-opposition-reaching-fever-pitch|title=Secrecy bill opposition reaching fever pitch|date=22 November 2011|work=Times Live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the bill included otherwise ANC-aligned groups such as [[Congress of South African Trade Unions|COSATU]]. Notably, [[Nelson Mandela]] and other Nobel laureates [[Nadine Gordimer]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], and [[F. W. de Klerk]] have expressed disappointment with the bill for not meeting standards of constitutionality and aspirations for freedom of information and expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/11/22/mandelas-office-comments-on-s-africas-secrecy-bill.html|title=Mandela's office comments on S Africa's secrecy bill|date=22 November 2011 |author=AFP|work=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the Marikana killings===
{{further|Marikana miners' strike}}
The ANC have been criticised for its role in failing to prevent 16 August 2012 massacre of Lonmin miners at Marikana in the North West. Some allege that Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega and Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa, a close confidant of Jacob Zuma, may have given the go ahead for the police action against the miners on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/companies/who-gave-permission-to-kill-bizos-1.1408535#.UIbgQxLJX_g|title=Who gave permission to kill?: Bizos|date=22 October 2012|publisher=IOL|work=Business Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioner Phiyega of the ANC came under further criticism as being insensitive and uncaring when she was caught smiling and laughing during the Farlam Commission's video playback of the 'massacre'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-10-24-marikana-families-horrified-at-phiyegas-behaviour|title=Marikana families horrified at Phiyegas behaviour|date=24 October 2012|publisher=M&amp;G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] has announced that he no longer can bring himself to exercise a vote for the ANC as it is no longer the party that he and Nelson Mandela fought for, and that the party has now lost its way, and is in danger of becoming a corrupt entity in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=Desmond Tutu: why I won't vote ANC|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/25/desmond-tutu-mandela-wont-vote-anc|work=The Guardian|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional failures===
The ANC has a growing list of constitutional failures. One of the most prominent relates to president of the ANC and of the Republic, [[Jacob Zuma]], and his [[Nkandla (homestead)|Nkandla homestead's]] security upgrades, valued at around R250 million. His swimming pool, for example, was termed a 'fire pool' and his amphitheatre an 'emergency meeting point', thus leaving the taxpayer to carry the costs. After the [[Public Protector]] released her report (Secure in Comfort) which found that Zuma must pay back the money spent on the non-security features, he refused to do so. In 2016 the Constitutional Court ruled that Zuma, as well as the National Assembly, had &quot;breached the Constitution&quot; and failed to uphold it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thamm|first1=Marianne|title=Nkandla ConCourt ruling: President Zuma and National Assembly in breach of Constitution|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-03-31-nkandla-concourt-ruling-president-zuma-and-national-assembly-in-breach-of-constitution/#.WRwsiVP5iRv|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuma apologised to the nation as follows: &quot;The matter has caused a lot of frustration and confusion for which I apologise on my behalf and on behalf of government.&quot; However he claimed not to have asked nor known about the non-security upgrades, despite the media reporting on them almost daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Michelle|title=Zuma apologises to the nation for Nkandla|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-04-01-zuma-on-nkandla-i-apologise0|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualification fraud===
{{POV|date=October 2019}}
There is also a growing trend for ANC members as well as those individuals appointed by the ANC to public positions of power to misrepresent their qualifications. The result of such lies typically lead to those appointed being unable to fulfill their obligations while being paid very large salaries, and typically cost the taxpayer large amount of money while attempting to defend themselves in court. A small selection follows:

[[Carl Niehaus]], who served as ANC speaker, claimed to have a B.A., Masters and Doctorate degrees; in reality he never received the Masters or Doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The dodgy CV of Carl Niehaus|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/the-dodgy-cv-of-carl-niehaus|accessdate=17 May 2017|publisher=PoliticsWeb|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pallo Jordan]], who served as Minister of Arts and Culture claimed to be in possession of a PhD, when in reality he has no tertiary education at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Van Onselen|first1=Gareth|title=Pallo Jordan's phantom doctorate|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2014/08/04/Pallo-Jordans-phantom-doctorate|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Mtimkulu, who was employed as chief engineer at [[Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa]] (Prasa) claimed to have a PhD in engineering, which was a lie; he was merely qualified as an engineering technician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alberts|first1=Anton|title=PRASA's Daniel Mtimkulu only an engineering technologist - Anton Alberts|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politics/prasas-daniel-mtimkulu-only-an-engineering-technol|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mtimkulu's leadership, Prasa ordered 70 new locomotives, valued at R3.5 billion. The first 13 Afro 4000 diesel locomotives to arrive, at a cost of R600 million, were too tall to be of use on their intended routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Africa's R600 million train blunder|url=https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/92424/south-africas-r600-million-train-blunder/|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen Tshabalala]], former chairperson of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC), claimed to have a BComm degree. In reality her marks were so poor that she was not allowed to rewrite some of her exams. She later claimed that her degree certificate was stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Presence|first1=Chantall|title=Unisa reveals SABC chair Ellen Tshabalala's dismal marks|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2014-12-03-unisa-reveals-sabc-chair-ellen-tshabalalas-dismal-marks|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending Tshabalala in court cost the SABC more than R1 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;politicsweb.co.za&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Gavin|title=Motsoeneng &amp; Tshabalala should pay their own legal fees|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/motsoeneng--tshabalala-should-pay-their-own-legal-|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hlaudi Motsoeneng]], former COO of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] lied about being in possession of a Matric certificate. By his own admission, he simply invented marks for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sithole|first1=Sthembiso|last2=Dawjee|first2=Haji Mohamed|title=Matric-less Motsoeneng waxes lyrical about matric certificates|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2015-01-06-matric-less-motsoeneng-waxes-lyrical-about-matric-certificate|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed by Ellen Tshabalala, and his various court cases have cost the SABC more than R1.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;politicsweb.co.za&quot;/&gt; Further, under Motsoeneng's reign, the broadcaster recorded a net loss of R411 million in the 2015/16 financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Regter|first1=Shimoney|title=CONTINUOUS ATTACKS ON SABC AFFECTING FINANCES|url=http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/16/continuous-attacks-on-sabc-affecting-finances|accessdate=17 May 2017|date=15 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dudu Myeni]], chairperson of [[South African Airways]] (SAA) and good friend of Jacob Zuma, claimed to have a Bachelor's degree in administration. This was proven false.

[[Sicelo Shiceka]], Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs lied about being in possession of a Master's degree.

===Racism===
A 2016 statement issued by Zizi Kodwa, the ANC National Spokesperson states that &quot;[t]he ANC rejects these [racist] comments with the contempt they deserve and calls on all South Africans to join in the rejection of all racists in our country, wherever they are. It is sad that well meaning South Africans have to contend with this backward attitude.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kodwa|first1=Zizi|title=Statement on racist comments|url=http://www.anc.org.za/content/statement-racist-comments|website=ANC Official Website|accessdate=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In support of this statement, the ANC has publicly called for legal action to be taken against whites who have publicly made racist comments against blacks, usually through social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANC lays charges against racist guesthouse owner|url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/anc-lays-charges-against-racist-guesthouse-owner|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=Africa News Agency|publisher=ENCA|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bernardo|first1=Carla|title=ANC to lay charges against racist South Africans|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-01-05-anc-to-lay-charges-against-racist-south-africans|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=African News Agency|work=Mail and Guardian|date=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penny Sparrow is one such high-profile case. She posted the following through her Facebook account:&lt;blockquote&gt;These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year's eve and New Year's day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I'm sorry to say that I was among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don't want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Jenni|title=Penny Sparrow back in court on criminal charges for racist comments|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/penny-sparrow-back-in-court-on-criminal-charges-for-racist-comments-20160912|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=News24|work=City Press|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sparrow pleaded guilty to crimen injuria, and was presented with a choice of either paying a R5,000 fine or 12 months in jail, in addition to paying the legal fees incurred by the ANC, who brought the matter to court. In a separate instance, she was also ordered to pay R150,000 to the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penny Sparrow pleads guilty to crimen injuria|url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/penny-sparrow-pleads-guilty-to-crimen-injuria|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=ENCA|date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the ANC's swift and decisive action towards Sparrow and other white racists, they have mostly ignored racist comments voiced by blacks, in particular ANC members. For example, Kenny Barrel Nkosi, an ANC ward councillor (Govan Mbeki Municipality, Mpumalanga) posted the following on his Facebook account: &quot;The first people that need to fokkof [fuck off] are whites, cubans never oppressed us. these are our true friends they were there in the times on needs. welcom cdes welcome [sic]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korb|first1=Louise|title=Whites must f***off – ANC councillor|url=http://citizen.co.za/news/419775/whites-must-foff-anc-councillor/|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=The Citizen|date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality issued the following statement: &quot;The matter has been investigated and at the time of the comment, the ward councillor was not representing the views of either the ANC or the Govan Mbeki Municipality, but merely as a personal opinion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobs|first1=Gerhard|title=Mpumulanga municipality defends &quot;whites must f**koff&quot; comment from ANC councillor|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/mpumulanga-municipality-defends-whites-must-fkoff-comment-from-anc-councillor/|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=The South African|date=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No further action was taken.

At a [[Gupta family]] wedding held at [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] in 2013, various incidents of racism occurred. The family made clear that they wanted only white workers, including waiters, security, bar staff and cleaning staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartley|first1=Aziz|title=Guptas' guests weren't racist - Sun City|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/guptas-guests-werent-racist---sun-city-1512764|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=Cape Times|publisher=IOL|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black workers were told to wash before they interacted with guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Wash first, blacks'|url=http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Wash-first-blacks-20150429|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=City Press|date=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations were denied by the Gupta family. Nonetheless, in the Gupta e-mail leak of 2017 these allegations were shown to be correct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Maverick&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Scorpio and amaBhungane #GuptaLeaks: Emails offer further proof of Gupta racist attitudes|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2017-06-09-scorpio-and-amabhungane-guptaleaks-emails-offer-further-proof-of-gupta-racist-attitudes/#.WTpdtxP5gWo|accessdate=9 June 2017|agency=SCORPIO and AMABHUNGANE|work=Daily Maverick|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the e-mails also make clear that a black worker was called a monkey by a member of the Gupta family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Maverick&quot;/&gt; That the Gupta family is a large, vocal and powerful supporter of the ANC and a personal friend of Jacob Zuma, may explain why no action was taken against them with regards to racism.

[[Lindiwe Sisulu]], ANC member and Minister of Defence and Military Veterans (who demanded that the Estate Agency Affairs Board report to her regarding action taken against Sparrow) called the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] leader, Mmusi Maimane, a &quot;hired native&quot;. Ironically – due to the fact that Chris Hart, prominent economist and investment strategist at [[Standard Bank]], was forced to resign for his racist tweet stating that &quot;[m]ore than 25 years after Apartheid ended, the victims are increasing along with a sense of entitlement and hatred towards minorities….&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Standard Bank's Chris Hart resigns|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-03-15-standard-banks-chris-hart-resigns|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=African News Agency|work=Mail and Guardian|date=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Sisulu said the following, while discussing the 2.3 million housing backlog: &quot;What makes an 18-year-old think the state owes them a house? It's a culture of entitlement … we can't continue with a dependency culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ngwenya|first1=Gwen|title='Racist' black South Africans who kept their jobs?|url=http://thoughtleader.co.za/amandangwenya/2016/01/07/racist-black-south-africans-who-kept-their-jobs%E2%80%A8/|work=Mail and Guardian|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No action has been taken against Sisulu.

[[Lulama Xingwana|Lulu Xingwana]], former ANC Minister of Women, Children and People with Disabilities, stated that &quot;[y]oung Afrikaner men are brought up in the Calvinist religion believing that they own a woman, they own a child, they own everything and therefore they can take that life because they own it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roets|first1=Ernst|title=Anti-white racism in South Africa|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/opinion/antiwhite-racism-in-south-africa|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=PoliticsWeb|date=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister apologised, and no further action was taken against her.

Jimmy Manyi, ANC director general of labour and later ANC spokesperson, is quotes as saying the following on a TV interview: &quot;I think its very important for [[Coloureds|coloured]] people in this country to understand that South Africa belongs to them in totality, not just the Western Cape. So this over-concentration of coloureds in the Western Cape is not working for them. They should spread in the rest of the country ... so they must stop this over-concentration situation because they are in over-supply where they are so you must look into the country and see where you can meet the supply.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manyi: 'Over-supply' of coloureds in Western Cape|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2011-02-24-coloureds-overconcentrated-in-wcape-says-manyi|accessdate=30 May 2017|agency=SAPA-AFP|work=Mail and Guardian|date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; No action has been taken against Manyi.

[[Julius Malema]], former [[African National Congress Youth League|ANCYL]] leader and current [[Economic Freedom Fighters|EFF]] leader, stated at a political rally in 2016 that &quot;We [the EFF] are not calling for the slaughter of white people‚ at least for now&quot;. When asked for comment by a news agency, the ANC spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa stated that there will be no comment from the ANC, as &quot;[h]e [Malema] was addressing his own party supporters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malema slammed for comments on whites|url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/malema-%E2%80%98slaughter-statement%E2%80%99-rocks-sa|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=ENCA|date=8 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417053045/http://www.enca.com/south-africa/malema-%E2%80%98slaughter-statement%E2%80%99-rocks-sa|archive-date=17 April 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still the ANCYL leader, Malema was taken to the [[Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000|Equality Court]] by [[AfriForum]] for repeatedly singing &quot;[[dubul' ibhunu]]&quot;, which translate as &quot;shoot the boer [white farmer]&quot;. The ANC supported Malema, though AfriForum and the ANC reached a settlement before the appeal case was due to be argued in the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]].

In partial response to the Penny Sparrow case, Velaphi Khumalo, while working for the Department of Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation, posted the following on his Facebook account:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I want to cleans this country of all white people. we must act as Hitler did to the Jews. I don't believe any more that the is a large number of not so racist whit people. I'm starting to be sceptical even of those within our Movement the ANC. I will from today unfriend all white people I have as friends from today u must be put under the same blanket as any other racist white because secretly u all are a bunch of racist fuck heads. as we have already seen 
[all sic].&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He also posted:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Noo seriously though u oppressed us when u were a minority and then manje u call us monkeys and we supposed to let it slide . white people in south Africa deserve to be hacked and killed like Jews. U have the same venom moss . look at [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] . noo u must be bushed alive and skinned and your off springs used as garden fertiliser [all sic]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Citizen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title='Kill whites like Jews' man back at work – report|url=http://citizen.co.za/news/news-national/1203433/kill-whites-like-jews-man-back-at-work-report/|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=The Citizen|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation responded with a statement wherein it &quot;views the hateful post by Velaphi Khumalo in a serious light. Our key mandate is nation-building and social cohesion. His sentiments take our country backwards and do not reflect what the Gauteng provincial government stands for.&quot; Khumalo was suspended on full pay while an investigation was undertaken, was found to be guilty by an internal disciplinary procedure, and issued with a warning, whereafter he resumed his work at the department.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Citizen&quot;/&gt;

Esethu Hasane, Media and Communication Manager for the Department of Sport and Recreation tweeted the following during the severe droughts in the Western cape in 2017: &quot;Only Western Cape still has dry dams. Please God, we have black people there, choose another way of punishing white people.&quot; Despite calls for his dismissal, no action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kriel|first1=Kallie|title=Mbalula should sack Esethu Hasane for racist tweet - AfriForum|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/news-and-analysis/mbalula-should-sack-esethu-hasane-for-racist-tweet|accessdate=30 May 2017|publisher=PoliticsWeb|date=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
