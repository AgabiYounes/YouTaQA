'''Arnulf of Carinthia''' ({{circa}} 850 – December 8, 899) was the [[Duchy of Carinthia|duke of Carinthia]] who overthrew his uncle, Emperor [[Charles the Fat]], became the [[Carolingian]] king of [[East Francia]]&lt;ref&gt;East Francia had been split from the rest of [[Frankish Realm]] by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843. It evolved into [[Holy Roman Empire]] after end of Carolingian rule.&lt;/ref&gt; from 887, the disputed [[King of Italy]] from 894 and the disputed [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from February 22, 896 until his death at [[Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]].

==Early life==
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}
===Illegitimacy and early life===
Arnulf was the illegitimate son of [[Carloman of Bavaria]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Jim. ''The Capetians: Kings of France 987-1328''. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2007. p 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDougall, Sara. ''Royal Bastards: The Birth of Illegitimacy, 800-1230''. Oxford University Press, 2017. p 91&lt;/ref&gt; and Liutswind,&lt;ref&gt;Also Litwinde or Litwindie&lt;/ref&gt; who may have been the sister of Ernst, Count of the Bavarian [[Nordgau (Bavaria)|Nordgau Margraviate]] in the area of the [[Upper Palatinate]], or perhaps the burgrave of [[Passau]], according to other sources. After Arnulf's birth, Carloman married, before 861, a daughter of that same Count Ernst, who died after 8 August 879. As it is mainly West-Franconian historiography&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manfred-hiebl.de/mittelalter-genealogie/karolinger_ostfraenkische_linie/karlmann_ostfraenkischer_koenig_880.html Konecny, Silvia. ''Die Frauen des karolingischen Königshauses. Die politische Bedeutung der Ehe und die Stellung der Frau in der fränkischen Herrscherfamilie vom 7. bis zum 10. Jahrhundert.'' PhD thesis Vienna 1976, p. 139]&lt;/ref&gt; that speaks of Arnulf's illegitimacy, it is quite possible that the two females are actually one and the same person and that Carloman married Arnulf's mother, thus legitimizing his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/karolinger_ostfraenkische_linie/luitswinda_mutter_kaiser_arnulfs_891.html Mediaeval Genealogy: Liutswind:] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030902183355/http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/karolinger_ostfraenkische_linie/luitswinda_mutter_kaiser_arnulfs_891.html |date=September 2, 2003 }} Various theories about her descent and her relation to Carloman (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf was granted the rule over the [[Duchy of Carinthia]], a Frankish vassal state and successor of the ancient [[Carantania|Principality of Carantania]] by his father [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], after Carloman reconciled with his own father, king [[Louis the German]] and was made king in [[Duchy of Bavaria]].

Arnulf spent his childhood in ''Mosaburch'' or Mosapurc, which is widely believed to be [[Moosburg, Austria|Moosburg]] in Carinthia, a few miles away from one of the Imperial residences, the Carolingian [[Kaiserpfalz]]  at [[Zollfeld|Karnburg]] (Krnski grad), which had been the residence of the Carantanian princes. Arnulf kept his seat here and from later events it may be inferred that the Carantanians, from an early time, treated him as their own Duke. Later, after he had been crowned King of East Francia, Arnulf turned his old territory of Carinthia into the [[March of Carinthia]], a part of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]].

===Regional ruler===
After King Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke in 879, [[Louis the Younger]] inherited Bavaria, [[Charles the Fat]] was given the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and Arnulf was confirmed in Carinthia by an agreement with Carloman. However, Bavaria was more or less ruled by Arnulf.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy (trans.) The Annals of Fulda. (Manchester Medieval series, Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II.) Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1992. 882 (p. 104 and n3)&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf already ruled Bavaria during the summer and autumn of 879 while his father arranged his succession and he himself was granted &quot;Pannonia,&quot; in the words of the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy (trans.) The Annals of Fulda. (Manchester Medieval series, Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II.) Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1992. 884 (pp 108–111)&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Carantanum,&quot; in the words of [[Regino of Prüm]].&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Simon. Kingship and Politics in the Late Ninth Century: Charles the Fat and the end of the Carolingian Empire. Cambridge University Press: 2003. pg. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The division of the realm was confirmed in 880 after Carloman's death.

When [[Engelschalk II]] of Pannonia in 882 rebelled against [[Aribo of Austria|Aribo]], [[March of Pannonia|Margrave of Pannonia]] and ignited the [[Wilhelminer War]], Arnulf supported him and accepted his and his brother's homage. This ruined Arnulf's relationship with his uncle the Emperor and put him at war with [[Svatopluk of Moravia]]. [[Pannonia]] was invaded, but Arnulf refused to give up the young Wilhelminers. Arnulf did not make peace with Svatopluk until late 885, by which time Moravian ruler was loyal to the emperor. Some scholars see this war as destroying Arnulf's hopes at succeeding Charles the Fat.

==King of East Francia==
Arnulf took the leading role in the deposition of his uncle, [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles the Fat]]. With the support of the Frankish nobles, Arnulf called a [[diet (assembly)|Diet]] at [[Trebur|Tribur]] and deposed Charles in November 887, under threat of military action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 78&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann III, pg. 376&quot;&gt;Mann III, pg. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Charles peacefully agreed to this involuntary retirement, but not without first chastising his nephew for his treachery and asking for a few royal villas in [[Swabia]], which Arnulf granted him,&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; on which to live out his final months.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Arnulf, having distinguished himself in the war against the [[Slavs]], was then elected king by the nobles of East Francia (only the eastern realm, though Charles had ruled the whole of the Frankish Empire).&lt;ref&gt;Comyn, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt; [[West Francia]], the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] and the Kingdom of Italy at this point elected their own kings from the Carolingian family.

Like all early Germanic rulers, he was heavily involved in [[ecclesiastical]] disputes. In 895, at the Diet of Tribur, he presided over a dispute between the [[Episcopal see]]s of [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Cologne]] over jurisdictional authority, which saw [[Hamburg-Bremen|Bremen and Hamburg]] remain a combined see, independent of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|see of Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf was a fighter, not a negotiator. In 890 he was successfully battling Slavs in Pannonia.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In early/mid-891, [[Vikings]]  invaded Lotharingia,&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and crushed an East Frankish army at [[Maastricht]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 20&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Terms such as &quot;Vikings&quot;, &quot;Danes&quot;, &quot;Northmen&quot; and &quot;Norwegians&quot; have been used loosely and interchangeably to describe these invaders.&lt;ref&gt;Arnulf's opponents in 890 have sometimes been described as  &quot;[[Normans]]&quot;, although the term has become more strongly associated with the Scandinavians that were allies of West Francia from 911 and settled in the [[Duchy of Normandy]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the subsequent [[Battle of Leuven (891)|Battle of Leuven]] (September 891), in [[Lotharingia]], Arnulf repelled the Vikings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 20&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and essentially ended their attacks on that front.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' report that there were so many dead Northmen that their bodies blocked the run of the river. After this victory Arnulf built a new [[castle]] on an island in the [[Dijle]] river (Dutch: Dijle, English and French: Dyle).&lt;ref&gt;[[Latin]] ''Luvanium'', local ''Lovon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intervention in West Francia===
Arnulf took advantage of the problems in [[West Francia]] after the death of Charles the Fat to secure the territory of [[Lotharingia]], which he converted into a kingdom for his son [[Zwentibold]].&lt;ref&gt;Comyn, pg. 82&lt;/ref&gt; In 889 Arnulf supported the claim of [[Louis the Blind]] to the [[Lower Burgundy|kingdom of Provence]], after receiving a personal appeal from Louis' mother, [[Ermengard of Italy|Ermengard]], who came to see Arnulf at [[Forchheim]] in May 889.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 382&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognising the superiority of Arnulf's position, in 888 king [[Odo of France]] formally accepted the suzerainty of Arnulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. xxxv&quot;&gt;Bryce, pg. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; In 893 Arnulf switched his support from Odo to [[Charles the Simple]] after being persuaded by [[Fulk, Archbishop of Reims]], that it was in his best interests.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf then took advantage of the following fighting between Odo and Charles in 894, taking more territory from West Francia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 56&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Charles the Simple was forced to flee to Arnulf and ask for his protection.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt; His intervention soon forced [[Pope Formosus]] to get involved, as he was worried that a divided and war weary West Francia would be easy prey for the [[Vikings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 56&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 895 Arnulf summoned both Charles and Odo to his residence at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. Charles's advisers convinced him not to go, and he sent a representative in his place. Odo, on the other hand, personally attended, together with a large retinue, bearing many gifts for Arnulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Angered by the non-appearance of Charles, he welcomed Odo at the Diet of Worms in May 895, and again supported Odo's claim to the throne of West Francia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt; In the same assembly he crowned his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]] as the king of Lotharingia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars with Moravia===
As early as 880 Arnulf had designs on [[Great Moravia]], and had the Frankish bishop [[Wiching]] of [[Nitra]] interfere with the missionary activities of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] priest [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]], with the aim of preventing any potential for creating a unified Moravian state.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold communicated political relations with the ruler of the  [[Great Moravia|Moravian]] Kingdom [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk]], and learned military and political secrets of Svatopluk. Later were used these tactics to occupy the territory of the Greater Moravian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/ebce.2018.8.issue-1/ebce-2018-0007/ebce-2018-0007.pdf|title=Ethics and politics of Great Moravia of the 9th century Vasil Gluchman|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf failed to conquer the whole of Great Moravia in wars of 892, 893, and 899. Yet Arnulf did achieve some successes, in particular in 895, when [[Duchy of Bohemia]] broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal state. An accord was reached between him and [[Duke of Bohemia]] [[Borivoj I of Bohemia|Borivoj I]] (reigned 870-95). Bohemia was thus freed from the dangers of Frankish invasion. In 893 or 894 Great Moravia probably lost a part of its territory — present-day Western [[Hungary]] — to him. As a reward, Wiching became Arnulf's [[chancellor]] in 892.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, III, pg. 244&lt;/ref&gt; In his attempts to conquer Moravia, in 899 Arnulf reached out to [[Magyars]] who had settled in [[Pannonia]], and with their help he imposed a measure of control over Moravia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 83&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 83&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor==

In Italy [[Guy III of Spoleto]] and [[Berengar of Friuli]] fought over the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]. Berengar had been crowned king in 887, but Guy was then crowned in 889. While [[Pope Stephen V]] supported Guy, even crowning him [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 891, Arnulf threw his support behind Berengar.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

In 893 the new [[Pope Formosus]], not trusting the newly crowned co-emperors [[Guy III of Spoleto]] and his son [[Lambert II of Spoleto]], sent an embassy to [[Omuntesberch]], where Arnulf was meeting with [[Svatopluk I of Moravia]],&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 379&lt;/ref&gt; to request that Arnulf come and liberate [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt; where he would be crowned emperor in [[Rome]]. Arnulf met the ''Primores'' of the Kingdom of Italy, dismissed them with gifts and promised to assist the pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf then sent his son [[Zwentibold]] with a Bavarian army to join [[Berengar of Friuli]]. They defeated Guy, but were bought off and left in autumn.

When pope Formosus again asked Arnulf to invade, the duke personally led an army across the [[Alps]] early in 894. In January 894 [[Bergamo]] fell, and Count Ambrose, Guy's representative in the city, was hung from a tree by the city's gates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot; /&gt; Conquering all of the territory north of the [[Po River]], Arnulf forced the surrender of [[Milan]] and then drove Guy out of [[Pavia]], where he was crowned [[King of Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. xxxv&quot; /&gt; Arnulf went no further before Guy died suddenly in late autumn, and a fever incapacitated his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt; His march northward through the [[Alps]] was interrupted by [[Rudolph I of Burgundy]], and it was only with great difficulty that Arnulf crossed the mountain range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, Arnulf ordered his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]] to ravage Rudolph's kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, Lambert and his mother [[Ageltrude]] travelled to Rome to receive papal confirmation of his imperial succession, but when pope Formosus, still desiring to crown Arnulf, refused, he was imprisoned in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].

In September 895 a new papal embassy arrived in [[Regensburg]] beseeching Arnulf's aid. In October Arnulf undertook his second campaign into Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  He crossed the Alps quickly and again, took [[Pavia]], but then he continued slowly, garnering support among the nobility of [[Tuscany]]. First [[Maginulf, Count of Milan]], and then [[Walfred of Friuli]], joined him. Eventually even [[Adalbert II of Tuscany]] abandoned Lambert. Finding Rome locked against him and held by Ageltrude,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf had to take the city by force on February 21, 896, freeing the pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf was then greeted at the [[Ponte Milvio]] by the [[Roman Senate]] who escorted him into the [[Leonine City]], where he was received by Pope Formosus on the steps of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles|Santi Apostoli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, 896 Formosus led the king into the church of St. Peter, anointed and crowned him as emperor, and saluted him as ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Fulda'', an. 896&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf then proceeded to the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], where he received the homage of the Roman people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt; who swore &quot;never to hand over the city to Lambert or his mother Ageltrude&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf then proceeded to exile to Bavaria two leading senators, Constantine and Stephen, who had helped Ageltrude to seize Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaving one of his vassals, Farold, to hold Rome, two weeks later Arnulf marched on [[Spoleto]], where Ageltrude had fled to join Lambert,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt; but now Arnulf suffered a stroke, forcing him to call off the campaign and return to Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Christopher |first1=Kleinhenz |title=Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-93929-4 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=E2CTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89&amp;lpg=PT89&amp;dq=arnulf+holy+roman+emperor+%22stroke%22#v=onepage&amp;q=arnulf%20holy%20roman%20emperor%20%22stroke%22&amp;f=false|date=2004-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours of the time made Arnulf's condition to be a result of poisoning at the hand of Ageltrude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf retained power in Italy only as long as he was personally there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. 79&quot;&gt;Bryce, pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt; On his way north, he stopped at [[Pavia]] where he crowned his illegitimate son [[Ratold of Italy|Ratold]], as sub-[[King of Italy]], after which he left Ratold in [[Milan]] in an attempt to preserve his hold on Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 30&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; That same year pope Formosus died, leaving Lambert once again in power, and both he and Berengar proceeded to kill any officials who had been appointed by Arnulf, forcing Ratold to flee from Milan to Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of his life Arnulf exercised very little control in Italy, and his agents in Rome did not prevent the accession of [[Pope Stephen VI]] in 896.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Pope initially gave his support to Arnulf, but eventually became a supporter of Lambert.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 84 – Silver coins from the pontificate of Stephen VI show the transition from Arnulf (“Arnolfvs Imp. Roma”) to Lambert (“Lamverto Imp. Roma”)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
After 896 Arnulf's health – besides suffering a stroke he had [[Phthiriasis|morbus pediculosis]], infestation of pubic lice of the eyelid – prevented him from effectively dealing with the problems besetting his reign. Italy was lost,&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 30&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; raiders from Moravia and [[Magyars]] were continually raiding his lands, and Lotharingia was in revolt against Zwentibold.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt; He was also plagued by escalating violence and power struggles between the lower Frankish nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 899 Arnulf died at [[Regensburg|Ratisbon]] in present-day [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Useful Knowledge page 623&quot; /&gt; He is entombed in [[St. Emmeram's Abbey|St. Emmeram's Basilica]] at [[Regensburg]], which is now known as Schloss Thurn und Taxis, the palace of the Princes of [[Thurn und Taxis]].

He was succeeded as the king of East Francia by his only legitimate son from [[Ota, wife of Arnulf of Carinthia|Ota]] (died 903), [[Louis the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 100&lt;/ref&gt; After his death in 911 at age 17 or 18, the east Frankish branch of [[Carolingians|Carolingian]] dynasty ceased to exist. Arnulf had had the nobility to recognize the rights of his illegitimate sons [[Zwentibold]] and [[Ratold of Italy|Ratold]] as his successors. Zwentibold, whom he had made [[King of Lotharingia]] in 895, continued to rule there until his murder in 900.
