'''Agent Orange''' is a [[herbicide]] and [[defoliant]] chemical, one of the &quot;tactical use&quot; [[Rainbow Herbicides]]. It is widely known for its use by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] as part of its [[chemical warfare]] program, [[Operation Ranch Hand]],{{sfn|Buckingham|1982}} during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1961 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/agent_orange_linked_skin_cancer_risk-128602 |title=Agent Orange Linked To Skin Cancer Risk |date=January 29, 2014 |access-date=February 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023230836/https://www.science20.com/news_articles/agent_orange_linked_skin_cancer_risk-128602 |work=Science 2.0 |archive-date=October 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mixture of equal parts of two [[herbicide]]s, [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]].

Up to four million people in [[Vietnam]] were exposed to the defoliant. The government of Vietnam says as many as 3 million people have suffered illnesses because of Agent Orange.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061401077_4.html |last=Stocking |first=Ben |title=Agent Orange Still Haunts Vietnam, US|date=2007-06-14 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=2017-03-29 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330083914/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/14/AR2007061401077_4.html |archive-date=2017-03-30|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Cross of Vietnam]] estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems as a result of Agent Orange contamination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica King&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/vietnam-us-agent-orange/ |title=U.S. in first effort to clean up Agent Orange in Vietnam |first=Jessica |last=King |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2012-08-11 |work=[[CNN]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303060725/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/vietnam-us-agent-orange |archive-date=2013-03-03 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Defoliation |editor-last=Tucker|editor-first=Spencer C.|work=The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War : a Political, Social, and Military History|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-961-0|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government has documented higher cases of [[leukemia]], [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], and various kinds of cancer in exposed veterans. An epidemiological study done by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] showed that there was an impact of birth defects of the children of veterans as a result of Agent Orange, although there was no overall rise in the total number of births with defects of Vietnam Veterans.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3969152.pdf?acceptTC=true&lt;/ref&gt; Agent Orange also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 hectares (31,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 11,969&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making [[reforestation]] difficult in numerous areas. Animal [[species diversity]] sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vallero&quot; /&gt;{{sfn|Furukawa|2004|p=215}}

The use of Agent Orange in Vietnam resulted in massive legal consequences. The [[United Nations]] ratified [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72]] and the [[Environmental Modification Convention]]. Lawsuits filed on behalf of both U.S. and Vietnamese veterans sought compensation for damages.

Agent Orange was to a lesser extent used outside Vietnam. It was first used by [[British Armed Forces]] in Malaysia during the [[Malayan Emergency]]. It was also used in neighbouring Laos and Cambodia during the Vietnam War because forests on the border with Vietnam were used by the [[Viet Cong]]. Some countries, such as Canada, carried out testing, while other countries, such as Brazil, used the herbicide to clear out sections of land for agriculture.

[[File:2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo(b,e)(1,4)dioxine 200.svg|thumb|[[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD)]]

[[File:2,4,5-T.svg|thumb|[[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T)]]

The active ingredient of Agent Orange was an equal mixture of two [[phenoxy herbicide]]s – [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4-D) and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] (2,4,5-T) – in [[ester|iso-octyl ester]] form, which contained traces of the [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]] [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin]] (TCDD).{{sfn|IOM|1994|p=90}} TCDD was a trace (typically 2-3 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]], ranging from 50 ppb to 50 ppm)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |vauthors=Young AL, Thalken CE, Arnold EL, Cupello JM, Cockerham LG |title=Fate of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin (TCDD) in the Environment: Summary and Decontamination Recommendations |year=1976 |publisher=United States Air Force Academy |id=TR 76 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but significant contaminant of Agent Orange. 

===Toxicology===
TCDD is the most toxic of the dioxins and is classified as a human [[carcinogen]] by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=12 |title=Dioxins |website=Tox Town |publisher=United States National Library of Medicine |access-date=2017-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313042937/https://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=12 |archive-date=2017-03-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fat-soluble nature of TCDD causes it to readily enter the body through physical contact or ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yonemoto, Junzo |title=The Effects of Dioxin on Reproduction and Development |journal=Industrial Health |volume=28 |date=2000 |pages=259–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dioxin easily accumulates in the food chain. Dioxin enters the body by attaching to a protein called the [[aryl hydrocarbon receptor]] (AhR), a transcription factor. When TCDD binds to AhR, the protein moves to the nucleus, where it influences gene expression.{{sfn|Ngo|Taylor|Roberts|Nguyen|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Michael |title=The Case of Agent Orange |journal=Contemporary Southeast Asia |date=2007 |volume=29 |pages=172–195 |doi=10.1355/cs29-1h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If not bound chemically to a biological surface such as soil, leaves or grass, Agent Orange dries quickly after spraying and breaks down within hours to days when exposed to sunlight and is no longer harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/basics.asp |title=Facts About Herbicides – Public Health |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |access-date=2017-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218184604/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/basics.asp |archive-date=2017-02-18 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Several herbicides were developed as part of efforts by the United States and Great Britain to develop herbicidal weapons for use during [[World War II]]. These included 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, [[MCPA]] (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, 1414B and 1414A, recoded LN-8 and LN-32), and [[isopropyl phenylcarbamate]] (1313, recoded LN-33).&lt;ref name=&quot;FAB&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Perera |first1=Judith |last2=Thomas |first2=Andy |date=April 18, 1985 |title=This horrible natural experiment |journal=New Scientist |pages=34–36 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=q7v_rDK0uOgC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the [[United States Department of the Army]] contracted botanist and bioethicist [[Arthur Galston]], who discovered the defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] to study the effects of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.yale.edu/2008/07/18/memoriam-arthur-galston-plant-biologist-fought-use-agent-orange |title=In Memoriam: Arthur Galston, Plant Biologist, Fought Use of Agent Orange |website=Yale News |access-date=2017-03-10 |date=2008-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312070110/http://news.yale.edu/2008/07/18/memoriam-arthur-galston-plant-biologist-fought-use-agent-orange |archive-date=2017-03-12 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a graduate and post-graduate student at the University of Illinois, Galston's research and [[dissertation]] focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider |first=Brandon |date=2003 |title=Agent Orange: A deadly member of the rainbow |url=http://research.yale.edu/ysm/article.jsp?articleID=48 |journal=[[Yale Scientific]] |volume=77 |issue=2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125154522/http://research.yale.edu/ysm/article.jsp?articleID=48 |archivedate=2009-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered both that 2,3,5-[[triiodobenzoic acid]] (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider2003&quot; /&gt; From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the [[Bushnell Army Airfield]] in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during [[Operation Downfall]] if the war had continued.{{sfn|Young|2009}}{{sfn|Verwey|1977|p=111}}

In the years after the war, the U.S. tested 1,100 compounds, and field trials of the more promising ones were done at British stations in India and Australia, in order to establish their effects in tropical conditions, as well as at the U.S.'s testing ground in Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAB&quot;/&gt; Between 1950 and 1952, trials were conducted in [[Tanganyika]], at [[Kikore]] and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and [[endothall]] (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53, the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 2,4,5-T in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of [[tsetse fly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAB&quot;/&gt;

== Early use ==
During the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), Britain was the first nation to employ the use of herbicides and defoliants to destroy bushes, trees, and vegetation to deprive insurgents of concealment and target food crops as part of a starvation campaign in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haberman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/us/agent-oranges-long-legacy-for-vietnam-and-veterans.html |title=Agent Orange's Long Legacy, for Vietnam and Veterans |last=Haberman |first=Clyde |date=2014-05-11 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=2017-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724205114/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/12/us/agent-oranges-long-legacy-for-vietnam-and-veterans.html |archive-date=2017-07-24 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed account of how the British experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists, E.K. Woodford of [[Agricultural and Food Research Council|Agricultural Research Council]]'s Unit of Experimental Agronomy and H.G.H. Kearns of the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAB&quot;/&gt;

After the Malayan conflict ended in 1960, the U.S. considered the British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a [[law of war|legal tactic of warfare]]. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] advised [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] that the British had established a precedent for warfare with herbicides in Malaya.&lt;ref name=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Global Politics of Pesticides: Forging Consensus from Conflicting Interests |page=61 |first=Peter |last=Hough |year=1998 |publisher=[[Earthscan]] |isbn=9781844079872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in the Vietnam War==
[[File:Aerial-herbicide-spray-missions-in-Southern-Vietnam--1965-1971.jpg|thumb|Map showing locations of U.S. Army aerial herbicide spray missions in South Vietnam taking place from 1965 to 1971.]]

In mid-1961, President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of South Vietnam asked the United States to conduct aerial herbicide spraying in his country.{{sfn|Buckingham|1982|p=11–12}} In August of that year, the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]] conducted herbicide operations with American help. Diem's request launched a policy debate in the [[White House]] and the [[State Department|State]] and [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Departments]]. However, U.S. officials considered using it, pointing out that the British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In November 1961, Kennedy authorized the start of [[Operation Ranch Hand]], the codename for the [[United States Air Force]]'s herbicide program in Vietnam.

During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly {{convert|20000000|U.S.gal|m3}} of various chemicals – the &quot;[[rainbow herbicides]]&quot; and defoliants – in Vietnam, eastern Laos, and parts of Cambodia as part of Operation Ranch Hand, reaching its peak from 1967 to 1969. For comparison purposes, an olympic size pool holds approximately {{cvt|660000|U.S.gal|m3}}.{{sfn|Pellow|2007|p=159}}{{sfn|Stellman|Stellman|Christian|Weber|2003}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Haberman&quot;/&gt; As the British did in Malaya, the goal of the U.S. was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and concealment and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Tucker |editor-first=Spencer C. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=1997 |title=Agent Orange}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was also a part of a general policy of [[forced draft urbanization]], which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S.-dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base.{{sfn|Stellman|Stellman|Christian|Weber|2003}}{{sfn|Kolko|1994|p=144–145}} Agent Orange was usually sprayed from helicopters or from low-flying [[C-123 Provider]] aircraft, fitted with sprayers and &quot;MC-1 Hourglass&quot; pump systems and {{convert|1000|U.S.gal|L}} chemical tanks. Spray runs were also conducted from trucks, boats, and backpack sprayers.{{sfn|Schuck|1987|p=16}}&lt;ref name=&quot;acs&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Young|2009|p=26}}

The first batch of herbicides was unloaded at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]] in South Vietnam, on January 9, 1962.{{sfn|Hay|1982|p=151}} U.S. Air Force records show at least 6,542 spraying missions took place over the course of Operation Ranch Hand.{{sfn|Furukawa|2004|p=143}} By 1971, 12 percent of the total area of South Vietnam had been sprayed with defoliating chemicals, at an average concentration of 13 times the recommended [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] application rate for domestic use.{{sfn|Stanford Biology Study Group|1971|p=36}} In South Vietnam alone, an estimated {{convert|39000|sqmi|ha}} of agricultural land was ultimately destroyed.{{sfn|Luong|2003|p=3}} In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the EPA.&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-war-against&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Fawthrop |first=Tom |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3798581.stm |title=Vietnam's war against Agent Orange |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191110092114/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3798581.stm |archive-date=2019-11-10 |work=BBC News |date=June 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-suffering&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Fawthrop |first=Tom |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/10/agentofsuffering |title=Agent of Suffering |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830050406/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/10/agentofsuffering |archive-date=2019-08-30 |work=The Guardian |date=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign destroyed {{convert|5|e6acre|km2|sigfig=1|order=flip}} of upland and mangrove forests and thousands of square kilometres of crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/us-moves-to-address-agent-orange-contamination-in-vietnam.html |title=4 Decades on, U.S. Starts Cleanup of Agent Orange in Vietnam |last=Fuller |first=Thomas |date=2012-08-09 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2017-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312065059/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/us-moves-to-address-agent-orange-contamination-in-vietnam.html |archive-date=2017-03-12 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, more than 20% of South Vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over the nine-year period.{{sfn|Kolko|1994|p=144–145}}{{sfn|Verwey|1977|p=113}}

In 1965, members of the [[U.S. Congress]] were told &quot;crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose&amp;nbsp;... but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the program.&quot;{{sfn|Verwey|1977|p=113}} Military personnel were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas. They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas; it was, in reality, only being grown to support the local civilian population. For example, in Quang Ngai province, 85% of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone. This contributed to widespread famine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving.{{sfn|Verwey|1977|p=116}}

The U.S. military began targeting food crops in October 1962, primarily using [[Agent Blue]]; the American public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42% of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the State Department in March 1966.{{sfn|Verwey|1977|p=111}}{{sfn|Kolko|1994|p=144–145}}

Many experts at the time, including Arthur Galston, opposed herbicidal warfare because of concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area. As early as 1966, resolutions were introduced to the [[United Nations]] charging that the U.S. was violating the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], which regulated the use of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]]. The U.S. defeated most of the resolutions,&lt;ref name=&quot;galston-light&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Peterson |first=Doug |url=http://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2004/galston |title=Matters of Light: Arthur W.

The U.S. delegation argued that a weapon, by definition, is any device used to injure, defeat, or destroy living beings, structures, or systems, and Agent Orange did not qualify under that definition. It also argued that if the U.S. were to be charged for using Agent Orange, then Britain and its Commonwealth nations should be charged since they also used it widely during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When Technology Fails: Significant Technological Disasters, Accidents, and Failures of the Twentieth Century |year=1994 |page=104 |last=Schlager |first=Neil |publisher=Gale Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Britain commented on the draft Resolution 2603 (XXIV): &quot;The evidence seems to us to be notably inadequate for the assertion that the use in war of chemical substances specifically toxic to plants is prohibited by [[international law]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_gb_rule76|title=United States of America: Practice Relating to Rule 76.

The government of Vietnam says that 4 million of its citizens were exposed to Agent Orange, and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it; these figures include their children who were exposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Washington Post&quot;/&gt; The [[Red Cross of Vietnam]] estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to contaminated Agent Orange.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica King&quot;/&gt; The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

According to a study by Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhan, children in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and [[Polydactyly|extra fingers and toes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Agent Orange blights Vietnam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaiadiscovery.com/latest-people/professor-nguyen-viet-nhan-helping-child-victims-of-agent-or.html|title=Professor Nguyen Viet Nhan: Helping Child Victims of Agent Orange Defoliation |website=Gaia Discovery |date=December 13, 2010 |language=en|access-date=2017-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225210710/http://www.gaiadiscovery.com/latest-people/professor-nguyen-viet-nhan-helping-child-victims-of-agent-or.html|archive-date=2017-02-25|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the [[breast milk]] of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thornton|first=Joe|title=Pandora's Poison: Chlorine, Health, and a New Environmental Strategy|publisher=MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-262-70084-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pandoraspoison00joet/page/190 190]|url=https://archive.org/details/pandoraspoison00joet|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most affected zones are the mountainous area along [[Truong Son Mountains|Truong Son]] (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia.

In 2006, Anh Duc Ngo and colleagues of the [[University of Texas Health Science Center]] published a [[meta-analysis]] that exposed a large amount of heterogeneity (different findings) between studies, a finding consistent with a lack of consensus on the issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;1940-5030&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/birth-defects-caused-agent-orange|last=King|first=Jesse|title=Birth Defects Caused by Agent Orange|journal=Embryo Project Encyclopedia|date=2012-11-08|hdl=10776/4202|issn=1940-5030|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801042017/http://embryo.asu.edu:80/pages/birth-defects-caused-agent-orange|archive-date=2013-08-01|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, statistical analysis of the studies they examined resulted in data that the increase in birth defects/[[relative risk]] (RR) from exposure to agent orange/dioxin &quot;appears&quot; to be on the order of 3 in Vietnamese-funded studies, but 1.29 in the rest of the world. There is data near the threshold of [[statistical significance]] suggesting Agent Orange contributes to still-births, cleft palate, and [[neural tube defects]], with [[spina bifida]] being the most statistically significant defect.{{sfn|Ngo|Taylor|Roberts|Nguyen|2006}} The large discrepancy in RR between Vietnamese studies and those in the rest of the world has been ascribed to bias in the Vietnamese studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;1940-5030&quot;/&gt;

Twenty-eight of the former U.S. military bases in Vietnam where the herbicides were stored and loaded onto airplanes may still have high levels of dioxins in the soil, posing a health threat to the surrounding communities. Extensive testing for dioxin contamination has been conducted at the former U.S. airbases in [[Da Nang Air Base|Da Nang]], [[Phù Cát Air Base|Phù Cát District]] and [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Biên Hòa]]. Some of the soil and sediment on the bases have extremely high levels of dioxin requiring remediation. The Da Nang Air Base has dioxin contamination up to 350 times higher than international recommendations for action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.hatfieldgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/AgentOrangeReports/UNDP1391/UNDP1391_Final_VRT_%20Report_and_Appendices.pdf |title=Evaluation of Contamination at the Agent Orange Dioxin Hot Spots in Bien Hoa, Phu Cat and Vicinity, Vietnam |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425050941/https://www.hatfieldgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/AgentOrangeReports/UNDP1391/UNDP1391_Final_VRT_%20Report_and_Appendices.pdf |archive-date=2019-04-25 |publisher=Office of the National Committee 33, Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment |location=Hanoi, Vietnam |author=Viet Nam – Russia Tropical Centre |date=June 2009 |id=UNDP1391.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author1=Hatfield Consultants |author2=Office of the National Steering Committee 33 |url=http://www.hatfieldgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/AgentOrangeReports/DANDI1283/DANDI1283_Final_Report.pdf |title=Assessment of dioxin contamination in the environment and human population in the vicinity of Da Nang Airbase, Viet Nam. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425053450/https://www.hatfieldgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/AgentOrangeReports/DANDI1283/DANDI1283_Final_Report.pdf |archive-date=2019-04-25 |id=DANDI1283.4 |location=Vancouver, Canada |publisher=Hatfield Consultants |date=2007 |type=Final Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contaminated soil and sediment continue to affect the citizens of Vietnam, poisoning their food chain and causing illnesses, serious skin diseases and a variety of cancers in the lungs, larynx, and prostate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agent Orange blights Vietnam&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Denselow |first=Robin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/227467.stm|work=BBC News|title=Agent Orange blights Vietnam|date=December 3, 1998|accessdate=April 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125013903/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/227467.stm|archive-date=January 25, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Veterans===
While in Vietnam, the veterans were told not to worry and were persuaded the chemical was harmless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hermann&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Hermann |first=Kenneth J. |url=http://politicalaffairs.net/killing-me-softly-how-agent-orange-murders-vietnam-s-children/ |title=Killing Me Softly: How Agent Orange Murders Vietnam's Children |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140917092644/http://politicalaffairs.net/killing-me-softly-how-agent-orange-murders-vietnam-s-children/ |archive-date=2014-09-17 |work=Political Affairs |date=April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects might be related to Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they had been exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43790.pdf |title=Veterans Exposed to Agent Orange: Legislative History, Litigation, and Current Issues |last1=Sidath |first1=Viranga Panangala |last2=Shedd |first2=Daniel |date=November 18, 2014 |publisher=Congressional Research Service |id=R43790 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321170713/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43790.pdf |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to qualify for compensation, veterans must have served on or near the perimeters of military bases in Thailand during the Vietnam Era, where herbicides were tested and stored outside of Vietnam, veterans who were crew members on C-123 planes flown after the Vietnam War, or were associated with Department of Defense (DoD) projects to test, dispose of, or store herbicides in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/claims-postservice-agent_orange.asp |title=Veterans Exposed to Agent Orange |date=January 19, 2018 |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |access-date=February 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203125103/https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/claims-postservice-agent_orange.asp |archive-date=February 3, 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1993, the Department of Veterans Affairs had compensated only 486 victims, although it had received disability claims from 39,419 soldiers who had been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fleischer |first1=Doris Zames |last2=Zames |first2=Freida |title=The disability rights movement: from charity to confrontation |publisher=Temple University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-1-56639-812-1 |page=178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t84d8tLEVcC&amp;pg=PA178 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228092239/https://books.google.com/books?id=3t84d8tLEVcC&amp;pg=PA178 |archive-date=2017-02-28 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2004 [[Zogby International]] poll of 987 people, 79% of respondents thought the U.S. chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate U.S. soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in Vietnam. Also, 51% said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vietnamembassy-usa.org/relations/most-americans-favor-compensation-agent-orange-victims |first=Ha |last=Nguyen |title=Most Americans favor compensation for Agent Orange victims |publisher=Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the United States |date=November 19, 2004 |access-date=2017-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331115923/http://vietnamembassy-usa.org/relations/most-americans-favor-compensation-agent-orange-victims|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Academy of Medicine====
Starting in the early 1990s, the federal government directed the Institute of Medicine (IOM), now known as the [[National Academy of Medicine]], to issue reports every 2 years on the health effects of Agent Orange and similar herbicides. First published in 1994 and titled Veterans and Agent Orange, the IOM reports assess the risk of both cancer and non-cancer health effects. Each health effect is categorized by evidence of association based on available research data.&lt;ref name=&quot;acs&quot;/&gt; The last update was published in 2016, entitled &quot;Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 2014.&quot;

The report shows sufficient evidence of an association with soft tissue sarcoma; non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); Hodgkin disease; Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); including hairy cell leukemia and other chronic B-cell leukemias.  Limited or suggested evidence of an association was linked with respiratory cancers (lung, bronchus, trachea, larynx); prostate cancer; multiple myeloma; and bladder cancer.  Numerous other cancers were determined to have inadequate or insufficient evidence of links to Agent Orange.

The National Academy of Medicine has repeatedly concluded that any evidence suggestive of an association between Agent Orange and prostate cancer is, &quot;limited because chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Institute of Medicine |title=Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam: Update 11 |date=2018 |publisher=The National Academies Press |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-309-47716-1 |url=http://nap.edu/25137 |accessdate=25 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of the Veterans Administration, the Institute Of Medicine evaluated whether service in these C-123 aircraft could have plausibly exposed soldiers and been detrimental to their health. Their report &quot;Post-Vietnam Dioxin Exposure in Agent Orange-Contaminated C-123 Aircraft&quot; confirmed it.&lt;ref name=&quot;c-123&quot;&gt;{{cite report |author1=Committee to Evaluate the Potential Exposure of Agent Orange/TCDD Residue and Level of Risk of Adverse Health Effects for Aircrew of Post-Vietnam C-123 Aircraft; Board on the Health of Select Populations|title=Post-Vietnam Dioxin Exposure in Agent Orange-Contaminated C-123 Aircraft|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18848/post-vietnam-dioxin-exposure-in-agent-orange-contaminated-c-123-aircraft|accessdate=2015-09-03|work=Institute of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. Public Health Service====
Publications by the [[United States Public Health Service]] have shown that Vietnam veterans, overall, have increased rates of cancer, and nerve, digestive, skin, and respiratory disorders. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] notes that in particular, there are higher rates of acute/chronic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, throat cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer,  [[Ischemic heart disease]], soft tissue sarcoma, and liver cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/epidemiology/studies/heroes/index.asp|title=Vietnam Era Health Retrospective Observational Study |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |language=en|access-date=2017-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225131928/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/epidemiology/studies/heroes/index.asp|archive-date=2017-02-25|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1987-02-13 |title=Postservice mortality among Vietnam veterans.

Military personnel who were involved in storage, mixture and transportation (including aircraft mechanics), and actual use of the chemicals were probably among those who received the heaviest exposures.{{sfn|Frumkin|2003|p=257}} Military members who served on Okinawa also claim to have been exposed to the chemical, but there is no verifiable evidence to corroborate these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Jon |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110412zg.html |title=Evidence for Agent Orange on Okinawa |newspaper=[[Japan Times]] |date=April 12, 2011 |page=12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011091450/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110412zg.html |archive-date=October 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. Veterans of Laos and Cambodia====
The United States fought secret wars in [[History of Laos since 1945#US objectives|Laos]] and [[Operation Menu|Cambodia]], dropping large quantities of Agent Orange in each of those countries.

==Ecological impact==
{{see also|Environmental impact of war}}
[[File:Before and after spraying agent orange.jpg|thumb|Mangrove forests, like the top one east of Saigon, were often destroyed by herbicides.]]
About 17.8%—{{convert|3100000|ha|sqkm sqmi}}—of the total forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which disrupted the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, and loss of seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas.{{sfn|Furukawa|2004|p=215}} Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as [[bamboo]] and [[cogon grass]]), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal species [[biodiversity|diversity]] was also impacted; in one study a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] biologist found 24 species of birds and 5 species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chiras, Daniel D.|title=Environmental science|year=2010|edition=8th|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett|isbn=978-0-7637-5925-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/environmentalsci8thechir/page/499 499]|url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalsci8thechir|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dioxins from Agent Orange have persisted in the Vietnamese environment since the war, settling in the soil and sediment and entering the [[food chain]] through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas. The movement of dioxins through the [[food web]] has resulted in [[bioconcentration]] and [[biomagnification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vallero&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Vallero, Daniel A.|title=Biomedical ethics for engineers: ethics and decision making in biomedical and biosystem engineering|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-7506-8227-5|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AeT56Pi8LFYC&amp;pg=PA73|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331131023/https://books.google.com/books?id=AeT56Pi8LFYC&amp;pg=PA73|archive-date=2017-03-31|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are former U.S. air bases.{{sfn|Furukawa|2004|pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociopolitical impact==
American policy during the Vietnam War was to destroy crops, accepting the sociopolitical impact that that would have.&lt;ref name=Turse/&gt; The [[RAND Corporation]]'s ''Memorandum 5446-ISA/ARPA'' states: &quot;the fact that the VC [the Vietcong] obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops&amp;nbsp;... if they are to be hampered by the crop destruction program, it will be necessary to destroy large portions of the rural economy – probably 50% or more&quot;.{{sfn|Verwey|1977|p=115}} Crops were deliberately sprayed with Agent Orange, areas were bulldozed clear of vegetation, and the rural population was subjected to bombing and artillery fire. In consequence, the urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled, growing from 2.8 million people in 1958 to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums because of the overcrowding.&lt;ref name=Turse&gt;{{cite book |last=Turse |first=Nick |title=Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeFK5dkYZsEC&amp;pg=PT95 |date=2013 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |isbn=978-0-8050-9547-0 |pages=95–99 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331041154/https://books.google.com/books?id=PeFK5dkYZsEC&amp;pg=PT95 |archive-date=2017-03-31 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Luong|2003|p=4}}

==Legal and diplomatic proceedings==
=== International ===
The extensive environmental damage that resulted from usage of the herbicide prompted the [[United Nations]] to pass [[United Nations Convention on Environmental Modification|Resolution 31/72]] and ratify the [[Environmental Modification Convention]].

=== Class action lawsuit ===
Since at least 1978, several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced Agent Orange, among them [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]], [[Monsanto Company|Monsanto]], and [[Diamond Shamrock]].&lt;ref name=EncNatSec&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Agent Orange |work=Encyclopedia of United States National Security |editor-first=Richard J. |editor-last=Samuel |publisher=SAGE Publications |date=2005 |isbn=9781452265353 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney Hy Mayerson was an early pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with [[environmentalism|environmental attorney]] [[Victor Yannacone]] in 1980 on the first [[class-action suit]]s against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, one of the first civilian doctors to see affected patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor.{{sfn|Wilcox|1983}} The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Wilbur J.|title=The Politics of Readjustment: Vietnam Veterans Since the War|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1993|isbn=978-0-202-30406-9|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLg8rVfYO9EC&amp;pg=PA130|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228024316/https://books.google.com/books?id=YLg8rVfYO9EC&amp;pg=PA130|archive-date=2017-02-28|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Mayerson, with Sgt. Charles E.

The chemical companies involved denied that there was a link between Agent Orange and the veterans' medical problems. However, on May 7, 1984, seven chemical companies settled the class-action suit out of court just hours before jury selection was to begin. The companies agreed to pay $180 million as compensation if the veterans dropped all claims against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Stanley, Jay|editor2=Blair, John D.|title=Challenges in military health care: perspectives on health status and the provision of care|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-650-3|page=164|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8k-WIJYwIF4C&amp;pg=PA164|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228022008/https://books.google.com/books?id=8k-WIJYwIF4C&amp;pg=PA164|archive-date=2017-02-28|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slightly over 45% of the sum was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harrington|first=John C.|title=The challenge to power: money, investing, and democracy|publisher=Chelsea Green Publisher|year=2005|isbn=978-1-931498-97-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/challengetopower00harr_0/page/260 260]|url=https://archive.org/details/challengetopower00harr_0|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers. &quot;Fairness Hearings&quot; were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers. Federal Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was &quot;fair and just&quot;. By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out. A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years. Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as [[Food Stamps|food stamps]], [[public assistance]], and [[government pension]]s. A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would receive $3,700.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-milhist-725&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Wilcox |first=Fred A. |editor-last1=Chambers |editor-first1=John Whiteclay|editor-last2=Anderson |editor-first2=Fred|work=The Oxford companion to American military history|title=Toxic Agents|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-19-507198-6|page=725|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00cham/page/725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Monsanto spokesman Jill Montgomery said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange, saying: &quot;We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause, but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Agent Orange Victims Sue Monsanto|last=Fawthrop|first=Tom|work=CorpWatch|date=November 4, 2004|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11638|access-date=February 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126185411/http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11638|archive-date=January 26, 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey Agent Orange Commission===
In 1980, New Jersey created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission, the first state commission created to study its effects. The commission's research project in association with [[Rutgers University]] was called &quot;The Pointman Project&quot;. It was disbanded by Governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prestin|first1=Terry|title=Agent Orange Panel Closes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-agent-orange-panel-closes.html|accessdate=13 September 2014|work=The New York Times|at=Section B; page 1; column 1|date=July 3, 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913214450/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-agent-orange-panel-closes.html|archive-date=13 September 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first phase of the project, commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels could only be found in the [[adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]]. The project studied dioxin (TCDD) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=371123 |first1=Peter C. |last1=Kahn |first2=Michael |last2=Gochfeld |first3=Martin |last3=Nygren |first4=Marianne |last4=Hansson |first5=Christoffer |last5=Rappe |first6=Henry |last6=Velez |first7=Therese |last7=Ghent-Guenther |first8=Wayne P. |last8=Wilson |display-authors=3 |title=Dioxins and Dibenzofurans in Blood and Adipose Tissue of Agent Orange—Exposed Vietnam Veterans and Matched Controls&quot; |work=JAMA |volume=259 |issue=11 |date=March 18, 1988 |page=1661–1667 |doi=10.1001/jama.1988.03720110023029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of Vietnam veterans, including [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and [[Brownwater Navy|brown water riverboat Navy]] personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yyvmcMsNnB4C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=The+Pointman+Project+rutgers#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Pointman%20Project%20rutgers&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of the Veteran in America|last=Pencak|first=William|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|isbn=9780313087592|location=|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Congress===
In 1991, Congress enacted the [[Agent Orange Act of 1991|Agent Orange Act]], giving the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] the authority to declare certain conditions &quot;presumptive&quot; to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/ |author=Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards |title=Agent Orange |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101154548/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/ |archivedate=2009-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same law required the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the [[Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/laws/PL102-4.asp |title=PL 102-4 and The National Academy of Sciences |publisher=The National Academies |date=1981-11-03 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803022853/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/laws/PL102-4.asp |archive-date=2012-08-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority for the National Academy of Sciences reviews and addition of any new diseases to the presumptive list by the VA is expiring in 2015 under the sunset clause of the Agent Orange Act of 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet3/brief3.gfr/tab_g/br3g1f.txt |title=Agent Orange Act of 1991 |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |accessdate=2017-03-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201132816/http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/radiation/dir/mstreet/commeet/meet3/brief3.gfr/tab_g/br3g1f.txt |archivedate=2017-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed [[prostate cancer]], respiratory cancers, [[multiple myeloma]], [[type II diabetes mellitus]], [[Hodgkin's disease]], [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], soft tissue sarcoma, [[chloracne]], [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], and [[spina bifida]] in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide.

===U.S.–Vietnamese government negotiations===
In 2002, Vietnam and the U.S. held a joint conference on Human Health and Environmental Impacts of Agent Orange. Following the conference, the U.S. [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) began scientific exchanges between the U.S. and Vietnam, and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of Agent Orange.{{sfn|Young|2009|p=310}} These negotiations broke down in 2005, when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was canceled. More progress has been made on the environmental front. In 2005, the first U.S.-Vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held.{{sfn|Young|2009|p=310}}

Starting in 2005, the EPA began to work with the Vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the Da Nang Air Base. Also in 2005, the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange, made up of representatives of Vietnamese and U.S. government agencies, was established. The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation, technical assistance and [[environmental remediation]] of dioxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr081209.html |title = US, Vietnam to Hold Fourth Joint Advisory Meeting on Agent Orange/Dioxin |publisher=Embassy of the United States, Hanoi |accessdate = August 11, 2011|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111015102640/http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr081209.html|archivedate = October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of United States President [[George W. Bush]]'s state visit to Vietnam in November 2006.

===Vietnamese victims class action lawsuit in U.S. courts===
On January 31, 2004, a [[victim's rights group]], the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] in [[Brooklyn]], against several U.S. companies for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed that the use of Agent Orange violated the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare]], 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], and the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]]. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the plaintiffs' claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under [[international law]] at the time of its use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule76|title=United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: Practice Relating to Rule 76.

{{quote|The [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]]'s (ARPA) [[Project AGILE]] was instrumental in the United States' development of herbicides as a military weapon, an undertaking inspired by the British use of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T to destroy jungle-grown crops and bushes during the insurgency in Malaya. The United States considered British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a legally accepted tactic of war. On November 24, 1961, [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] advised [[U.S. President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] that herbicide use in Vietnam would be lawful, saying that &quot;[t]he use of defoliant does not violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in their use of helicopters for destroying crops by chemical spraying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Literary Cold War, 1945 to Vietnam |first=Adam |last=Piette |date=May 25, 2009 |pages=201–202 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |isbn=978-0-7486-3527-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite contribution |last=Rusk |first=Dean |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v01/d275 |title=Memorandum From the Secretary of State to the President |work=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963 |volume=Volume I, Vietnam, 1961 |editor=Office of the Historian |publisher=United States Department of State |date=November 24, 1961 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211050023/https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v01/d275|archive-date=2018-12-11|url-status=live |oclc=220954388}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George Jackson stated that &quot;if the Americans were guilty of war crimes for using Agent Orange in Vietnam, then the British would be also guilty of war crimes as well since they were the first nation to deploy the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare and used them on a large scale throughout the Malayan Emergency. Not only was there no outcry by other states in response to Britain's use, but the U.S. viewed it as establishing a precedent for the use of herbicides and defoliants in [[jungle warfare]].&quot; The U.S. government was also not a party in the lawsuit because of [[sovereign immunity]], and the court ruled the chemical companies, as contractors of the U.S. government, shared the same immunity.
The case was appealed and heard by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Manhattan]] on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the court upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the herbicides contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the entire panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] and declined to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |url=https://www.asser.nl/upload/documents/DomCLIC/Docs/NLP/US/AgentOrange_AppealsJudgement_22-2-2008.pdf |litigants=Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin v.

===Help for those affected in Vietnam===
To assist those who have been affected by Agent Orange/dioxin, the Vietnamese have established &quot;peace villages&quot;, which each host between 50 and 100 victims, giving them medical and psychological help. As of 2006, there were 11 such villages, thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims. U.S. veterans of the war in Vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of Agent Orange have supported these programs in Vietnam. An international group of veterans from the U.S. and its allies during the Vietnam War working with their former enemy—veterans from the Vietnam Veterans Association—established the Vietnam Friendship Village outside of [[Hanoi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamfriendship.org|title=Vietnam Friendship Village Project|accessdate=August 18, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917012142/http://www.vietnamfriendship.org/|archivedate=17 September 2008 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center provides medical care, rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from Vietnam who have been affected by Agent Orange. In 1998, The [[Vietnam Red Cross]] established the Vietnam Agent Orange Victims Fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout Vietnam that have been affected. In 2003, the Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange (VAVA) was formed. In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies, VAVA provides medical care, rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by Agent Orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vava.org.vn/|title=Hội Nạn nhân chất độc da cam/dioxin Việt Nam| |trans-title=Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/Dioxin |website=vava.org.vn|language=vi-VN|access-date=2017-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326221003/http://vava.org.vn/|archive-date=2017-03-26|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200,000 Vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides; this totaled $40.8 million in 2008. The Vietnam Red Cross has raised more than $22 million to assist the ill or disabled, and several U.S. foundations, United Nations agencies, European governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about $23 million for site cleanup, reforestation, health care and other services to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Ngô Quang Xuân |title=Statement to the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of Asia, Pacific and Global Environment |date=June 2009 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2010, members of [[the U.S.-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin]] unveiled a comprehensive 10-year Declaration and Plan of Action to address the toxic legacy of Agent Orange and other herbicides in Vietnam. The Plan of Action was released as an Aspen Institute publication and calls upon the U.S. and Vietnamese governments to join with other governments, foundations, businesses, and nonprofits in a partnership to clean up dioxin &quot;hot spots&quot; in Vietnam and to expand humanitarian services for people with disabilities there.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/agentorange/chi-agent-orange-actionplandec08,0,7945266.story |title=Public-private group has plan in the works to resolve issue |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Jason |last=Grotto |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522082810/http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/agentorange/chi-agent-orange-actionplandec08,0,7945266.story |archive-date=2013-05-22 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Margie |last=Mason |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37735860 |title=Plan addresses Agent Orange legacy in Vietnam |work=NBC News |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305083530/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37735860/ |archive-date=2016-03-05 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.spc-rep.html |title=Special Report: Agent Orange |work=Washington Monthly |date=January-February 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901175643/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1001.spc-rep.html |archivedate=2012-09-01 |pages=22–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2010, Senator [[Patrick Leahy]] acknowledged the work of the Dialogue Group by releasing a statement on the floor of the United States Senate.

===Australia===
In 2008, Australian researcher Jean Williams claimed that cancer rates in [[Innisfail, Queensland]], were 10 times higher than the state average because of secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the [[Order of Australia]] medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing. Neither Williams nor Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined that cancer rates in Innisfail were no higher than those in other parts of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=McMahon, Barbara |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/19/australia |title=Australia cancer deaths linked to Agent Orange |newspaper=The Guardian |date=May 19, 2008 |accessdate=March 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330180951/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/19/australia |archive-date=March 30, 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guam===
An analysis of chemicals present in the island's soil, together with resolutions passed by [[Legislature of Guam|Guam's legislature]], suggest that Agent Orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around [[Anderson Air Force Base]] and [[Naval Air Station Agana]]. Despite the evidence, the Department of Defense continues to deny that Agent Orange was stored or used on Guam. Several Guam veterans have collected evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of Agent Orange used in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimond2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hero-project/articles/2013/09/25/were-vets-who-served-in-guam-exposed-to-agent-orange-and-denied-benefits.html |title=Were Vets Who Served in Guam Exposed to Agent Orange and Denied Benefits? |last1=Dimond |first1=Diane |date=September 25, 2013 |work=The Daily Beast |accessdate=September 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928223244/http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hero-project/articles/2013/09/25/were-vets-who-served-in-guam-exposed-to-agent-orange-and-denied-benefits.html |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Pacer IVY collected Agent Orange in South Vietnam and removed it in 1972 aboard the ship {{MV|Transpacific}} for storage on Johnston Atoll.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jonmitchellinjapan.com/uploads/4/0/4/0/4040871/okinawa_report_package_2013_pdf.pdf |title=Investigations into Allegations of Herbicide Orange on Okinawa, Japan |last=Young |first=Alvin L. |publisher=United States Department of Defence |date=January 2013 |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA reports that {{cvt|1800000|U.S.gal|L|order=flip}} of Herbicide Orange was stored at Johnston Island in the Pacific and {{cvt|480000|U.S.gal|L|order=flip}} at [[Gulfport, Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=Sierra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/910096MY.PDF |title=Final report of the Federal Task Force for Hazardous Materials Management of the Western Federal Regional Council Region IX, August 1, 1973 to June 30, 1977 |last1=Bourns |first1=Charles T. |date=March 1, 1978 |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=16 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110002238/http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/910096MY.PDF |archive-date=10 January 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and studies were initiated to find a safe method to destroy the materials, and it was discovered they could be incinerated safely under special conditions of temperature and dwell time.&lt;ref name=Sierra /&gt; However, these herbicides were expensive, and the Air Force wanted to resell its surplus instead of dumping it at sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guam&quot; /&gt; Among many methods tested, a possibility of salvaging the herbicides by reprocessing and filtering out the TCDD contaminant with carbonized (charcoaled) coconut fibers.

From July to September 1977 during Operation Pacer HO, the entire stock of Agent Orange from both Herbicide Orange storage sites at Gulfport and Johnston Atoll was subsequently incinerated in four separate burns in the vicinity of Johnston Island aboard the Dutch-owned waste incineration ship {{ship|MT|Vulcanus}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guam&quot;&gt;{{cite report |title=Phase II Environmental Baseline Survey, Johnston Atoll |date=April 2005 |author=EarthTech |chapter=Appendix B |page=B19-B20 |url=http://www.guamagentorange.info/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Johnston_Atoll_History.261114404.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421032235/http://www.guamagentorange.info/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Johnston_Atoll_History.261114404.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 21, 2013 |accessdate=August 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Okinawa, Japan===
There have been dozens of reports in the press about use and/or storage of military formulated herbicides on Okinawa that are based upon statements by former U.S. service members that had been stationed on the island, photographs, government records, and unearthed storage barrels. The U.S. Department of Defense has denied these allegations with statements by military officials and spokespersons, as well as a January 2013 report authored by Dr. Alvin Young that was released in April 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blanket2013&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2013/06/04/issues/as-evidence-of-agent-orange-in-okinawa-stacks-up-u-s-sticks-with-blanket-denial/ |last=Mitchell |first=Jon |title=As evidence of agent orange in Okinawa stacks up US sticks with blanket denial |date=June 4, 2013 |newspaper=Japan Times |access-date=February 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416223910/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2013/06/04/issues/as-evidence-of-agent-orange-in-okinawa-stacks-up-u-s-sticks-with-blanket-denial/ |archive-date=April 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the 2013 report rebuts articles written by journalist Jon Mitchell as well as a statement from &quot;An Ecological Assessment of Johnston Atoll&quot; a 2003 publication produced by the [[United States Army Chemical Materials Agency]] that states, &quot;in 1972, the U.S. Air Force also brought about 25,000 200L drums of the chemical, Herbicide Orange (HO) to Johnston Island that originated from Vietnam and was stored on Okinawa.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecological&quot;&gt;{{cite report |last1=Lobel |first1=Phillip |last2=Schreiber |first2=Elizabeth A. |last3=McCloskey |first3=Gary |last4=O'Shea |first4=Leo |date=2003 |publisher=Chemical Materials Agency, United States Department of the Army |title=An Ecological Assessment of Johnston Atoll |page=4 |url=http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003673775 |accessdate=July 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915235915/http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003673775 |archivedate=September 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 report states: &quot;The authors of the [2003] report were not DoD employees, nor were they likely familiar with the issues surrounding Herbicide Orange or its actual history of transport to the Island.&quot; and detailed the transport phases and routes of Agent Orange from Vietnam to Johnston Atoll, none of which included Okinawa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;/&gt;

Further official confirmation of restricted (dioxin containing) herbicide storage on Okinawa appeared in a 1971 Fort Detrick report titled &quot;Historical, Logistical, Political and Technical Aspects of the Herbicide/Defoliant Program&quot;, which mentions that the environmental statement should consider &quot;Herbicide stockpiles elsewhere in PACOM (Pacific Command) U.S. Government restricted materials Thailand and Okinawa ([[Kadena AFB]]).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockpile&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title='Herbicide Stockpile' at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa: 1971 U.S. Army report on Agent Orange |first=Jon |last=Mitchell |url=https://apjjf.org/2013/11/1/Jon-Mitchell/3883/article.html |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |volume=11 |issue=1 No. 5 |date=January 14, 2012 |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 DoD report says that the environmental statement urged by the 1971 report was published in 1974 as &quot;The Department of Air Force Final Environmental Statement&quot;, and that the latter did not find Agent Orange was held in either Thailand or Okinawa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blanket2013&quot;/&gt;

===Thailand===
Agent Orange was tested by the United States in Thailand during the Vietnam War. In 1999, buried drums were uncovered and confirmed to be Agent Orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Agent Orange Found Under Resort Airport |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-26/news/9905260083_1_agent-orange-chemical-birth-defects |work=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |date=May 26, 1999 |agency=Tribune News Services |access-date=February 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105085210/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-26/news/9905260083_1_agent-orange-chemical-birth-defects |archive-date=January 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers who uncovered the drums fell ill while upgrading the airport near [[Hua Hin District]], 100&amp;nbsp;km south of Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Boonthan |last=Sakanond |title=Thailand: Toxic Legacy of the Vietnam War |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/1999/05/thailand-toxic-legacy-of-the-vietnam-war/ |location=Bangkok, Thailand |date=May 19, 1999 |agency=Inter Press Service |access-date=February 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707064407/http://www.ipsnews.net/1999/05/thailand-toxic-legacy-of-the-vietnam-war/ |archive-date=July 7, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam-era veterans whose service involved duty on or near the perimeters of military bases in Thailand anytime between February 28, 1961, and May 7, 1975, may have been exposed to herbicides and may qualify for VA benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;VA.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/locations/thailand.asp |title=Thailand Military Bases and Agent Orange Exposure – Public Health |publisher=[[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] |accessdate=10 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227062320/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/locations/thailand.asp |archive-date=27 February 2017 |url-status=live }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A declassified Department of Defense report written in 1973, suggests that there was a significant use of herbicides on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand to remove foliage that provided cover for enemy forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;VA.gov&quot;/&gt; In 2013, the VA determined that herbicides used on the Thailand base perimeters may have been tactical and procured from Vietnam, or a strong, commercial type resembling tactical herbicides.&lt;ref name=&quot;VA.gov&quot;/&gt;

===United States===
The [[University of Hawaii]] has acknowledged extensive testing of Agent Orange on behalf of the United States Department of Defense in Hawaii along with mixtures of Agent Orange on Kaua'i Island in 1967–68 and on Hawaii Island in 1966; testing and storage in other U.S. locations has been documented by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Keever |first1=Beverly Deepe |title=University vulnerable to pitfalls of secret experiments |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/03/27/editorial/special2.html |accessdate=30 March 2017 |work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=March 27, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325150042/http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/03/27/editorial/special2.html |archive-date=25 March 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Health.

In 1971, the C-123 aircraft used for spraying Agent Orange were returned to the United States and assigned various East Coast USAF Reserve squadrons, and then employed in traditional airlift missions between 1972 and 1982. In 1994, testing by the Air Force identified some former spray aircraft as &quot;heavily contaminated&quot; with dioxin residue. Inquiries by aircrew veterans in 2011 brought a decision by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs opining that not enough dioxin residue remained to injure these post-Vietnam War veterans. On 26 January 2012, the U.S. Center For Disease Control's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry challenged this with their finding that former spray aircraft were indeed contaminated and the aircrews exposed to harmful levels of dioxin. In response to veterans' concerns, the VA in February 2014 referred the C-123 issue to the Institute of Medicine for a special study, with results released on January 9, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Agent Orange Residue on Post-Vietnam War Airplanes |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/locations/residue-c123-aircraft/index.asp |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |accessdate=April 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401063001/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/locations/residue-c123-aircraft/index.asp |archive-date=April 1, 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;c-123&quot;/&gt;

Agent Orange was sprayed on thousands of acres of brush in the [[Tennessee Valley]] for 15 years before scientists discovered the herbicide was dangerous. [[Monroe County, Tennessee]], is one of the locations known to have been sprayed according to the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]. Forty-four remote acres were doused with Agent Orange along power lines throughout the National Forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The defoliant Agent Orange, which contains dioxin, was sprayed... |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/12/The-defoliant-Agent-Orange-which-contains-dioxin-was-sprayed/8912421560000/ |work=United Press International |access-date=2020-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822110845/https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/12/The-defoliant-Agent-Orange-which-contains-dioxin-was-sprayed/8912421560000/ |archive-date=2019-08-22 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, New Jersey declared a [[Passaic River]] production site to be a state of emergency. The dioxin pollution in the Passaic River dates back to the Vietnam era, when Diamond Alkali manufactured it in a factory along the river. The tidal river carried dioxin upstream and down, tainting a 17-mile stretch of riverbed in one of New Jersey's most populous areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brickley |first1=Peg |last2=Morgenson |first2=Gretchen |title=Agent Orange's Other Legacy—a $12 Billion Cleanup and a Fight Over Who Pays |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/agent-oranges-other-legacya-12-billion-cleanup-and-a-fight-over-who-pays-1543850435 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=2020-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604004410/https://www.wsj.com/articles/agent-oranges-other-legacya-12-billion-cleanup-and-a-fight-over-who-pays-1543850435 |archive-date=2019-06-04 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2006 Department of Defense report listed Agent Orange testing, storage, and disposal sites at 32 locations throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Thailand, Puerto Rico, Korea, and in the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Young|2006|p=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Veteran Administration has also acknowledged that Agent Orange was used domestically by U.S. forces in test sites throughout the United States. [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida was one of the primary testing sites throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report on DoD Herbicides Outside of Vietnam |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/agentorange/dod_herbicides_outside_vietnam.pdf |publisher=United States Department of Veterans Affairs |accessdate=September 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611133859/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/agentorange/dod_herbicides_outside_vietnam.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup programs==
In February 2012, Monsanto agreed to settle a case covering dioxin contamination around a plant in [[Nitro, West Virginia]], that had manufactured Agent Orange. Monsanto agreed to pay up to $9 million for cleanup of affected homes, $84 million for medical monitoring of people affected, and the community's legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-24/monsanto-says-it-settled-west-virginia-lawsuits-over-nitro-plant |title=Monsanto Settles West Virginia Lawsuits Over Nitro Plant |last=Kaskey |first=Jack |date=February 24, 2012 |publisher=Bloomburg |accessdate=26 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302023817/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-02-24/monsanto-says-it-settled-west-virginia-lawsuits-over-nitro-plant |archive-date=2 March 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wvgazettemail.com/News/201311220094|title=Supreme Court affirms Monsanto pollution settlement in Nitro|date=November 22, 2013|work=Charleston Gazette-Mail|last1=Ward|first1=Ken, Jr.|accessdate=30 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205022132/http://www.wvgazettemail.com/News/201311220094|archive-date=5 December 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 August 2012, the United States and Vietnam began a cooperative cleaning up of the toxic chemical on part of [[Danang International Airport]], marking the first time the U.S. government has been involved in cleaning up Agent Orange in Vietnam. Danang was the primary storage site of the chemical. Two other cleanup sites the United States and Vietnam are looking at is [[Biên Hòa]], in the southern province of [[Đồng Nai Province|Đồng Nai]]—a &quot;hotspot&quot; for dioxin—and [[Phù Cát]] airport in the central province of [[Bình Định]], says U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam [[David Shear]].
