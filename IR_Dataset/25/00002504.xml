The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was [[History of Benzedrine|Benzedrine]], a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions. Currently, [[#Pharmaceutical products|pharmaceutical amphetamine]] is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, [[Adderall]],{{#tag:ref|&quot;Adderall&quot; is a [[brand name]] as opposed to a nonproprietary name; because the latter (&quot;''dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine aspartate''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NDCD&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = National Drug Code Amphetamine Search Results | url = https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/results.cfm?beginrow=1&amp;numberperpage=160&amp;searchfield=amphetamine&amp;searchtype=ActiveIngredient&amp;OrderBy=ProprietaryName | website = National Drug Code Directory| publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | access-date = 16 December 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131216080856/https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/results.cfm?beginrow=1&amp;numberperpage=160&amp;searchfield=amphetamine&amp;searchtype=ActiveIngredient&amp;OrderBy=ProprietaryName | archive-date=16 December 2013 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is excessively long, this article exclusively refers to this amphetamine mixture by the brand name.|name=&quot;Adderall&quot;| group=&quot;note&quot;}} [[dextroamphetamine]], or the inactive [[prodrug]] [[lisdexamfetamine]].

At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as [[euphoria]], change in [[libido|desire for sex]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[Executive functions|cognitive control]]. It induces physical effects such as improved reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce [[Rhabdomyolysis|rapid muscle breakdown]]. [[Addiction]] is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to occur from long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., [[delusion]]s and [[paranoia]]) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.{{#tag:ref|&lt;ref name=&quot;Adderall IR&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Malenka_2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergogenics&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Libido&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Westfall&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amphetamine-induced psychosis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stimulant Misuse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Long-Term Outcomes Medications&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHMH_3e-Addiction doses&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Addiction risk&quot; /&gt;|group=&quot;sources&quot;}}

Amphetamine belongs to the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine class]].

As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring [[trace amine]] neuromodulators, specifically [[phenethylamine]] and {{nowrap|[[N-Methylphenethylamine|''N''-methylphenethylamine]]}}, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while {{nowrap|''N''-methylphenethylamine}} is a [[Structural isomer|positional isomer]] of amphetamine that differs only in the placement of the [[methyl group]].{{#tag:ref|&lt;ref name=&quot;Trace Amines&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EMC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Amphetamine | url = http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/amphetamine | website = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction | access-date = 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amphetamine - a substituted amphetamine&quot; /&gt;|group=&quot;sources&quot;}}

*: Quote from Molecular Neuropharmacology textbook pp. 295: &quot;The ARAS is a complex structure consisting of several different circuits including the four monoaminergic pathways discussed in Chapter 6. The norepinephrine pathway originates from the locus ceruleus (LC) and related brainstem nuclei; the serotonergic neurons originate from the raphe nuclei within the brainstem as well; the dopaminergic neurons originate in ventral tegmental area (VTA); and the histaminergic pathway originates from neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) of the posterior hypothalamus&amp;nbsp;... Norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and histamine have complex modulatory functions and, in general, promote wakefulness.&quot;

* indicate that every monoamine neurotransmitter is involved in energy homeostasis, specify how, and mention which DA/NE-ergic projections are involved [cite PMID 22547886 and the refs I added to the &quot;energy homeostasis&quot; article]
** cover the systems neurobiology of monoaminergic regulation of feeding behavior
* amphetamine-induced hypothalamic CART induction probably plays some role in the mechanism of action, but would need to find a source once its GPCR has been IDed
**quotes on CART's physiological/cognitive effects: &quot;CART promotes physical activity and wakefulness&quot; [PMID 22547886] and markedly inhibits hunger [pubchem amphetamine entry] (pubchem quote: &quot;this anorectic peptide inhibits both normal and starvation-induced feeding and completely blocks the feeding response induced by neuropeptide Y and regulated by leptin in the hypothalamus&quot;)

===Enhancing performance===

====Cognitive performance====
In 2015, a [[systematic review]] and a [[meta-analysis]] of high quality [[clinical trial]]s found that, when used at low (therapeutic) doses, amphetamine produces modest yet unambiguous improvements in cognition, including [[working memory]], long-term [[episodic memory]], [[inhibitory control]], and some aspects of [[Attention#Clinical model|attention]], in normal healthy adults;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unambiguous PFC D1 A2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The Cognition-Enhancing Effects of Psychostimulants Involve Direct Action in the Prefrontal Cortex | journal =Biological Psychiatry| volume = 77 | issue = 11 | pages = 940–950 | year = June 2015 | pmid = 25499957 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.09.013 | quote = The procognitive actions of psychostimulants are only associated with low doses. Surprisingly, despite nearly 80 years of clinical use, the neurobiology of the procognitive actions of psychostimulants has only recently been systematically investigated. Findings from this research unambiguously demonstrate that the cognition-enhancing effects of psychostimulants involve the preferential elevation of catecholamines in the PFC and the subsequent activation of norepinephrine α2 and dopamine D1 receptors.&amp;nbsp;... This differential modulation of PFC-dependent processes across dose appears to be associated with the differential involvement of noradrenergic α2 versus α1 receptors.

Studies with juvenile rats have also indicated that repeated exposure to methylphenidate does not necessarily lead to enhanced drug-seeking behavior in adulthood (38). However, the recent increase of methylphenidate use as a cognitive enhancer by the general public has again raised concerns because of its potential for abuse and addiction (3, 6–10). Thus, although oral administration of clinical doses of methylphenidate is not associated with euphoria or with abuse problems, nontherapeutic use of high doses or i.v. administration may lead to addiction (39, 40).--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=&quot;sources&quot;}}

Genetic or pharmacological blockade of G9a in the NAc potentiates behavioral responses to cocaine and opiates, whereas increasing G9a function exerts the opposite effect (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a). Such drug-induced downregulation of G9a and H3K9me2 also sensitizes animals to the deleterious effects of subsequent chronic stress (Covington et al., 2011). Downregulation of G9a increases the dendritic arborization of NAc neurons, and is associated with increased expression of numerous proteins implicated in synaptic function, which directly connects altered G9a/H3K9me2 in the synaptic plasticity associated with addiction (Maze et al., 2010).&lt;br /&gt;G9a appears to be a critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).&amp;nbsp;... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop.

The obtained results will be crucial in designing a surrogate molecule for amphetamine that can help either in improving the efficacy and bioavailability of the amphetamine drug via competitive inhibition or in redesigning the drug for better pharmacological effects.

For these reasons, observations of dependence and abuse of prescription d-amphetamine are rare in clinical practice, and this stimulant can even be prescribed to people with a history of drug abuse provided certain controls, such as daily pick-ups of prescriptions, are put in place (Jasinski and Krishnan, 2009b).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USVyvanselabel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Drug Approval Package: Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate) NDA #021977 | website=United States Food and Drug Administration | date=24 December 1999 | url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2007/021977s000TOC.cfm | access-date=22 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
