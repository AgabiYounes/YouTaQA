'''Alexandra''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀλεξάνδρα}}) is the feminine form of the given name [[Alexander]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἀλέξανδρος}}, ''Alexandros'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanks Hardcastle Hodges 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanks |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Hanks |last2=Hardcastle |first2=Kate |last3=Hodges |first3=Flavia |title=A Dictionary of First Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |series=Oxford paperback reference |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-861060-1 |oclc=67869278 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nd05X_awIgC&amp;pg=PT52 |page=52 |access-date=5 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name is a compound of the Greek verb {{lang|grc|ἀλέξειν}} (''alexein'') &quot;to defend&quot; and {{lang|grc|ἀνήρ}} (''anēr'') &quot;man&quot; (&lt;small&gt;[[genitive|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|grc|ἀνδρός}} ''andros'').
