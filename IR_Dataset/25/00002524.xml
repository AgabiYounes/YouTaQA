The '''Airbus A300''' is a discontinued [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body airliner]] developed and manufactured by [[Airbus]].
&lt;!--development--&gt;
In September 1967, aircraft manufacturers in the UK, [[France]], and [[West Germany]] signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] to develop a large airliner.
Germany and France reached an agreement on 29 May 1969 after the British withdrew from the project on 10 April 1969.
[[Europe]]an collaborative [[aerospace manufacturer]] Airbus Industrie was formally created on 18 December 1970 to develop and produce it.
The prototype first flew on 28 October 1972.

&lt;!--design--&gt;
The first [[Twinjet|twin-engine]] widebody airliner typically seats 247 passengers in two classes over a [[Range (aircraft)|range]] of 5,375 to 7,500&amp;nbsp;km (2,900 to 4,050&amp;nbsp;nmi).
&lt;!--variants--&gt;
Initial variants are powered by [[General Electric CF6|CF6]]-50 or [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D|JT9D]] turbofans and have a three-crew flight deck.
The improved A300-600 has a two-crew cockpit and updated [[General Electric CF6|GE CF6]]-80 or [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000|PW4000]] engines, it made its first flight on 8 July 1983 and entered service later that year.
The A300 is the basis of the smaller [[Airbus A310|A310]] (first flight: 1982) and was adapted in a freighter version.
Its cross section was retained for the larger [[Airbus A340|A340]] (1991) and [[Airbus A330|A330]] (1992).
It is also the basis for the oversize [[Airbus Beluga|Beluga]] transport (1994).

&lt;!-- operational history--&gt;
Launch customer [[Air France]] introduced the type on 30 May 1974.
After limited demand initially, sales took off as the type was proven in early service, beginning three decades of steady orders.
It has a similar capacity to the [[Boeing 767]]-300, introduced in 1986, but lacked the 767-300ER range.
During the 1990s, the A300 became popular with [[cargo aircraft]] operators, as passenger airliner conversions or as original builds.
Production ceased in July 2007 after 561 deliveries.

==Development==

===Origins===
During the 1960s, European aircraft manufacturers such as [[Hawker Siddeley]] and the [[British Aircraft Corporation]], based in the UK, and [[Sud Aviation]] of France, had ambitions to build a new 200-seat airliner for the growing civil aviation market. While studies were performed and considered, such as a stretched twin-engine variant of the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] and an expanded development of the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] [[BAC One-Eleven]], designated the [[BAC Three-Eleven|BAC Two-Eleven]], it was recognized that if each of the European manufacturers were to launch similar aircraft into the market at the same time, neither would achieve sales volume needed to make them viable.&lt;ref name=&quot;early days&quot;&gt;[http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/ &quot;Early days (1967–1969).&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705195621/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/early-days-1967-1969/ |date=5 July 2011 }} ''Airbus'', Retrieved: 28 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, a British government study, known as the Plowden Report, had found British aircraft production costs to be between 10% and 20% higher than American counterparts due to shorter production runs, which was in part due to the fractured European market. To overcome this factor, the report recommended the pursuit of multinational collaborative projects between the region's leading aircraft manufacturers.&lt;ref name = &quot;bowen 49&quot;&gt;Bowen 2010, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/feb/01/aircraft-industry-plowden-report &quot;Aircraft Industry (Plowden Report).&quot;] ''[[Hansard]]'', February 1966. vol 723, cc890-1016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;international 2-13&quot;&gt;International 1995, pp. 2–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

European manufacturers were keen to explore prospective programs; the proposed 260-seat [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] ''HBN 100'' between Hawker Siddeley, [[Nord Aviation]], and [[Breguet Aviation]] being one such example.&lt;ref name = &quot;early days&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simons 2014, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; National governments were also keen to support such efforts amid a belief that American manufacturers could dominate the [[European Economic Community]];&lt;ref&gt;Chorafas 2012, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, Germany had ambitions for a multinational airliner project to invigorate its aircraft industry, which had declined considerably following the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 2010, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-1960s, both [[Air France]] and [[American Airlines]] had expressed interest in a short-haul twin-engine [[wide-body aircraft]], indicating a market demand for such an aircraft to be produced.&lt;ref name = &quot;bowen 49&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;&gt;[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-at-thirty-family-planning-124235/ &quot;Airbus at thirty – Family planning.&quot;] ''Flight International'', 2 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1967, during a high-profile meeting between French, German, and British ministers, an agreement was made for greater cooperation between European nations in the field of aviation technology, and &quot;for the joint development and production of an airbus&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;early days&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;seng 34&quot;&gt;Senguttuvan 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''airbus'' at this point was a generic aviation term for a larger commercial aircraft, and was considered acceptable in multiple languages, including [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name = &quot;seng 34&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after the July 1967 meeting, French engineer [[Roger Béteille]] was appointed as the technical director of what would become the A300 program, while [[Henri Ziegler]], chief operating office of Sud Aviation, was appointed as the general manager of the organization and German politician [[Franz Josef Strauss]] became the chairman of the supervisory board.&lt;ref name = &quot;early days&quot;/&gt; Béteille drew up an initial work share plan for the project, under which French firms would produce the aircraft's cockpit, the control systems, and lower-center portion of the fuselage, Hawker Siddeley would manufacture the wings, while German companies would produce the forward, rear and upper part of the center fuselage sections. Addition work included moving elements of the wings being produced in the [[Netherlands]], and Spain producing the horizontal tail plane.&lt;ref name = &quot;early days&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 38&quot;/&gt;

An early design goal for the A300 that Béteille had stressed the importance of was the incorporation of a high level of technology, which would serve as a decisive advantage over prospective competitors. As such, the A300 would feature the first use of [[composite material|composite]] materials of any passenger aircraft, the leading and trailing edges of the tail fin being composed of [[Fiberglass|glass fibre reinforced plastic]].&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;international 2-16&quot;&gt;International 1995, pp. 2–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Béteille opted for English as the working language for the developing aircraft, as well against using [[Metric system|Metric]] instrumentation and measurements, as most airlines already had US-built aircraft.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt; These decisions were partially influenced by feedback from various airlines, such as [[Air France]] and [[Lufthansa]], as an emphasis had been placed on determining the specifics of what kind of aircraft that potential operators were seeking. According to Airbus, this cultural approach to market research had been crucial to the company's long term success.&lt;ref name=&quot;first order flight&quot;&gt;[http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/first-order-first-flight-1970-1972/ &quot;First order, first flight (1970–1972).&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401095900/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/first-order-first-flight-1970-1972/ |date=1 April 2015 }} ''Airbus'', Retrieved: 28 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September 1967, the British, French, and West German governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding to start development of the 300-seat Airbus A300.&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 38&quot;&gt;Simons 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flightpath3 p43&quot;&gt;Endres 2004, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;pitt note 57&quot;&gt;Pitt and Norsworthy 2012, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the A300 was only the second major joint aircraft programme in Europe, the first being the Anglo-French [[Concorde]].&lt;ref&gt;Senguttuvan 2006, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the memorandum, Britain and France were each to receive a 37.5 per cent work share on the project, while Germany received a 25 per cent share. Sud Aviation was recognized as the lead company for A300, with Hawker Siddeley being selected as the British partner company.&lt;ref name = &quot;early days&quot;/&gt; At the time, the news of the announcement had been clouded by the British Government's support for the Airbus, which coincided with its refusal to back BAC's proposed competitor, the BAC 2-11, despite a preference for the latter expressed by [[British European Airways]] (BEA).&lt;ref name = &quot;seng 34&quot;/&gt; Another parameter was the requirement for a new engine to be developed by [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] to power the proposed airliner; a derivative of the in-development [[Rolls-Royce RB211]], the [[Turbofan#Three spool|triple-spool]] RB207, capable of producing of 47,500&amp;nbsp;lbf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight international1968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200017.html|title=Aero Engines 1968: &quot;Flight&quot; special review|date=4 January 1968|journal=FLIGHT International|issue=3069|volume=93|pages=19–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1968, the French and British partner companies (Sud Aviation and Hawker Siddeley) proposed a revised configuration, the 250-seat Airbus A250. It had been feared that the original 300-seat proposal was too large for the market, thus it had been scaled down to produce the A250.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;trouble strife&quot;&gt;[https://www.airbus.com/company/history/aircraft-history/1968-1969.html &quot;Trouble and strife (1968–1969).&quot;] ''Airbus'', Retrieved: 28 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;international 2-14&quot;/&gt; The dimensional changes involved in the shrink reduced the length of the fuselage by 5.62 meters and the diameter by 0.8 meters, reducing the overall weight by 25 tonnes.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 16&quot;&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; For increased flexibility, the cabin floor was raised so that standard [[unit load device|LD3 freight containers]] could be accommodated side-by-side, allowing more cargo to be carried. Refinements made by Hawker Siddeley to the wing's design provided for greater lift and overall performance; this gave the aircraft the ability to climb faster and attain a level cruising altitude sooner than any other passenger aircraft.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt; It was later renamed the A300B.&lt;ref name = &quot;seng 34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;trouble strife&quot;/&gt;

Perhaps the most significant change of the A300B was that it would not require new engines to be developed, being of a suitable size to be powered by Rolls-Royce's RB211, or alternatively the American [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] and [[General Electric CF6]] powerplants; this switch was recognized as considerably reducing the project's development costs.&lt;ref name = &quot;trouble strife&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flightpath3 p45&quot;&gt;Endres 2004, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; To attract potential customers in the US market, it was decided that General Electric CF6-50 engines would power the A300 in place of the British RB207; these engines would be produced in co-operation with French firm [[Snecma]].&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt; By this time, Rolls-Royce had been concentrating their efforts upon developing their RB211 [[turbofan]] engine instead and progress on the RB207's development had been slow for some time, the firm having suffered due to funding limitations, both of which had been factors in the engine switch decision.&lt;ref name = &quot;international 2-13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;trouble strife&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 1969, a few months after the decision to drop the RB207 had been announced, the British government announced that they would withdraw from the Airbus venture.&lt;ref name = &quot;trouble strife&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simons 2014, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, West Germany proposed to France that they would be willing to contribute up to 50% of the project's costs if France was prepared to do the same.&lt;ref name = &quot;trouble strife&quot;/&gt; Additionally, the managing director of Hawker Siddeley, [[Arnold Alexander Hall|Sir Arnold Alexander Hall]], decided that his company would remain in the project as a favoured sub-contractor, developing and manufacturing the wings for the A300, which would later become pivotal in later versions' impressive performance from short domestic to long intercontinental flights.&lt;ref name = &quot;international 2-13&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;seng 34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 18&quot;&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawker Siddeley spent £35 million of its own funds, along with a further £35 million loan from the West German government, on the machine tooling to design and produce the wings.&lt;ref name = &quot;trouble strife&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 39&quot;&gt;Simons 2014, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project launch===
[[File:Airbus A300B2-103 (F-WUAD) at Le Bourget Airport.jpg|thumb|An A300 in vintage Airbus livery at Le Bourget in 1977]]

On 29 May 1969, during the [[Paris Air Show]], French transport minister [[Jean Chamant]] and German economics minister [[Karl Schiller]] signed an agreement officially launching the Airbus A300, the world's first twin-engine widebody airliner.&lt;ref name = &quot;early days&quot;/&gt; The intention of the project was to produce an aircraft that was smaller, lighter, and more economical than its three-engine American rivals, the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] and the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]].&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt; In order to meet Air France's demands for an aircraft larger than 250-seat A300B, it was decided to stretch the fuselage to create a new variant, designated as the A300B2, which would be offered alongside the original 250-seat A300B, henceforth referred to as the A300B1. On 3 September 1970, Air France signed a letter of intent for six A300s, marking the first order to be won for the new airliner.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 21&quot;/&gt;

In the aftermath of the Paris Air Show agreement, it was decided that, in order to provide effective management of responsibilities, a [[Groupement d'intérêt économique]] would be established, allowing the various partners to work together on the project while remaining separate business entities.&lt;ref name = &quot;early days&quot;/&gt; On 18 December 1970, Airbus Industrie was formally established following an agreement between [[Aérospatiale]] (the newly merged [[Sud Aviation]] and [[Nord Aviation]]) of France and the antecedents to [[DaimlerChrysler Aerospace|Deutsche Aerospace]] of Germany, each receiving a 50 per cent stake in the newly formed company.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bowen 50&quot;&gt;Bowen 2010, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the consortium was joined by a third full partner, the Spanish firm [[Construcciones Aeronáuticas|CASA]], who received a 4.2 per cent stake, the other two members reducing their stakes to 47.9 per cent each.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 20&quot;/&gt; In 1979, Britain joined the Airbus consortium via [[British Aerospace]], which Hawker Siddeley had merged into, which acquired a 20 per cent stake in Airbus Industrie with France and Germany each reducing their stakes to 37.9 per cent.&lt;ref name = &quot;international 2-14&quot;&gt;International 1995, pp. 2–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bowen 53&quot;/&gt;

Airbus Industrie was initially headquartered in [[Paris]], which is where design, development, flight testing, sales, marketing, and customer support activities were centered; the headquarters was relocated to [[Toulouse]] in January 1974.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt; The final assembly line for the A300 was located adjacent to [[Toulouse Blagnac International Airport]]. The manufacturing process necessitated transporting each aircraft section being produced by the partner companies scattered across Europe to this one location. The combined use of ferries and roads were used for the assembly of the first A300, however this was time-consuming and not viewed as ideal by [[Felix Kracht]], Airbus Industrie's production director.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt; Kracht's solution was to have the various A300 sections brought to Toulouse by a fleet of [[Boeing 377]]-derived [[Aero Spacelines Super Guppy]] aircraft, by which means none of the manufacturing sites were more than two hours away. Having the sections airlifted in this manner made the A300 the first airliner to use [[just-in-time manufacturing]] techniques, and allowed each company to manufacture its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly assemblies.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bowen 53&quot;&gt;Bowen 2010, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1969, construction of the first prototype A300 began.&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 20&quot;&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September 1972, this first prototype was unveiled to the public, it conducted its [[maiden flight]] from Toulouse–Blagnac International Airport on 28 October that year.&lt;ref name = &quot;seng 34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;flightpath3 p51-2&quot;&gt;Endres 2004, pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; This maiden flight, which was performed a month ahead of schedule, lasted for one hour and 25 minutes; the captain was Max Fischl and the first officer was Bernard Ziegler, son of Henri Ziegler.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt; On 5 February 1973, the second prototype performed its maiden flight.&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 39&quot;/&gt; The flight test program, which involved a total of four aircraft, was relatively problem-free, accumulating 1,580 flight hours throughout.&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 22&quot;/&gt; In September 1973, as part of promotional efforts for the A300, the new aircraft was taken on a six-week tour around [[North America]] and [[South America]], to demonstrate it to airline executives, pilots, and would-be customers.&lt;ref name = &quot;first order flight&quot;/&gt; Amongst the consequences of this expedition, it had allegedly brought the A300 to the attention of [[Frank Borman]] of [[Eastern Airlines]], one of the &quot;big four&quot; U.S. airlines.&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt;

On 15 March 1974, [[type certificate]]s were granted for the A300 from both German and French authorities, clearing the way for its entry into revenue service.&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt; On 23 May 1974, [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) certification was received.&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 22&quot;&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The first production model, the A300B2, entered service in 1974, followed by the A300B4 one year later.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt; Initially, the success of the consortium was poor, in part due to the economic consequences of the [[1973 oil crisis]],&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;seng 34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 40&quot;&gt;Simons 2014, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1979 there were 81 A300 passenger liners in service with 14 airlines, alongside 133 firm orders and 88 options.&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt; Ten years after the official launch of the A300, the company had achieved a 26 per cent market share in terms of dollar value, enabling Airbus Industries to proceed with the development of its second aircraft, the [[Airbus A310]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt; It was the launch of the [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] in 1987 that firmly established Airbus as a major player in the aircraft market&amp;nbsp;– over 400 orders were placed before the narrow-body airliner had flown its first flight, compared to 15 for the A300 in 1972.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The Airbus A300 is a [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] medium-to-long range [[airliner]]; it has the distinction of being the first twin-engine wide-body aircraft in the world.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;seng 34&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;tech lead&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pitt and Norsworthy 2012, pp. 57, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the A300 became the first [[ETOPS]]-compliant aircraft, due to its high performance and safety standards.&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 40&quot;/&gt; Another world-first of the A300 is the use of [[composite material|composite]] materials on a commercial aircraft, which was used on both secondary and later primary airframe structures, decreasing overall weight and improving cost-effectiveness.&lt;ref name = &quot;tech lead&quot;/&gt; Other firsts included the pioneering use of [[center of gravity of an aircraft|center-of-gravity]] control, achieved by transferring fuel between various locations across the aircraft, and electrically signaled secondary flight controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;airbus launch&quot;&gt;[http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/first-order-first-flight-1970-1972/a300/ &quot;A300: the aircraft that launched Airbus.&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105931/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/first-order-first-flight-1970-1972/a300/ |date=4 March 2016 }} ''Airbus'', Retrieved: 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The A300 is powered by a pair of underwing [[turbofan]] engines, either [[General Electric CF6#CF6-50|General Electric CF6]] and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] engines; the sole use of underwing engine pods allowed for any suitable turbofan engine to be more readily used.&lt;ref name = &quot;pitt note 57&quot;/&gt; The lack of a third tail-mounted engine, as per the [[trijet]] configuration used by some competing airliners, allowed for the wings to be located further forwards and to reduce the size of the [[vertical stabilizer]] and [[elevator (aeronautics)|elevator]], which had the effect of increasing the aircraft's flight performance and fuel efficiency.&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 21&quot;&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bowen 50&quot;/&gt;

Airbus partners had employed the latest technology, some of which having been derived from [[Concorde]], on the A300. According to Airbus, new technologies adopted for the airliner were selected principally for increased safety, operational capability, and profitability.&lt;ref name = &quot;tech lead&quot;/&gt; Upon entry into service in 1974, the A300 was a very advanced plane, which went on to influence later airliner designs. The technological highlights include:
* Advanced wings by [[de Havilland]] (later [[BAE Systems]]) with:
** [[Supercritical airfoil]] section for economical performance
** advanced [[aerodynamically]] efficient [[flight control surfaces]]
* {{cvt|5.64|m|in|0}} diameter circular fuselage section for 8-abreast passenger seating and wide enough for 2 [[Unit Load Device|LD3]] cargo containers side-by-side
* Structures made from metal [[billet (manufacturing)|billets]], reducing weight
* First airliner to be fitted with [[airborne wind shear detection and alert system|wind shear protection]]
* Advanced autopilots capable of flying the aircraft from climb-out to landing
* Electrically controlled braking system

Later A300s incorporated other advanced features such as the Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit, which enabled a two-pilot flight crew to fly the aircraft alone without the need for a [[flight engineer]], the functions of which were automated; this two-man cockpit concept was a world-first for a wide-body aircraft.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus launch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glass cockpit]] flight instrumentation, which used [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) monitors to display flight, navigation, and warning information, along with fully digital dual autopilots and digital [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control computer]]s for controlling the [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]]s, [[Flap (aeronautics)|flap]]s, and [[leading-edge slats]], were also adopted upon later-built models.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech lead&quot;&gt;[http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/technology-leaders-1977-1979/ &quot;Technology leaders (1977–1979).&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925104335/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/technology-leaders-1977-1979/ |date=25 September 2015 }} ''Airbus'', Retrieved: 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tischler 1996, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional composites were also made use of, such as [[carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] (CFRP), as well as their presence in an increasing proportion of the aircraft's components, including the spoilers, [[rudder]], [[air brake (aeronautics)|air brakes]], and [[landing gear]] doors.&lt;ref&gt;Park 2014, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature of later aircraft were the addition of [[wingtip fence]]s, which generated greater aerodynamic performance (first introduced on the [[Airbus A310|A310-300]]).{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In addition to passenger duties, the A300 became widely used by air freight operators; according to Airbus, it is the best selling freight aircraft of all time.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus launch&quot;/&gt; Various variants of the A300 were built to meet customer demands, often for diverse roles such as [[aerial refueling]] tankers, freighter models (new-build and conversions), [[combi aircraft]], military [[airlift]]er, and [[VIP]] transport. Perhaps the most visually unique of the variants is the [[Airbus Beluga|A300-600ST Beluga]], an oversize cargo-carrying model operated by Airbus to carry aircraft sections between their manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus launch&quot;/&gt; The A300 was the basis for, and retained a high level of commonality with, the second airliner produced by Airbus, the smaller [[Airbus A310]].&lt;ref name = &quot;tech lead&quot;/&gt;

==Operational history==
[[File:Air France Airbus A300B2 1974 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|left|[[Air France]] A300B2 at [[Farnborough Airshow]] in 1974]]

On 23 May 1974, the first A300 to enter service performed the first commercial flight of the type, flying from Paris to London, for [[Air France]].&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 39&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt;

Immediately after the launch, sales of the A300 were weak for some years, with most orders going to airlines that had an obligation to favor the domestically made product&amp;nbsp;– notably Air France and [[Lufthansa]], the first two airlines to place orders for the type.&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowen 2010, pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appointment of [[Bernard Lathière]] as Henri Ziegler's replacement, an aggressive sales approach was adopted. [[Indian Airlines]] was the world's first domestic airline to purchase the A300, ordering three aircraft with three options. However, between December 1975 and May 1977, there were no sales for the type. During this period a number of &quot;whitetail&quot; A300s&amp;nbsp;– completed but unsold aircraft&amp;nbsp;– were completed and stored at Toulouse, and production fell to half an aircraft per month amid calls to pause production completely.&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt;

During the flight testing of the A300B2, Airbus held a series of talks with [[Korean Air]] on the topic of developing a longer-range version of the A300, which would become the A300B4. In September 1974, Korean Air placed an order for 4 A300B4s with options for 2 further aircraft; this sale was viewed as significant as it was the first non-European international airline to order Airbus aircraft. Airbus had viewed South-East Asia as a vital market that was ready to be opened up and believed Korean Air to be the 'key'.&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;&gt;[http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/champagneand-drought-1973-1977/ &quot;Champagne&amp;nbsp;... and drought (1973–1977).&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401100121/http://www.airbus.com/company/history/the-narrative/champagneand-drought-1973-1977/ |date=1 April 2015 }} ''Airbus'', Retrieved: 28 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 23&quot;&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Airlines operating the A300 on short haul routes were forced to reduce frequencies to try and fill the aircraft. As a result, they lost passengers to airlines operating more frequent narrow body flights. Eventually, Airbus had to build its own narrowbody aircraft (the A320) to compete with the [[Boeing 737]] and [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]/[[McDonnell Douglas MD-80|MD-80]]. The savior of the A300 was the advent of [[ETOPS|Extended Range Twin Operations (ETOPS)]], a revised [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] rule which allows twin-engine jets to fly long-distance routes that were previously off-limits to them. This enabled Airbus to develop the aircraft as a medium/long range airliner.

In 1977, US carrier [[Eastern Air Lines]] leased four A300s as an in-service trial.&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt; [[Frank Borman]], ex-astronaut and the then CEO of the airline, was impressed that the A300 consumed 30% less fuel, even more economical than expected, in contrast to his fleet of [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar|Tristars]] and proceeded to order 23 A300s, becoming the first U.S. customer for the type. This order is often cited as the point at which Airbus came to be seen as a serious competitor to the large American aircraft-manufacturers [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell Douglas]].&lt;ref name = &quot;airbus 30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;simon 40&quot;/&gt; Aviation author John Bowen alleged that various concessions, such as loan guarantees from European governments and compensation payments, were a factor in the decision as well.&lt;ref name = &quot;bowen 52&quot;/&gt; The Eastern Air Lines breakthrough was shortly followed by an order from [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]]. From then on, the A300 family sold well, eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Airbus_Deliveries&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Aerocondor Colombia Airbus A300B4-2C at SFO.jpg|thumb|[[Aerocondor Colombia]] A300B4 at [[San Francisco International Airport]] in 1978]]
In December 1977, [[Aerocondor Colombia|Aerocondor]] [[Colombia]] became the first [[Airbus]] operator in [[Latin America]], leasing one Airbus A300B4-2C, named ''[[Barranquilla|Ciudad de Barranquilla]]''.

During the late 1970s, Airbus adopted a so-called '[[Silk Road]]' strategy, targeting airlines in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Champagne and Drought&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;bowen 52&quot;&gt;Bowen 2010, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, The aircraft found particular favor with Asian airlines, being bought by [[Japan Air System]], [[Korean Air]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Thai Airways International]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Philippine Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]], [[China Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], [[Indian Airlines]], [[Trans Australia Airlines]] and many others. As Asia did not have restrictions similar to the FAA [[ETOPS|60-minutes rule]] for twin-engine airliners which existed at the time, Asian airlines used A300s for routes across the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[South China Sea]].

In 1977, the A300B4 became the first [[ETOPS]] compliant aircraft&amp;nbsp;– its high performance and safety standards qualified it for Extended Twin Engine Operations over water, providing operators with more versatility in routing.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} In 1982 [[Garuda Indonesia]] became the first airline to fly the A300B4-200FF. By 1981, Airbus was growing rapidly, with over 300 aircraft sold and options for 200 more planes for over forty airlines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 1989, Chinese operator [[China Eastern Airlines]] received its first A300; by 2006, the airline operated around 18 A300s, making it the largest operator of both the A300 and the A310 at that time. On 31 May 2014, China Eastern officially retired the last A300-600 in its fleet, having begun drawing down the type in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Hashim, Firdaus.

From 1997 to 2014, a single A300, designated [[Weightlessness#European Space Agency A300 Zero-G|A300 Zero-G]], was operated by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), [[CNES|centre national d'études spatiales]] (CNES) and the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) as a [[reduced-gravity aircraft]] for conducting research into [[weightlessness|microgravity]]; the A300 is the largest aircraft to ever have been used in this capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Beysens and van Loon 2015, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; A typical flight would last for two and a half hours, enabling up to 30 [[parabola]]s to be performed per flight.&lt;ref&gt;Beysens and van Loon 2015, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Research/Experience_weightlessness_on_board_the_Zero-G_Airbus &quot;Experience weightlessness on board the 'Zero-G' Airbus.&quot;] ''European Space Agency'', Retrieved: 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, the A300 was being heavily promoted as a cargo freighter.&lt;ref name = &quot;nor wag 24&quot;&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest freight operator of the A300 is [[FedEx Express]], which has 68 A300 aircraft in service. [[UPS Airlines]] also operates 52 freighter versions of the A300. The final version was the A300-600R and is rated for 180-minute [[ETOPS]]. The A300 has enjoyed renewed interest in the secondhand market for conversion to freighters; large numbers were being converted during the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Norris and Wagner 1999, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The freighter versions&amp;nbsp;– either new-build A300-600s or converted ex-passenger A300-600s, A300B2s and B4s&amp;nbsp;– account for most of the world freighter fleet after the [[Boeing 747]] freighter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The A300 provided Airbus the experience of manufacturing and selling airliners competitively. The basic fuselage of the A300 was later stretched ([[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A340|A340]]), shortened (A310), or modified into derivatives ([[Airbus Beluga|A300-600ST ''Beluga'' Super Transporter]]).

Only two were built: the first prototype, registered F-WUAB, then F-OCAZ, and a second aircraft, F-WUAC, which was leased in November 1974 to [[Trans European Airways]] (TEA) and re-registered OO-TEF. TEA instantly subleased the aircraft for six weeks to [[Air Algérie]], but continued to operate the aircraft until 1990. It had accommodation for 300 passengers (TEA) or 323 passengers (Air Algérie) with a maximum weight of 132,000&amp;nbsp;kg and two [[General Electric CF6|General Electric CF6-50A]] engines of 220&amp;nbsp;kN thrust. The A300B1 was five frames shorter than the later production versions, being only {{cvt|50.97|m|ft|1}} in length.

===A300B2===
The first production version. Powered by General Electric CF6 or [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] engines (the same engines that powered the 747 or the DC-10) of between 227 and 236&amp;nbsp;kN thrust, it entered service with Air France in May 1974. The prototype A300B2 made its first flight on 28 June 1973 and was certificated by the French and German authorities on 15 March 1974 and FAA approval followed on 30 May 1974. The first production A300B2 (A300 number 5) made its maiden flight on 15 April 1974 and was handed over to Air France a few weeks later on 10 May 1974. The A300B2 entered revenue service on 23 May 1974 between Paris and London.

Officially designated A300B4-600, this version is nearly the same length as the B2 and B4 but has increased space because it uses the A310 rear fuselage and horizontal tail. It has higher-power [[General Electric CF6|CF6-80]] or [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000]] engines and uses the [[Honeywell]] 331-250 [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU).&lt;ref name=hw&gt;{{Cite web|title=Honeywell 331-250 APU|url=http://www.honeywell.com/sites/portal?smap=aerospace&amp;page=Power_Systems3&amp;theme=T5&amp;catID=CB6099334-14AB-C264-AB94-8E47224CA642&amp;id=H544A09A8-A70B-FA73-F93C-6AEFB3D0FB6D&amp;sel=4|accessdate=18 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320002847/http://www.honeywell.com/sites/portal?smap=aerospace&amp;page=Power_Systems3&amp;theme=T5&amp;catID=CB6099334-14AB-C264-AB94-8E47224CA642&amp;id=H544A09A8-A70B-FA73-F93C-6AEFB3D0FB6D&amp;sel=4|archivedate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes include an improved wing featuring a recambered trailing edge, the incorporation of simpler single-slotted Fowler [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]], the deletion of slat fences, and the removal of the outboard [[ailerons]] after they were deemed unnecessary on the A310.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%202008.html|publisher=Flight International|title=Commercial Aircraft of the World|access-date=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A300-600 made its first flight on 8 July 1983 and entered service later that year with [[Saudi Arabian Airlines]]. A total of 313 A300-600s (all versions) have been sold. The A300-600 also has a similar cockpit to the A310, eliminating the need for a flight engineer. The FAA issues a single type rating which allows operation of both the A310 and A300-600.
