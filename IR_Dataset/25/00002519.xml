'''Adelaide of Italy''' ({{lang-de|Adelheid}}; 931{{snd}}16 December 999 AD), also called '''Adelaide of Burgundy''', was [[Holy Roman Empress]] by marriage to Emperor [[Otto the Great]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;&gt;Campbell, Thomas. &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01140c.htm St. Adelaide.]&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;; she was crowned with him by [[Pope John XII]] in [[Rome]] on 2 February 962. She was regent of the Holy Roman Empire as the guardian of her grandson in 991-995.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;

==Life==
===Early life===
Born in [[Orbe Castle]], [[Orbe]], Kingdom of [[Upper Burgundy]] (now in modern-day [[Switzerland]]), she was the daughter of [[Rudolf II of Burgundy]], a member of the [[Elder House of Welf]], and [[Bertha of Swabia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Appendix'', ''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024'', ed. Timothy Reuter, Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 699.&lt;/ref&gt; 

She became involved from the beginning in the complicated fight to control not only Burgundy but also Lombardy. The battle between her father Rudolf II and [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I]] to control northen Italy ended with Berengar’s death, and Rudolf could claimed the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imperial ladies of the Ottonian Dynasty: women and rule in tenth-century Germany|last=Jestice|first=Phyllis G.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2018|isbn=978-3-319-77305-6|location=|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the inhabitants of Lombardy weren’t happy with this decision and called for help of another ally, [[Hugh of Italy|Hugh of Provence]], who considered Rudolf an enemy for a long time. Although Hugh challenged Rudolf for the Burgundian throne, he only succeeded when Adelaide’s father died in 937&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imperial ladies of the Ottonian Dynasty: women and rule in tenth-century Germany|last=Jestice|first=Phyllis G.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2018|isbn=978-3-319-77305-6|location=|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in order to be able to control Upper Burgundy he decided to marry his son [[Lothair II of Italy|Lothair II]], the nominal [[King of Italy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The big book of women saints|last=Gallick|first=Sarah|publisher=Pymble, NSW: HarperCollins e-books|year=2009|isbn=978-0061956560|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with Adelaide (in 947, before  June 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;) who was fifteen years old. 

The marriage produced a daughter, [[Emma of Italy]], born about 948. She became Queen of Western France by marrying King [[Lothair of France]].

===Empress===
[[Image:Meissner-dom-stifter.jpg|thumb|left|Adelaide and her second spouse Otto&amp;nbsp;I; [[Meissen Cathedral]], Germany.]]

The [[Calendar of Saints]] states that her first husband was poisoned, on [[November 22]] of 950 in [[Turin]], by the holder of real power, his successor, [[Berengar II of Italy]].

Not only did some people of Lombardy suggest that Adelaide wanted to rule the kingdom by herself,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imperial ladies of the Ottonian Dynasty: women and rule in tenth-century Germany|last=Jestice|first=Phyllis G.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2018|isbn=978-3-319-77305-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Berengar attempted to cement his political power by forcing her to marry his son, [[Adalbert of Ivrea|Adalbert]]. The young widow refused and fled, taking refuge in the castle of [[Como]]. Nevertheless, she was quickly tracked down and imprisoned for four months at [[Garda, Veneto|Garda]].

According to Adelaide's contemporary biographer, [[Odilo of Cluny]], she managed to escape from captivity. After a time spent in the marshes nearby, she was rescued by a priest and taken to a &quot;certain impregnable fortress,&quot; likely the fortified town of [[Canossa Castle]] near [[Reggio nell'Emilia|Reggio]].&lt;ref&gt;Odilo of Cluny, ''Epitaph of Adelheid'' ch. 3, in Gilsdorf, ''Queenship and Sanctity'', 131&lt;/ref&gt; She managed to send an emissary to [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], and asked the [[East Francia|East Frankish]] king for his protection. The widow met Otto at the old [[Lombards|Lombard]] capital of [[Pavia]] and they married on 23 September 951.&lt;ref&gt;''Burgundy and Provence, 879–1032'', Constance Brittain Bouchard,''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024'', 342.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A few years later, in 953, [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia]], Otto's son by his first marriage, made a big revolt against his father that was quelled by the latter. On account of this episode, Otto decided to dispossess Liudolf of his ducal title. This decision favoured the position of Adelaide and her descendants at court. Adelaide also managed to retain her entire territorial dowry.

After returning to Germany with his new wife, Otto cemented the existence of the Holy Roman Empire by defeating the Hungarian invaders at the [[battle of Lechfeld]] (August 10, 955). In addition, he extended the boundaries of [[East Francia]] beyond the [[Elbe River]], defeating the Obrodites and other Slavs of the Elbe at the battle of Recknitz ([[October 16]], 955).

Adelaide accompanied her husband on his second expedition to Italy, destined to subdue the revolt of Berengar II and to protect [[Pope John XII]]. In [[Rome]], Otto the Great was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] on [[February 2]], 962 by Pope John XII and breaking tradition, also crowned Adelaide as [[Holy Roman Empress]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ottonians as kings and emperors'', Eckhard Müller-Mertens, ''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024'', 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, Adelaide and their eleven-year-old son, [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&amp;nbsp;II]], traveled again with Otto in 966 on his third expedition to Italy, where the Emperor restored the newly elected [[Pope John XIII]] to his throne (and executed some of the Roman rioters who had deposed him). 

Adelaide remained in Rome for six years while Otto ruled his kingdom from Italy. Their son Otto II was crowned co-emperor in 967, then married the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu]] in April 972, resolving the conflict between the two empires in southern Italy, as well as ensuring the imperial succession. Adelaide and her husband then returned to Germany, where Otto died in May 973, at the same [[Memleben]] palace where his father had died 37 years earlier.

===Regency===
In the years following Oto's death, Adelaide exerted a powerful influence at court. However, her daughter-in-law, the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu]], turned her husband against her and Adelaide was expelled from court in 978. During her exile, she divided her time living partly in [[Italy]] and partly in [[Arles]] with her brother [[Conrad I of Burgundy|Conrad of Burgundy]], King of Burgundy, through whom she was finally reconciled with her son; in 983 (shortly before his death) Otto II appointed her his viceroy in Italy.

In 983, her son Otto II died and was succeeded by her grandson [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] under the regency of his mother Adelaide's daughter-in-law Dowager Empress Theophanu while Adelaide remained in Italy. When Theophanu died in 990, Adelaide assumed regency on behalf of her grandson the Emperor until he reached legal majority four years later. Adelaide resigned as regent when Otto III was declared of legal majority in 995 and then was free to devote herself exclusively to her works of charity, in particular to the foundation and restoration of religious houses: monasteries, churches and abbeys.

Adelaide had long entertained close relations with [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], then the center of the movement for ecclesiastical reform, and in particular with its abbots [[Majolus]] and [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]]. She retired to a nunnery she had founded in c.&amp;nbsp;991 at [[Selz Abbey|Selz]] in [[Alsace]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-adelaide-of-burgundy Saint Adelaide of Burgundy]&quot;. Saints.SQPN.com. 15 June 2012. Web. {2012-9-20}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On her way to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] to support her nephew [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolf&amp;nbsp;III]] against a rebellion, she died at Selz Abbey on 16 December 999, days short of the millennium she thought would bring the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. She was buried in the Abbey and [[Pope Urban II]] canonized her in 1097.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Peter H. |title=The Holy Roman Empire: A Thousand Years of Europe's History |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin Books Limited |isbn=978-0-14-195691-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=I5lFCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT374&amp;lpg=PT374&amp;dq=Adelaide+of+Italy+canonization#v=onepage&amp;q=Adelaide%20of%20Italy%20canonization&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although after serious flooding, which almost completely destroyed it in 1307, the saint's relics, miraculously saved, were moved to the parish church in the town of Seltz, dedicated to [[Saint Stephen]], where they now rest.

Adelaide had constantly devoted herself to the service of the church and peace, and to the empire as guardian of both; she also interested herself in the conversion of the [[early Slavs|Slavs]]. She was thus a principal agent&amp;mdash;almost an embodiment&amp;mdash;of the work of the pre-[[East-West Schism|schism]] [[Orthodox Catholic Church]] at the end of the [[Early Middle Ages]] in the construction of the religious culture of Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Saints: A concise Biographical Dictionary|first=John|last=Coulson|publisher= Hawthorn Books, Inc.|year= 1960|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/adelaide.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of her relics are preserved in a shrine in Hanover.  Her feast day, 16 December, is still kept in many German dioceses.

==Issue==
In 947, Adelaide was married to King [[Lothair II of Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holböck126&quot;&gt;Ferdinand Holböck, ''Married Saints and Blesseds: Through the Centuries'', transl. Michael J. Miller, (Ignatius Press, 2002), 126.&lt;/ref&gt; The union produced one child:
* [[Emma of Italy]] (born 948 - † after 987), queen of France and wife of [[Lothair of France]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Holböck126&quot; /&gt;

In 951, Adelaide was married to King [[Otto I]], the future Holy Roman Emperor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holböck127&quot;&gt;Ferdinand Holböck, ''Married Saints and Blesseds: Through the Centuries'', 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The union produced four children:
* Henry (born 952 - † September 8, 957)&lt;ref name=&quot;Holböck127&quot; /&gt;
* Bruno (born 953 - † 6 February 999)&lt;ref name=&quot;Holböck127&quot; /&gt;
* [[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Matilda]]{{snd}}(born 954 - † 6 February 999), the first [[Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Holböck127&quot; /&gt;
* [[Otto II]] (born 955 - † 7th December 983), later [[Holy Roman Emperor]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Holböck127&quot; /&gt;

==Legacy, art, and literature==
Adelaide is usually represented in the garb of an empress, with sceptre and crown. Since [[14th century]], it is also given as an attribute a model church or a ship (with which it is said to have escaped from captivity).

The most famous representation of German art belongs to a group of sandstone figures in the choir of [[Meissen Cathedral]], which was created around 1260. She is shown here with her husband, who was not canonized, since he founded the diocese of Meissen with her.
