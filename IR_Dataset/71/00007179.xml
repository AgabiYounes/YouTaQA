One of Elwes' relatives is [[John Elwes (politician)|John Elwes]], who was believed to be the inspiration for [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] in ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' (1843), having been referenced by [[Charles Dickens]] himself in chapter six of his last completed novel, ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literaturepage.com/read/dickens-our-mutual-friend-577.html||first=Michael| last=Moncur|publisher=The Literature Page|title=Charles Dickens: Our Mutual Friend}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/man-who-inspired-ebenezer-scrooge/|title=John Elwes: scrimper who inspired Ebenezer Scrooge|first=Norman|last=Miller|date=20 September 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elwes himself played five roles in the [[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|2009 film adaptation]] of ''A Christmas Carol''.

Elwes was brought up as a [[Roman Catholic]] and was an [[altar boy]] at [[Westminster Cathedral]], although he did not attend [[denominational]] schools as most of the men on his father's side of the family had, including his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Guthrie |first=Marisa |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/12/04/2005-12-04_the_spirit_moved_him.html |title=The spirit moved him |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |quote=Elwes, who grew up a Catholic... |date=4 December 2005 |accessdate=13 September 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61zzNYuVF?url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2005-12-04/entertainment/18305424_1_vatican-residence-pope-john-paul-ii-papal |archivedate=27 September 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal relatives include such [[clerics]] as [[Dudley Charles Cary-Elwes]] (1868–1932), the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Northampton|Bishop of Northampton]], Abbott [[Columba Cary-Elwes]] ([[Ampleforth Abbey]], [[Saint Louis Abbey]]), and Father Luke Cary-Elwes ([[Fort Augustus Abbey]]).
