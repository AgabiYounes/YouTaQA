The '''Communist Party of China''' ('''CPC'''){{NoteTag|{{Lang-zh |c = 中国共产党 |p = Zhōngguó Gòngchǎndǎng }}; sometimes referred to in English as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).}}&lt;!-- Do not add languages here as they're mentioned above. --&gt; is the founding and [[Ruling party|ruling political party]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC). The CPC is the [[One-party state|sole governing party]] within [[mainland China]], [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|permitting only eight other]], subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the [[United Front (China)|United Front]]. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]]. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT)'s [[nationalist government]] from [[mainland China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It also controls the world's largest armed forces, the [[People's Liberation Army]].

The CPC is officially organised on the basis of [[democratic centralism]], a principle conceived by Russian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] [[Vladimir Lenin]] which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]], convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] and its [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]]. The [[List of leaders of the Communist Party of China|party's leader]] recently holds the offices of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] (responsible for civilian party duties), [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and [[President of the People's Republic of China|State President]] (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts, the party leader is the country's [[paramount leader]]. The current paramount leader is General Secretary [[Xi Jinping]], elected at the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th National Congress]] held in October 2012.

The CPC is committed to [[communism]] and continues to participate in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]] each year. According to the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party constitution]], the CPC adheres to [[Marxism–Leninism]], [[Mao Zedong Thought]], [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]], the [[Three Represents]], the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]], and [[Xi Jinping Thought]]. The official explanation for [[Reform and opening-up|China's economic reforms]] is that the country is in the [[primary stage of socialism]], a developmental stage similar to the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. The [[command economy]] established under [[Mao Zedong]] was replaced by the [[socialist market economy]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]], the [[Economy of China|current economic system]], on the basis that &quot;Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth&quot;.

Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of Eastern European communist governments]] in 1989–1990 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the CPC has emphasised its party-to-party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining [[socialist state]]s. While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling [[communist parties]] around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of [[one-party states]] (whatever their ideology), [[Dominant-party system|dominant parties]] in [[democracies]] (whatever their ideology) and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties.

The CPC has its origins in the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, during which radical Western ideologies like [[Marxism]] and [[Anarchism in China|anarchism]] gained traction among [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectuals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;XinhuaCCPhistory&quot; /&gt; Other influences stemming from the Bolshevik revolution and Marxist theory inspired the Communist Party of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |location= |page = 114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Li Dazhao]] was the first leading Chinese intellectual who publicly supported [[Leninism]] and [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=26}} In contrast to [[Chen Duxiu]], Li did not renounce participation in the affairs of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} Both of them regarded the [[October Revolution]] in Russia as groundbreaking, believing it to herald a new era for oppressed countries everywhere.{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} The CPC was modeled on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s theory of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|pp=34–38}} Study circles were, according to [[Cai Hesen]], &quot;the rudiments [of our party]&quot;.{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=38}} Several study circles were established during the [[New Culture Movement]], but &quot;by 1920 skepticism about their suitability as vehicles for reform had become widespread.&quot;{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=44}}

The [[1st National Congress of the Communist Party of China|founding National Congress]] of the CPC was held on 23–31 July 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinatoday.com/org/cpc/cpc_1st_congress_standing_polibureau.htm |title=1st.

The communists dominated the left wing of the KMT, a party organized on Leninist lines, struggling for power with the party's right wing.{{sfn|Schram|1966|pp=84, 89}} When KMT leader [[Sun Yat-sen]] died in March 1925, he was succeeded by a rightist, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who initiated moves to marginalize the position of the communists.{{sfn|Schram|1966|pp=84, 89}} Fresh from the success of the [[Northern Expedition]] to overthrow the warlords, Chiang Kai-shek turned on the communists, who by now numbered in the tens of thousands across China.{{sfn|Feigon|2002|p=42}} Ignoring the orders of the Wuhan-based KMT government, he marched on Shanghai, a city controlled by communist militias. Although the communists welcomed Chiang's arrival, he turned on them, [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|massacring 5000]] with the aid of the [[Green Gang]].{{sfn|Feigon|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Schram|1966|p=106}}{{sfn|Carter|1976|pp=61–62}} Chiang's army then marched on Wuhan, but was prevented from taking the city by CPC General [[Ye Ting]] and his troops.{{sfn|Schram|1966|p=112}} Chiang's allies also attacked communists; in Beijing, 19 leading communists were killed by [[Zhang Zuolin]], while in Changsha, He Jian's forces machine gunned hundreds of peasant militiamen.{{sfn|Schram|1966|pp=106–109, 112–113}}{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=62}} That May, tens of thousands of communists and their sympathizers were killed by nationalists, with the CPC losing approximately {{formatnum:15000}} of its {{formatnum:25000}} members.{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=62}}

The CPC continued supporting the Wuhan KMT government,{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=62}} but on 15 July 1927 the Wuhan government expelled all communists from the KMT.{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=63}} The CPC reacted by founding the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army of China, better known as the &quot;[[History of the People's Liberation Army#From the founding of the People's Liberation Army to the Korean War|Red Army]]&quot;, to battle the KMT. A battalion led by General [[Zhu De]] was ordered to take the city of [[Nanchang]] on 1 August 1927 in what became known as the [[Nanchang uprising]]; initially successful, they were forced into retreat after five days, marching south to [[Shantou]], and from there being driven into the wilderness of [[Fujian]].{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=63}} [[Mao Zedong]] was appointed commander-in-chief of the Red Army, and led four regiments against Changsha in the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]], hoping to spark peasant uprisings across Hunan.{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=64}} His plan was to attack the KMT-held city from three directions on 9 September, but the Fourth Regiment deserted to the KMT cause, attacking the Third Regiment. Mao's army made it to Changsha, but could not take it; by 15 September, he accepted defeat, with 1,000 survivors marching east to the [[Jinggang Mountains]] of [[Jiangxi]].{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=64}}{{sfn|Schram|1966|pp=122–125}}{{sfn|Feigon|2002|pp=46–47}}

The near-destruction of the CPC's urban organizational apparatus led to institutional changes within the party.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} The party adopted [[democratic centralism]], a way to organize revolutionary parties, and established a [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] (to function as the standing committee of the Central Committee).{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} The result was increased centralization of power within the party .{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} At every level of the party this was duplicated, with standing committees now in effective control.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} After Chen Duxiu's dismissal, [[Li Lisan]] was able to assume ''de facto'' control of the party organization by 1929–30.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} Li Lisan's leadership was a failure, leaving the CPC on the brink of destruction.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} The [[Comintern]] became involved, and by late 1930, his powers had been taken away.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} By 1935 Mao had become the party's [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] member and informal leader, with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Zhang Wentian]], the formal head of the party, serving as his informal deputies.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} The conflict with the KMT led to the reorganization of the Red Army, with power now centralized in the leadership through the creation of CPC political departments charged with supervising the army.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}}

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] caused a pause in the conflict between the CPC and the KMT.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=370}} The [[Second United Front]] was established between the CPC and the KMT to tackle the invasion.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=354}} While the front formally existed until 1945, all collaboration between the two parties had ended by 1940.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=354}} Despite their formal alliance, the CPC used the opportunity to expand and carve out independent bases of operations to prepare for the coming war with the KMT.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}} In 1939 the KMT began to restrict CPC expansion within China.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}} This led to frequent clashes between CPC and KMT forces{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}} but which subsided rapidly on the realisation on both sides that civil war was not an option.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}} Yet, by 1943, the CPC was again actively expanding its territory at the expense of the KMT.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}}

[[Mao Zedong]] became the [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] in 1945. From 1945 until 1949, the war had been reduced to two parties; the CPC and the KMT.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} This period lasted through four stages; the first was from August 1945 (when the Japanese surrendered) to June 1946 (when the peace talks between the CPC and the KMT ended).{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} By 1945, the KMT had three-times more soldiers under its command than the CPC and initially appeared to be prevailing.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} With the cooperation of the Americans and the Japanese, the KMT was able to retake major parts of the country.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} However, KMT rule over the reconquered territories would prove unpopular because of endemic party corruption.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} Notwithstanding its huge numerical superiority, the KMT failed to reconquer the rural territories which made up the CPC's stronghold.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} Around the same time, the CPC launched an invasion of [[Manchuria]], where they were assisted by the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} The second stage, lasting from July 1946 to June 1947, saw the KMT extend its control over major cities, such as [[Yan'an]] (the CPC headquarters for much of the war).{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=95}} The KMT's successes were hollow; the CPC had tactically withdrawn from the cities, and instead attacked KMT authorities by instigating protests amongst students and intellectuals in the cities (the KMT responded to these events with heavy-handed repression).{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=96}} In the meantime, the KMT was struggling with factional infighting and Chiang Kai-shek's autocratic control over the party, which weakened the KMT's ability to respond to attacks.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=96}} The third stage, lasting from July 1947 to August 1948, saw a limited counteroffensive by the CPC.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=96}} The objective was clearing &quot;Central China, strengthening North China, and recovering Northeast China.&quot;{{sfn|Leung|1996|p=96}} This policy, coupled with desertions from the KMT military force (by the spring of 1948, the KMT military had lost an estimated 2 of its 3 million troops) and declining popularity of KMT rule.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=96}} The result was that the CPC was able to cut off KMT garrisons in [[Manchuria]] and retake several lost territories.{{sfn|Leung|1996|p=96}} The last stage, lasting from September 1948 to December 1949, saw the communists take the initiative and the collapse of KMT rule in mainland China as a whole.{{sfn|Leung|1996|p=96}} On 1 October 1949, Mao declared the establishment of the PRC, which signified the end of the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Chinese Revolution]] (as it is officially described by the CPC).{{sfn|Leung|1996|p=96}}

Following Mao's death in 1976, a power struggle between CPC Chairman [[Hua Guofeng]] and Vice-chairman [[Deng Xiaoping]] erupted.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=47}} Deng won the struggle, and became the &quot;paramount leader&quot; in 1978.{{sfn|Wong|2005|p=47}} Deng, alongside [[Hu Yaobang]] and [[Zhao Ziyang]], spearheaded the [[Reform and opening]] policy, and introduced the ideological concept of [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], opening China to the world's markets.{{sfn|Sullivan|2012|p=254}} In reversing some of Mao's &quot;leftist&quot; policies, Deng argued that a [[socialist state]] could use the [[market economy]] without itself being capitalist.&lt;ref name=&quot;marketvsplanning&quot;/&gt; While asserting the political power of the Party, the change in policy generated significant economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;XinhuaCCPhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/29/c_13851746.htm | agency = [[Xinhua News Agency]] | date = 29 April 2011 | title = History of the Communist Party of China | accessdate = 4 January 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150329021437/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-04/29/c_13851746.htm | archive-date = 29 March 2015 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new ideology, however, was contested on both sides of the spectrum, by Maoists as well as by those supporting political liberalization. With other social factors, the conflicts culminated in the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2012|p=25}} The protests having been crushed, Deng's vision on economics prevailed, and by the early 1990s the concept of a [[socialist market economy]] had been introduced.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=682}} In 1997, Deng's beliefs (Deng Xiaoping Theory), were embedded in the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|CPC constitution]].{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=684}}

CPC general secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] succeeded Deng as &quot;paramount leader&quot; in the 1990s, and continued most of his policies.{{sfn|Sullivan|2012|p=100}} As part of Jiang Zemin's nominal legacy, the CPC ratified the [[Three Represents]] for the 2003 revision of the party's constitution, as a &quot;guiding ideology&quot; to encourage the party to represent &quot;advanced productive forces, the progressive course of China's culture, and the fundamental interests of the people.&quot;{{sfn|Sullivan|2012|p=238}} The theory legitimized the entry of private business owners and [[bourgeois]] elements into the party.{{sfn|Sullivan|2012|p=238}} [[Hu Jintao]], Jiang Zemin's successor as General Secretary, took office in 2002.{{sfn|Sullivan|2012|p=317}} Unlike Mao, Deng and Jiang Zemin, Hu laid emphasis on [[collective leadership]] and opposed one-man dominance of the political system.{{sfn|Sullivan|2012|p=317}} The insistence on focusing on economic growth led to a [[Social issues in the People's Republic of China|wide range of serious social problems]].

== Governance ==
=== Collective leadership ===
[[Collective leadership]], the idea that decisions will be taken through consensus, is the ideal in the CPC.{{sfn|Unger|2002|p=22}} The concept has its origins back to [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the Russian Bolshevik Party.{{sfn|Baylis|1989|p=102}} At the level of the central party leadership this means that, for instance, all members of the Politburo Standing Committee are of equal standing (each member having only one vote).{{sfn|Unger|2002|p=22}} A member of the Politburo Standing Committee often represents a sector; during Mao's reign, he controlled the [[People's Liberation Army]], [[Kang Sheng]], the security apparatus, and Zhou Enlai, the [[State Council of China|State Council]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (China)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].{{sfn|Unger|2002|p=22}} This counts as informal power.{{sfn|Unger|2002|p=22}} Despite this, in a paradoxical relation, members of a body are ranked [[Hierarchy|hierarchically]] (despite the fact that members are in theory equal to each others).{{sfn|Unger|2002|p=22}} Informally, the collective leadership is headed by a &quot;[[leadership core]]&quot;; that is the [[paramount leader]], the person who holds the offices of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|CPC general secretary]], [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|CMC chairman]] and [[President of the People's Republic of China|president of the PRC]].{{sfn|Unger|2002|pp=22–24}} Before Jiang Zemin's tenure as paramount leader, the party core and collective leadership were indistinguishable.{{sfn|Unger|2002|p=158}} In practice, the core was not responsible to the collective leadership.{{sfn|Unger|2002|p=158}} However, by the time of Jiang, the party had begun propagating a responsibility system, referring to it in official pronouncements as the &quot;core of the collective leadership&quot;.{{sfn|Unger|2002|p=158}}

=== Democratic centralism ===
{{Further|Democratic centralism}}

The CPC's organizational principle is democratic centralism, which is based on two principles: [[democracy]] (synonymous in official discourse with &quot;socialist democracy&quot; and &quot;inner-party democracy&quot;) and [[centralism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DemocraticcentralismQiushi&quot; /&gt; This has been the guiding organizational principle of the party since the [[5th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|5th National Congress]], held in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;DemocraticcentralismQiushi&quot; /&gt; In the words of the party constitution, &quot;The Party is an integral body organized under its program and constitution and on the basis of democratic centralism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DemocraticcentralismQiushi&quot; /&gt; Mao once quipped that democratic centralism was &quot;at once democratic and [[Centralism|centralized]], with the two seeming opposites of democracy and centralization united in a definite form.&quot; Mao claimed that the superiority of democratic centralism lay in its internal contradictions, between democracy and centralism, and [[liberty|freedom]] and [[discipline]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DemocraticcentralismQiushi&quot; /&gt; Currently, the CPC is claiming that &quot;democracy is the lifeline of the Party, the lifeline of socialism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DemocraticcentralismQiushi&quot; /&gt; But for democracy to be implemented, and functioning properly, there needs to be centralization.&lt;ref name=&quot;DemocraticcentralismQiushi&quot; /&gt; The goal of democratic centralism was not to obliterate capitalism or its policies but instead it is the movement towards regulating capitalism while involving socialism and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The World Transformed:1945 to the Present |last = Hunt |first = Michael |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = |year = 2013 |isbn = |page = 121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Democracy in any form, the CPC claims, needs centralism, since without centralism there will be no order.&lt;ref name=&quot;DemocraticcentralismQiushi&quot; /&gt; According to Mao, democratic centralism &quot;is centralized on the basis of democracy and democratic under centralized guidance. This is the only system that can give full expression to democracy with full powers vested in the people's congresses at all levels and, at the same time, guarantee centralized administration with the governments at each level exercising centralized management of all the affairs entrusted to them by the people's congresses at the corresponding level and safeguarding whatever is essential to the democratic life of the people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DemocraticcentralismQiushi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://english.qstheory.cn/politics/201311/t20131113_290377.htm |title = Democratic Centralism: The Core Mechanism in China's Political System |last = Chuanzi |first = Wang |date = 1 October 2013 |access-date = 5 January 2014 |work = [[Qiushi]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032209/http://english.qstheory.cn/politics/201311/t20131113_290377.htm |archive-date = 6 January 2014 |url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-Party Cooperation System===
The Multi-Party Cooperation and Political Consultation System is led by the CPC in cooperation and consultation with the eight parties which make up the [[United Front (China)|United Front]].&lt;ref name=&quot;multipartycooperationsystem&quot; /&gt; Consultation takes place under the leadership of the CPC, with mass organizations, the United Front parties, and &quot;representatives from all walks of life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;multipartycooperationsystem&quot; /&gt; These consultations contribute, at least in theory, to the formation of the country's basic policy in the fields of political, economic, cultural and social affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;multipartycooperationsystem&quot; /&gt; The CPC's relationship with other parties is based on the principle of &quot;long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, treating each other with full sincerity and sharing weal or woe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;multipartycooperationsystem&quot;/&gt; This process is institutionalized in the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC).&lt;ref name=&quot;multipartycooperationsystem&quot;/&gt; All the parties in the United Front support China's road to socialism, and hold steadfast to the leadership of the CPC.&lt;ref name=&quot;multipartycooperationsystem&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Political/29034.htm|website=China.org.cn|title=IV.

=== Central organization===
[[File:18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.jpg|thumb|The [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th National Congress]], convened in November 2012]]

The [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]] is the party's highest body, and, since the [[9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|9th National Congress]] in 1969, has been convened every five years (prior to the 9th Congress they were convened on an irregular basis). According to the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party's constitution]], a congress may not be postponed except &quot;under extraordinary circumstances.&quot;{{sfn|Mackerras|McMillen|Watson|2001|p=228}} The party constitution gives the National Congress six responsibilities:{{sfn|Mackerras|McMillen|Watson|2001|p=229}}

# revising the party's constitution.{{sfn|Mackerras|McMillen|Watson|2001|p=229}}

In practice, the delegates rarely discuss issues at length at the National Congresses.

The flag sleeve (pole hem) is in white and 6.5&amp;nbsp;cm in width. The dimension of the pole hem is not included in the measure of the flag.

|quote = &quot;Since 1978 China has to a certain extent shifted its political philosophical discourse. But this shift has brought us closer to classical Marxism. For example, classical Marxism expresses the relationship between economics and politics, and further, the economic base and  superstructure where the latter is determined fundamentally by the former and only under certain limited conditions can the latter shape the former. Both Stalin and Mao, however, believed that politics and the superstructure could, at any moment, fundamentally determine economics, that they could determine absolutely the economic base. In a word, for whatever reason both Stalin and Mao misunderstood this vital point in Marxist theory and suffered accordingly in practice.&quot;

It has been argued in recent years, mainly by foreign commentators, that the CPC does not have an ideology, and that the party organization is [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] and interested only in what works.{{sfn|Brown|2012|p=52}} The party itself, however, argues otherwise. For instance, [[Hu Jintao]] stated in 2012 that the Western world is &quot;threatening to divide us&quot; and that &quot;the international culture of the West is strong while we are weak ... Ideological and cultural fields are our main targets&quot;.{{sfn|Brown|2012|p=52}} The CPC puts a great deal of effort into the party schools and into crafting its ideological message.{{sfn|Brown|2012|p=52}} Before the &quot;[[Practice Is the Sole Criterion for the Truth]]&quot; campaign, the relationship between ideology and decision-making was a deductive one, meaning that policy-making was derived from ideological knowledge.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=105}} Under Deng this relationship was turned upside down, with decision-making justifying ideology and not the other way around.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=105}} Lastly, Chinese policy-makers believe that the [[State ideology of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's state ideology]] was &quot;rigid, unimaginative, ossified, and disconnected from reality&quot; and that this was one of the reasons for the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. They therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard the party's rule.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=105}}

While non-Chinese analysts generally agree that the CPC has rejected orthodox Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought (or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking), the CPC itself disagrees.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=104}} Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CPC's formal commitment to Marxism with the introduction of the ideological theory, the [[Three Represents]].{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|p=99}} However, party theorist [[Leng Rong]] disagrees, claiming that &quot;President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism—which is why we talk about a 'socialist market economy' with Chinese characteristics.&quot;{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|p=99}} The attainment of true &quot;communism&quot; is still described as the CPC's and China's &quot;ultimate goal&quot;.{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|p=527}} While the CPC claims that China is in the [[primary stage of socialism]], party theorists argue that the current development stage &quot;looks a lot like capitalism&quot;.{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|p=527}} Alternatively, certain party theorists argue that &quot;capitalism is the early or first stage of communism.&quot;{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|p=527}} Some have dismissed the concept of a primary stage of socialism as intellectual cynicism.{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|p=527}} According to [[Robert Lawrence Kuhn]], a China analyst, &quot;When I first heard this rationale, I thought it more comic than clever—a wry caricature of hack propagandists leaked by intellectual cynics.

[[Deng Xiaoping Theory]] was added to the party constitution at the 14th National Congress.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=684}} The concepts of &quot;[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]&quot; and &quot;the [[primary stage of socialism]]&quot; were credited to the theory.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=684}} Deng Xiaoping Theory can be defined as a belief that [[state socialism]] and [[planned economy|state planning]] is not by definition communist, and that market mechanisms are class neutral.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=668}} In addition, the party needs to react to the changing situation dynamically; to know if a certain policy is obsolete or not, the party had to &quot;[[seek truth from facts]]&quot; and follow the slogan &quot;practice is the sole criterion for the truth&quot;.{{sfn|Chan|2003|p=180}} At the 14th National Congress, Jiang reiterated Deng's mantra that it was unnecessary to ask if something was socialist or capitalist, since the important factor was whether it worked.{{sfn|Vogel|2011|p=685}}

The &quot;[[Three Represents]]&quot;, [[Jiang Zemin|Jiang Zemin's]] contribution to the party's ideology, was adopted by the party at the 16th National Congress. The Three Represents defines the role of the Chinese Communist Party, and stresses that the Party must always represent the requirements for developing China's advanced productive forces, the orientation of China's advanced culture and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Selected Works of Jiang Zemin, Eng. ed., FLP, Beijing, 2013, Vol. III, p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Chan|2003|p=201}} Certain segments within the CPC criticized the Three Represents as being un-Marxist and a betrayal of basic Marxist values. Supporters viewed it as a further development of socialism with Chinese characteristics.{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|pp=108–109}} Jiang disagreed, and had concluded that attaining the communist mode of production, as formulated by earlier communists, was more complex than had been realized, and that it was useless to try to force a change in the mode of production, as it had to develop naturally, by following the [[Historical materialism|economic laws of history]].{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|pp=107–108}} The theory is most notable for allowing capitalists, officially referred to as the &quot;new social strata&quot;, to join the party on the grounds that they engaged in &quot;honest labor and work&quot; and through their labour contributed &quot;to build[ing] socialism with Chinese characteristics.&quot;{{sfn|Kuhn|2011|p=110}}

==== Ruling parties of socialist states ====
The CPC has retained close relations with the remaining [[socialist state]]s still espousing [[communism]]: [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]] and their respective ruling parties as well as [[North Korea]] and its ruling party, which officially abandoned communism in 2009.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=81}} It spends a fair amount of time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states, trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not, following the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Eastern European socialist states]] in 1989 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} In general, the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive, and the CPC believes that the socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in the future.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}}

The ruling party which the CPC is most interested in is the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} In general the CPV is considered a model example of socialist development in the post-Soviet era.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} Chinese analysts on Vietnam believe that the introduction of the [[Doi Moi]] reform policy at the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th CPV National Congress]] is the key reason for Vietnam's current success.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}}

While the CPC is probably the organization with [[China-North Korea relations|most access to North Korea]], writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} The few reports accessible to the general public are those about [[North Korean economic reform]]s.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for [[Economy of North Korea|North Korea's economic system]], the [[North Korea's cult of personality|cult of personality]] which pervades society, the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the [[Korean People's Army]] and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=82–83}} There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the [[First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK general secretary]] [[Kim Jong-il]] to [[North China Plain|Guandong province]] to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}}

There is a considerable degree of interest in Cuba within the CPC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[Fidel Castro]], the former [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] (PCC), is greatly admired, and books have been written focusing on the successes of the [[Cuban Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[China-Cuba relations|Communication between the CPC and the PCC]] has increased considerably since the 1990s, hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=85}} At the 4th Plenary Session of the [[16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|16th Central Committee]], which discussed the possibility of the CPC learning from other ruling parties, praise was heaped on the PCC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008 |p=85}} When [[Wu Guanzheng]], a Central Politburo member, met with Fidel Castro in 2007, he gave him a personal letter written by Hu Jintao: &quot;Facts have shown that China and Cuba are trustworthy good friends, good comrades, and good brothers who treat each other with sincerity. The two countries' friendship has withstood the test of a changeable international situation, and the friendship has been further strengthened and consolidated.&quot;{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=85–86}}

=== Non-communist parties ===
Since the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties.{{sfn|Smith|West|2012|p=127}} These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=86–92}} For instance, the CPC has been eager to understand how the [[People's Action Party|People's Action Party of Singapore]] (PAP) maintains its total domination over [[Politics of Singapore|Singaporean politics]] through its &quot;low-key presence, but total control.&quot;{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} According to the CPC's own analysis of [[Singapore]], the PAP's dominance can be explained by its &quot;well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups.&quot;{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a [[liberal democracy]], they view it as a [[guided democracy]] led by the PAP.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} Other differences are, according to the CPC, &quot;that it is not a political party based on the working class—instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the [[parliamentary system]], not a [[vanguard party|revolutionary party]].&quot;{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=94}} Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the [[United Malays National Organisation]], which has ruled [[Malaysia]] (1957-2018), and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in [[Japan]], which dominated [[Japanese politics]] since 1955.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=95–96}}

The CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made friendly overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party relations with the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} For instance, the longevity of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Syrian Regional Branch]] of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] is attributed to the personalization of power in the [[al-Assad family]], the strong [[presidential system]], the inheritance of power, which passed from [[Hafez al-Assad]] to his son [[Bashar al-Assad]], and the role given to the [[Syrian military]] in politics.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}}

Peng Liyuan (8959188037).jpg|thumb|Xi Jinping (second from left) with [[Enrique Peña Nieto]] (second from right), the former [[President of Mexico]] and a leading member of the social democratic Institutional Revolutionary Party]]
In recent years, the CPC has been especially interested in [[Latin America]],{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}} as shown by the increasing number of delegates sent to and received from these countries.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}} Of special fascination for the CPC is the 71-year-long rule of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) in [[Mexico]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}} While the CPC attributed the PRI's long reign in power to the strong presidential system, tapping into the [[machismo]] culture of the country, its nationalist posture, its close identification with the rural populace and the implementation of [[nationalization]] alongside the [[marketization]] of the [[Economy of Mexico|economy]], {{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}} the CPC concluded that the PRI failed because of the lack of inner-party democracy, its pursuit of [[social democracy]], its rigid party structures that could not be reformed, its [[Corruption in Mexico|political corruption]], the pressure of [[globalization]], and American interference in [[Mexican politics]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}} While the CPC was slow to recognize the [[pink tide]] in Latin America, it has strengthened party-to-party relations with several socialist and [[anti-American]] political parties over the years.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=98}} The CPC has occasionally expressed some irritation over [[Hugo Chávez]]'s [[anti-capitalist]] and anti-American rhetoric.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=98}} Despite this, in 2013 the CPC reached an agreement with the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV), which was founded by Chávez, for the CPC to educate PSUV cadres in political and social fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/130513/chinese-communist-party-to-train-chavista-leaders | title = Chinese Communist Party to train chavista leaders | date = 13 May 2013 | work = [[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]] | accessdate = 4 January 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104213020/http://english.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/130513/chinese-communist-party-to-train-chavista-leaders | archivedate = 4 January 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the CPC claimed to have established relations with 99 political parties in 29 Latin American countries.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=98}}

[[Social democrat]]ic movements in Europe have been of great interest to the CPC since the early 1980s.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=98}} With the exception of a short period in which the CPC forged party-to-party relations with far-right parties during the 1970s in an effort to halt &quot;[[Soviet imperialism|Soviet expansionism]]&quot;, the CPC's relations with European social democratic parties were its first serious efforts to establish cordial party-to-party relations with non-communist parties.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=98}} The CPC credits the European social democrats with creating a &quot;capitalism with a human face&quot;.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=98}} Before the 1980s, the CPC had a highly negative and dismissive view of social democracy, a view dating back to the [[Second International]] and the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] view on the social democratic movement.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=98}} By the 1980s that view had changed, and the CPC concluded that it could actually learn something from the social democratic movement.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=98}} CPC delegates were sent all over Europe to observe.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=99}} By the 1980s most European social democratic parties were facing electoral decline, and were in a period of self-reform.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=99}} The CPC followed this with great interest, laying most weight on reform efforts within the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=99}} The CPC concluded that both parties were re-elected because they modernized, replacing traditional [[State socialism|state socialist tenets]] with new ones supporting [[privatization]], shedding the belief in [[big government]], conceiving a new view of the [[welfare state]], changing their negative views of the market, and moving from their traditional support base of trade unions to entrepreneurs, the young and students.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=99–100}}
