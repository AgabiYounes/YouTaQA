'''Tramlink''', previously '''Croydon Tramlink''', is a [[light rail]] [[tram]] system serving [[Croydon]] and surrounding areas in [[South London]], England. It began operation in 2000, the first tram system in London since 1952. It is owned by [[London Trams]], an arm of [[Transport for London]] (TfL), and operated by Tram Operations Ltd, a subsidiary of [[FirstGroup]].

The network consists of 39 stops along {{convert|28|km|0|abbr=on}} of track,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/london-trams?intcmp=2647 |title=London Trams |publisher=Transport for London |accessdate=9 November 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108184124/https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/london-trams?intcmp=2647 |archivedate=8 November 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a mixture of street track shared with other traffic, dedicated track in public roads, and off-street track consisting of new rights-of-way, former railway lines, and one right-of-way where the Tramlink track runs parallel to a [[third rail]]-electrified [[Network Rail]] line.

The network's lines coincide in central Croydon, with eastbound termini at [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]] and [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]], and a westbound terminus at [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]], where there is an interchange for [[London Underground]]. Tramlink is the fourth-busiest light rail network in the UK behind the [[Docklands Light Railway]], [[Manchester Metrolink]] and [[Tyne &amp; Wear Metro]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/720315/light-rail-and-tram-statistics-england-2018.pdf Light Rail and Tram Statistics, England: 2017/18] Department for Transport&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Trams in London}}

===Construction===
[[File:Tram on trial in George Street (East). - geograph.org.uk - 1660811.jpg|thumb|left|Tram on trial going towards East Croydon in October 1999. The carriages were painted in [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]] red and white livery.]]
In 1990 [[Croydon London Borough Council|Croydon Council]] with [[London Regional Transport]] (LRT) put the project to Parliament and the Croydon Tramlink Act 1994 resulted, which gave LRT the power to build and run Tramlink.&lt;ref name=tramlinkact&gt;{{Cite web |title = Croydon Tramlink Act |year = 1994 |url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1994/ukla_19940011_en_2#pt1-l1g4 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121026062753/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1994/11/contents/enacted#pt1-l1g4 |archivedate = 26 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 four consortia were shortlisted to build, operate and maintain Tramlink:&lt;ref&gt;Light rail shortlist ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' November 1995 page 715&lt;/ref&gt;
*Altram: [[John Laing Group|John Laing]], [[Hitachi Rail Italy|Ansaldo]], [[Serco]]
*Croydon Connect: [[Tarmac Group|Tarmac]], [[AEG]], [[Transdev (historic)|Transdev]]
*CT Light Rail Group: [[Alstom|GEC Alsthom]], [[Mowlem]], [[Welsh Water]]
*Tramtrack Croydon: [[First London|CentreWest]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Sir Robert McAlpine]], [[Amey plc|Amey]], [[Bombardier Transportation]]

In 1996 Tramtrack Croydon (TC) won a 99-year [[Private Finance Initiative]] (PFI) contract to design, build, operate and maintain Tramlink. The equity partners in TC were [[Amey plc|Amey]] (50%), [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] (20%), [[3i]] (20%) and [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] with [[Bombardier Transportation]] contracted to build and maintain the trams and [[FirstGroup]] operate the service.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Preferred bidder selected for Croydon tram project&quot; ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 279 22 May 1996 page 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Croydon buy out&quot; ''Railway Gazette International'' April 2008 page 212&lt;/ref&gt; TC retained the revenue generated by Tramlink and LRT had to pay compensation to TC for any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced later.&lt;ref name = tfln7741/&gt;

One of the factors leading to its creation was that the London Borough of Croydon has no [[London Underground]] service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thetrainline.com/train-times/heathrow-t2-no-underground-to-south-croydon ''thetrainline.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:028140 tramlink mitcham.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gauntlet track|Interlaced track]] near Mitcham]]
Tramlink makes use of a number of [[National Rail]] lines, running parallel to franchised services, or in some cases, runs on previously abandoned railway corridors. Between [[Birkbeck station|Birkbeck]] and [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], Tramlink uses the [[Crystal Palace line]], running alongside [[Southern (Govia Thameslink Railway)|Southern]] rail services. The [[National Rail]] track had been singled some years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/croydon/ |title=Croydon Tramlink |accessdate=16 December 2013 |publisher=railway-technology.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222173800/http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/croydon/ |archivedate=22 February 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Elmers End to Woodside, Tramlink follows the former [[British Rail]] branch line to [[Woodside railway station (London)|Woodside]] where the old station buildings stand disused, and the original platforms have been replaced by accessible low platforms. Tramlink then follows the former [[Woodside and South Croydon Railway]] (W&amp;SCR) to reach the current Addiscombe tram stop, adjacent to the site of the demolished [[Bingham Road railway station]]. It continues along the former railway route to near Sandilands where Tramlink curves sharply towards Sandilands tram stop. Another route from Sandilands tram stop curves sharply on to the W&amp;SCR before passing through Park Hill (or Sandilands) tunnels and to the site of [[Coombe Road railway station]] after which it curves away across [[Lloyd Park (Croydon)|Lloyd Park]].

Tramlink follows the former [[West Croydon to Wimbledon Line]], which was first opened in 1855 and closed on 31 May 1997 to allow for conversion into Tramlink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2002 |journal=[[Railway Magazine]] |volume=148 |page=51 |issn=0033-8923}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this section, from near Phipps Bridge to near Reeves Corner, Tramlink follows the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], giving Tramlink a claim to one of the world's oldest railway alignments – {{gbmapscaled|TQ273680|300|Tramway Path}} beside Mitcham tram stop. A partial obstruction near this point (reinforcement to a retaining wall below a car park) has necessitated the use of [[gauntlet track|interlaced track]].

A Victorian footbridge beside Waddon New Road was dismantled to make way for the flyover&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.transport-of-delight.com/Tramlink/Pages/TramsinAction/Flyover-1.htm |title=Flyover 1 |publisher=Transport-of-delight.com |accessdate=9 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514094243/http://www.transport-of-delight.com/Tramlink/Pages/TramsinAction/Flyover-1.htm |archivedate=14 May 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; over the West Croydon to [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton]] railway line. The footbridge has been re-erected at [[Corfe Castle railway station|Corfe Castle]] station on the [[Swanage Railway]] (although some evidence suggests that this was a similar footbridge removed from the site of [[Merton Park railway station]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Andrew |title=Prestigious national award plaque installed at Corfe Castle on 26th October 2008 |url=http://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/news482.htm |publisher=Swanage Railway |accessdate=31 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927222352/http://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/news482.htm |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Andrew |title=Ex-Strategic Rail Authority Chairman officially opens Corfe Castle's historic Victorian railway footbridge on 28th April 2007 |url=http://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/news363.htm |publisher=Swanage Railway |accessdate=31 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927223311/http://www.swanagerailway.co.uk/news363.htm |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buyout by Transport for London===
In March 2008, TfL announced that it had reached agreement to buy TC for £98 million. The purchase was finalised on 28 June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/annual-report-and-statement-of-accounts-2008-09.pdf AnnualAccounts for year ended 31 March 2008] Transport for London page 158&lt;/ref&gt; The background to this purchase relates to the requirement that TfL (who took over from London Regional Transport in 2000) compensates TC for the consequences of any changes to the fares and ticketing policy introduced since 1996. In 2007 that payment was £4m, with an annual increase in rate.&lt;ref name=tfln7741&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx|title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services|accessdate=18 March 2008 |publisher=[[Transport for London]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |archivedate = 12 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; FirstGroup will continue to operate the service until 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/what-we-do/london-trams London Trams] Transport for London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;News in Brief ''Railway Gazette International'' August 2008 page 479&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008 TfL introduced a new livery, using the blue, white and green of the routes on TfL maps, to distinguish the trams from buses operating in the area. The colour of the cars was changed to green, and the brand name was changed from Croydon Tramlink to simply Tramlink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestnews/s-green-Tramlink/article-385546-detail/article.html|title=It's green for go at Tramlink|last=Kottegoda|first=Maheesha|date=9 October 2008|work=Croydon Advertiser|accessdate=10 October 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009215248/http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/latestnews/s-green-Tramlink/article-385546-detail/article.html|archivedate=9 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These refurbishments were completed in early 2009.

==Current system==

===Stops===
[[File:Croydon Tramlink Addiscombe Road.jpg|thumb|right|Tram 2530 leaving Croydon on an [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]] service in 2004]]

The tram stops have low platforms, {{convert|35|cm|abbr=on}} above rail level. They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.
There are 39 stops, most being {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.

Tramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon–West Croydon and Elmers End–Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].

Thirty-eight stops opened in the phased introduction of tram services in May 2000. [[Centrale tram stop]] in Tamworth Road opened on 10 December 2005, increasing journey times slightly. As turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.

All stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.

The PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even safety instructions for vandals to stop putting rubbish or other objects onto the track.

===Routes===

[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]

Tramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|&quot;London Connections&quot; map]].

When Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tramlink p 10&quot;&gt;''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered…'' Poster, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon. In June 2012 Route 4 from Therapia Lane to Elmers End was introduced. On Monday 4 April 2016, Route 4 was extended from Therapia Lane to Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Transport for London]]|title=Tram-endous boost for travellers|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|date=4 April 2016|access-date=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513142204/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/news-articles/tram-endous-boost-for-travellers|archive-date=13 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February 2018, the network and timetables were restructured again for more even and reliable services. As part of this change, trams would no longer display route numbers on their dot matrix destination screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/trams/new-tram-service-pattern-and-timetable?intcmp=50562&amp;home=banner |title= New tram service pattern &amp; timetable |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180226032231/https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/trams/new-tram-service-pattern-and-timetable?intcmp=50562&amp;home=banner |archivedate= 26 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in three routes:
* New Addington to West Croydon, returning to New Addington every 6/7 minutes.
* Wimbledon to Beckenham Junction every 10 minutes (every 15 minutes on Sundays and late evening)
* Wimbledon to Elmers End every 10 minutes (every 15 minutes on Sundays and terminates at Croydon in late evening every 15 minutes)

Additionally, the first two trams from New Addington will run to Wimbledon. Overall, this would result in a decrease in 2tph leaving Elmers End, resulting in a 25% decrease in capacity here, and 14% in the Addiscombe area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://insidecroydon.com/2017/10/14/even-westfield-now-agree-theres-no-need-for-28m-tram-loop/|title=Even Westfield now agree there’s no need for £28m tram loop|date=14 October 2017|website=insidecroydon.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171219161934/https://insidecroydon.com/2017/10/14/even-westfield-now-agree-theres-no-need-for-28m-tram-loop/|archivedate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this would also regulate waiting times in this area and on the Wimbledon branch to every 5 minutes, from every 2–7 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/15688614.Changes_coming_to_tram_timetable__Here_s_what_you_need_to_know/|title=Changes coming to tram timetable: Here's what you need to know|website=Croydon Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206074505/http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/15688614.Changes_coming_to_tram_timetable__Here_s_what_you_need_to_know/|archivedate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fares and ticketing===
[[File:Gb-tramlink-tickets.jpg|thumb|upright|A Tramlink Ticket Machine]]

TfL Bus Passes are valid on Tramlink, as are [[Travelcard]]s that include any of zones 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Pay-as-you-go [[Oyster Card]] fares are the same as on [[London Buses]], although special fares may apply when using Tramlink feeder buses.

When using Oyster cards, passengers must touch in on the platform before boarding the tram. Special arrangements apply at [[Wimbledon station]], where the Tramlink stop is within the [[National Rail]] and [[London Underground]] station. Tramlink passengers must therefore touch in at the station entry barriers then again at the Tramlink platform to inform the system that no mainline/LUL rail journey has been made.

[[Contactless payment|EMV Contactless payment]] cards can additionally be used to pay for fares in the same manner as Oyster cards.&lt;ref&gt;https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless&lt;/ref&gt;
Ticket machines were withdrawn on 16 July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2018/june/tfl-confirms-trams-in-croydon-will-go-cashle&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering vehicles===
Engineers' vehicles used in Tramlink construction were hired for that purpose. In November 2006 Croydon Tramlink purchased five second-hand engineering vehicles from [[Deutsche Bahn]]. These were two DB class Klv 53 engineers' trams (numbered 058 and 059 in Tramline service), and three 4-wheel wagons (numbered 060, 061, and 062).&lt;ref name=CR-TL&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.croydon-tramlink.co.uk/pictures/plant/index.shtml |title=On Track Plant and Construction Traffic |publisher=Stephen Parascandolo |accessdate=10 November 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628041641/http://www.croydon-tramlink.co.uk/pictures/plant/index.shtml |archivedate=28 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Service tram 058 and trailer 061 were both sold to the [[National Tramway Museum]] in 2010.

{{Copypaste|url=http://croydon-tramlink.co.uk/extensions/index.shtml|date=October 2019}}

===Trams 2030===
In November 2014, a 15-year plan for upgrades to the tram system to greatly increase capacity on the network in line with an expected increase in ridership to 60 million passengers by 2031.&lt;ref name=&quot;content.tfl.gov.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/rup-20141113-part-1-item09-trams-update.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019202726/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/rup-20141113-part-1-item09-trams-update.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans would relieve overcrowding and improve reliability on all lines, support housing growth, (as laid out in the London Plan)&lt;ref name=&quot;london.gov.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_london_plan_2016_jan_2017_fix.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423062539/https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/the_london_plan_2016_jan_2017_fix.pdf |archivedate=23 April 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and support programmes for regeneration in the Croydon metropolitan centre (such as [[Croydon Vision 2020]], the Croydon Opportunity Area, and [[Whitgift Centre#Redevelopment|Westfield Croydon]]); furthermore, the upgrades seek to future-proof for [[Crossrail 2]], potential [[Bakerloo line extension]] to the east of the network, and extensions to the tram network itself. The plans involve dual-tracking across the network and introducing diverting loops on either side of Croydon, allowing for a higher frequency of trams on all four branches of the network without increasing congestion in Croydon metropolitan centre; the £737m investment programme is to be funded partially by the Croydon Growth Zone, TfL Business Plan, housing levies, and the respective boroughs, as well as partially by the affected developers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132721/http://content.tfl.gov.uk/trams-for-growth-presentation.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans are outlined in three phases consisting of six outputs:

====Phase A====
To support developments in Croydon, construction of a diverting loop in East Croydon has been proposed at Dingwall Road. This loop would run up Dingwall Road alongside the [[Ruskin Square]] development, call at a new stop on Lansdowne Road, and return to the Croydon loop before the Wellesley Road stop (refurbished to accommodate for higher ridership); services originating from New Addington would alternate between using the main Croydon loop and this loop before returning to New Addington, although the services around the Croydon loop may be phased out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220133627/https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tramlink/dingwall-road-loop-extension/user_uploads/dingwall-2015-consultation-report.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;content.tfl.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; The aim of this is to increase the number services both around the Croydon loop and to Wimbledon originating from Elmers End to meet demand; to accommodate this increase in services, dual-tracking of line after Arena and the construction of a second platform at Elmers End is required.&lt;ref name=&quot;content.tfl.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; This is fully committed, partially funded by TfL and partially by the Croydon Partnership of [[Westfield Corporation|Westfield]] and [[Hammerson]], with construction to begin in 2017 and to be completed by 2020. However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phase B====
An increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.&lt;ref name=&quot;london.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.&lt;ref name=&quot;content.tfl.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.&lt;ref name=&quot;content.tfl.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; This plan may be in service by 2023.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phase C====
A 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.uk&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.&lt;ref name=&quot;content.tfl.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
This would be in place by 2029.&lt;ref name=&quot;gov.uk&quot;/&gt;

====Other developments====
These developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used). As such, an increase in depot and stabling capacity across the whole 15-year plan is also required; an enlargement of the current Therapia Lane site as well as sites near the Elmers End and Harrington Road tram stops have been shortlisted.&lt;ref name=&quot;content.tfl.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, plans for increases in capacity at Wimbledon are supported long-term with the redesign of the station as part of plans of Crossrail 2 and at East Croydon as part of plans for an upgrade of the [[Brighton Main Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
The plan also is designed to accommodate the long-term aim of extending services to Crystal Palace.

===Sutton to Wimbledon (Sutton Link)===
The only Tramlink extension actively being pursued by the Mayor of London and TfL, as of 2018, is a new line between Sutton and Wimbledon ([[Sutton Link]]). Depending on the route chosen, this could support Opportunity Areas at Wimbledon and Sutton, the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification, the Morden Housing Zone, and intensification along the route at Rose Hill. The extension aims to support the delivery of at least 10,000 homes and thousands of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/new_london_plan_december_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A further extension to the new London Cancer Hub on the same site of the [[The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust|Royal Marsden Hospital]] and [[Institute of Cancer Research]] in [[Belmont, Sutton|Belmont]] has also been proposed as a long-term part of the development.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200547/business/1514/the_london_cancer_hub/7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the London 2050 infrastructure plan, an extension of the Tramlink to Sutton was given a medium priority with a timescale of 2030.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Transport%20Supporting%20Paper_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Mayor [[Boris Johnson]] affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also were proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a proposed £320m scheme for a new line to connect Wimbledon to Sutton via Morden was made and brought to consultation jointly by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton. The consultation aimed to gauge support for the extension, as well as for different routes proposed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.opportunitysutton.org/wp-content/uploads/Tramlink_Report_FINAL1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation offered three choices of northern terminus (Wimbledon, South Wimbledon on-street, South Wimbledon off-street), with or without the loop serving St Helier's Hospital directly, and for the Sutton loop to either run entirely around the Sutton gyratory or divert north along the High Street. The results overwhelmingly supported the extension, with majorities supporting the northern terminus at Wimbledon, including a loop to serve St Helier's Hospital, and running entirely around the gyratory. Although £100m from TfL was initially secured in the draft 2016/17 budget,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.TfL_commits___100m_to_extending_tram_network_from_Wimbledon_to_Sutton/|title=TfL commits £100m to extending tram network from Wimbledon to Sutton|website=Sutton Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was subsequently reallocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/100million-tram-link-between-croydon-and-sutton-in-doubt-as-mayor-of-london-shelves-funding/story-29969181-detail/story.html|title=Why Croydon's tram network may now not be extended to Sutton|date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Mayor of London, [[Sadiq Khan]] remains committed to the project however, and has called on the council to raise the shortfall in funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/14504564.Sadiq_Khan__Tram_extension_is_a_priority____but_don_t_hold_your_breath_/|title=Sadiq Khan: Tram extension is a priority - 'but don't hold your breath'|website=Sutton Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suttonguardian.co.uk/news/15043498._Show_more_ambition___Sutton_to_review_tram_extension_funding_as_Mayor_calls_on_council_to_pledge_more_money/|title='Show more ambition': Sutton to review tram extension funding as Mayor calls on council to pledge more money|website=Sutton Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been announced £70m from the Mayor's Growth Fund had been allocated to the extension with a potential further £30m being available in the next Tfl Business plan, subject to an acceptable business case and funding package being reached by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.tfl.gov.uk/pic-20171212-item08-growth-fund.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://moderngov.sutton.gov.uk/documents/s61496/Sutton%20Tram%20Update%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; An additional £50m has also been offered by the London Boroughs of Merton and Sutton.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/14345323.tfl-commits-100m-to-extending-tram-network-from-wimbledon-to-sutton/&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2018, a TfL consultation opened on proposals for rapid transit between Sutton and Merton.&lt;ref name=&quot;consultations.tfl.gov.uk&quot;&gt;https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/trams/sutton-link/&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation proposed three potential routes:
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!#!! Northern terminus!! Route
|-
|1 || [[South Wimbledon tube station]] || From South Wimbledon tube station along Morden Road (A24), interchange with [[Morden Road tram stop]], through [[Morden]] (300m from [[Morden tube station]], through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory
|-
|2 || [[Colliers Wood tube station]] || From Colliers Wood tube station along Church Road, interchange with [[Belgrave Walk tram stop]], along Morden Road (A239), through Rose Hill and St Helier, follows Sutton gyratory
|-
|3 || [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] ||Along [[Sutton Loop Line]] from Wimbledon, diverts from line at Collingwood Road before West Sutton, follows Sutton gyratory
|}

It has been proposed that Routes 1 or 2 would cost £425m as a segregated tram line, but also could be delivered at £275m as a bus rapid transit (BRT) route. Also, both routes 1 and 2 had potential for a direct link between [[Wimbledon station]] (with route 2 the easier route) and a potential loop for a direct connection with [[St Helier Hospital]]. Route 3 however has only been proposed to be delivered as a tram route at £300m, with [[Thameslink]] services terminating at [[West Sutton railway station|West Sutton]] and Wimbledon. Services on the intermediate stations would however be more frequent as a tram service than currently. Work could begin in 2022, with aim for completing in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/16832779.routes-for-the-wimbledon-sutton-tramlink-extension-revealed/&lt;/ref&gt; Services to Wimbledon regardless of route would however be postponed several years to co-ordinate with Crossrail 2 works, due to the low capacity on tram platforms in the station and to limit disruption.

In February 2020, TfL announced their preference for a north–south tramway between Colliers Wood and Sutton town centre for £425m on the condition of securing additional funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;consultations.tfl.gov.uk&quot;/&gt;

===Projected extensions===
The Mayor's Transport Strategy for London states that extensions to the network could be developed at relatively modest cost where there is potential demand from existing and new development to support concentrated passenger movements, and where Tramlink technology might be cost effective. Proposal 4D7 says that &quot;The Mayor will explore the potential for extending the Tramlink network where doing so could help meet the objectives of the Transport Strategy cost effectively&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf London Dockland and Croydon Tramlink Extensions] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713203635/http://www.london.gov.uk/mayor/strategies/transport/pdf/final_ch04d.pdf |date=13 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sought initial views on the viability of a number of extensions by summer 2002.

Other extension proposals include Lewisham, Bromley town centre, Biggin Hill Airport/Village and a local spur/loop to penetrate further into Purley Way retail/industrial park.

Starting in the west, there are two corridors into Sutton town centre. The first, principally between Wimbledon and Sutton, was in view even before Tramlink opened: the trams were delivered with this as &quot;line 4&quot; on their destination blinds.

====North and south from Croydon====
[[File:Tram in Church Street - geograph.org.uk - 1209531.jpg|right|thumb|A tram travelling on Church Street, Croydon town centre]]
To the north and south of Croydon are some busy bus corridors, which derive from earlier tram routes. These include the [[Purley, London|Purley]] – Croydon – [[Streatham]] corridor, which is proposed for conversion to tram operation.&lt;ref name=SLTBrochure&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.tramlink.co.uk/extensions/SLTBrochure.pdf |format = PDF |title = South London Trams – Transport for Everyone – The case for extensions to Tramlink |publisher = South London Partnership |accessdate = 2 September 2008 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011025/http://www.tramlink.co.uk/extensions/SLTBrochure.pdf |archivedate = 18 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spext&gt;{{Cite web |title = Tramlink Extensions |url = http://www.tramlink.co.uk/extensions/index.shtml |publisher = Croydon Tramlink – The Unofficial Site |accessdate = 2 September 2008 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120605044236/http://tramlink.co.uk/extensions/index.shtml |archivedate = 5 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the south of Croydon, the proposal is for the new route to diverge from the central Croydon loop and use a highway alignment, probably South End and Brighton Road, to Purley. Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spext&quot;/&gt;

To the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point. The proposal is to terminate the line at [[Streatham railway station]], providing an interchange to the extended [[East London Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spext&quot;/&gt;

====Crystal Palace extension====
[[File:Climbing the Addington Hills (5276420251).jpg|thumb|Near the summit of line 3, having climbed through the Addington Hills from [[Lloyd Park (Croydon)|Lloyd Park]].]]
The proposed extension to [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace]] would have linked it to Harrington Road and Beckenham Junction, with services terminating at Crystal Palace Parade.&lt;ref name=LambethCouncil&gt;{{cite web|title=Croydon Tramlink extension to Crystal Palace|url=http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/Services/TransportStreets/PublicTransportTaxis/PublicTransportConsultation/ExtendingTramlinkToCrystalPalace.htm|work=Lambeth Council Website|publisher=Lambeth Council|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were three options on how to get to the Parade: on-street, off-street and a mixture of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/trams/pdf/Crystal-Palace-2006-10-19.pdf |title=Crystal Palace extension options to reach the Parade |website=tfl.gov.uk |accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After consultation in 2006 the off-street option was favoured, with trams running along existing railway as far as [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace Station]], and then running round the western edge of [[Crystal Palace Park]] (within the current park's perimeter) to the bus terminus near the parade. The planned extension was cancelled due to a lack of funding in 2000. The plans were revived shortly after [[Boris Johnson]]'s re-election as London mayor in May 2012 but six months later the plan was cancelled again.&lt;ref name=CroydonAdvertiser&gt;{{cite news|last=Austen|first=Ian|title=Crystal Palace Tramlink extension not backed by Boris Johnson despite manifesto|url=http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/Crystal-Palace-Tramlink-extension-backed-Boris/story-17523965-detail/story.html#axzz2cR2ARIFZ|accessdate=19 August 2013|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TfL had stated in 2008 that due to lack of funding the plans for this extension will not be taken forward,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2055.aspx Tramlink extension to Crystal Palace] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202065640/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2055.aspx |date=2 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also says that it is committed to including new proposals for extensions to the tram as part of a future bid to Government.
