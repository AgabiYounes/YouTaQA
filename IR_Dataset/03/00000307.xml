'''Abraham Lincoln''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Lincoln|title=Lincoln. (Merriam-Webster)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th [[president of the United States]] (1861–1865). Lincoln led the nation through its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Pencak|title=Encyclopedia of the Veteran in America|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=yyvmcMsNnB4C|page=222}}|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=222|isbn=978-0-313-08759-2|access-date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Finkelman|author1-first=Paul|author2-last=Gottlieb|author2-first=Stephen E.|title=Toward a Usable Past: Liberty Under State Constitutions|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=xJuXT1sVhFcC|page=388}}year=2009|publisher=U of Georgia Press|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; He preserved the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|abolished slavery]], strengthened the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernized [[Economy of the United States|the U.S. economy]].

Lincoln was born in poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]] primarily in [[Indiana]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].

As the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln found his political opposition was manifold, and included [[Radical Republican]]s, [[War Democrats]], [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] (anti-war Democrats), and irreconcilable secessionists. He managed the various factions by pitting them against each other, by exploiting political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall1947&quot; /&gt;{{rp|65–87}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.

Lincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by  Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

==Family and childhood==
===Early life===
{{Main|Early life and career of Abraham Lincoln}}
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of [[Thomas Lincoln]] and [[Nancy Lincoln|Nancy Hanks Lincoln]], in a one-room log cabin on [[Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park|Sinking Spring Farm]] near [[Hodgenville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|20–22}} He was a descendant of [[Samuel Lincoln]], an Englishman who migrated from [[Hingham, Norfolk]], to its namesake, [[Hingham, Massachusetts]], in 1638. The family then migrated west, passing through [[New Jersey]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|3,4}} Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, [[Abraham Lincoln (captain)|Captain Abraham Lincoln]], moved the family from Virginia to [[Jefferson County, Kentucky]] and was killed in an [[Northwest Indian War|Indian raid]] in 1786.&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|4}} His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|21}}{{efn|Thomas, born January 1778, would have been 8 at the attack, May 1786.

Lincoln's mother Nancy is widely assumed, absent documentation, to have been the daughter of Lucey Hanks.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|79}} Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|9}} They had three children: [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]], Abraham, and Thomas who died in infancy.&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|9–10}}

Thomas Lincoln bought or leased farms in Kentucky before losing all but {{convert|200|acre|ha}} of his land in court disputes over [[Title (property)|property titles]].&lt;ref name=Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|20}} In 1816, the family moved to [[Indiana]] where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warren&quot; /&gt;{{rp|13}} Indiana was a [[Slave states and free states|&quot;free&quot; (non-slaveholding)]] territory, and they settled in an &quot;unbroken forest&quot;&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|26}} in Hurricane Township, [[History of Perry County, Indiana|Perry County, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|16 and 43}} {{efn|Their land eventually became part of [[Spencer County, Indiana]], when the county was established in 1818.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|3, 5, 16}}}} In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot;, but mainly due to land title difficulties.&lt;ref name=Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|20}}&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|23–24}}
[[File:Log Cabin at the Lincoln Living Historical Farm.jpg|thumb|right|The farm site where Lincoln grew up in [[Spencer County, Indiana]]]]
In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|34, 156}} He owned farms, town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. Thomas and Nancy were members of a [[Separate Baptists]] church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|22–24}}

Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas eventually obtained clear title to {{convert|80|acre|ha}} of land in what became known as the [[Little Pigeon Creek Community]].&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|24, 104}}

===Mother's death===
On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died of [[milk sickness]], leaving 11-year-old [[Sarah Lincoln Grigsby|Sarah]] in charge of a household that included her father, 9-year-old Abraham, and Dennis Hanks, Nancy's 19-year-old orphaned cousin.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|22–23, 77}} Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a [[stillborn]] son; Lincoln was distraught over his sister's death.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|20, 30–33}}

On December 2, 1819, Thomas married [[Sarah Bush Lincoln|Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Bush Johnston]], a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|23, 83}} Abraham became close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as &quot;Mother&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|26–27}} Lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. He was called lazy for all his &quot;reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing Poetry, etc.&quot;.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|25, 31, 47}} His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy &quot;physical labor&quot;, but loved to read.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|66}}

===Education and move to Illinois===
[[File:Young Lincoln By Charles Keck.JPG|thumb|right|''Young Lincoln'' by [[Charles Keck]] at Senn Park, Chicago|alt=A statue of young Lincoln sitting on a stump, holding a book open on his lap]]
Lincoln was primarily self-educated, with intermittent formal schooling from travelling teachers of less than 12 months aggregate;&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|10, 33}} he became an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.&lt;ref name=Madison/&gt;{{rp|110}} Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], [[Aesop's Fables]], [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', [[Daniel Defoe]]'s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', [[Mason Locke Weems]]'s ''The Life of Washington'', and ''[[The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin]]''.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|29–31, 38–43}}

As a teen, Lincoln took responsibility for chores, and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until age 21.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|30–33}} Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic and became adept at using an axe.&lt;ref name=Warren/&gt;{{rp|134–35}} He was known for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as &quot;the Clary's Grove boys.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|41}}

In March 1830, partly out of fear of another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Thomas, moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in [[Macon County, Illinois|Macon County]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|36}} {{efn|Historians disagree on who initiated the move; Thomas Lincoln had no obvious reason to do so. One possibility is that other members of the family, including Dennis Hanks, may not have matched Thomas's stability and steady income.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|38–40}}}} Abraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part due to his father's lack of education.&lt;ref name=Bartelt/&gt;{{rp|71}} Nevertheless, he occasionally lent Thomas money.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|28, 152}} In 1831, as Thomas and other family prepared to move to a [[Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site|new homestead]] in [[Coles County, Illinois]], Abraham struck out on his own.&lt;ref name=Oates1994/&gt;{{rp|15–17}} He made his home in [[Lincoln's New Salem|New Salem]] for six years.&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|23–53}} Lincoln and some friends took goods by [[flatboat]] to New Orleans, where he was first exposed to slavery.&lt;ref name= Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|22–23}}&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|38}}

Lincoln's first romantic interest was [[Ann Rutledge]], whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gannett |first=Lewis |date=Winter 2005 |title=&quot;Overwhelming Evidence&quot; of a Lincoln-Ann Rutledge Romance?: Reexamining Rutledge Family Reminiscences |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |magazine=Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association |location=Springfield, IL |publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association |pages=28–41 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403014805/https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0026.104/--overwhelming-evidence-of-a-lincoln-ann-rutledge-romance?rgn=main;view=fulltext |archivedate=April 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died on August 25, 1835, most likely of [[typhoid fever]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|55–58}} In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky.&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|56–57, 69–70}}

Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Owens a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship; she never replied.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|67}}

In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], a daughter of [[Robert Smith Todd]], a wealthy slave-owner in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name= Lamb/&gt;{{rp|3}} They met in [[Springfield, Illinois]] in December 1839 and were engaged a year later.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|80–86}} A wedding set for January 1, 1841 was canceled at Lincoln's request, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's sister.&lt;ref name= Sandburg1926/&gt;{{rp|46–51}} While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, Lincoln was asked where he was going and replied, &quot;To hell, I suppose.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|93}} In 1844, the couple bought [[Lincoln Home National Historic Site|a house]] in Springfield near Lincoln's law office; Mary kept house with the help of a relative and hired servant.&lt;ref name= Baker/&gt;{{rp|142}}

He was an affectionate but absent husband, and father of four children. [[Robert Todd Lincoln]] was born in 1843, reached adulthood, and had three children. [[Edward Baker Lincoln]] (Eddie) was born in 1846 but died on February 1, 1850, probably of tuberculosis. [[William Wallace Lincoln|&quot;Willie&quot; Lincoln]] was born on December 21, 1850 and died of a fever on February 20, 1862. The youngest son, [[Tad Lincoln|Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln]], was born on April 4, 1853 and died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16, 1871.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|179–181, 476}} {{efn|The Lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson [[Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith]], died in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Emerson|title=Giant in the Shadows: The Life of Robert T.

Herndon]] would grow irritated when Lincoln would bring his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his own work to notice his children's behavior. Herndon recounted, &quot;I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut. Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hertz |first1=Emanuel |title=The Hidden Lincoln |date=1938 |publisher=The Viking Press |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Abraham suffered from &quot;[[history of depression|melancholy]],&quot; a condition later referred to as [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlanticoct2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200510/lincolns-clinical-depression |title=Lincoln's Great Depression |first=Joshua Wolf |last=Shenk |date=October 2005 |work=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009044732/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/10/lincoln-apos-s-great-depression/4247/ |archivedate=October 9, 2011 |url-status=live  |access-date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.&lt;ref name= Steers/&gt;{{rp|341}}

In 1832, Lincoln joined with a partner [[Denton Offutt]] in the purchase of a general store on credit in New Salem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth J.

That March he entered politics, running for the [[Illinois General Assembly]], advocating navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He could draw crowds as a [[raconteur]], but he lacked the requisite formal education, powerful friends, and money, and lost the election.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|41}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hN7QQgAACAAJ}}|title=Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln Volume 3 |chapter=The Improvement of Sangamon River|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|editor-first=Marion Mills |editor-last=Miller |year=1832|publisher=Wildside Press|isbn=9781434424976|language=en}} [[s:Life and Works of Abraham Lincoln/Volume 3/The Improvement of Sangamon River|WP article]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln briefly interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the [[Illinois Militia]] during the [[Black Hawk War]].&lt;ref name= Winkle/&gt;{{rp|86–95}} When he returned to his campaign and first speech, he observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his &quot;neck and the seat of his trousers&quot; and tossed him.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|46}} Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.&lt;ref name= Winkle/&gt;{{rp|114–116}}

Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, but continued his voracious reading, and he decided to become a lawyer. He taught himself the law, with [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Commentaries]]'', saying later of the effort, &quot;I studied with nobody.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|53–55}}

In 1843 Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for Illinois's 7th district seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]]; he was defeated by [[John J. Hardin]] though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term. Lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846, he was indeed elected to the seat in the House. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but as dutiful as any, participating in almost all votes and making speeches that toed the party line.&lt;ref name=Oates1974/&gt;{{rp|79}} Lincoln teamed with [[Joshua R.

=== Political views ===
On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the [[Mexican–American War]], which he imputed to President [[James K. Polk]]'s desire for &quot;military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heidler2006&quot; /&gt;{{rp|181–183}} He supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]], a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holzer&quot; /&gt;{{rp|63}}

Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his [[Spot Resolutions]]. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had &quot;invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oates1974&quot; /&gt;{{rp|79–80}} Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Basler&quot; /&gt;{{rp|199–202}} The resolution was ignored in both the Congress and the national papers, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him &quot;spotty Lincoln.{{rp|202}}&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerSchamel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/ |title=Lincoln's Spot Resolutions |publisher=National Archives |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920053345/http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/lincoln-resolutions/ |archivedate=September 20, 2011 |url-status=dead  |access-date=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald1996&quot; /&gt;{{rp|128}}

Lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House. Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General [[Zachary Taylor]] for the Whig nomination in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|124–126}} Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed Commissioner of the [[General Land Office]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|140}} The administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the [[Oregon Territory]] as consolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=Isaac Newton |date=1885 |title=The Life of Abraham Lincoln |volume=2 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ|page=81}} |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Janses, McClurg, &amp; Company |page=81 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403025741/https://books.google.com/books?id=3zgDAAAAYAAJ |archivedate=April 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined to resume his law practice.&lt;ref name= Harris/&gt;{{rp|55–57}}

Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases; he was sole counsel in 51 cases, of which 31 were decided in his favor.&lt;ref name= Handy/&gt;{{rp|440}} From 1853 to 1860, one of his largest clients was the [[Illinois Central Railroad]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|155–156, 196–197}} His legal reputation gave rise to the nickname &quot;Honest Abe&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5GJ6Un1JA_8C}}|title=The Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln|last=Library|first=Philosophical|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1-4532-0281-4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended [[William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong]], who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|150–151}} The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by [[judicial notice]] in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'' showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted.&lt;ref name= Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|150–151}}

Lincoln rarely raised objections; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of killing a man, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|150–151}}&lt;ref name= Harrison1935&gt;{{cite book|oclc=3512772|last=Harrison|first=J.

[[File:Abraham Lincoln by Byers, 1858 - crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Lincoln in 1858, the year of [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|his debates]] with [[Stephen A. Douglas|Stephen Douglas]] over slavery.]]

The debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the [[Compromise of 1850]], a legislative package designed to address the issue.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|175–176}} In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to &quot;both extremes&quot; on the slavery issue.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|182–185}} As the slavery debate in the [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] and [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed [[Popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term &quot;popular sovereignty&quot; and its pejorative connotation|popular sovereignty]] as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the resulting spread of slavery, but Douglas's [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|188–190}}

Lincoln made no comment on the act until months later in his &quot;[[Abraham Lincoln's Peoria speech|Peoria Speech]]&quot; in October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency.&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|148–152}} He said the Kansas Act had a &quot;''declared'' indifference, but as I must think, a covert ''real'' zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref name=Basler/&gt;{{rp|255}} Lincoln's attacks on the Kansas–Nebraska Act marked his return to political life.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|203–205}}

Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, &quot;I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist...I do no more than oppose the ''extension'' of slavery.&quot;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|215–216}} The new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party, and combining [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]], [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty]], and antislavery [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] members, &lt;ref name= McGovern/&gt;{{rp|38–39}} Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|203–204}} Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist [[Know Nothing]] movement.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|191–194}}

In 1854 Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. The year's elections showed the strong opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and in the aftermath Lincoln sought election to the United States Senate.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|203–205}} At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature.&lt;ref name=Oates1974/&gt;{{rp|119}} After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for [[Lyman Trumbull]]. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, [[Joel Aldrich Matteson]].&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|205–208}}

==== 1856 campaign ====
[[Bleeding Kansas|Violent political confrontations in Kansas]] continued, and opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the [[United States elections, 1856|1856 elections]] approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the [[Bloomington Convention]], which formally established the [[Illinois Republican Party]]. The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the [[Lincoln's Lost Speech|final speech]] of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|216–221}} At the June [[1856 Republican National Convention]], though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, [[John C. Frémont]] and [[William Dayton]] comprised the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]] and the Know Nothings nominated former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|224–228}} Buchanan prevailed, while Republican [[William Henry Bissell]] won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|229–230}}{{efn|[[Eric Foner]] contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the [[republicanism in the United States|republicanism principles]] of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]], especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name=Foner2010/&gt;{{rp|84–88}}}}
[[File:DredScott.jpg|alt=Painting|thumb|upright|A portrait of [[Dred Scott]], petitioner in ''Dred Scott v. Sandford'']]

==== ''Dred Scott v. Sanford'' ====
Dred Scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a free territory under the Missouri Compromise. After Scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. His petition was denied in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857); Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution. While many Democrats hoped that ''Dred Scott'' would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt;{{rp|236–238}} Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the [[Slave Power]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zarefsky&quot; /&gt;{{rp|69–110}} He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal “in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffa&quot; /&gt;{{rp|299–300}}

===Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech===
{{Further|Lincoln–Douglas debates|Cooper Union speech}}

In 1858 Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him favor.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|247–248}} Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas from his opposition to the [[Lecompton Constitution]] and admission of Kansas as a [[slave state]].&lt;ref name=Oates1974/&gt;{{rp|138–139}} Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|247–250}}
[[File:Lincoln O-17 by Brady, 1860.png|thumb|left|Abraham Lincoln (1860) by [[Mathew Brady]], taken the day of the Cooper Union speech.]]
Accepting the nomination, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's House Divided Speech|House Divided Speech]], with the biblical reference Mark 3:25, &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.&quot;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|251}} The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion.&lt;ref name= Harris/&gt;{{rp|98}} The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|209}} When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, &quot;[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party&amp;nbsp;... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.&quot;&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|257–258}}

The Senate campaign featured seven [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|debates]] between the two. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands. &lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|214–218}} The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that Douglas’&quot;[[Slave Power]]&quot; was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers’ premise that [[all men are created equal]]. Douglas emphasized his [[Freeport Doctrine]], that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|214–224}} Lincoln's argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas's argument was more legal, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court in the ''Dred Scott'' decision.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|223}}

{{Lincoln-Douglas debates (map)}}
Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. Lincoln's articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence.&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|89–90}} In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the ''Illinois Staats-Anzeiger'', a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|242, 412}} In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by [[William H. Seward]], [[Salmon P. Chase]], [[Edward Bates]], and [[Simon Cameron]]. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast, and was unsure whether to seek the office.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|291–293}} In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|307–308}}

On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a [[Cooper Union speech|speech at Cooper Union]], in which he argued that the [[List of national founders|Founding Fathers]] had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. He insisted that morality required opposition to slavery, and rejected any &quot;groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jaffa/&gt;{{rp|473}} Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly.&lt;ref name=Holzer/&gt;{{rp|108–111}} But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention. Journalist [[Noah Brooks]] reported, &quot;No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience.&quot;&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|97}}&lt;ref name=Holzer/&gt;{{rp|157}}

Historian [[David Herbert Donald]] described the speech as a &quot;superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|240}} In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, &quot;The taste ''is'' in my mouth a little.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|241}}

On May 18, at the [[1860 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to [[Ticket balance|balance the ticket]].

Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the [[Wide Awakes]], which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.&lt;ref name=Audacious&gt;{{cite book|title=Lincoln for President: An Unlikely Candidate, An Audacious Strategy, and the Victory No One Saw Coming|last=Chadwick|first=Bruce|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=2PQqZzyw4uAC|page=l49}}|pages=147–149|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Illinois|date=2009|accessdate=April 1, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402091121/https://books.google.com/books?id=2PQqZzyw4uAC&amp;pgpage=149|archivedate=April 2, 2017|isbn=978-1-4022-4756-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's ideas of abolishing [[slavery]] grew, drawing more supporters.

''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People''. Belmont: Clark Baxter, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of &quot;free labor&quot;, which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|254–256}} The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ''Chicago Tribune'' writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000–200,000 copies.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|254}}

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.&lt;ref name= Mansch/&gt;{{rp|61}} Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon.&lt;ref name=White/&gt;{{rp|350}} His victory in the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]] was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.&lt;ref name= Nevins1947/&gt;{{rp|4:312}}

Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating &quot;One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute.&quot; The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: &quot;We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies&amp;nbsp;...

Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|268, 279}} Lincoln said in his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]]:

[[Fort Sumter]]'s commander, [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Major Robert Anderson]], sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] and began the fight. Historian [[Allan Nevins]] argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.&lt;ref name= Nevins1959/&gt;{{rp|5:29}}

[[William Tecumseh Sherman]] talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was &quot;sadly disappointed&quot; at his failure to realize that &quot;the country was sleeping on a volcano&quot; and that the South was preparing for war.&lt;ref name= Sherman/&gt;{{rp|185–186}} Donald concludes that, &quot;His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|293}}

On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. This call forced states to choose sides. Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral.&lt;ref name= Oates1994/&gt;{{rp|226}} The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to defend the nation.

States sent Union regiments south. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled rail links, [[Baltimore riot of 1861|attacked Union troops]] who were changing trains. Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting [[Maryland in the American Civil War#Imposition of martial law|local Maryland]] officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States#Suspension during the Civil War|habeas corpus]]'' in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington.&lt;ref name= Heidler2000/&gt;{{rp|174}} [[John Merryman]], a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, [[Roger B. Taney]], author of the ''Dred Scott'' opinion, to issue a writ of ''habeas corpus.'' In June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the [[ex parte Merryman]] ruling.&lt;ref&gt;William C.

====Union military strategy====
Lincoln took executive control of the war and formed an overall [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military strategy. Lincoln responded to this unprecedented political and military crisis as [[commander-in-chief]] by using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|303–304}}&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|163–164}}

Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln, and others]]

The war dominated Lincoln's time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success, and that any compromise would alienate factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|315, 331–333, 338–339, 417}} On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861|Confiscation Act]] that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|314}}&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|178}}

In late August 1861, General [[John C. Frémont]], the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting his superiors in Washington, proclaimed a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. Lincoln cancelled the proclamation, saying its emancipation plan was political, lacking military necessity and a legal basis.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|314–317}} After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000.&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|181}}

In foreign policy, Lincoln's main goal was to stop military aid to the Confederacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boritt2002&quot;/&gt;{{rp|213–214}} Lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his Secretary of State, [[William Seward]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boritt2002&quot;/&gt;{{rp|213–214}} At times Seward was too bellicose, so for balance Lincoln maintained a close working relationship with [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] chairman [[Charles Sumner]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|322}} The [[Trent Affair]] of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy had illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer [[James G. Randall]] dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James Garfield|last= Randall|title=Lincoln the President: Springfield to Gettysburg|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|page=50}}|year=1946|page=50|access-date=May 16, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122025358/https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|archivedate=November 22, 2016|isbn=978-0-306-80754-1}} quoted in Kevin Peraino, ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2013) pp 160–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into War Department. He tracked all phases of the effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced [[Simon Cameron]] with [[Edwin Stanton]] as [[United States Secretary of War|War Secretary]]. Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and cancelling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000.&lt;ref name=Oates1974/&gt;{{rp|115}} Stanton was a staunchly Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. &quot;Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together,&quot; say Thomas and Hyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WTGTAAAAIAAJ|page=385}}|title=Stanton: The Life and Times of Lincoln's Secretary of War|last=Thomas|first=Benjamin Platt|last2=Hyman|first2=Harold Melvin|date=1962|publisher=Alfred A.

In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort leading to prompt, decisive victory. However major Northern newspapers demanded more—they expected victory within 90 days.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|295–296}} Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon.

====General McClellan====
After the Union rout at [[First Battle of Bull Run|Bull Run]] and [[Winfield Scott]]'s retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General [[George B. McClellan]] general-in-chief.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|318–319}} McClellan then took months to plan his [[Peninsula Campaign]]. McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. McClellan blamed Lincoln's holding troops back for his campaign's subsequent failure.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|349–352}}

Pope complied with Lincoln's desire to advance on Richmond from the north, thus protecting Washington from counterattack.&lt;ref name=Nevins1947/&gt;{{rp|2:159–162}}

Pope was then soundly defeated at the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]] in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington.&lt;ref name= Nevins1960/&gt;{{rp|2:159–162}}

Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington.&lt;ref name= Goodwin/&gt;{{rp|478–479}} Two days after McClellan's return to command, General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September.&lt;ref name= Goodwin/&gt;{{rp|478–480}} The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January. Lincoln had waited for a military victory so that the Proclamation would not be perceived as the product of desperation.&lt;ref name= Goodwin/&gt;{{rp|481}}

McClellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's army, while General [[Don Carlos Buell]] likewise refused orders to move the [[Army of the Ohio]] against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. Lincoln replaced Buell with [[William Rosecrans]]; and, after the [[1862 and 1863 United States House of Representatives elections|1862 midterm elections]], replaced McClellan with [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Both were presumably more supportive of the commander-in-chief.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|389–390}}

Burnside, against presidential advice, launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was [[Battle of Fredericksburg|defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg]] in December. Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and increased after [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|429–431}} Lincoln promoted [[Joseph Hooker]].&lt;ref name= Nevins1947/&gt;{{Rp|6:433–44}}

The midterm elections in 1862 cost the Republicans severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of ''habeas corpus'', [[Conscription|military draft law]], and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations.&lt;ref name= Nevins1947/&gt;{{rp|6:322}}

In the spring of 1863, Lincoln became optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included attacks by [[Joseph Hooker|Hooker]] on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald1996&quot; /&gt;{{rp|422–423}}

Hooker was routed by Lee at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May.&lt;ref name= Nevins1947/&gt;{{rp|6:432–450}} He then resigned and was replaced by [[George Meade]] as Lee moved north. Meade followed Lee into Pennsylvania and beat him in the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln's demands. At the same time, Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River, splitting off the far western rebel states.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|444–447}}

The Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. Lincoln argued that slavery would end by preventing its expansion into new territories. He sought to persuade the states to accept [[compensated emancipation]] in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery would make it obsolete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackubin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |title=The Liberator |first=Thomas Owens |last=Mackubin |date=March 25, 2004 |work=National Review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216125903/http://old.nationalreview.com/books/owens200403251139.asp |archivedate=February 16, 2012 |url-status=live  |access-date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln rejected Fremont's two emancipation attempts in August 1861 and one by Major General [[David Hunter]] in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and would upset loyal border states.&lt;ref name= Guelzo1999/&gt;{{rp|290–291}}

On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July, the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]] was enacted, which set up court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed this was not within Congress's power, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could be taken only by the Commander-in-Chief, using Constitutional war powers, which he planned to do. Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|364–365}}

Privately, Lincoln concluded that the Confederacy's slave base had to be eliminated. However, Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''New York Tribune'' agreed.&lt;ref name= McPherson1992/&gt;{{rp|124}} Lincoln rejected this argument directly in his letter of August 22, 1862. Although he said he personally wished all men could be free, Lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his &quot;official duty&quot;) was that of preserving the Union:&lt;ref name= Guelzo2004/&gt;{{rp|147–153}}

{{quote|My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery.

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, with effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas under Union control in two states.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|364, 379}} Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Masur. (2012). ''Lincoln's Hundred Days: The Emancipation Proclamation and the War for the Union.'' Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, Union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|407}} Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up [[Abraham Lincoln on slavery#Colonization|colonies]] for the newly freed slaves. He supported this in the Proclamation, but the undertaking failed.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|408}}

Enlisting former slaves became official policy. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Tennessee military governor [[Andrew Johnson]] encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, &quot;The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|430–431}} By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General [[Lorenzo Thomas]] had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|431}}

====Gettysburg Address (1863)====
{{Main|Gettysburg Address}}
[[File:Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, Gettysburg, highlighted version.png|thumb|The only confirmed photo of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, some three hours before [[Gettysburg Address|the speech]]. Lincoln, absent his typical tophat, is highlighted.|alt=Large group of people]]
Lincoln spoke at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|453–460}} Defying his prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here&quot;, the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burlingame&quot;/&gt;{{rp|222}}

In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, &quot;conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal&quot;. He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end, and the future of democracy would be assured, that &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|460–466}}&lt;ref name= Wills/&gt;{{rp|20, 27, 105, 146}}

====General Grant====
[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|alt=Painting of four men conferring in a ship's cabin, entitled &quot;The Peacemakers&quot;.|thumb|upright=1.25|President Lincoln (center right) with, from left, Generals [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] and [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] and Admiral [[David Dixon Porter|Porter]] in ''[[The Peacemakers]]'', an 1868 painting of events aboard the ''[[River Queen (steamboat)|River Queen]]'' in March 1865]]

Grant's victories at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] and in the [[Vicksburg campaign]] impressed Lincoln. Responding to criticism of Grant after [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], Lincoln had said, &quot;I can't spare this man. He fights.&quot;&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|315}} With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, and incorporate black troops. Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander. Grant stayed with Meade's army and told Meade what to do.&lt;ref name= Nevins1947/&gt;{{rp|4:6–17}}

Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864, as was McClellan. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant's political intentions. Assured that he had none, Lincoln submitted Grant's appointment to the Senate. He obtained Congress's consent to make him Lieutenant General, a rank that had remained unoccupied since [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|490–492}}

Grant waged his bloody [[Overland Campaign]] in 1864, with heavy losses on both sides.&lt;ref name= McPherson2009/&gt;{{rp|113}} Despite this, when Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, the general replied, &quot;I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.&quot;&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|501}}

Grant's army moved steadily south. Lincoln traveled to Grant's headquarters at [[City Point, Virginia]] to confer with Grant and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehousehistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |title=The Peacemakers |publisher=The White House Historical Association |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927000627/http://www.whitehousehistory.org/whha_about/whitehouse_collection/whitehouse_collection-art-06.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead  |access-date=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln replaced the Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North.&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|422–424}}

Lincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructure—plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its fighting ability. Lincoln emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies rather than destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake.&lt;ref name= Neely2004/&gt;{{rp|434–458}}{{vague|date=December 2014}}

In 1864 Confederate general [[Jubal Early]] [[Battle of Fort Stevens|raided Washington, D.C.]], while Lincoln watched from an exposed position; Captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] shouted at him, &quot;Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!&quot;&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|434}}

As Grant continued to attrit Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President [[Alexander H. Stephens|Stephens]] led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at [[Hampton Roads Conference|Hampton Roads]]. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|565}} On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg. The Confederate government evacuated and the city fell. Lincoln visited the conquered capital. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], officially ending the war.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|589}}

===Re-election===
{{Main|1864 United States presidential election}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1864.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Map of the U.S. showing Lincoln winning all the Union states except for Kentucky, New Jersey, and Delaware. The Southern states are not included.|An [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral]] landslide for Lincoln (in red) in the 1864 election; southern states (brown) and territories (gray) not in play]]

Lincoln ran again in 1864. He united the main Republican factions, along with [[War Democrats]] such as [[Edwin M. Stanton]] and Andrew Johnson. Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him.&lt;ref name= Fish/&gt;{{rp|53–69}}&lt;ref name= Tegeder/&gt;{{rp|77–90}} At its convention, the Republicans selected Johnson as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new [[National Union Party (United States)|Union Party]].&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|494–507}}

Grant's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln's re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat. Lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:&lt;ref name= Grimsley/&gt;{{rp|80}} Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

While the Democratic platform followed the &quot;Peace wing&quot; of the party and called the war a &quot;failure&quot;, their candidate, McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and led his party to renew its support for Grant. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and [[David Farragut]]'s capture of Mobile ended defeatism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald1996&quot; /&gt;{{rp|531}} The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. The National Union Party was united by Lincoln's support for emancipation. State Republican parties stressed the [[perfidy]] of the Copperheads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Randall1955&quot; /&gt;{{rp|307}} On November 8, Lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of Union soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grimsley&quot; /&gt;{{rp|80}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Paludan&quot; /&gt;{{rp|274–293}}

[[File:Abraham Lincoln second inaugural address.jpg|thumb|alt=A large crowd in front of a large building with many pillars|Lincoln's second inaugural address in 1865 at the almost completed Capitol building]]
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his [[Lincoln's second inaugural address|second inaugural address]]. In it, he deemed the endless casualties to be God's will. Historian [[Mark Noll]] claims this speech to rank &quot;among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name= Noll2000/&gt;{{rp|426}} Lincoln said:

{{quote|Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the [[wikt:bondman|bond-man's]] 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said 3,000 years ago, so still it must be said, &quot;the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether&quot;. With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Abraham ''Abraham Lincoln: Selected Speeches and Writings'' (Library of America edition, 2009) p 450&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Reconstruction===
{{Main|Reconstruction era}}
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates considered how to reintegrate the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general asked Lincoln how to treat defeated Confederates. Lincoln replied, &quot;Let 'em up easy.&quot;&lt;ref name=Thomas2008/&gt;{{rp|509–512}} Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war even when it had passed, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. His main goal was to keep the union together. He planned to go forward not by focusing on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forged in Crisis: The Making of Five Legendary Leaders|last=Koehn|first=Nancy|publisher=Scribner|year=2017|isbn=978-1-5011-7444-5|location=NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep. [[Thaddeus Stevens]], Sen. [[Charles Sumner]] and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]], who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His [[Ten percent plan|Amnesty Proclamation]] of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|471–472}}

[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''. The caption reads (Johnson): &quot;Take it quietly Uncle Abe and I will draw it closer than ever.&quot; (Lincoln): &quot;A few more stitches Andy and the good old Union will be mended.&quot;]]

As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations re-formed. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln appointed Johnson and [[Frederick Steele]] as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the [[Wade–Davis Bill]], in 1864, which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|485–486}}

Lincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals' choice, [[Salmon P. Chase]], who Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.&lt;ref name= Nevins1947/&gt;{{rp|4:206}}

After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. He declared that such an amendment would &quot;clinch the whole matter&quot;.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|561}} By December 1863, an amendment was brought to Congress. This first attempt failed, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage became part of the Republican/Unionist platform. After a House debate, the second attempt passed on January 31, 1865.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|562–563}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-passes-the-13th-amendment |title=House passes the 13th Amendment – History.com This Day in History – 1/31/1865 |publisher=History.com |accessdate=November 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110065228/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/house-passes-the-13th-amendment |archive-date=November 10, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; With ratification, it became the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on December 6, 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Primary Documents in American History: 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |publisher=Library of Congress |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010110013/http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/13thamendment.html |archivedate=October 10, 2011 |url-status=live  |access-date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed Senator Charles Sumner's [[Freedmen's Bureau]] bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists.&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|242–243}}

Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived. Biographers [[James G. Randall]] and [[Richard Current]], according to David Lincove, argue that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lincove|first=David A.|title=Reconstruction in the United States: An Annotated Bibliography|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=3EQcT7-Dpi0C|page=80}}|year= 2000|publisher=Greenwood|page=80|access-date=June 27, 2015|isbn=978-0-313-29199-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes.}}

[[Eric Foner]] argues that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foner|first=Eric|title=The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=4b8m7cv3wTIC|page=335}}|year=2010|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=334–36|access-date=June 27, 2015|isbn=978-0-393-34066-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans.&amp;nbsp;... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves&amp;nbsp;... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death.}}

===Native American policy===
Lincoln's connection with Indians was pre-dated by his grandfather, who was killed by Indians in 1784. Lincoln claimed Indians were antagonistic toward his father, [[Thomas Lincoln]], and his young family. Although Lincoln was a veteran of the Black Hawk War, fought in Wisconsin and Illinois, in 1832, he saw no significant action.&lt;ref name=Nichols1974&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nichols|first=David A.|title=The Other Civil War Lincoln and the Indians|url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/44/v44i01p002-015.pdf|date=Spring 1974|journal=Minnesota History}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} During his presidency, Lincoln's policy toward Indians was dominated by political considerations.&lt;ref name=Nichols1974/&gt;{{rp|3}} Lincoln used the Indian Bureau as a source of patronage, making  blanket appointments to his loyal followers in Minnesota and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name=Nichols1974/&gt;{{rp|4}} President Lincoln faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks.&lt;ref name=Nichols1974/&gt;{{rp|4}}

On August 17, 1862, the [[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]], in alliance with the [[Yankton Sioux Tribe|Yankton Indians]], started in Minnesota, killing hundreds of white settlers and forcing 30,000 from their homes.&lt;ref name=Burlingame2008/&gt;{{rp|480}} The Indian violence deeply alarmed the Lincoln administration. Some believed it was a conspiracy by the Confederacy to launch a war on the Northwestern front.&lt;ref name=Nichols1974/&gt;{{rp|4–5,7}} Taking the matter seriously, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to Minnesota, making him commander of the new Northwestern Department.&lt;ref name=Nichols1974/&gt;{{rp|7}}  Lincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war (''[[POWs]]''), sent by railroad, to put down the Sioux Uprising.&lt;ref name=Burlingame2008&gt;{{cite book|last=Burlingame|first=Michael|title=Abraham Lincoln: A Life|volume=2|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|481}}&lt;ref name=Nichols1974/&gt;{{rp|7}} When the Confederates protested turning ''POWs'' into Indian fighters, Lincoln relented, and revoked the policy.&lt;ref name=Burlingame2008/&gt;{{rp|481}} Pope campaigned against the Indians mercilessly and with vigor, even advocating their extinction. Pope ordered Indian farms and food supplies to be destroyed, and Indian warriors to be killed.&lt;ref name=Nichols1974/&gt;{{rp|7}} Aiding Pope, Minnesota Congressman Col. [[Henry Hastings Sibley|Henry H. Sibley]] led militiamen and regular troops to defeat the Sioux at [[Battle of Wood Lake|Wood Lake]].&lt;ref name=Burlingame2008/&gt;{{rp|481}} By October 9, Pope considered the uprising to be ended, although hostilities ceased on December 26.&lt;ref name=Nichols1974/&gt;{{rp|8}}

Presented with 303 execution warrants for [[Sioux#Santee (Isáŋyathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were convicted of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each warrant, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).&lt;ref name= Cox/&gt;{{rp|182}} Former Governor of Minnesota [[Alexander Ramsey]] told Lincoln, in 1864, that Lincoln would have gotten more presidential election support had he executed all 303 of the Indians. Lincoln responded, &quot;I could not afford to hang men for votes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Burlingame2008/&gt;{{rp|483}}

===Other enactments===
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, giving Congress primary responsibility for lawmaking while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program.&lt;ref name= Donald2001/&gt;{{rp|137}} The [[1862 Homestead Act]] made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. The 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] provided government grants for [[List of agricultural universities and colleges|agricultural colleges]] in each state. The [[Pacific Railway Acts]] of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which was completed in 1869.&lt;ref name= Paludan/&gt;{{rp|116}} The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=McPherson1993/&gt;{{rp|450–452}}

In July 1861, the US issued paper currency for the first time. The currency became known [[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]], because it was printed in green on the reverse side.&lt;ref&gt;Brands 2011, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a [[Income tax in the United States|Federal income tax]]. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, following the first enacted by Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Revenue Act of 1861]], creating the first U.S. income tax.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|424}} This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms). The [[Revenue Act of 1862]] adopted rates that increased with income.&lt;ref name= Paludan/&gt;{{rp|111}}

Lincoln presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in other areas. The [[National Banking Act]] created the system of national banks. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name=Donald2001/&gt;{{rp|424}}

In response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the ''[[New York World]]'' and the ''[[The Journal of Commerce|Journal of Commerce]]'' published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln attacked the media about such behavior, ordering the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|501–502}}

Lincoln is largely responsible for the [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving holiday]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald1996&quot; /&gt;{{rp|471}} Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century. It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. The prior proclamation had been during [[James Madison]]'s presidency 50 years earlier. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald1996&quot; /&gt;{{rp|471}}

In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as [[Yosemite National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schaffer|first=Jeffrey P.|title=Yosemite National Park: A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails|publisher=Wilderness Press|page=48|location=Berkeley|year=1999|isbn=978-0-89997-244-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that &quot;we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald1996&quot; /&gt;{{rp|471}} Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]] was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. [[Samuel Freeman Miller]], supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. Democrat [[Stephen Johnson Field]], a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blue&quot; /&gt;{{rp|245}}

====Other judicial appointments====
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], and 27 judges to the [[United States district courts]].

Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by [[John Wilkes Booth]] on [[Good Friday]], April 14, 1865, while attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] with his wife, a mere five days after Lee's surrender. Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|586–587}} After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, Booth decided to assassinate the President.&lt;ref name= Harrison2000/&gt;{{rp|3–4}} Learning of Lincoln's intent to attend the play with Grant, Booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater and to kill Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their respective homes.

At 10:13&amp;nbsp;pm, Booth entered the back of Lincoln's theater box, crept up from behind, and fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him.

The late President lay in state, first in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21.

As a young man, Lincoln was a [[religious skepticism|religious skeptic]].&lt;ref name=Carwardine2003/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot; /&gt;{{rp|84}} He was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|48–49, 514–515}} He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name=Noll1992/&gt; 

In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the [[The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated|Doctrine of Necessity]], a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power.&lt;ref name=Donald1996/&gt;{{rp|48–49}} With the death of his son [[Edward Baker Lincoln|Edward]] (died 1850), Lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on God.&lt;ref name= Parrillo/&gt;{{rp|227–253}} He never joined a church, although he frequently attended [[First Presbyterian Church (Springfield, Illinois)|First Presbyterian Church]] with his wife beginning in 1852.&lt;ref name=&quot;White p. 180&quot; /&gt;{{efn|On claims that Lincoln was baptized by an associate of [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]], see {{cite journal|url=http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html |last=Martin |first=Jim |title=The secret baptism of Abraham Lincoln |journal=Restoration Quarterly |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1996 |access-date=May 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019204330/http://www.acu.edu/sponsored/restoration_quarterly/archives/1990s/vol_38_no_2_contents/martin.html |archivedate=October 19, 2012 }}}} He rented a pew and occasionally attended church services.&lt;ref name=&quot;White p. 180&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=White |first=Ronald C. |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781400064991 |url-access=registration |title=A.

In the 1850s, Lincoln asserted his belief in &quot;providence&quot; in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=g9EynQEACAAJ}}|title=&quot;Our Country&quot;: Northern Evangelicals and the Union During the Civil War and Reconstruction|last=Brodrecht|first=Grant R.|date=2008|publisher=University of Notre Dame|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death of son [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie]] in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for solace.&lt;ref name= Wilson/&gt;{{rp|251–254}} After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary.

And having begun, He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.&quot;&lt;ref name= Wilson/&gt;{{rp|254}} 

He did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.&lt;ref name=Noll1992/&gt; Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]].&lt;ref name= Carwardine1997/&gt;{{rp|27–55}} On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name= Guelzo1999/&gt;{{rp|434}}

=== Republican values ===
Lincoln's redefinition of ''[[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]]'' have been stressed by historians such as [[John Patrick Diggins]], [[Harry V. Jaffa]], [[Vernon Burton]], [[Eric Foner]], and Herman J. Belz.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Thomas |first=Benjamin Platt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFhKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;dq=Lincoln+%2522republican+values%2522+Jaffa+Diggins+Burton |title=Abraham Lincoln: a Biography |year=1952 |publisher=Marine Publishing |pages=PT61 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln called the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]—which emphasized freedom for all and equality—the &quot;[[sheet anchor]]&quot; of republicanism beginning in the 1850s. He did this at a time when the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]], which &quot;tolerated slavery&quot;, was the focus of most political discourse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffa&quot; /&gt;{{rp|399}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; Diggins notes, &quot;Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself&quot; in the [[Cooper Union speech|1860 Cooper Union speech]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Diggins&quot; /&gt;{{rp|307}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner2010&quot; /&gt;{{rp|215}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt;

His position on war, though, was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution. His position was in effect that the Constitution is essentially a contract among the states, and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract. Further, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffa&quot; /&gt;{{rp|263}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot; /&gt; Many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=_zaSs2HzEEwC|page=243}}|title=The Age of Lincoln: A History|last=Burton|first=Orville Vernon|date=July 8, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9781429939553|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lincoln's [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|first inaugural address]], he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints.

The successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people view the country. The term &quot;the United States&quot; has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (&quot;these United States&quot;), and other times in the singular. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Burt |first=Andrew |date=May 13, 2013 |title='These United States': How Obama's Vocal Tic Reveals a Polarized America |magazine=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/05/these-united-states-how-obamas-vocal-tic-reveals-a-polarized-america/275739/ |language=en-US |access-date=February 14, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Lincoln's assassination left him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party.

Schwartz argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the [[Progressive Era]] (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of America's most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name= Schwartz2000/&gt;{{rp|109}} 

Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, &quot;helped lead America to the nationalism of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boritt2002&quot;/&gt;{{rp|222}} In the [[New Deal]] era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the [[self-made man]] or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name= Schwartz2009/&gt;{{rp|23, 91–98}}
 
Sociologist [[Barry Schwartz (sociologist)|Barry Schwartz]] argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with &quot;a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life&quot;. During the [[Great Depression]], he argues, Lincoln served &quot;as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful&quot;. Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan.
