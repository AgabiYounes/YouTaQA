A '''cabal''' is a group of people united in some close design, usually to promote their private views or interests in an ideology, [[state (polity)|state]], or other community, often by [[Wiktionary:intrigue|intrigue]] and usually unbeknownst to those outside their group. The use of this term usually carries negative connotations of political purpose, conspiracy and secrecy.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cabal|title=Collins English Dictionary: Cabal|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wordpandit.com/cabal/|title=Wordpandit: Cabal|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also refer to a secret plot or a [[clique]], or may be used as a verb (to form a cabal or to conspire secretly).&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''cabal'' derives from [[Kabbalah]] (a word that has numerous spelling variations), the [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish mystical]] interpretation of the Hebrew scripture. In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] it means &quot;reception&quot; or &quot;tradition&quot;, denoting the ''sod'' (secret) level of [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Jewish exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/kabbalah.htm|title=Judaism 101: Kabbalah and Jewish Mysticism|website=www.jewfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European culture ([[Christian Cabala]], [[Hermetic Qabalah]]) it became associated with [[occult]] doctrine or a secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60664380|title=Kabbalah : a very short introduction|last=Dan|first=Joseph|page=67|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195327052|location=New York, NY|oclc=60664380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It came into English via the French ''cabale'' from the medieval Latin ''cabbala'', and was known early in the 17th century through usages linked to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]]. By the middle of the 17th century it had developed further to mean some intrigue entered into by a small group and also referred to the group of people so involved, i.e. a semi-secret political clique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cab1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Cabal|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501021445/http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-cab1.htm|archive-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a theory that the term took on its present meaning from a group of ministers formed in 1668 - the &quot;[[Cabal ministry]]&quot; of King [[Charles II of England]]. Members included [[Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh|Sir Thomas Clifford]], [[Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington|Lord Arlington]], the [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Ashley]], and [[John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale|Lord Lauderdale]], whose initial letters coincidentally spelled CABAL, and who were the signatories of the [[Secret Treaty of Dover]] that allied [[England]] to [[France]] in a prospective war against the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will and Ariel.  ''The Age of Louis XIV.'' (page 277) New York: Simon And Schuster, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory that the word originated as an acronym from the names of the group of ministers is a [[folk etymology]], although the coincidence was noted at the time and could possibly have popularized its use.&lt;ref name=HCG&gt;{{Cite book|title=Europe: Its Influence on South Africa|last=Girdlestone|first=Henry Clapcott|page=178|edition=11th impression, revised &amp; enlarged by Cecil Lewis|date=1926|publisher=Juta &amp; Co.|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;
