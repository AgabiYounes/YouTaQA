The Canadian government has influenced  culture with programs, laws and institutions. It has created crown corporations to promote Canadian culture through media, such as the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) and the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), and promotes many events which it considers to promote Canadian traditions. It has also tried to [[Canadian cultural protectionism|protect Canadian culture]] by setting legal minimums on [[Canadian content]] in many media using bodies like the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Film Board of Canada |authorlink=National Film Board of Canada|url=http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&amp;lg=en |title=Mandate of the National Film Board |year=2005|accessdate=March 15, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060421170854/http://www.nfb.ca/atonf/organisation.php?v=h&amp;lg=en |archivedate = April 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Ian McKay (historian)|Ian MacKay]] argues that, thanks to the long-term political impact of &quot;[[Upper Canada Rebellion|Rebels]], [[Socialism in Canada|Reds]], and [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|Radicals]]&quot;, and allied leftist political elements, &quot;egalitarianism, social equality, and peace... are now often simply referred to...as 'Canadian values.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McKay2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian McKay|title=Rebels, Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gc_yHAW03fIC&amp;pg=PA181|year=2005|publisher=Between The Lines|isbn=978-1-896357-97-3|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 [[Statistics Canada]] survey found that an &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of Canadians shared the values of human rights (with 92% of respondents agreeing that they are a shared Canadian value), respect for the law (92%) and gender equality (91%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-652-x/89-652-x2015005-eng.htm#a2|title=Canadian Identity, 2013|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal access to publicly funded health services &quot;is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national health care insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Health of Canadians – The Federal Role|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/372/soci/rep/repoct02vol6part7-e.htm|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=5 January 2017|location=17.2 Universality|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians stemming from the French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the [[British Empire]], resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marger2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin N.

[[Western alienation]] is the notion that the [[Western Canada|western provinces]]  have historically been alienated, and in extreme cases excluded, from mainstream Canadian political affairs in favour of [[Eastern Canada]] or more specifically the  [[central Canada|central provinces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wesley2011o&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Jared J.

Though more than half of Canadians live in just two provinces: Ontario and Quebec, each province is largely self-contained due to provincial economic self-sufficiency. Only 15 percent of Canadians live in a different province from where they were born, and only 10 percent go to another province for university. Canada has always been like that, and stands in sharp contrast to the United States' internal mobility which is much higher. For example 30 percent live in a different state from where they were born, and 30 percent go away for university. [[Scott Gilmore]] in ''[[Maclean's]]'' argues that &quot;Canada is a nation of strangers&quot;, in the sense that for most individuals, the rest of Canada outside their province is little-known.  Another factor is the cost of internal travel. Intra-Canadian airfares are high—it is cheaper and more common to visit the United States than to visit another province. Gilmore argues that the mutual isolation makes it difficult to muster national responses to major national issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macleans.ca/opinion/canada-a-nation-of-strangers/?sfi=1c19d41d13bc01bd139ed1efb9272ccf|title=Canada: A nation of strangers |publisher=[[Macleans]]|author=Scott Gilmore|quote=Canada: A nation of strangers: Canadians don’t often move out of their birth province.

===Humour===
{{Main|Canadian humour}}
[[Canadian humour]] is an integral part of the Canadian Identity. There are several traditions in Canadian humour in both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Quebec French|French]].&lt;ref name = Scobie&gt;Scobie, Stephen [http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/humorous-writing-in-english/ &quot;Humorous Writing in English&quot;].

===Literature===
[[File:Atwood123.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Margaret Atwood]] is a Canadian poet, novelist, literary critic, essayist, inventor, teacher and environmental activist.]]
{{Main|Canadian literature}}
[[Canadian literature]] is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=W. J. Keith|title=Canadian literature in English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rGawhTGpGK0C&amp;pg=PA19|year= 2006|publisher=The Porcupine's Quill|isbn=978-0-88984-283-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's early literature, whether written in English or French, often reflects the Canadian perspective on nature, frontier life, and Canada's position in the world, for example the poetry of [[Bliss Carman]] or the memoirs of [[Susanna Moodie]] and [[Catherine Parr Traill]]. These themes, and Canada's literary history, inform the writing of successive generations of Canadian authors, from [[Leonard Cohen]] to [[Margaret Atwood]].

By the mid-20th century, Canadian writers were exploring national themes for Canadian readers. Authors were trying to find a distinctly Canadian voice, rather than merely emulating British or American writers. Canadian identity is closely tied to its literature. The question of national identity recurs as a theme in much of Canada's literature, from [[Hugh MacLennan]]'s ''[[Two Solitudes (novel)|Two Solitudes]]'' (1945) to [[Alistair MacLeod]]'s ''[[No Great Mischief]]'' (1999). Canadian literature is often categorized by [[List of regions of Canada|region or province]]; by the socio-cultural origins of the author (for example, [[Acadians]],  indigenous peoples, LGBT, and [[Irish Canadian]]s); and by literary period, such as &quot;Canadian postmoderns&quot; or &quot;Canadian Poets Between the Wars&quot;.

[[Sports in Canada]] consists of a variety of games. Although there are many contests that Canadians value, the most common are [[ice hockey]], [[box lacrosse]], [[Canadian football]], basketball, soccer, [[curling]], baseball and [[ringette]]. All but curling and soccer are considered domestic sports as they were either invented by Canadians or trace their roots to Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;MorrowWamsley2013&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Don Morrow|author2=Kevin B.
