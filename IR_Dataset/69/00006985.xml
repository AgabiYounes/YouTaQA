'''Chlorophyll''' (also '''chlorophyl''') is any of several related green [[pigment]]s found in the [[mesosomes]] of [[cyanobacteria]], as well as in the [[chloroplast]]s of [[alga]]e and [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/chlorophyll/chlorophyll_h.htm | title =Chlorophyll | last = May | first = Paul | name-list-format = vanc | publisher=[[University of Bristol]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words {{lang|grc|χλωρός}}, {{transl|grc|khloros}} (&quot;pale green&quot;) and {{lang|grc|φύλλον}}, {{transl|grc|phyllon}} (&quot;leaf&quot;).&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=chlorophyll|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=chlorophyll&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorophyll is essential in [[photosynthesis]], allowing plants to absorb [[energy]] from light.

Chlorophylls absorb light most strongly in the [[Diffuse sky radiation|blue portion]] of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] as well as the red portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muneer S, Kim EJ, Park JS, Lee JH | title = Influence of green, red and blue light emitting diodes on multiprotein complex proteins and photosynthetic activity under different light intensities in lettuce leaves (Lactuca sativa L.) | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 4657–70 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24642884 | pmc = 3975419 | doi = 10.3390/ijms15034657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum, which it reflects, producing the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues. Two types of chlorophyll exist in the photosystems of green plants: [[chlorophyll a]] and [[chlorophyll b|b]].&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
Chlorophyll was first isolated and named by [[Joseph Bienaimé Caventou]] and [[Pierre Joseph Pelletier]] in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;See:

On p. 490, the authors propose a new name for chlorophyll. From p. 490: ''&quot;Nous n'avons aucun droit pour nommer une substance connue depuis long-temps, et à l'histoire de laquelle nous n'avons ajouté que quelques faits ; cependant nous proposerons, sans y mettre aucune importance, le nom de ''chlorophyle'', de ''chloros'', couleur, et ''φυλλον'', feuille : ce nom indiquerait le rôle qu'elle joue dans la nature.&quot;''  (We have no right to name a substance [that has been] known for a long time, and to whose story we have added only a few facts ; however, we will propose, without giving it any importance, the name ''chlorophyll'', from ''chloros'', color, and ''φυλλον'', leaf :  this name would indicate the role that it plays in nature.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of magnesium in chlorophyll was discovered in 1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Willstätter | first = Richard | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1906 | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002455980;view=1up;seq=436 | title = Zur Kenntniss der Zusammensetzung des Chlorophylls | trans-title = Contribution to the knowledge of the composition of chlorophyll | language = German | journal = Annalen der Chemie | volume = 350 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 48–82 | quote = From p. 49: ''&quot;Das Hauptproduct der alkalischen Hydrolyse bilden tiefgrüne Alkalisalze.

After initial work done by German chemist [[Richard Willstätter]] spanning from 1905 to 1915, the general structure of chlorophyll ''a'' was elucidated by [[Hans Fischer]] in 1940. By 1960, when most of the [[stereochemistry]] of chlorophyll ''a'' was known, [[Robert Burns Woodward]] published a total synthesis of the molecule.&lt;ref name=&quot;motilva&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodward RB, Ayer WA, Beaton JM, Bickelhaupt F, Bonnett R, Buchschacher P, Closs G, Dutler H, Hannah J, Hauck F, Itô S, Langemann A, Le Goff E, Leimgruber W, Lwowski W, Sauer J, Valenta Z, Volz H |display-authors=6  |date=July 1960|title=The total synthesis of chlorophyll|journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]|volume=82|issue=14|pages=3800–3802|doi=10.1021/ja01499a093|url=http://media.iupac.org/publications/pac/1961/pdf/0203x0383.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the last remaining stereochemical elucidation was completed by [[Ian Fleming (chemist)|Ian Fleming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleming|first=Ian | name-list-format = vanc |author-link=Ian Fleming (chemist)|date=14 October 1967|title=Absolute Configuration and the Structure of Chlorophyll|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=216|pages=151–152|doi=10.1038/216151a0|issue=5111|bibcode = 1967Natur.216..151F }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 Woodward and co-authors published an updated synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Woodward RB, Ayer WA, Beaton JM, Bickelhaupt F, Bonnett R, Buchschacher P, Closs GL, Dutler H, Hannah J, Hauck FP, Itǒ S, Langemann A, Le Goff E, Leimgruber W, Lwowski W, Sauer J, Valenta Z, Volz H | display-authors = 6 |year=1990|title=The total synthesis of chlorophyll a|journal=[[Tetrahedron (journal)|Tetrahedron]] |volume=46 |issue=22 |pages=7599–7659 |doi=10.1016/0040-4020(90)80003-Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chlorophyll f]] was announced to be present in [[cyanobacteria]] and other oxygenic microorganisms that form [[stromatolites]] in 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jabr | first = Ferris | name-list-format = vanc | date = August 2010 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=new-form-chlorophyll | title = A New Form of Chlorophyll? | journal = Scientific American }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19338-infrared-chlorophyll-could-boost-solar-cells.html Infrared chlorophyll could boost solar cells].

The spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified ''in vivo'' depending on specific pigment-protein interactions.]]
Chlorophyll is vital for [[photosynthesis]], which allows plants to absorb energy from [[light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio104/photosyn.htm | title =Photosynthesis | last = Carter | first = J.

Chlorophyll molecules are arranged in and around [[photosystem]]s that are embedded in the [[thylakoid]] membranes of [[chloroplast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/photosynthetic-cells-14025371 | title =Essentials of Cell Biology|chapter=Unit 1.3. Photosynthetic Cells | author =Nature | publisher =nature.com | date =July 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these complexes, chlorophyll serves three functions. The function of the vast majority of chlorophyll (up to several hundred molecules per photosystem) is to absorb light.  Having done so, these same centers execute their second function: the transfer of that light energy by [[resonance energy transfer]] to a specific chlorophyll pair in the [[reaction center]] of the photosystems.  This pair effects the final function of chlorophylls, charge separation, leading to biosynthesis.
The two currently accepted photosystem units are [[photosystem II]] and [[photosystem I]], which have their own distinct reaction centres, named [[P680]] and [[P700]], respectively. These centres are named after the wavelength (in [[nanometer]]s) of their red-peak absorption maximum. The identity, function and spectral properties of the types of chlorophyll in each photosystem are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them. Once extracted from the protein into a solvent (such as [[acetone]] or [[methanol]]),&lt;ref name=Marker1972&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Marker | first = A. F.

The function of the reaction center of chlorophyll is to absorb light energy and transfer it to other parts of the photosystem. The absorbed energy of the photon is transferred to an electron in a process called charge separation. The removal of the electron from the chlorophyll is an oxidation reaction. The chlorophyll donates the high energy electron to a series of molecular intermediates called an [[electron transport chain]]. The charged reaction center of chlorophyll (P680&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron stripped from water. The electron that reduces P680&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through several intermediates. This reaction is how photosynthetic organisms such as plants produce O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas, and is the source for practically all the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Earth's atmosphere. Photosystem I typically works in series with Photosystem II; thus the P700&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of Photosystem I is usually reduced as it accepts the electron, via many intermediates in the thylakoid membrane, by electrons coming, ultimately, from Photosystem II. Electron transfer reactions in the thylakoid membranes are complex, however, and the source of electrons used to reduce P700&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can vary.

The electron flow produced by the reaction center chlorophyll pigments is used to pump H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the thylakoid membrane, setting up a [[chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic]] potential used mainly in the production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (stored chemical energy) or to reduce NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to [[NADPH]]. NADPH is a universal [[redox|agent]] used to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into sugars as well as other biosynthetic reactions.

Reaction center chlorophyll–protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without the assistance of other chlorophyll pigments, but the probability of that happening under a given light intensity is small. Thus, the other chlorophylls in the photosystem and antenna pigment proteins all cooperatively absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center. Besides chlorophyll ''a'', there are other pigments, called [[accessory pigment]]s, which occur in these pigment–protein antenna complexes.

==Chemical structure==
[[Image:Chlorophyll-a-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Space-filling model of the chlorophyll{{ns|1}}a molecule]]
Chlorophylls are numerous in types, but all are defined by the presence of a fifth ring beyond the four pyrrole-like rings.  Most chlorophylls are classified as [[chlorin]]s, which are reduced relatives of [[porphyrins]] (found in [[hemoglobin]]).  They share a common biosynthetic pathway with porphyrins, including the precursor [[uroporphyrinogen III]].  Unlike hemes, which feature iron at the center of the [[tetrapyrrole]] ring, chlorophylls bind [[magnesium]]. For the structures depicted in this article, some of the [[ligand]]s attached to the Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center are omitted for clarity. The chlorin ring can have various side chains, usually including a long [[phytol]] chain. The most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is chlorophyll ''a''.

The structures of chlorophylls are summarized below:{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

By measuring the absorption of light in the red and far red regions, it is possible to estimate the concentration of chlorophyll within a leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Cate T, Perkins TD |date=September 2003| title = Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Caventou| journal = Journal of Tree Physiology| volume = 23| issue = 15| pages = 1077–1079| doi = 10.1093/treephys/23.15.1077|pmid=12975132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratio fluorescence emission can be used to measure chlorophyll content. By exciting chlorophyll ''a'' fluorescence at a lower wavelength, the ratio of chlorophyll fluorescence emission at {{val|705|10|u=nm}} and {{val|735|10|u=nm}} can provide a linear relationship of chlorophyll content when compared with chemical testing. The ratio ''F''&lt;sub&gt;735&lt;/sub&gt;/''F''&lt;sub&gt;700&lt;/sub&gt; provided a [[correlation coefficient|correlation value of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] 0.96 compared with chemical testing in the range from 41&amp;nbsp;mg&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; up to 675&amp;nbsp;mg&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. Gitelson also developed a formula for direct readout of chlorophyll content in mg&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. The formula provided a reliable method of measuring chlorophyll content from 41&amp;nbsp;mg&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; up to 675&amp;nbsp;mg&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; with a correlation ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value of 0.95.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Gitelson AA, Buschmann C, Lichtenthaler HK |date=1999 |title=The Chlorophyll Fluorescence Ratio ''F''&lt;sub&gt;735&lt;/sub&gt;/''F''&lt;sub&gt;700&lt;/sub&gt; as an Accurate Measure of Chlorophyll Content in Plants |journal=Remote Sens.

==Biosynthesis==
{{Further|Protochlorophyllide}}
In plants, chlorophyll is derived from glutamate and is synthesised along a branched biosynthetic pathway that is shared with heme and siroheme. The immediate precursor to chlorophyll ''a'' and ''b'' is [[protochlorophyllide]]. In [[Angiosperm]] plants, the last step, the conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll, is light-dependent and such plants are pale ([[etiolation|etiolated]]) if grown in darkness. [[Non-vascular plant]]s and green algae have an additional light-independent enzyme and grow green even in darkness.

Chlorophyll itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction. Protochlorophyllide occurs mostly in the free form and, under light conditions, acts as a [[photosensitizer]], forming highly toxic [[free radicals]]. Hence, plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of chlorophyll precursor. In angiosperms, this is done at the step of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), one of the intermediate compounds in the biosynthesis pathway. Plants that are fed by ALA accumulate high and toxic levels of protochlorophyllide; so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Further|Chlorosis}}
Chlorosis is a condition in which [[leaf|leaves]] produce insufficient chlorophyll, turning them yellow. Chlorosis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of [[Iron deficiency (plant disorder)|iron]] — called iron chlorosis — or by a shortage of [[magnesium deficiency (plants)|magnesium]] or [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen]]. Soil pH sometimes plays a role in nutrient-caused chlorosis; many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific pH levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this.&lt;ref&gt;

== Complementary light absorbance of anthocyanins ==
[[File:Spectra Chlorophyll ab oenin (1).PNG|thumb|right| Superposition of spectra of chlorophyll a and b with [[oenin]] (malvidin 3O glucoside), a typical [[anthocyanidin]], showing that, while chlorophylls absorb in the blue and yellow/red parts of the visible spectrum, oenin absorbs mainly in the green part of the spectrum, where chlorophylls don't absorb at all.]]
[[Anthocyanin]]s are other [[plant pigment]]s. The absorbance pattern responsible for the [[red]] color of anthocyanins may be complementary to that of green chlorophyll in photosynthetically active tissues such as young ''[[Quercus coccifera]]'' leaves. It may protect the leaves from attacks by plant eaters that may be attracted by green color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karageorgou P, Manetas Y | title = The importance of being red when young: anthocyanins and the protection of young leaves of Quercus coccifera from insect herbivory and excess light | journal = Tree Physiology | volume = 26 | issue = 5 | pages = 613–21 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16452075 | doi = 10.1093/treephys/26.5.613 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
The chlorophyll maps show milligrams of chlorophyll per cubic meter of seawater each month. Places where chlorophyll amounts were very low, indicating very low numbers of [[phytoplankton]], are blue. Places where chlorophyll concentrations were high, meaning many phytoplankton were growing, are yellow. The observations come from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua satellite. Land is dark gray, and places where MODIS could not collect data because of sea ice, polar darkness, or clouds are light gray. The highest chlorophyll concentrations, where tiny surface-dwelling ocean plants are [[thriving]], are in cold polar waters or in places where ocean currents bring cold water to the surface, such as around the equator and along the shores of continents. It is not the cold water itself that stimulates the phytoplankton. Instead, the cool temperatures are often a sign that the water has welled up to the surface from deeper in the ocean, carrying nutrients that have built up over time. In polar waters, nutrients accumulate in surface waters during the dark winter months when plants cannot grow. When sunlight returns in the spring and summer, the plants flourish in high concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MY1DMM_CHLORA Chlorophyll : Global Maps].

== Culinary use ==
Chlorophyll is registered as a food additive (colorant), and its [[E number]] is E140. Chefs use chlorophyll to color a variety of foods and beverages green, such as pasta and spirits. [[Absinthe#Production|Absinthe]] gains its green color naturally from the chlorophyll introduced through the large variety of herbs used in its production.&lt;ref name=Adams2004&gt;{{cite book | last = Adams | first = Jad | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2004 | title = Hideous absinthe : a history of the devil in a bottle | page = 22 | isbn = 978-1860649202 | publisher = I.B.Tauris, 2004 | location = United Kingdom | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b7FwE6EpNPoC&amp;pg=PA22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chlorophyll is not soluble in water, and it is first mixed with a small quantity of [[vegetable oil]] to obtain the desired [[solution]].
