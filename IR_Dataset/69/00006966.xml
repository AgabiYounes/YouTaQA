The traditional '''Chinese calendar''' (officially known as the Agricultural Calendar [{{zh|labels=no |s=农历 |t=農曆 |p=Nónglì |l=farming calendar}}]), Former Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = 旧历 |t = 舊曆 |p = Jiùlì}}), Traditional Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = 老历 |t = 老曆 |p = Lǎolì}}) or Lunar Calendar ({{zh|labels=no |s = 阴历 |t = 陰曆 |p = Yīnlì |l = [[Yin and yang|yin]] calendar }}), is a [[lunisolar calendar]] which reckons years, months and days according to astronomical phenomena. In modern days, it is defined in China by [[GB/T]] 33661–2017, &quot;Calculation and promulgation of the Chinese calendar&quot;, issued by the Standardisation Administration of China on 12 May 2017.

Although modern-day China uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], the traditional Chinese calendar governs holidays—such as the [[Chinese New Year]] and [[Chinese New Year|Lantern Festival]]—in both China and in [[overseas Chinese]] communities. It also gives the traditional Chinese nomenclature of dates within a year, which people use for selecting auspicious days for [[Auspicious wedding dates|weddings]], funerals, moving, or starting a business.  The evening state-run news program ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' in the P.R.C. continues to announce the month and date in both the Gregorian and the traditional lunisolar calendar.

Like [[Chinese characters]], variants of this calendar are used in different parts of the [[East Asian cultural sphere]]. Korea, Vietnam, and the Ryukyu Islands adopted the calendar, and it evolved into [[Korean calendar|Korean]], [[Vietnamese calendar|Vietnamese]], and [[Ryukyuan religion#religious calendar|Ryukyuan calendars]]. The main difference from the traditional Chinese calendar is the use of different [[Meridian (geography)|meridians]], which leads to some astronomical events—and calendar events based on them—falling on different dates. The traditional [[Japanese calendar]] also derived from the Chinese calendar (based on a Japanese meridian), but its official use in Japan was abolished in 1873 as part of reforms after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Calendars in [[Mongolian calendar|Mongolia]] and [[Tibetan calendar|Tibet]] have absorbed elements of the traditional Chinese calendar, but are not direct descendants of it.{{citation needed|date=January 2019|reason=Mongolian needed}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.uu.se/~svante/papers/calendars/tibet.pdf|title=Tibetan Calendar Mathematics|last=Janson|first=Svante|website=|url-status=live|access-date=26 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days begin and end at midnight, and months begin on the day of the [[new moon]]. Years begin on the second (or third) new moon after the [[winter solstice]]. [[Solar term]]s govern the beginning and end of each month. A [[sexagenary cycle]], consisting of stems (干) and branches (支), is used as identification alongside each year, month, including [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary months]] or leap months as needed. The length of a month is also annotated as either long (大, literally &quot;big&quot; for months with 30 days) or short (小, literally &quot;small&quot; for months with 29 days).

===Solar calendars===
[[File:Five Phases and Four Seasons Calendar.png|thumb|alt=See caption|Five-phase and four-quarter calendars]]
The traditional Chinese calendar was developed between 771 and 476 BC, during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of the [[Eastern Zhou]] dynasty. Before the [[Zhou dynasty]], solar calendars were used.

One version of the solar calendar is the five-elements calendar ({{zh|labels=no|s=五行历|t=五行曆}}), which derives from the [[Wu Xing]]. A 365-day year was divided into five phases of 73 days, with each phase corresponding to a Day 1 Wu Xing element. A phase began with a governing-element day ({{zh|labels=no|c=行御}}), followed by six 12-day weeks. Each phase consisted of two three-week months, making each year ten months long. Years began on a ''jiǎzǐ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=甲子}}) day (and a 72-day wood phase), followed by a ''bǐngzǐ'' day ({{zh|labels=no|c=丙子}}) and a 72-day fire phase; a ''wùzǐ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=戊子}}) day and a 72-day earth phase; a ''gēngzǐ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=庚子}}) day and a 72-day metal phase, and a ''rénzǐ'' day ({{zh|labels=no|c=壬子}}) followed by a water phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guanzi 41&quot;&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:管子 |trans-title=[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] |script-chapter=zh:第41篇五行 |trans-chapter=Chapter 41: Five Elements |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E7%AE%A1%E5%AD%90/%E7%AC%AC41%E7%AF%87%E4%BA%94%E8%A1%8C |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other days were tracked using the [[Yellow River Map]] (''He Tu'').

Another version is a four-quarters calendar ({{zh|labels=no|s=四时八节历|t=四時八節曆|l=four sections, eight seasons calendar}}, or {{zh|labels=no|t=四分曆|s=四分历}}). Weeks were ten days long, with one month consisting of three weeks. A year had 12 months, with a ten-day week [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalated]] in summer as needed to keep up with the tropical year. The 10 [[Heavenly Stems]] and 12 [[Earthly Branches]] were used to mark days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guanzi 40&quot;&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:管子 |trans-title=[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]] |script-chapter=zh:第40篇四時 |trans-chapter=Chapter 40: Four Sections |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E7%AE%A1%E5%AD%90/%E7%AC%AC40%E7%AF%87%E5%9B%9B%E6%99%82 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third version is the balanced calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=調曆|s=调历}}). A year was 365.25 days, and a month was 29.5 days. After every 16th month, a half-month was intercalated. According to [[oracle bone]] records, the [[Shang dynasty]] calendar ({{Circa|1600|1046}} BC) was a balanced calendar with 12 to 14 months in a year; the month after the winter solstice was ''Zhēngyuè''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmth.net/bbsanc.php?path=/groups/sci.faq/Astronomy/bw/all2/bk37k/M.1275291864.z0&amp;ap=353 |script-title=zh:中国农历发展简史 |trans-title=A brief history of the development of Chinese Lunar calendar |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lunisolar calendars===
The first lunisolar calendar was the Zhou calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=周曆|s=周历}}), introduced under the [[Zhou dynasty]]. This calendar set the beginning of the year at the day of the new moon before the winter solstice. It also set the ''shàngyuán'' as the winter solstice of a ''dīngsì'' year, making the year it was introduced around 2,758,130.{{citation needed|date=October 2018|reason=Also needs an explanation.}}

Several competing lunisolar calendars were also introduced, especially by states fighting Zhou control during the [[Warring States period]]. The state of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] issued its own Lu calendar({{zh|labels=no|t=魯曆|s=鲁历}}). [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] issued the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=夏曆|s=夏历}}) in AD 102,&lt;ref name=&quot;Petersen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Petersen |first=Jens Østergård |year=1992 |title=The Taiping Jing and the A.D. 102 Clepsydra Reform |journal=Acta Orientalia |volume=53 |pages=122–158 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12945035}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the [[March equinox]]. [[Qin (state)|Qin]] issued the [[Zhuanxu]] calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=顓頊曆|s=颛顼历}}), with a year beginning on the day of the new moon nearest the [[winter solstice]]. [[Song (state)|Song]]'s [[Shang dynasty|Yin]] calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=殷曆|s=殷历}}) began its year on the day of the new moon after the winter solstice.

These calendars are known as the six ancient calendars ({{zh|labels=no|t=古六曆|s=古六历}}), or quarter-remainder calendars, ({{zh|labels=no|t=四分曆|s=四分历|p=sìfēnlì}}), since all calculate a year as {{frac|365|1|4}} days long. Months begin on the day of the new moon, and a year has 12 or 13 months. Intercalary months (a 13th month) are added to the end of the year. The Qiang and Dai calendars are modern versions of the Zhuanxu calendar, used by mountain peoples.

====Qin and early Han dynasties====
After [[Qin Shi Huang]] unified China under the Qin dynasty in 221 BC, the Qin calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=秦曆|s=秦历}}) was introduced. It followed most of the rules governing the Zhuanxu calendar, but the month order was that of the Xia calendar; the year began with month 10 and ended with month 9, analogous to a Gregorian calendar beginning in October and ending in September. The intercalary month, known as the second ''Jiǔyuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=後九月|s=后九月|l=later ''Jiǔyuè''}}), was placed at the end of the year. The Qin calendar was used into the Han dynasty.

====Han-Ming dynasties and Taichu calendar====
[[Emperor Wu of Han]] {{reign|141|87 BC}} introduced reforms halfway through his reign. His Taichu Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=太初曆|s=太初历|l=grand beginning calendar}}) defined a solar year as {{frac|365|385|1539}} days, and the lunar month was {{frac|29|43|81}} days. This calendar introduced the 24 [[solar term]]s, dividing the year into 24 equal parts. Solar terms were paired, with the 12 combined periods known as climate terms. {{citation needed span|date=October 2018|text=The first solar term of the period was known as a pre-climate, and the second was a mid-climate. Months were named for the mid-climate to which they were closest, and a month without a mid-climate was an intercalary month.}}

The Taichu calendar established a framework for traditional calendars, with later calendars adding to the basic formula. The Dàmíng Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=大明曆|s=大明历|l=brightest calendar}}), created in the [[Liang dynasty]] by [[Zu Chongzhi]], introduced the equinoxes. The use of a [[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]] to determine the lunar month was first described in the [[Tang dynasty]] Wùyín Yuán Calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=戊寅元曆|s=戊寅元历|l=earth tiger epoch calendar}}). The [[Yuan dynasty]] Shòushí calendar ({{zh|labels=no|t=授時曆|s=授时历|l=teaching time calendar}}) used [[spherical trigonometry]] to find the length of the [[tropical year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Needham |first=Joseph |orig-year=1954 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth |journal=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 3 |volume=3 |date=1986 |pages=109–110|bibcode=1959scc3.book.....N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ho |first=Peng Yoke |date=2000 |title=Li, Qi, and Shu: An Introduction to Science and Civilization in China |location=Mineola |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=978-0-486-41445-4 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Restivo |first=Sal |date=1992 |title=Mathematics in Society and History: Sociological Inquiries |location=Dordrecht |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |isbn=978-1-4020-0039-3 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar had a 365.2425-day year, identical to the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Asiapac Editorial |date=2004 |title=Origins of Chinese Science and Technology |translator1=Yang Liping |translator2=Y.N. Han |location=Singapore |publisher=Asiapac Books |isbn=978-981-229-376-3 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern calendars ===
Although the Chinese calendar lost its place as the country's official calendar at the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sun Yat-sen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Sun Yat-sen |script-chapter=zh:临时大总统改历改元通电 |trans-chapter=Provisional President's open telegram on calendar change and era change |script-title=zh:孙中山全集 |trans-title=The Complete Works of Sun Yat-sen |volume=v. 2 |publisher={{lang|zh|中华书局}} |location=Beijing |date=1982 |orig-year=Telegram originally sent 1 January 1912 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; its use has continued. The Republic of China adopted [[UTC+08:00]] in 1928, but changed to a single [[time zone]]; some calendars followed the last calendar of the Qing dynasty, published in 1908. This caused confusion about the date of the 1978 [[Mid-Autumn Festival]], and those areas then switched to the UTC+8-based calendar.&lt;ref name=&quot;aslaksen&quot; /&gt;

==== Shíxiàn calendar ====
{{Main|Chongzhen calendar}}
During the late [[Ming dynasty]], [[Xu Guangqi]] and his colleagues worked out a new calendar based on Western astronomical arithmetic; however, the new calendar was not released before the end of the dynasty. In the early [[Qing dynasty]], [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] submitted the calendar to the [[Shunzhi Emperor]]. The Qing government issued it as the Shíxiàn (seasonal) calendar.

In this calendar, the [[solar term]]s are 15° each along the [[ecliptic]] and it can be used as a [[solar calendar]]. However, the length of the climate term near [[Apsis|perihelion]] is less than 30 days and there may be two mid-climate terms. The Shíxiàn calendar changed the mid-climate-term rule to &quot;decides the month in sequence, except the intercalary month.&quot;{{Quote without source|date=October 2018}} The present traditional calendar follows the Shíxiàn calendar, except:
# The baseline is Chinese Standard Time, rather than Beijing local time.
# Astronomical data is used, rather than mathematical calculations.

====Proposals====
To optimize the Chinese calendar, astronomers have proposed a number of changes. Gao Pingzi ({{zh|labels=no|c=高平子}}; 1888–1970), a Chinese astronomer who co-founded the [[Purple Mountain Observatory]], proposed that month numbers be calculated before the new moon and solar terms be rounded to the day. Since the intercalary month is determined by the first month without a mid-climate and the mid-climate time varies by time zone, countries which adopted the calendar but calculate with their own time could vary from the time in China.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Outlying areas ===
Calendars of ethnic groups in the mountains and plateaus of southwestern China and the grasslands of northern China are based on their [[phenology]] and algorithms of traditional calendars of different periods, particularly the Tang and pre-Qin dynasties.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

== Structure ==
=== Elements ===
Elements of the traditional Chinese calendar are:
* ''Day'', from one midnight to the next
* ''Month'', the time from one [[new moon]] to the next. These [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic months]] are about {{frac|29|17|32}} days long. 
* ''Date'', when a day occurs in the month. Days are numbered in sequence from 1 to 29 (or 30).
* ''Year'', the time of one revolution of the earth around the sun. It is measured from the first day of spring (lunisolar year) or the winter solstice (solar year). A year is about {{frac|365|31|128}} days.
* ''[[Chinese zodiac|Zodiac]]'', {{frac|12}} year, or 30° on the [[ecliptic]]. A zodiac is about {{frac|30|7|16}} days.
*''[[Solar term]]'', {{frac|24}} year, or 15° on the ecliptic. A solar term is about {{frac|15|7|32}} days. 
* ''Calendar month'', when a month occurs within a year. Some months may be repeated.
* ''Calendar year'', when it is agreed that one year ends and another begins. The year begins on the first day of spring, defined as the second (sometimes third) new moon after the winter solstice. A calendar year is 353–355 or 383–385 days long.

The Chinese calendar is [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]], similar to the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]] calendars.

=== Features ===
The movements of the sun, moon, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] (known as the seven luminaries) are the references for calendar calculations. 
* The distance between Mercury and the sun is less than 30° (the sun's height at ''chénshí'':{{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|辰時}}}}, 8:00 to 10:00&amp;nbsp;am), so Mercury was sometimes called the &quot;chen star&quot; ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|辰|星}}|s=|t=}}); it is more commonly known as the &quot;water star&quot; ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|水星}}}}).
* Venus appears at dawn and dusk, and is known as the &quot;bright star&quot; ({{Zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|启明|星}}|t={{linktext|啟明|星}}}}) or &quot;long star&quot; ({{Zh|labels=no|c=|s={{linktext|长庚|星}}|t={{linktext|長庚|星}}}}).
* Mars looks like fire and occurs irregularly, and is known as the &quot;fire star&quot; ({{Zh|labels=no|c=|s={{linktext|荧惑|星}}|t={{linktext|熒惑|星}}}} or {{Zh|labels=no|c=|s={{linktext|火星}}}}). Mars is the punisher in Chinese mythology. When Mars is near [[Antares]] ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|心宿二}}}}), it is a bad omen and can forecast the death of an emperor or removal of a chancellor ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|荧惑|守|心}}|s=|t=}}).
* The period of Jupiter's revolution is 11.86 years, so Jupiter is called the &quot;age star&quot; ({{Zh|labels=no|c=|s={{linktext|岁星}}|t={{linktext|歲星}}}}); 30° of Jupiter's revolution is about a year on earth.
* The period of Saturn's revolution is about 28 years. Saturn, known as the &quot;guard star&quot; ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|鎮星}}|s=|t=}}), guards one of the 28 mansions every year.

The [[Big Dipper]] is the celestial compass, and its handle's direction determines the season and month.
The stars are divided into [[Chinese constellations#Three Enclosures|Three Enclosures]] and [[Twenty-Eight Mansions|28 Mansions]] according to their location in the sky relative to [[Ursa Minor]], at the centre. Each mansion is named with a character describing the shape of its principal [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]]. The Three Enclosures are [[Purple Forbidden enclosure|Purple Forbidden]], ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|紫微}}|s=|t=}}), [[Supreme Palace enclosure|Supreme Palace]] ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|太微}}|s=|t=}}), and [[Heavenly Market enclosure|Heavenly Market]]. ({{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|天市}}|s=|t=}}) The eastern mansions are {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|角}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|亢}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|氐}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|房}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|心}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|尾}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|箕}}}}. Southern mansions are {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|井}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|鬼}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|柳}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|星}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|张}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|翼}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|轸}}}}. Western mansions are {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|奎}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|娄}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|胃}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|昴}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|毕}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|参}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|觜}}}}. Northern mansions are {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|斗}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|牛}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|女}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|虚}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|危}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|室}}}}, {{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|壁}}}}.
The moon moves through about one [[lunar mansion]] per day, so the 28 mansions were also used to count days. In the [[Tang dynasty]], [[Yuan Tiangang]] ({{Zh|labels=no|c=袁天罡}}) matched the 28 mansions, seven luminaries and yearly animal signs to yield combinations such as &quot;horn-wood-flood dragon&quot; ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|角|木|蛟}}}}).

=== Codes ===
Several coding systems are used to avoid ambiguity. The [[Heavenly Stems]] is a [[decimal]] system. The [[Earthly Branches]], a [[duodecimal]] system, mark dual hours (''shí'', {{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|時}}|s={{linktext|时}}}} or ''shíchen'' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|時辰}}|s={{linktext|时辰}}}})) and climatic terms. The 12 characters progress from the first day with the same branch as the month (first ''Yín'' day ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|寅|日}}}}) of ''Zhēngyuè''; first ''Mǎo'' day ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|卯|日}}}}) of ''Èryuè''), and count the days of the month.

The [[Sexagenary cycle|stem-branches]] is a [[sexagesimal]] system. The Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches make up [[Sexagenary cycle|60 stem-branches]]. The stem-branches mark days and years. The five elements of the [[Wu Xing]] are assigned to each of the stems, branches and stem-branches.

===Day===
[[File:Chinese time.png|thumb|alt=See caption|Explanatory chart for traditional Chinese time]]
{{main|Traditional Chinese timekeeping}}
China has used the Western hour-minute-second system to divide the day since the [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;units of time&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sôma|first=Mitsuru|last2=Kawabata|first2=Kin-aki|last3=Tanikawa|first3=Kiyotaka|date=25 October 2004|title=Units of Time in Ancient China and Japan|url=http://pasj.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/5/887|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan|volume=56|issue=5|pages=887–904|doi=10.1093/pasj/56.5.887|issn=0004-6264|bibcode=2004PASJ...56..887S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several era-dependent systems had been in use; systems using multiples of twelve and ten were popular, since they could be easily counted and aligned with the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches.

===Week===
{{For|more information on the adoption of the seven-day week|Names of the days of the week#East Asian tradition}}
{{For|more information on the ten-day week|Decan}}

As early as the Bronze-Age [[Xia dynasty]], days were grouped into nine- or ten-day weeks known as ''xún'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|旬}}}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = {{zh|labels=no|c=海上}} | script-title = zh:中國人的歲時文化 |trans-title=Timekeeping of the Chinese culture | publisher = {{zh|labels=no|c=岳麓書社}} | year = 2005 | pages = 195 | isbn = 978-7-80665-620-4 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months consisted of three ''xún''. The first 10 days were the ''early xún'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|上旬}}}}), the middle 10 the ''mid xún'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|中旬}}}}), and the last nine (or 10) days were the ''late xún'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|下旬}}}}). Japan [[Japanese calendar#Subdivisions of the month|adopted this pattern]], with 10-day-weeks known as {{nihongo|''jun''|旬}}. In Korea, they were known as ''sun'' ({{lang-ko|label=none|순}},{{lang-ko|label=none|旬}}).

The structure of ''xún'' led to public holidays every five or ten days. During the [[Han dynasty]], officials were legally required to rest every five days (twice a ''xún'', or 5–6 times a month). The name of these breaks became ''huan'' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|澣}} |s={{linktext|浣}}}}, &quot;wash&quot;).

The seven-day week was adopted from the Hellenistic system by the 4th century CE, although its source is unclear. It was again transmitted to China in the 8th century by [[Manichaeism|Manichaeans]] via [[Kangju]] (a Central Asian kingdom near [[Samarkand]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjvlang.com/Dow/dowjpn.html |website=CJVLang |title=Days of the week in Japanese |access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The 4th-century date, according to the ''[[Cihai]]'' encyclopedia,{{year needed|date=April 2015}} is due to a reference to Fan Ning ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|範寧}}|s={{linktext|范宁}}}}), an astrologer of the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]].{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}}}{{efn|The renewed adoption from Manichaeans in the 8th century ([[Tang dynasty]]) is documented with the writings of the Chinese Buddhist monk [[Yijing (monk)|Yi Jing]] and the Ceylonese Buddhist monk [[Amoghavajra|Bu Kong]].{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}}} and is the most-used system in modern China.

===Month===
Months are defined by the time between [[new moon]]s, which averages approximately {{frac|29|17|32}} days. There is no specified length of any particular Chinese month, so the first month could have 29 days (short month, {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|小月}}}}) in some years and 30 days (long month, {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|大月}}}}) in other years.

A 12-month-year using this system has 354 days, which would drift significantly from the [[tropical year]]. To fix this, traditional Chinese years have a 13-month year approximately once every three years. The 13-month version has the same alternation of long and short months, but adds a 30-day leap month ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|閏月}}|p=rùnyuè}}) at the end of the year. Years with 12 months are called common years, and 13-month years are known as long years.

Although most of the above rules were used until the [[Tang dynasty]], different eras used different systems to keep lunar and solar years aligned. The [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]] of the Taichu calendar was {{frac|29|43|81}} days long. The 7th-century, Tang-dynasty Wùyín Yuán Calendar was the first to determine month length by synodic month instead of the cycling method. Since then, month lengths have primarily been determined by observation and prediction.

The days of the month are always written with two characters and numbered beginning with 1. Days one to 10 are written with the day's [[Chinese numerals|numeral]], preceded by the character ''Chū'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|初}}}}); ''Chūyī'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|初一}}}}) is the first day of the month, and ''Chūshí'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=初{{linktext|十}}}}) the 10th. Days 11 to 20 are written as regular Chinese numerals; ''Shíwǔ'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|十五}}}}) is the 15th day of the month, and ''Èrshí'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|二十}}}}) the 20th. Days 21 to 29 are written with the character ''Niàn'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|廿}}}}) before the characters one through nine; ''Niànsān'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|廿三}}}}), for example, is the 23rd day of the month. Day 30 (as applicable) is written as the numeral ''Sānshí'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|三十}}}}).

History books use days of the month numbered with the 60 stem-branches: {{Quote| text={{zh|labels=no|c=天聖元年....{{linktext|二月}}....{{linktext|丁|巳}}, 奉安太祖、太宗御容于南京鴻慶宮}}. &lt;br /&gt;[[Tiansheng Era (Song)|''Tiānshèng'']] 1st year....''Èryuè''....''Dīngsì'', the emperor's funeral was at his temple, and the imperial portrait was installed in Nanjing's ''Hongqing Palace''. |title=[[History of Song Dynasty]]|sign=|source=[https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/宋史/卷009 Part 9, Volume 9: Renzong part 1] {{in lang|zh}}}}

Because astronomical observation determines month length, dates on the calendar correspond to moon phases. The first day of each month is the new moon. On the seventh or eighth day of each month, the first-quarter moon is visible in the afternoon and early evening. In the 15th or 16th day of each month, the full moon is visible all night. On the 22nd or 23rd day of each month, the last-quarter moon is visible late at night and in the morning.

Since the beginning of the month is determined by the new moon occurs, other countries using this calendar use their own time standards to calculate it; this results in deviations. The first new moon in 1968 was at 16:29 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on 29 January. Since [[North Vietnam]] used [[UTC+07:00]] to calculate their [[Vietnamese calendar]] and [[South Vietnam]] used [[UTC+08:00]] (Beijing time) to calculate theirs, North Vietnam began the [[Tết]] holiday at 29 January at 23:29 and South Vietnam began it on 30 January at 00:15. The time difference allowed asynchronous attacks in the [[Tet Offensive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aslaksen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/cal.pdf |title=Mathematics of the Chinese calendar |last=Aslaksen |first=Helmer |date=17 July 2010 |format=PDF  |website=math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen|publisher=Department of Maths, National University of Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Names of months ====
Lunar months were originally named according to natural phenomena. Current naming conventions use numbers as the month names. Every month is also associated with one of the twelve [[Earthly Branches]].

====Chinese lunar date conventions====

Though the numbered month names are often used for the corresponding month number in the Gregorian calendar, it is important to realize that the numbered month names are not interchangeable with the Gregorian months when talking about lunar dates.

*''Incorrect'': The [[Dragon Boat Festival]] falls on 5 May in the [[Lunar Calendar]], whereas the [[Double Ninth Festival]], [[Lantern Festival]], and [[Qixi Festival]] fall on 9 September 15 January, and 7 July in the [[Lunar Calendar]], respectively.
*''Correct'': The [[Dragon Boat Festival]] falls on ''Wǔyuè'' 5th (or, 5th day of the fifth month) in the [[Lunar Calendar]], whereas the [[Double Ninth Festival]], [[Lantern Festival]], and [[Qixi Festival]] fall on ''Jiǔyuè'' 9th (or, 9th day of the ninth month), ''Zhēngyuè'' 15th (or, 15th day of the first month), and ''Qīyuè'' 7th (or, 7th day of the seventh month) in the [[Lunar Calendar]], respectively.
*''Alternate [[Chinese Zodiac]] correction'': The [[Dragon Boat Festival]] falls on Horse Month 5th on [[Lunar Calendar]], whereas the [[Double Ninth Festival]], [[Lantern Festival]], and [[Qixi Festival]] fall on Dog Month 9th, Tiger Month 15th, and Monkey Month 7th on [[Lunar Calendar]], respectively.

One may even find out the [[heavenly stem]] and [[earthly branch]] corresponding to a particular day in the month, and those corresponding to its month, and those to its year, to determine the [[Four Pillars of Destiny]] associated with it, for which the [[Tung Shing]], also referred to as the [[Chinese Almanac]] of the year, or the [[Huangli]], and containing the essential information concerning [[Chinese astrology]], is the most convenient publication to consult. Days rotate through a [[sexagenary cycle]] marked by a coordination between [[heavenly stem]]s and [[earthly branch]]s, hence the referral to the [[Four Pillars of Destiny]] as, &quot;[[Bazi]]&quot;, or &quot;[[Birth Time Eight Characters]]&quot;, with each pillar consisting of a character for its corresponding heavenly stem, and another for its earthly branch. Since [[Huangli]] days are [[sexagenary cycle|sexagenaric]], their order is quite independent from their numeric order in each month, and from their numeric order within a week (referred to as [[True Animals]] with relation to the [[Chinese zodiac]]). Therefore, it does require painstaking calculation for one to arrive at the [[Four Pillars of Destiny]] of a particular given date, which rarely outpace the convenience of simply consulting the [[Huangli]] by looking up its [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] date.

===Solar term===
{{See also|Solar term}}
The [[tropical year|solar year]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=岁|t=歲|p=Suì}}), the time between [[winter solstice]]s, is divided into 24 [[solar term]]s known as jié qì. Each term is a 15° portion of the ecliptic. These solar terms mark both Western and Chinese seasons as well as equinoxes, solstices, and other Chinese events. The even solar terms (marked with &quot;Z&quot;) are considered the major terms, while the odd solar terms (marked with &quot;J&quot;) are deemed minor.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/cal2.pdf|title=When is Chinese New Year?|last=Aslaksen|first=Helmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solar terms qīng míng (清明) on 5 April and dōng zhì (冬至) on 22 December are both celebrated events in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

=== Solar year ===
The calendar solar year, known as the ''suì'', ({{zh|labels=no|t=歲|s=岁}}) begins at the December solstice and proceeds through the 24 solar terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Due to the fact that the speed of the Sun's apparent motion in the elliptical is variable, the time between major solar terms is not fixed. This variation in time between major solar terms results in different solar year lengths. There are generally 11 or 12 complete months, plus two incomplete months around the winter solstice, in a solar year. The complete months are numbered from 0 to 10, and the incomplete months are considered the 11th month. If there are 12 complete months in the solar year, it is known as a leap solar year, or leap ''suì''&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;''.''

Due to the inconsistencies in the length of the solar year, different versions of the traditional calendar might have different average solar year lengths. For example, one solar year of the 1st century BC Tàichū calendar is {{frac|365|385|1539}} (365.25016) days. A solar year of the 13th-century Shòushí calendar is {{frac|365|97|400}} (365.2425) days, identical to the Gregorian calendar. The additional .00766 day from the Tàichū calendar leads to a one-day shift every 130.5 years.

Pairs of solar terms are climate terms, or solar months. The first solar term is &quot;pre-climate&quot; ({{zh|labels=no|s=节气|t=節氣|p=Jiéqì}}), and the second is &quot;mid-climate&quot; ({{zh|labels=no|s=中气|t=中氣|p=Zhōngqì}}).

The first month without a mid-climate is the [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|leap]], or intercalary, month. In other words, the first month that doesn't include a major solar term is the leap month.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Leap months are numbered with ''rùn'' {{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|閏}}}}, the character for &quot;intercalary&quot;, plus the name of the month they follow. In 2017, the intercalary month after month six was called ''Rùn Liùyuè'', or &quot;intercalary sixth month&quot; ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|閏|六月}}}}) and written as ''6i'' or ''6+''. The next intercalary month (in 2020, after month four) will be called ''Rùn Sìyuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|閏|四月}}}}) and written ''4i'' or ''4+''.

===Lunisolar year===
The lunisolar year begins with the first spring month, ''Zhēngyuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|正月}}|l=capital month}}), and ends with the last winter month, ''Làyuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|s={{linktext|腊月}}|t={{linktext|臘月}}|l=sacrificial month}}). All other months are named for their number in the month order. If a leap month falls after month 11—as it will in 2033—the 11th month will be ''Shíèryuè'' ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|十二月}}|l=twelfth month}}), and the leap month will be ''Làyuè''.

Years were traditionally numbered by the reign in ancient China, but this was abolished after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. For example, the year from 8 February 2016 to 27 January 2017 was a ''Bǐngshēn'' year ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|丙申|年}}}}) of {{Chinese Year|l}}.

During the [[Tang dynasty]], the Earthly Branches were used to mark the months from December 761 to May 762.&lt;ref name=&quot;new book of tang&quot;&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=[[New Book of Tang]] |script-title=zh:新唐書 |trans-chapter=Volume 6 Annals 6: Suzong, Daizong |script-chapter=zh:新唐書卷六 本紀第六 肅宗 代宗 |url=https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%94%90%E6%9B%B8/%E5%8D%B7006|quote={{zh|labels=no|c=上元…。二年……，九月壬寅，大赦，去「乾元大圣光天文武孝感」号，去「上元」号，称元年，以十一月为岁首，月以斗所建辰为名。…。&lt;br /&gt;元年建子月癸巳[2]，…。己亥[9]，…。丙午[16]，…。己酉[29]，…。庚戌[30]，…。[初一壬午大雪，十七冬至]&lt;br/&gt;建丑月辛亥[1]，…。己未[9]，…。乙亥[25]，…。[初一辛亥，初三小寒，十八大寒]&lt;br/&gt;宝应元年建寅月甲申[4]，…。乙酉[5]，…。丙戌[3]，…。甲辰[24]，…。戊申[28]，…。[初一辛巳，初三立春，十八雨水]&lt;br/&gt;建卯月辛亥[1]，…。壬子[2]，…。癸丑[3]，…。乙丑[15]，…。戊辰[18]，…。庚午[20]，…。壬申[22]，…。[初一辛亥，初四惊蛰，十九春分]&lt;br/&gt;建辰月壬午[3]，…。甲午[5]，…。戊申[19]，…。[初一庚辰，初五清明，二十谷雨]&lt;br/&gt;建巳月庚戌[1]，…。壬子[3]，…。甲寅[5]，…。乙丑[16]，…。大赦，改元年为宝应元年，复以正月为岁首，建巳月为四月。丙寅，…。[初一庚戌，初五甲寅立夏]。}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over this period, the year began with the winter solstice.

==== Age reckoning ====
{{Main|East Asian age reckoning}}
In China, a person's official age is based on the Gregorian calendar; for traditional use, age is based on the Chinese ''sui'' calendar. At birth, a child is considered the first year of lifetime using [[ordinal number]] (instead of &quot;zero&quot; using [[cardinal number]]); after each Chinese New Year, one year is added to their traditional age. Because of the potential for confusion, infant ages are often given in months instead of years.

After the Gregorian calendar's introduction in China, the Chinese traditional age was referred to as the &quot;nominal age&quot; ({{zh|labels=no |t=虛歲 |s=虚岁|p=xūsuì|l=incomplete age}}) and the Gregorian age was known as the &quot;real age&quot; ({{zh|labels=no |t=實歲 |s=实岁 |p=shísùi |l=whole age}}).

==== Year-numbering systems ====
=====Eras=====
{{Main|Chinese era name}}
In ancient China, years were numbered from a new emperor's assumption of the throne or an existing emperor's announcement of a new era name. The first recorded reign title was ''Jiànyuán'' ({{zh|labels=no |c = 建元 |l = founding era}}), from 140 BC; the last reign title was ''Xuāntǒng'' ({{zh|labels=no |s = 宣统 |t = 宣統 | l = announcing unification}}), from AD 1908. The era system was abolished in 1912, after which the current or [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republican era]] was used.

=====Stem-branches=====
The 60 stem-branches have been used to mark the date since the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC). Astrologers knew that the orbital period of [[Jupiter]] is about 4,332 days. Since 4332 is 12 × 361, Jupiter's orbital period was divided into 12 years ({{zh|labels=no|s=岁|t=歲|p=suì}}) of 361 days each. The stem-branches system solved the era system's problem of unequal reign lengths.

=====Continuous numbering=====
Nomenclature similar to that of the Christian era has occasionally been used:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=辽宁大学学报：哲社版 Journal of Liaoning University: Philosophy and Social Science Edition|year=2004 |issue=6|pages=43–50 |title=[Subsidiary Relations in the Pre-Qin Period] |author=Liu Rong}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Huángdì year ({{zh|labels=no|t=黄帝紀年}}), starting at the beginning of the reign of the [[Yellow Emperor]] with year 1 at 2697 (or 2698) BC
* Yáo year ({{zh|labels=no|t=唐堯紀年}}), starting at the beginning of the reign of [[Emperor Yao]] (year 1 at 2156 BC)
* Gònghé year ({{zh|labels=no|t=共和紀年}}), starting at the beginning of the [[Gonghe Regency]] (year 1 at 841 BC)
* Confucius year ({{zh|labels=no|t=孔子紀年}}), starting at the birth year of [[Confucius]] (year 1 at 551 BC)
* Unity year ({{zh|labels=no|t=統一紀年}}), starting at the beginning of the reign of [[Qin Shi Huang]] (year 1 at 221 BC)
No reference date is universally accepted. The most popular is the Gregorian calendar ({{zh|labels=no|p=gōnglì|t={{linktext|公曆}}|s={{linktext|公历}}|l=common calendar}}).

On 2 January 1912, [[Sun Yat-sen]] announced changes to the official calendar and era. 1 January was 14 Shíyīyuè 4609 Huángdì year, assuming a year 1 of 2698 BC. The change was adopted by many [[overseas Chinese]] communities, such as [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aslaksen&quot; /&gt;

During the 17th century, the [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuits]] tried to determine the [[Epoch (reference date)|epochal year]] of the Han calendar. In his ''Sinicae historiae decas prima'' (published in [[Munich]] in 1658), [[Martino Martini]] (1614–1661) dated the ascension of the [[Yellow Emperor]] to 2697 BC and began the Chinese calendar with the reign of [[Fuxi]] (which, according to Martini, began in 2952 BC. [[Philippe Couplet]]'s 1686 ''Chronological table of Chinese monarchs'' (''Tabula chronologica monarchiae sinicae'') gave the same date for the Yellow Emperor. The Jesuits' dates provoked interest in Europe, where they were used for comparison with Biblical chronology.{{citation needed |date=October 2018}} Modern Chinese chronology has generally accepted Martini's dates, except that it usually places the reign of the Yellow Emperor at 2698 BC and omits his predecessors Fuxi and [[Shennong]] as &quot;too legendary to include&quot;.{{Quote without source|date=October 2018}}

Publications began using the estimated birth date of the [[Yellow Emperor]] as the first year of the Han calendar in 1903, with newspapers and magazines proposing different dates. The province of [[Jiangsu]] counted 1905 as the year 4396 (using a year 0 of 2491 BC), and the newspaper ''[[Ming Pao]]'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=明報|s=明报}}) reckoned 1905 as 4603 (using a year 0 of 2698 BC).{{citation needed |date=October 2018}} [[Liu Shipei]] ({{lang|zh|劉師培}}, 1884–1919) created the Yellow Emperor Calendar, with year 0 as the birth of the emperor (which he determined as 2711 BC). There is no evidence that this calendar was used before the 20th century.{{sfnb|Cohen|2012| p = 1, 4}} Liu calculated that the 1900 international expedition sent by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] to suppress the [[Boxer Rebellion]] entered Beijing in the 4611th year of the Yellow Emperor.

=== Chinese New Year ===
{{Main|Chinese New Year}}
The date of the Chinese New Year accords with the patterns of the solar calendar and hence is variable from year to year. However, there are two general rules that govern the date. Firstly, Chinese New Year transpires on the second new moon following the December solstice. If there is a leap month after the eleventh or twelfth month, then Chinese New Year falls on the third new moon after the December solstice. Alternatively, Chinese New Year will fall on the new moon that is closest to ''lì chūn'', or the solar term that begins spring (typically falls on 4 February). However, this rule is not as reliable since it can be difficult to determine which new moon is the closest in the case of an early or late Chinese New Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

It has been found that Chinese New Year moves back by either 10, 11, or 12 days in some years. If it falls before 21 January, then it moves forward in the next year by either 18, 19, or 20 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

===Phenology===
The [[East Asian rainy season|plum-rains season]] ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|梅雨}}}}), the rainy season in late spring and early summer, begins on the first ''bǐng'' day after ''[[Mangzhong]]'' ({{zh|labels=no|芒种}}) and ends on the first ''wèi'' day after [[Xiaoshu]] ({{zh|labels=no|小暑}}). The [[dog days|Three Fu]] ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|三伏}}|p=sānfú}}) are three periods of hot weather, counted from the first ''gēng'' day after the summer solstice. The first ''fu'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=初伏|p=chūfú}}) is 10 days long. The mid-''fu'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=中伏|p=zhōngfú}}) is 10 or 20 days long. The last ''fu'' ({{zh|labels=no|c=末伏|p=mòfú}}) is 10 days from the first ''gēng'' day after the beginning of autumn.&lt;ref name=&quot;3 fu&quot; /&gt; The Shujiu cold days ({{zh|labels=no|p=shǔjǐu|c=數九|l=counting to nine}}) are the 81 days after the winter solstice (divided into nine sets of nine days), and are considered the coldest days of the year. Each nine-day unit is known by its order in the set, followed by &quot;nine&quot; ({{zh|labels=no|c=九}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;81 days&quot; /&gt;

===Celebrations in Japan===
Many of the above holidays were celebrated in pre-Meiji Japan based on the lunar calendar but are now celebrated based on the Gregorian calendar.

===Double Celebrations Due to Intercalary Months===
In the case where there is a corresponding intercalary month, the holidays may be celebrated twice.  For example, in the hypothetical situation where there is an additional intercalary seventh month, the Zhong Yuan Festival will be celebrated on the seventh month followed by another celebration on the intercalary seventh month.
