A '''campus''' is traditionally the land on which a [[college]] or [[university]] and related institutional buildings are situated. Usually a college campus includes [[library|libraries]], [[lecture]] halls, [[residence hall]]s, student centers or dining halls, and park-like settings.

A modern campus is a collection of buildings and grounds that belong to a given institution, either academic or non-academic. Examples include the [[Googleplex]] and the [[Apple Campus]].

==Etymology==
The word derives from a [[Latin]] word for &quot;field&quot; and was first used to describe the large field adjacent [[Nassau Hall]] of the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]) in 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=campus |first=Douglas |last=Harper |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=20 December 2013 |title=Campus (n.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field separated Princeton from the small nearby town.

Some other American colleges later adopted the word to describe individual fields at their own institutions, but &quot;campus&quot; did not yet describe the whole university property. A school might have one space called a campus, another called a field, and still another called a yard.

==History==
The tradition of a campus began with the medieval [[Europe]]an universities where the students and teachers lived and worked together in a [[cloister]]ed environment.&lt;ref name=chap&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOZIHCV04SoC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=American Places: In Search of the Twenty-first Century Campus |last=Chapman |first=M. Perry |page=7 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the importance of the setting to academic life later migrated to America, and early colonial educational institutions were based on the Scottish and English collegiate system.&lt;ref name=chap/&gt;

The campus evolved from the cloistered model in Europe to a diverse set of independent styles in the United States. Early colonial colleges were all built in proprietary styles, with some contained in single buildings, such as the campus of [[Princeton University]] or arranged in a version of the cloister reflecting American values, such as Harvard's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Paul Venable|title=Campus: An American Planning Tradition |year=1984|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the campus designs and the architecture of colleges throughout the country have evolved in response to trends in the broader world, with most representing several different contemporary and historical styles and arrangements.

==Uses==
The meaning expanded to include the whole institutional [[real property|property]] during the 20th century, with the old meaning persisting into the 1950s in some places.

===Office buildings===
Sometimes the lands on which company office buildings sit, along with the buildings, are called campuses. The [[Microsoft Campus]] in [[Redmond, Washington]], is a good example of this usage. Hospitals and even airports sometimes use the term to describe the territory of their respective facilities.

===Universities===
The word ''campus'' has also been applied to European universities, although most such institutions are characterized by ownership of individual buildings in urban settings rather than park-like lawns in which buildings are placed.
