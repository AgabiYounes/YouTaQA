'''Corporatocracy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɔr|p|ə|r|ə|ˈ|t|ɒ|k|r|ə|s|i}}, from [[corporate]] and {{lang-el|-κρατία|translit=-kratía|lit=domination by}}; short form '''corpocracy'''&lt;ref&gt;https://wordspy.com/index.php?word=corpocracy    corpocracy   n.

==Use of &quot;corporatocracy&quot; and similar ideas==

Historian [[Howard Zinn]] argues that during the [[Gilded Age]] in the United States, the U.S. government was acting exactly as [[Karl Marx]] described capitalist states: &quot;pretending neutrality to maintain order, but serving the interests of the rich&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zinn |first=Howard |author-link=Howard Zinn |title=A People's History of the United States |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-06-083865-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/peopleshistoryof00zinn_0/page/258 258] |title-link=A People's History of the United States }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]], there has been a severe increase in [[market power]] of corporations, largely due to U.S. [[antitrust]] laws being weakened by [[neoliberal]] reforms, leading to growing income inequality and a generally underperforming economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Stiglitz|first=Joseph|date=May 13, 2019 |title=Three decades of neoliberal policies have decimated the middle class, our economy, and our democracy|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/three-decades-of-neoliberal-policies-have-decimated-the-middle-class-our-economy-and-our-democracy-2019-05-13|work=[[MarketWatch]]|location= |access-date= August 22, 2019|authorlink=Joseph Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that to improve the economy, it is necessary to decrease the influence of money on U.S. politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph|date=October 23, 2017 |title=America Has a Monopoly Problem—and It’s Huge|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/america-has-a-monopoly-problem-and-its-huge/|work=[[The Nation]] |location= |access-date= August 22, 2019|authorlink=Joseph Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1956 book ''[[The power elite]]'', sociologist [[C Wright Mills]] states that together with the military and political establishment, leaders of the biggest corporations form a &quot;power [[elite]]&quot; that is in control of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Doob| first = Christopher| title = Social Inequality and Social Stratification | publisher = Pearson | edition = 1st| year = 2013| location = Boston| pages = 143| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] described the United States as a corporatocracy in ''[[The Price of Civilization]]'' (2011).&lt;ref name=&quot;sachs price of civilization&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Price of Civilization''|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4000-6841-8|location=New York|pages=105, 106, 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that it arose from four trends: weak [[Political parties in the United States|national parties]] and strong political representation of individual districts, the large U.S. military establishment after [[World War II]], large corporations [[corporate political donations|using money to finance election campaigns]], and [[globalization]] tilting the balance of power away from workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;sachs price of civilization&quot; /&gt;
 
In 2013, economist [[Edmund Phelps]] criticised the economic system of the U.S. and other western countries in recent decades as being what he calls &quot;the new [[corporatism]]&quot;, which he characterises as a system in which the state is far too involved in the economy, tasked with &quot;protecting everyone against everyone else&quot;, but in which at the same time big companies have a great deal of influence on the government, with lobbyists' suggestions being &quot;welcome, especially if they come with bribes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phelps2013&quot;&gt;[[Edmund Phelps|Phelps, Edmund]] (2013).

==Corporate influence on politics in the United States==

===Corruption===

During the [[Gilded Age]] in the United States, corruption was rampant as business leaders spent significant amounts of money ensuring that government did not regulate their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tindall |first1=George Brown |last2=Shi |first2=David E. |year=2012 |title=America: A Narrative History (Brief Ninth Edition) |volume=2 |publisher=W. W. Norton |page=578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate influence on legislation===
{{main|Regulatory capture}}
Corporations have significant influence on the regulations and regulators that monitor them. For example, Senator [[Elizabeth Warren]] explained in December 2014 how an omnibus spending bill required to fund the government was modified late in the process to weaken banking regulations. The modification made it easier to allow taxpayer-funded bailouts of banking &quot;swaps entities&quot;, which the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank]] banking regulations prohibited. She singled out [[Citigroup]], one of the largest banks, which had a role in modifying the legislation. She also explained how both Wall Street bankers and members of the government that formerly had worked on Wall Street stopped bi-partisan legislation that would have broken up the largest banks. She repeated President Theodore Roosevelt's warnings regarding powerful corporate entities that threatened the &quot;very foundations of Democracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJpTxONxvoo|title=Remarks by Senator Warren on Citigroup and its bailout provision|date=12 December 2014|work=YouTube|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceived symptoms of corporatocracy in the United States==

===Share of income===
[[File:U.S. Compensation as Percent of GDP - v1.png|right|thumb|400px|Labor's share of GDP has declined 1970 to 2013, measured based on total compensation as well as salaries and wages. This implies capital's share is increasing.]]

With regard to income inequality, the 2014 income analysis of [[University of California, Berkeley]] economist [[Emmanuel Saez]] confirms that relative growth of income and wealth is not occurring among small and mid-sized entrepreneurs and business owners (who generally populate the lower half of top one per-centers in income),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://thecfoalliance.org/documents/CFO_Alliance_Executive_Compensation_Survey_Presentation_Final_1_10_2013.pdf |title=The CFO Alliance Executive Compensation Survey 2013 |access-date=2014-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013144010/https://thecfoalliance.org/documents/CFO_Alliance_Executive_Compensation_Survey_Presentation_Final_1_10_2013.pdf |archive-date=2014-10-13 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead only among the top .1 percent of income distribution, whom economics Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman describes as &quot;super-elites – corporate bigwigs and financial wheeler-dealers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/25/opinion/we-are-the-99-9.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;ref=opinion&amp;adxnnlx=1413381816-Gy6K3nXHunUOH3N8AnSa7Q We Are The 99.9%, Paul Krugman, New York Times, November 24, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/how-you-i-and-everyone-got-the-top-1-percent-all-wrong/359862/|title=How You, I, and Everyone Got the Top 1 Percent All Wrong|author=Derek Thompson|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who earn $2,000,000 or more every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabriel-zucman.eu&quot;&gt;[http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/SaezZucman2014Slides.pdf The Distribution of US Wealth, Capital Income and Returns since 1913, Emmanuel Saez, Gabriel Zucman], March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/phildemuth/2013/11/25/are-you-rich-enough-the-terrible-tragedy-of-income-inequality-among-the-1/|title=Are You Rich Enough? The Terrible Tragedy Of Income Inequality Among The 1%|author=Phil DeMuth|work=Forbes|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate power can also increase income inequality. Nobel Prize winner of economics [[Joseph Stiglitz]] wrote in May 2011: &quot;Much of today’s inequality is due to manipulation of the financial system, enabled by changes in the rules that have been bought and paid for by the financial industry itself—one of its best investments ever. The government lent money to financial institutions at close to zero percent interest and provided generous bailouts on favorable terms when all else failed. Regulators turned a blind eye to a lack of transparency and to conflicts of interest.&quot; Stiglitz explained that the top 1% got nearly &quot;one-quarter&quot; of the income and own approximately 40% of the wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105|title=Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%|author=Joseph E. Stiglitz|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measured relative to GDP, total compensation and its component wages and salaries have been declining since 1970. This indicates a shift in income from labor (persons who derive income from hourly wages and salaries) to capital (persons who derive income via ownership of businesses, land and assets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/monetary-policy-and-long-term-trends|title=Monetary policy and long-term trends|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some five percent of U.S. GDP was approximately $850 billion in 2013. This represents an additional $7,000 in compensation for each of the 120 million U.S. households. [[Larry Summers]] estimated in 2007 that the lower 80% of families were receiving $664 billion less income than they would be with a 1979 income distribution (a period of much greater equality), or approximately $7,000 per family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larrysummers.com/commentary/financial-times-columns/harness-market-forces-to-share-prosperity-june-24-2007/|title=Harness market forces to share prosperity |author=Larry Summers|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not receiving this income may have led many families to increase their debt burden, a significant factor in the 2007–2009 [[subprime mortgage crisis]], as highly leveraged homeowners suffered a much larger reduction in their net worth during the crisis. Further, since lower income families tend to spend relatively more of their income than higher income families, shifting more of the income to wealthier families may slow economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mian and Sufi2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Effective corporate tax rates===
[[File:U.S. Federal Corporate Income Tax Receipts and Pre-Tax Profits.png|thumb|right|400px|U.S. corporate effective tax rates have fallen significantly since the year 2000.]]

Some large U.S. corporations have used a strategy called [[tax inversion]] to change their headquarters to a non-U.S. country to reduce their tax liability. About 46 companies have reincorporated in low-tax countries since 1982, including 15 since 2012. Six more also planned to do so in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/tax-inversion|title=Tax Inversion|work=BloombergView.com|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock buybacks versus wage increases===
One indication of increasing corporate power was the removal of restrictions on their ability to buy back stock, contributing to increased income inequality. Writing in the ''Harvard Business Review'' in September 2014, William Lazonick blamed record corporate [[share repurchase|stock buybacks]] for reduced investment in the economy and a corresponding impact on prosperity and income inequality.  Between 2003 and 2012, the 449 companies in the S&amp;P 500 used 54% of their earnings ($2.4 trillion) to buy back their own stock.  An additional 37% was paid to stockholders as dividends. Together, these were 91% of profits. This left little for investment in productive capabilities or higher income for employees, shifting more income to capital rather than labor.  He blamed executive compensation arrangements, which are heavily based on stock options, stock awards and bonuses for meeting earnings per share (EPS) targets. EPS increases as the number of outstanding shares decreases. Legal restrictions on buybacks were greatly eased in the early 1980s. He advocates changing these incentives to limit buybacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2014/09/profits-without-prosperity/ar/1|title=Profits Without Prosperity|work=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/harold-meyerson-in-corporations-its-owner-take-all/2014/08/26/0c1a002a-2ca7-11e4-bb9b-997ae96fad33_story.html|title=In corporations, it's owner-take-all|author=Harold Meyerson|date=26 August 2014|work=Washington Post|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 12 months to March 31, 2014, S&amp;P 500 companies increased their stock buyback payouts by 29% year on year, to $534.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ef626fc4-f6f7-11e3-b271-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3IVLb48yU|title=US share buybacks and dividends hit record|work=Financial Times|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. companies are projected to increase buybacks to $701 billion in 2015 according to Goldman Sachs, an 18% increase over 2014. For scale, annual non-residential fixed investment (a proxy for business investment and a major GDP component) was estimated to be about $2.1 trillion for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2014/txt/gdp3q14_adv.txt |title=BEA-GDP Press Release-Q3 2014 Advance Estimate-October 30, 2014 |access-date=March 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608092235/https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2014/txt/gdp3q14_adv.txt |archive-date=June 8, 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/102173955#.CNBC-Jeff Cox-Stock Buybacks Expected to Jump 18% in 2015-November 11, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry concentration===
{{See also|Too big to fail|Concentration of media ownership}}
[[File:5-Bank Asset Concentration in U.S. 1997-2012.png|thumb|350px|Percentage of banking assets held by largest five U.S. banks from 1997-2011.]]

Brid Brennan of the Transnational Institute explained how concentration of corporations increases their influence over government: ”It’s not just their size, their enormous wealth and assets that make the TNCs [transnational corporations] dangerous to democracy. It’s also their concentration, their capacity to influence, and often infiltrate, governments and their ability to act as a genuine international social class in order to defend their commercial interests against the common good. It is such decision making power as well as the power to impose deregulation over the past 30 years, resulting in changes to national constitutions, and to national and international legislation which has created the environment for corporate crime and impunity.&quot;&lt;ref name=Brennan2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/article/state-corporate-power|title=The State of Corporate Power|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tni.org/briefing/state-power-2014|title=State of Power 2014|work=Transnational Institute|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such industry concentration is in banking. The top 5 U.S. banks had approximately 30% of the U.S. banking assets in 1998; this rose to 45% by 2008 and to 48% by 2010, before falling to 47% in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DDOI06USA156NWDB|title=5-Bank Asset Concentration for United States|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Economist]] also explained how an increasingly profitable corporate financial and banking sector caused Gini coefficients to rise in the U.S. since 1980: &quot;Financial services' share of GDP in America doubled to 8% between 1980 and 2000; over the same period their profits rose from about 10% to 35% of total corporate profits, before collapsing in 2007–09. Bankers are being paid more, too. In America the compensation of workers in financial services was similar to average compensation until 1980. Now it is twice that average.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/node/17957381|title=Unbottled Gini|journal=The Economist|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summary argument, considering these findings, is that if corporatization is the consolidation and sharing of economic and political power between large corporations and the state ... then a corresponding concentration of income and wealth (with resulting income inequality) is an expected by-product of such a consolidation.&lt;ref name=Brennan2014/&gt;
