==History==
{{see also| Yoga|Nadi (yoga)}}

The term ''chakra'' appears to first emerge within the Hindu Vedas, though not precisely in the sense of psychic energy centers, rather as ''chakravartin'' or the king who &quot;turns the wheel of his empire&quot; in all directions from a center, representing his influence and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=White, David Gordon |authorlink=David Gordon White |title=Tantra in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1778-4 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iconography popular in representing the ''Chakras'', states White, trace back to the five symbols of [[yajna]], the Vedic fire altar: &quot;square, circle, triangle, half moon and dumpling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=White, David Gordon |authorlink=David Gordon White |title=Tantra in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hayV4o50eUEC |year=2001 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1778-4 |page=555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hymn 10.136 of the ''Rigveda'' mentions a renunciate [[yogi]] with a female named ''kunamnama''. Literally, it means &quot;she who is bent, coiled&quot;, representing both a minor goddess and one of many embedded enigmas and esoteric riddles within the ''Rigveda''. Some scholars, such as David Gordon White and Georg Feuerstein, interpret this might be related to [[kundalini]] shakti, and an overt overature to the terms of esotericism that would later emerge in Post-Aryan Bramhanism. the Upanishad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Gordon White |authorlink=David Gordon White |title=Kiss of the Yogini: &quot;Tantric Sex&quot; in its South Asian Contexts|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5RwARVMg2_4C |year=2006| publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-02783-8|pages=33, 130, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Georg Feuerstein 1998 15–17&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Feuerstein, Georg  |authorlink=Georg Feuerstein |title=Tantra: Path of Ecstasy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4O6_AwAAQBAJ |year=1998 |publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-0-8348-2545-1 |pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Flood, Gavin D.  |authorlink=Gavin Flood |title=An Introduction to Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-43878-0|pages=77–78, 285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breath channels ([[Nadi (yoga)|nāḍi]]) are mentioned in the classical [[Upanishads]] of Hinduism from the 1st millennium BCE,&lt;ref name=&quot;YIP14&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trish O'Sullivan (2010), ''Chakras''. In: D.A. Leeming, K. Madden, S. Marlan (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'', Springer Science + Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt; but not psychic-energy chakra theories. The latter, states [[David Gordon White]], were introduced about 8th-century CE in Buddhist texts as hierarchies of inner energy centers, such as in the ''[[Hevajra Tantra]]'' and ''Caryāgiti''.&lt;ref name=&quot;YIP14&quot;&gt;White, David Gordon.

In contrast to White, according to [[Georg Feuerstein]], early Upanishads of Hinduism do mention ''cakra'' in the sense of &quot;psychospiritual vortices&quot;, along with other terms found in tantra: ''[[prana]]'' or ''vayu'' (life energy) along with ''nadi'' (energy carrying arteries).&lt;ref name=&quot;Georg Feuerstein 1998 15–17&quot;/&gt; According to [[Gavin Flood]], the ancient texts do not present ''chakra'' and kundalini-style yoga theories although these words appear in the earliest Vedic literature in many contexts. The ''chakra'' in the sense of four or more vital energy centers appear in the medieval era Hindu and Buddhist texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Flood, Gavin D. |authorlink=Gavin D.

Chakra is a part of the esoteric medieval era theories about physiology and psychic centers that emerged across Indian traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;YIP14&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Basant Pradhan |title=Yoga and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy: A Clinical Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=maUxBQAAQBAJ |year=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-09105-1 |pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory posited that human life simultaneously exists in two parallel dimensions, one &quot;physical body&quot; (''sthula sarira'') and other &quot;psychological, emotional, mind, non-physical&quot; it is called the &quot;[[subtle body]]&quot; (''sukshma sarira'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma2006p193&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind Sharma|title=A Primal Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PiO8lKUs9-YC |year=2006|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-5014-5|pages=193–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|The roots to this theory are found in [[Samkhya]] and [[Vedanta]] which attempt to conceptualize the permanent soul and impermanent body as interacting in three overlapping states: the gross body (sthula sarira), the subtle body (sukshma sarira), and causal body (karana sarira). These ideas emerged to address questions relating to the nature of body and soul, how and why they interact while one is awake, one is asleep and over the conception-birth-growth-decay-death-rebirth cycle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma2006p193&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=muller227&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Friedrich Max Müller]]|title=The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AOzHazE_nQcC |year=1899|publisher=Longmans |pages=227–236, 393–395}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This subtle body is energy, while the physical body is mass. The psyche or mind plane corresponds to and interacts with the body plane, and the theory posits that the body and the mind mutually affect each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lochtefeld2002p137&quot;/&gt; The subtle body consists of nadi (energy channels) connected by nodes of psychic energy called ''chakra''.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt; The theory grew into extensive elaboration, with some suggesting 88,000 chakras throughout the subtle body. The number of major chakras varied between various traditions, but they typically ranged between four and seven.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grimes100&quot;/&gt;

The important chakras are stated in Hindu and Buddhist texts to be arranged in a column along the spinal cord, from its base to the top of the head, connected by vertical channels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lochtefeld2002p137&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesRyan2006p102&quot;/&gt; The tantric traditions sought to master them, awaken and energize them through various breathing exercises or with assistance of a teacher. These chakras were also symbolically mapped to specific human physiological capacity, [[seed syllable]]s (bija), sounds, subtle elements (tanmatra), in some cases deities, colors and other motifs.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lochtefeld2002p137&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Klaus K.

The chakra theories of Hinduism and Buddhism differs from the historic [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|Chinese system of meridians]] in [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesRyan2006p102&quot;/&gt; Unlike the latter, the ''chakra'' relates to subtle body, wherein it has a position but no definite nervous node or precise physical connection. The tantric systems envision it as continually present, highly relevant and a means to psychic and emotional energy. It is useful in a type of yogic rituals and meditative discovery of radiant inner energy (''prana'' flows) and mind-body connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;JonesRyan2006p102&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices, 2nd Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=190–191, 353–357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[meditation]] is aided by extensive symbology, [[mantra]]s, diagrams, models (deity and [[mandala]]). The practitioner proceeds step by step from perceptible models, to increasingly abstract models where deity and external mandala are abandoned, inner self and internal mandalas are awakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=E.

{{quote|Ideas and practices involving so-called 'subtle bodies' have existed for many centuries in many parts of the world. (...) Virtually all human cultures known to us have some kind of concept of mind, spirit or soul as distinct from the physical body, if only to explain experiences such as sleep and dreaming. (...) An important subset of subtle-body practices, found particularly in Indian and Tibetan Tantric traditions, and in similar Chinese practices, involves the idea of an internal 'subtle physiology' of the body (or rather of the body-mind complex) made up of channels through which substances of some kind flow, and points of intersection at which these channels come together. In the Indian tradition the channels are known as ''nadi'' and the points of intersection as ''cakra''. |Geoffrey Samuel and Jay Johnston, ''Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Geoffrey Samuel |author1link=Geoffrey Samuel |author2=Jay Johnston |title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-136-76640-4 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Contrast with classical yoga===

Chakra and related theories have been important to the esoteric traditions, but they are not directly related to mainstream [[yoga]]. According to the Indologist [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]] and other scholars, the goals of classical yoga such as spiritual liberation (freedom, self-knowledge, [[moksha]]) is &quot;attained entirely differently in classical yoga, and the ''cakra / nadi / kundalini'' physiology is completely peripheral to it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edwin Francis Bryant |title=The Yoga sūtras of Patañjali: a new edition, translation, and commentary with insights from the traditional commentators |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHYxAQAAIAAJ |year=2009 |publisher=North Point Press |isbn=978-0-86547-736-0 |pages=358–364, 229–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stefanie Syman |authorlink=Stefanie Syman |title=The Subtle Body: The Story of Yoga in America |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFYFEmSVtQAC |year=2010 |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |isbn=978-1-4299-3307-0 |pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crown Brow Throat Chakras, Rajasthan 18th Century.jpg|thumb|left|In meditation, chakras are often visualised in different ways, such as a lotus flower, or a disc containing a particular deity.]]

The classical eastern traditions, particularly those that developed in India during the 1st millennium AD, primarily describe ''nadi'' and ''cakra'' in a &quot;subtle body&quot; context.&lt;ref name=samuel5/&gt; To them, they are in same dimension as of the psyche-mind reality that is invisible yet real.

Different esoteric traditions in Hinduism mention numerous numbers and arrangements chakras, of which a classical system of seven is most prevalent.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grimes100&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lochtefeld2002p137&quot;/&gt; This seven-part system, central to the core texts of hatha yoga, is one among many systems found in Hindu tantric literature. These texts teach many different Chakra theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=David Gordon|title=Kiss of the Yogini|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-89483-5|pages=221–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chakra methodology is extensively developed in the goddess tradition of Hinduism called [[Shaktism]]. It is an important concept along with yantras, mandalas and kundalini yoga in its practice. Chakra in Shakta tantrism means circle, an &quot;energy center&quot; within, as well as being a term for group rituals such as in ''chakra-puja'' (worship within a circle) which may or may not involve tantra practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=June McDaniel |title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-534713-5 |pages=96–97, 101–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cakra-based system is a part of the meditative exercises that came to be known as [[yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Philipp H.

Beyond its original [[Shakta]] milieu, various sub-traditions within the [[Shaiva]] and [[Vaishnava]] schools of Hinduism also developed texts and practices on Nadi and Chakra systems. Modern Hindu groups including the [[Bihar School of Yoga]] and the [[Self Realization Fellowship]] utilize a technique of circular energy that works based on the chakras known as [[kriya yoga]]. Although [[Paramahansa Yogananda]] claimed this was the same technique taught as kriya yoga by [[Patañjali]] in the [[Yoga Sūtras]] and by [[Krishna]] in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] (as karma yoga), [[Swami Satyananda]] of the Bihar school disagreed with this assessment and acknowledged the similarities between kriya and taoist inner orbit practices. Both schools claim the technique is taught in every age by an [[avatar]] of god known as [[Mahavatar Babaji|Babaji]]. The historicity of its techniques in India prior to the early twentieth century are not well established. It believed by its practitioners to activate the chakras and stimulate faster spiritual development.

The esoteric traditions in Buddhism generally teach four chakras.&lt;ref name=britchakra/&gt; In some early Buddhist sources, these chakras are identified as: manipura (navel), anahata (heart), vishuddha (throat) and ushnisha kamala (crown).&lt;ref name=&quot;Olson2009p78&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwTnQcFjCQsC&amp;pg=PA78 |title=Historical Dictionary of Buddhism |author=Carl Olson |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8108-6317-0 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alternate Sanskrit terms can be found at http://www.kheper.net/topics/chakras/chakras-Tib.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; In one development within the Nyingma lineage of the ''Mantrayana'' of Tibetan Buddhism a popular conceptualization of chakras in increasing subtlety and increasing order is as follows: Nirmanakaya (gross self), Sambhogakaya (subtle self), Dharmakaya (causal self), and Mahasukhakaya (non-dual self), each vaguely – yet by no means directly – corresponding to the categories within the [[Shaiva]] ''Mantramarga'' universe, i.e., Svadhisthana, Anahata, Visuddha, Sahasrara, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Geoffrey Samuel |author2=Jay Johnston |title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-76640-4 |page=40, Table 2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending on the meditational tradition, these vary between three and six.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olson2009p78&quot;/&gt; The chakras are considered psycho-spiritual constituents, each bearing meaningful correspondences to cosmic processes and their postulated Buddha counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Or99AgAAQBAJ|title=New Buddhist Movements in Thailand: Towards an Understanding of Wat Phra Dhammakaya and Santi Asoke|author=Rory Mackenzie |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-134-13262-1|pages=108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Olson2009p78&quot; /&gt;

A system of five chakras is common among the [[Anuttarayoga Tantra#Mother Tantras|Mother class of Tantras]] and these five chakras along with their correspondences are:&lt;ref&gt;John C. Huntington, Dina Bangdel, ''The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art'', Serindia Publications, Inc., 2003, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Basal chakra ([[Mahābhūta|Element]]: Earth, [[Five Tathagatas|Buddha]]: [[Amoghasiddhi]], [[Bījā|Bija mantra]]: LAM)
* Abdominal chakra (Element: Water, Buddha: [[Ratnasambhava]], Bija mantra: VAM)
* Heart chakra (Element: Fire, Buddha: [[Akshobhya]], Bija mantra: RAM)
* Throat chakra (Element: Wind, Buddha: [[Amitābha|Amitabha]], Bija mantra: YAM)
* Crown chakra (Element: Space, Buddha: [[Vairochana]], Bija mantra: KHAM)

Chakras clearly play a key role in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], and are considered to be the pivotal providence of Tantric thinking. And, the precise use of the chakras across the gamut of tantric sadhanas gives little space to doubt the primary efficacy of Tibetan Buddhism as distinct religious agency, that being that precise revelation that, without Tantra there would be no Chakras, but more importantly, without Chakras, there is no Tibetan Buddhism. The highest practices in Tibetan Buddhism point to the ability to bring the subtle pranas of an entity into alignment with the central channel, and to thus penetrate the realisation of the ultimate unity, namely, the &quot;organic harmony&quot; of one's individual consciousness of Wisdom with the co-attainment of All-embracing Love, thus synthesizing a direct cognition of absolute [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geshe Gelsang Kyatos]], ''Clear Light of Bliss''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geoffrey Samuel, the buddhist esoteric systems developed cakra and nadi as &quot;central to their [[soteriology|soteriological]] process&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Geoffrey Samuel |author2=Jay Johnston|title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-76640-4|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theories were sometimes, but not always, coupled with a unique system of physical exercises, called ''yantra yoga'' or '''phrul 'khor''.

Chakras, according to the [[Bon]] tradition, enable the gestalt of experience, with each of the five major chakras, being psychologically linked with the five experiential qualities of unenlightened consciousness, the [[six realms]] of woe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dahlby |first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche |editor=Mark |date=2002 |title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: The Five Elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Snow Lion |isbn=1-55939-176-6 |page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|tsa lung]] practice embodied in the [[Trul khor]] lineage, unbaffles the primary channels, thus activating and circulating liberating prana. [[Yoga]] awakens the deep mind, thus bringing forth positive attributes, inherent gestalts, and virtuous qualities. In a computer analogy, the screen of one's consciousness is slated and an attribute-bearing file is called up that contains necessary positive or negative, supportive qualities.&lt;ref name=twr&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rinpoche|first1=Tenzin Wangyal |title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen|date=2002|publisher=Snow Lion |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=1-55939-176-6 |pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dahlby |first1=Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche ; edited by Mark |title=Healing with Form, Energy, and Light: the five elements in Tibetan Shamanism, Tantra, and Dzogchen |date=2002 |publisher=Snow Lion |location=Ithaca, NY |isbn=1-55939-176-6 |pages=84–85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tantric practice is said to eventually transform all experience into clear light. The practice aims to liberate from all negative conditioning, and the deep cognitive salvation of freedom from control and unity of perception and cognition.&lt;ref name=twr/&gt;

===Qigong===
[[Qigong]] ({{linktext|氣功}}) also relies on a similar model of the human body as an [[Energy (esotericism)|esoteric energy system]], except that it involves the circulation of [[qì]] ({{linktext|氣}}, also ''ki'') or life-energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Luk]],  ''Taoist Yoga&amp;nbsp;– Alchemy and Immortality'', Rider and Company, London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.5&lt;/ref&gt; The qì, equivalent to the Hindu prana, flows through the energy channels called [[meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], equivalent to the nadi, but two other energies are also important: ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|jīng]]'', or primordial essence, and ''[[Shen (Chinese religion)|shén]]'', or spirit energy.

In the principle circuit of qì, called the [[microcosmic orbit]], energy rises up a main meridian along the spine, but also comes back down the front torso. Throughout its cycle it enters various [[dantian]] (elixir fields) which act as furnaces, where the types of energy in the body (jing, qi and shen) are progressively refined.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Erzeng, Philip Clart. The Story of Han Xiangzi: the alchemical adventures of a Taoist immortal&lt;/ref&gt; These dantian play a very similar role to that of chakras. The number of dantian varies depending on the system; the navel dantian is the most well-known, but there is usually a dantian located at the heart and between the eyebrows.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mantak Chia|Mantak and Maneewan Chia]] ''Awaken Healing Light of the Tao'' (Healing Tao Books, 1993), ch.13&lt;/ref&gt; The lower dantian at or below the navel transforms essence, or jīng, into qì. The middle dantian in the middle of the chest transforms qì into shén, or spirit, and the higher dantian at the level of the forehead (or at the top of the head), transforms shen into [[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], infinite space of void.&lt;ref&gt;Andy James. The Spiritual Legacy of Shaolin Temple&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silat===
Traditional spirituality in the Malay Archipelago borrows heavily from Hindu-Buddhist concepts. In Malay and Indonesian metaphysical theory, the chakras' energy rotates outwards along diagonal lines. Defensive energy emits outwards from the centre line, while offensive energy moves inwards from the sides of the body. This can be applied to [[Energy medicine|energy-healing]], meditation, or martial arts. [[Silat]] practitioners aim to harmonise their movements with these chakras, thereby increasing the power and effectiveness of attacks and movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tua&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title=Silat Tua: The Malay Dance of Life |author=Zainal Abidin Shaikh Awab and Nigel Sutton |year=2006 |publisher=Azlan Ghanie Sdn Bhd |location=Kuala Lumpur |isbn=978-983-42328-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The seven chakra system==
[[File:Chakras map.svg|thumb|upright|One widely popular schema of seven chakras is as follows, from bottom to top: 1. Muladhara 2. Svadhisthana 3. Nabhi-Manipura 4. Anahata 5. Vishuddhi 6. Ajna 7. Sahasrara.&lt;ref name=&quot;grimes100&quot;/&gt;]]

The more common and most studied chakra system incorporates six major chakras along with a seventh center generally not regarded as a chakra. These points are arranged vertically along the axial channel ([[Nadi (yoga)|sushumna nadi]] in Hindu texts, Avadhuti in some Buddhist texts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Geoffrey Samuel |author1link=Geoffrey Samuel |author2=Jay Johnston |title=Religion and the Subtle Body in Asia and the West: Between Mind and Body |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_qOz641rV0C |year=2013 |publisher= Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-76640-4 |pages=39–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gavin Flood, this system of six chakras plus the ''sahasrara'' &quot;center&quot; at the crown first appears in the ''Kubjikāmata-tantra'', an 11th-century [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Flood |first=Gavin |authorlink=Gavin Flood |title=The Tantric Body: The Secret Tradition of Hindu Religion |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2006 |isbn= 978-1845110123 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was this chakra system that was translated in early 20th century by [[Sir John Woodroffe]] (also called Arthur Avalon) in the text ''The Serpent Power''. Avalon translated the Hindu text ''Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa'' meaning the examination (nirūpaṇa) of the six (ṣaṭ) chakras (cakra).&lt;ref name=&quot;White 2003 221&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=David Gordon |authorlink=David Gordon White |title=Kiss of the Yogini |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-89483-5 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chakras are traditionally considered meditation aids. The yogi progresses from lower chakras to the highest chakra blossoming in the crown of the head, internalizing the journey of spiritual ascent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banerjea175&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Akshaya Kumar Banerjea |title=Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljn1koKa0CQC&amp;pg=PA175 |year=1983 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |isbn=978-81-208-0534-7 |pages=175–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both the Hindu and Buddhist kundalini or candali traditions, the chakras are pierced by a dormant energy residing near or in the lowest chakra. In Hindu texts she is known as [[Kundalini]], while in Buddhist texts she is called Candali or [[Tummo]] (Tibetan: ''gtum mo'', &quot;fierce one&quot;).&lt;ref name=johnston40/&gt;

===Other chakras===
{{Tantric chakras}}
&lt;!--[[File:BalineseChakraBanner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|A Balinese chakra banner]]--&gt;

Many systems include myriad minor chakras throughout the body. ''Talu'', ''[[Bindu (symbol)#Chakra|bindu]]'', ''manas'', and ''dvadashanta'' chakra are close to and associated with Ajna chakra. Situated just to the left of Anahata chakra (where the heart is situated anatomically) is ''Hridaya'' chakra. ''[[Vishuddha#Lalana chakra|Lalance]]'' chakra is situated at the base of the mouth and is associated with Vishuddha chakra. In some Shaivist traditions there are 114 chakras out of which 112 are present inside the body.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_VL19SScV8&amp;t=538s&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and similar theories in the West==
{{Main|Esotericism}}

In 1918, the translation of two Indian texts—the ''Ṣaṭ-Cakra-Nirūpaṇa'' and the ''Pādukā-Pañcaka'', by Sir [[John Woodroffe]], alias Arthur Avalon, in a book titled ''The Serpent Power''—introduced the [[shakta]] theory of seven main chakras in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Woodroffe, ''The Serpent Power'', Dover Publications, pp.317ff&lt;/ref&gt; This book is extremely detailed and complex, and later the ideas were developed into the predominant Western view of the chakras by [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]] in his book ''The Chakras''. Many of the views which directed Leadbeater's understanding of the chakras were influenced by previous theosophist authors, in particular [[Johann Georg Gichtel]], a disciple of [[Jakob Böhme]], and his book ''Theosophia Practica (1696)'', in which Gichtel directly refers to inner ''force centres'', a concept reminiscent of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304194144/http://www.archeosofica.org/en/index.php/Theosophical-Excerpts/Gichtel-and-the-Theosophia-Practica.html|date=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hesychasm===
A separate contemplative movement within the Eastern Orthodox Church is [[Hesychasm]], a form of Christian meditation. Comparisons have been made between the Hesychastic centres of prayer and the position of the chakras.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mircea Eliade]]. Yoga, Immortality and Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; Particular emphasis is placed upon the heart area. However, there is no talk about these centres as having any sort of metaphysical existence. Far more than in any of the cases discussed above, the centres are simply places to focus the concentration during prayer.

===New Age===
{{Main|New Age}}
[[File:Nervous plexi.jpg|thumb|Chakra positions in relation to nervous plexuses, from a 1927 textbook]]

In ''[[Anatomy of the Spirit]]'' (1996), [[Caroline Myss]] describes the function of chakras as follows: &quot;Every thought and experience you've ever had in your life gets filtered through these chakra databases. Each event is recorded into your cells...&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myss.com/library/chakras/ |title=Myss Library &amp;#124; Chakras |publisher=Myss.com |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chakras are described as being aligned in an ascending column from the base of the [[spine (anatomy)|spine]] to the top of the head. [[New Age]] practices often associate each chakra with a certain colour. In various traditions, chakras are associated with multiple physiological functions, an aspect of [[consciousness]], a [[classical element]], and other distinguishing characteristics. They are visualised as [[Lotus (genus)|lotuses]] or flowers with a different number of petals in every chakra.

The chakras are thought to vitalise the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered [[Wikt:locus|loci]] of life [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] or [[prana]] (which New Age belief equates with ''[[shakti]]'', ''[[qi]]'' in Chinese, ''ki ''in Japanese, ''koach-ha-guf''&lt;ref&gt;[[Helena Blavatsky]] (1892). Theosophical Glossary. Krotona.&lt;/ref&gt; in Hebrew, ''bios ''in Greek, and [[aether (classical element)|''aether'']]'' ''in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called [[Nadi (yoga)|nadi]]. The function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Neff |first=Dio Urmilla |title=The Great Chakra Controversy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nusDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 |journal=[[Yoga Journal]] |issue=Nov–Dec 1985 |date=1985 |pages=42–45, 50–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Steiner]] considered the chakra system to be dynamic and evolving. He suggested that this system has become different for modern people than it was in ancient times and that it will, in turn, be radically different in future times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_c01.html |title=GA010: Chapter I: The Astral Centers |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/MAC1909/GA010b_index.html |title=GA010: Initiation and Its Results|location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Wn.rsarchive.org |accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner described a sequence of development that begins with the upper chakras and moves down, rather than moving in the opposite direction. He gave suggestions on how to develop the chakras through disciplining thoughts, feelings, and will.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''How to Know Higher Worlds''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Florin Lowndes, a &quot;spiritual student&quot; can further develop and deepen or elevate thinking consciousness when taking the step from the &quot;ancient path&quot; of schooling to the &quot;new path&quot; represented by Steiner's ''[[The Philosophy of Freedom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowndes |first1=Florin |title=Enlivening the Chakra of the Heart: The Fundamental Spiritual Exercises of Rudolf Steiner |date=2000 |publisher=Sophia Books |location=London |isbn=1-85584-053-7 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endocrine system===
Chakras and their importance are posited to reside in the psyche. However, there are those who believe that chakras have a physical manifestation as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sivananda |first=Swami |authorlink=Swami Sivananda |title=Kundalini Yoga: illustrated |date=1991 |publisher=Divine Life Society |location=Sivanandanagar, U.P. |isbn=81-7052-052-5|edition=9th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Gary Osborn, for instance, has described the chakras as [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] counterparts to the [[endocrine system|endocrine glands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardiner |first1=Philip|last2=Osborn|first2=Gary |title=The Shining Ones: the world's most powerful secret society revealed|date=2006 |publisher=Watkins |location=London|isbn=1-84293-150-4|pages=44–45|edition=Rev. and updated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Anodea Judith]] noted a marked similarity between the positions of the two and the roles described for each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5n4dkTw7e0QC&amp;pg=PA20 |title=Wheels of Life: A User's Guide to the Chakra System – Anodea Judith – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Sturgess also links the lower six chakras to specific nerve plexuses along the spinal cord as well as glands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sturgess|first1=Stephen|title=The Yoga Book: a practical guide to self-realization|date=1997|publisher=Element|location=Rockport, Mass.|isbn=1-85230-972-5|pages=19–21}}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C.
