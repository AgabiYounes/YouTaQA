'''Clitoridectomy''' or '''clitorectomy''' is the [[surgery|surgical]] removal, reduction, or partial removal of the [[clitoris]].&lt;ref name=Hiort2014&gt;{{cite book | last = Hiort | first = O. | title = Understanding differences and disorders of sex development (DSD) | publisher = Karger | location = Basel| year = 2014 | isbn = 9783318025583 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p 205 --&gt; It is rarely used as a therapeutic medical procedure, such as when [[cancer]] has developed in or spread to the clitoris. It is often performed on [[intersex]] newborns. Commonly, non-medical removal of the clitoris is performed during [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

==Medical uses ==

===Malignancies===
A clitoridectomy is often done to remove malignancy or necrosis of the clitoris. This is sometimes done along with a radical complete vulvectomy. Surgery may also become necessary due to therapeutic radiation treatments to the pelvic area.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;

Removal of the clitoris may be due to malignancy or trauma.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams gynecology | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071716727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HorbachBouman2015&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horbach|first1=Sophie E.R.|last2=Bouman|first2=Mark-Bram|last3=Smit|first3=Jan Maerten|last4=Özer|first4=Müjde|last5=Buncamper|first5=Marlon E.|last6=Mullender|first6=Margriet G.|title=Outcome of Vaginoplasty in Male-to-Female Transgenders: A Systematic Review of Surgical Techniques|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=12|issue=6|year=2015|pages=1499–1512|issn=1743-6095|doi=10.1111/jsm.12868|pmid=25817066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intersex infants and other issues  ===
Female infants born with a [[46,XX]] genotype but have genitalia affected by [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and are treated surgically with vaginoplasty that often reduces the size of the clitoris without its total removal. The atypical size of the clitoris is due to an endocrine imbalance in utero.&lt;ref name=Hiort2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gundeti2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Pediatric Robotic and Reconstructive Urology a Comprehensive Guide|last=Gundeti|first=Mohan|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2012|isbn=9781444335538|location=City|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons for the surgery include issues involving a microphallus and those who have Mayer-Rokitansky-Kustner disorder. Treatments on children raise human rights concerns.

==Technique==
Clitoridectomy surgical techniques are used to remove an invasive malignancy that extends to the clitoris. Standard surgical procedures are followed in these cases. This includes evaluation and biopsy. Other factors that will affect the technique selected are age, other existing medical conditions, and obesity. Other considerations are the probability of extended hospital care and the development of infection at the surgical site.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;&lt;!--pp 1340-42  --&gt;
The surgery proceeds with the use of general anesthesia, and prior to the vulvectomy/clitoridectomy an inguinal lymphyadenectomy is first done. The extent of the surgical site extends one to two centimeters beyond the boundaries of malignancy. Superficial lymph nodes may also need to be removed. If the malignancy is present in muscular tissue in the region, it is also removed. In some cases, the surgeon is able to preserve the clitoris though the malignancy may be extensive. The cancerous tissue is removed and the incision is closed.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;&lt;!--pp 1340-42  --&gt;

Post operative care may employ the use of suction drainage to allow the deeper tissues to heal toward the surface. Follow up after surgery includes the stripping of the drainage device to prevent blockage. A typical hospital stay can be up to two weeks. The site of the surgery is left unbandaged to allow for frequent examination.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;&lt;!--pp 1340-42  --&gt;
Complications can be the development of lymphedema though not removing the saphenous vein during the surgery will help prevent this. In some instances, foot elevation, diuretic medication and compression stockings can reduce the build up of fluid.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;&lt;!--pp 1340-42  --&gt;

In a clitoridectomy for intersex infants, the clitoris is often reduced instead of removed. The surgeon cuts the shaft of the elongated phallus and sews the glans and preserved nerves back onto the stump.  In a less common surgery called clitoral recession, the surgeon hides the clitoral shaft under a fold of skin so only the glans remains visible.&lt;ref name = &quot;Fausto-Sterling&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fausto-Sterling|first1=Anne|title=Sexing the body : gender politics and the construction of sexuality|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780465077137|url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-07714-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780465077137/page/48 48]|edition=1. ed., [Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
===General===
While much feminist scholarship has described clitoridectomy as a practice aimed at controlling women's sexuality, the historic emergence of the practice in ancient European and Middle Eastern cultures appears to have derived from ideas about intersex people and the policing of boundaries between the sexes. In the seventeenth century, anatomists remained divided on whether a clitoris was a normal female organ, with some arguing that only intersex people had one and that, if large enough to be visible, it should always be removed at birth.&lt;ref&gt;Alison M. Moore, Victorian Medicine Was Not Responsible for Repressing the Clitoris: Rethinking Homology in the Long History of Women’s Genital Anatomy. Signs: The Journal of Women in Culture and Society 44 (1) August 2018, 53-81. DOI: 10.1086/698277.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, a clitoridectomy was thought by some to curb [[Masturbation#Female|female masturbation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Duffy, John|authorlink=John Duffy (medical historian)|doi=10.1001/jama.1963.63710030028012|date=October 19, 1963|title=Masturbation and Clitoridectomy: A Nineteenth-Century View|journal=JAMA|volume=186|issue=3|pages=246–248|pmid=14057114}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Baker Brown]] (1812–1873), an English gynaecologist who was president of the [[Medical Society of London]]  believed that the &quot;unnatural irritation&quot; of the clitoris caused [[epilepsy]], [[Female hysteria|hysteria]], and [[mania]], and he worked &quot;to remove [it] whenever he had the opportunity of doing so&quot;, according to his obituary in the ''Medical Times and Gazette''. [[Peter Lewis Allen]] writes that Brown's views caused outrage, and he died penniless after being expelled from the [[Obstetrical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Lewis Allen|Allen, Peter Lewis]]. ''The Wages of Sin: Sex and Disease, Past and Present''. University of Chicago Press, 2000, [https://archive.org/details/wagesofsinsexdis00alle/page/106 p. 106].

Occasionally, in American and English medicine of the nineteenth century, circumcision was done as a cure for insanity. Some believed that mental and emotional disorders were related to female reproductive organs and that removing the clitoris would cure the neurosis. This treatment was discontinued in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Atoki | first = Morayo | title = Should female circumcision continue to be banned? | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page = 229 | doi = 10.1007/BF01104114 | date = August 1995 | postscript =; Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aesthetics]] may determine clitoral norms. A lack of ambiguity of the genitalia is seen as necessary in the [[assignment of a sex]] to infants and therefore whether a child's genitalia is normal, but what is ambiguous or normal can vary from person to person.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kessler&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kessler|first1=Suzanne J.|title=Lessons from the intersexed|date=2000|publisher=Rutgers Univ. Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=978-0813525297|page=43|edition=2. Paperback printing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual behavior is another reason for clitoridectomies. Author Sarah Rodriguez stated that the history of medical textbooks has indirectly created accepted ideas about the female body. Medical and gynecological textbooks are also at fault in the way that the clitoris is described in comparison to a male's penis. The importance and originality of a female's clitoris is underscored because it is seen as &quot;a less significant organ, since anatomy texts compared the penis and the clitoris in only one direction.&quot; Rodriguez said that a male's penis created the framework of the sexual organ.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rodriguez&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Sarah|title=Female Circumcision and Clitoridectomy in the United States: A History of Medical Treatment|date=2014|publisher=University of Rochester Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all historical examples of clitoral surgeries should be assumed to be clitoridectomy (removal of the clitoris). In the nineteen thirties, the French psychoanalyst Marie Bonaparte studied African clitoral surgical practices and showed that these often involved removal of the clitoral hood, not the clitoris. She also had a surgery done to her own clitoris by the Viennese surgeon Dr Halban, which entailed cutting the suspensory ligament of the clitoris to permit it to sit closer to her vaginal opening. These sorts of clitoral surgeries, contrary to reducing women's sexual pleasure, actually appear aimed at making coitus more pleasurable for women, though it is unclear if that is ever their actual outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Relocating Marie Bonaparte’s Clitoris. Australian Feminist Studies 24 (60), April 2009, 149-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights concerns===
{{Further|Female genital mutilation|Intersex human rights}}
Clitoridectomies are the most common form of female genital mutilation. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates that clitordectomies have been performed on 200 million girls and women that are currently alive. The regions that most clitoridectomies take place are Asia, the Middle East and west, north and east Africa. The practice also exists in migrants originating from these regions. Most of the surgeries are for cultural or religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Female genital mutilation | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date= February 2016| url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/| accessdate = 2016-03-26  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clitoridectomy of women with intersex conditions is controversial when it takes place during childhood or under duress. Intersex women exposed to such treatment have spoken of their loss of physical sensation, and loss of autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Holmes| first = Morgan| authorlink = Morgan Holmes | title = Is Growing up in Silence Better Than Growing up Different?| work = [[Intersex Society of North America]]| url = http://www.isna.org/node/743 | accessdate = 2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Bastien-Charlebois| first = Janik| authorlink = Janik Bastien-Charlebois | title = My coming out: The lingering intersex taboo| work = [[Montreal Gazette]]| date = August 9, 2015| url = https://montrealgazette.com/life/my-coming-out-the-lingering-intersex-taboo | accessdate = 2016-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, multiple human rights institutions have criticized early surgical management of such characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Méndez| first = Juan| title = Report of the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan E.

In 2013, it was disclosed in a medical journal that four unnamed elite female athletes from developing countries were subjected to gonadectomies and partial clitoridectomies after [[Sex verification in sports|testosterone testing]] revealed that they had an intersex condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;jcem2013&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1210/jc.2012-3893| pmid = 23633205 | issn = 0021-972X | volume = 98| issue = 6| pages = –1055–E1059| last1 = Fénichel| first1 = Patrick| last2 = Paris| first2 = Françoise| last3 = Philibert| first3 = Pascal| last4 = Hiéronimus| first4 = Sylvie| last5 = Gaspari| first5 = Laura| last6 = Kurzenne| first6 = Jean-Yves| last7 = Chevallier| first7 = Patrick| last8 = Bermon| first8 = Stéphane| last9 = Chevalier| first9 = Nicolas| last10 = Sultan| first10 = Charles| title = Molecular Diagnosis of 5α-Reductase Deficiency in 4 Elite Young Female Athletes Through Hormonal Screening for Hyperandrogenism| journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism| date = June 2013|display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bmj2014&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1136/bmj.g2926| issn = 1756-1833| volume = 348| issue = apr28 9| pages = –2926–g2926| last1 = Jordan-Young| first1 = R.
