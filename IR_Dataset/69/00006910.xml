[[File:Quakingfallcolors.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Many organisms, including [[aspen tree]]s, reproduce by cloning, often creating large groups of organisms with the same [[DNA]]. One example depicted here is [[quaking aspen]].]]
'''Cloning''' is the process of producing [[genetics|genetically]] identical individuals of an [[organism]] either naturally or artificially. In nature, many organisms produce clones through [[asexual reproduction]]. Cloning in [[biotechnology]] refers to the process of creating clones of organisms or copies of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[DNA]] fragments ([[molecular cloning]]). Beyond [[biology]], the term refers to the production of multiple copies of [[digital media]] or [[software]]

The term '''clone''', coined by [[Herbert J. Webber]], is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:κλών#Ancient Greek|κλών]] ''klōn'', &quot;twig&quot;, referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. In botany, the term '''lusus''' was traditionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.|year=1868|title=Laws of Botanical Nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Congress held at Paris in August 1867; together with an Historical Introduction and Commentary by Alphonse de Candolle, Translated from the French|publisher=L.

Weddell}}{{rp|21, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[horticulture]], the spelling ''clon'' was used until the twentieth century; the final ''e'' came into use to indicate the vowel is a &quot;long o&quot; instead of a &quot;short o&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Natural cloning==
Cloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life forms to spread for hundreds of millions of years. It is the reproduction method used by [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], and [[bacteria]], and is also the way that [[Clonal colony|clonal colonies]] reproduce themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |title=Tasmanian bush could be oldest living organism |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723041627/http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |archivedate=23 July 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm |title=Ibiza's Monster Marine Plant |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=Ibiza Spotlight |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226063158/http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/news/2006/monster_plant_280506_i.htm |archivedate=26 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these organisms include [[Vaccinium corymbosum|blueberry plants]], [[Hazel|hazel trees]], [[Pando (tree)|the Pando trees]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=DeWoody, J. |author2=Rowe, C.A. |author3=Hipkins, V.D. |author4=Mock, K.E. |date=2008 |title= &quot;Pando&quot; Lives: Molecular Genetic Evidence of a Giant Aspen Clone in Central Utah |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=493–497 |doi=10.3398/1527-0904-68.4.493|url=http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/wnan/vol68/iss4/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NALDC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/27665/PDF | title=Blackwell Publishing Ltd Clonal dynamics in western North American aspen (Populus tremuloides) | publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Oxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltd | date=2008 | accessdate=2013-12-05 |author=Mock, K.E. |author2=Rowe, C.A. |author3=Hooten, M.B. |author4=Dewoody, J. |author5=Hipkins, V.D. | pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kentucky coffeetree]], ''[[Myrica]]'', and the [[Liquidambar styraciflua|American sweetgum.]]

==Molecular cloning==
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.

Cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author= Peter J. Russel |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA
# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence
# [[transfection]] – inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells
# screening/selection – selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA

Although these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected;  these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.

Initially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].

== Cell cloning{{Anchor|Cellular cloning}}==

===Cloning unicellular organisms===
[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]
Cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.

A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).&lt;ref name=&quot;CloningRings&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63–66|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.

=== Cloning stem cells ===
{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}
[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], popularly known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called &quot;research cloning&quot; or &quot;therapeutic cloning&quot;. The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called &quot;reproductive cloning&quot;), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Halim&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=31 October 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient.&lt;ref name=Halim /&gt; The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Plus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Plus |first=M. |year=2011 |title= Fetal development |accessdate=31 October 2011 |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latham&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K. E. |year=2005 |title=Early and delayed aspects of nuclear reprogramming during cloning |publisher=Biology of the Cell |pages=97, 119–132 |url=http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802122210/http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |archivedate=2 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would on sperm cells.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt;

The process of cloning a particular farm animal using SCNT is relatively the same for all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt;

SCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=|bibcode=1996Natur.380...64C }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from being well understood. However, by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten&lt;ref&gt;Shukman, David (14 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25576718 China cloning on an 'industrial scale'] BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, a Korean Company Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewScientist500&quot;&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|magazine=New Scientist|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's [[mitochondria]] that contain their own [[mitochondrial DNA]] are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.

== Organism cloning ==
{{See also|Asexual reproduction|Cuttings (plants)|vegetative reproduction}}
'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.

=== Horticultural ===
[[File:Vine shoots.JPG|thumb|Propagating plants from [[cuttings (plants)|cuttings]], such as grape vines, is an ancient form of cloning]]
{{For|the use of cloning in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}
The term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]]. Many horticultural plant [[cultivar]]s are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Sagers, Larry A. (2 March 2009) [http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf Proliferate favorite trees by grafting, cloning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301102536/http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf |date=1 March 2014 }} Utah Stae University, Deseret News (Salt Lake City) Retrieved 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, some European cultivars of [[grape]]s represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are [[potato]] and [[banana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1102001108| title = Multidisciplinary perspectives on banana (''Musa'' spp.) domestication| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 108| url = http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130704133315/http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2013-07-04| issue = 28| pages = 11311–11318| year = 2011| last1 = Perrier| first1 = X.| last2 = De Langhe| first2 = E.| last3 = Donohue| first3 = M.| last4 = Lentfer| first4 = C.| last5 = Vrydaghs| first5 = L.| last6 = Bakry| first6 = F.| last7 = Carreel| first7 = F.| last8 = Hippolyte| first8 = I.| last9 = Horry| first9 = J. -P.| last10 = Jenny| first10 = C.| last11 = Lebot| first11 = V.| last12 = Risterucci| first12 = A. -M.| last13 = Tomekpe| first13 = K.| last14 = Doutrelepont| first14 = H.| last15 = Ball| first15 = T.| last16 = Manwaring| first16 = J.| last17 = De Maret| first17 = P.| last18 = Denham| first18 = T.| pmid = 21730145| pmc = 3136277| bibcode = 2011PNAS..10811311P}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grafting]] can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under [[ethics|ethical]] scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.

Many [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[vine]]s, [[fern]]s and other [[perennials|herbaceous perennial]]s form [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] naturally. Parts of an individual plant may become detached by [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of [[gemma (botany)|gemmae]]. Some vascular plants e.g. [[dandelion]] and certain [[viviparity|viviparous]] grasses also form [[seed]]s asexually, termed [[apomixis]], resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.

=== Parthenogenesis ===
Clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as [[parthenogenesis]] (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes,&lt;ref&gt;Castagnone-Sereno P, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23682915 Diversity and evolution of root-knot nematodes, genus Meloidogyne: new insights from the genomic era] Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2013;51:203-20&lt;/ref&gt; fish (for example the [[hammerhead shark]]&lt;ref name =&quot;NYT Shubin&quot;&gt;Shubin, Neil (24 February 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/opinion/24shubin.html Birds Do It. Bees Do It. Dragons Don’t Need To] New York Times, Retrieved 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;), and lizards including the [[Komodo dragon]]&lt;ref name =&quot;NYT Shubin&quot;/&gt; and several [[Teiidae|whiptails]]. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the [[XY sex-determination system]], the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''), which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] but has spread throughout many tropical environments.

=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===
Artificial cloning of organisms may also be called ''reproductive cloning''.

==== First steps ====
[[Hans Spemann]], a [[Germans|German]] [[embryologist]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1928 he and his student, [[Hilde Mangold]], were the first to perform [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] using [[amphibian]] embryos – one of the first steps towards cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Robertis|first1=EM|title=Spemann's organizer and self-regulation in amphibian embryos|journal=Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology|date=April 2006|volume=7|issue=4|pages=296–302|pmid=16482093|pmc=2464568|doi=10.1038/nrm1855}}.  See [http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v7/n4/box/nrm1855_BX1.html Box 1: Explanation of the Spemann-Mangold experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods ====
Reproductive cloning generally uses &quot;[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]&quot; (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.&lt;ref name=HumanGenomeInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.

Artificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil.

Dolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that genetic material from a specific adult cell, designed to express only a distinct subset of its genes, can be redesigned to grow an entirely new organism. Before this demonstration, it had been shown by John Gurdon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gurdon J | journal=Dev. Biol. | date= Apr 1962 | volume=4| issue=2 | pages=256–73 | title=Adult frogs derived from the nuclei of single somatic cells | pmid= 13903027 | doi=10.1016/0012-1606(62)90043-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mammalian system.

The first mammalian cloning (resulting in Dolly the sheep) had a success rate of 29 embryos per 277 fertilized eggs, which produced three lambs at birth, one of which lived. In a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves, one-third of the calves died quite young. The first successfully cloned horse, [[Prometea]], took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first{{clarify|does this mean &quot;first vertebrate&quot;?|date=February 2016}} clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.

There were early claims that [[Dolly the sheep]] had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of [[telomere]]s, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear [[chromosome]]s. However, other researchers, including [[Ian Wilmut]] who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to problems with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakayama&quot; /&gt;

Dolly was named after performer [[Dolly Parton]] because the cells cloned to make her were from a [[mammary gland]] cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.&lt;ref name=BBCname&gt;BBC. 22 February 2008.

==== Human cloning ====
{{Main|Human cloning}}
Human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislation]] regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Bobby|title=WATCH: Scientists clone monkeys using technique that created Dolly the sheep|url=http://fox61.com/2018/01/25/watch-scientists-clone-monkeys-using-technique-that-created-dolly-the-sheep/|website=Fox61|publisher=fox61|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]]. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18523539 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=Therapeutic cloning: promises and issues | pmc=2323472 | date=July 2007 | journal=Mcgill J Med | pages=112–20 | last1 = Kfoury | first1 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethical issues of cloning ====
{{Main|Ethics of cloning}}

There are a variety of [[bioethics|ethical]] positions regarding the possibilities of cloning, especially [[human cloning]]. While many of these views are [[religious]] in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by [[secular]] perspectives as well.  Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.

Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml#organsQ |title=Cloning Fact Sheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Genome Program |date=2009-05-11 |archivedate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid the need for [[immunosuppressive drugs]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;/&gt; and to stave off the effects of aging.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

==== Cloning extinct and endangered species ====
Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from [[extinct]] species has, for decades, been a dream.  Possible implications of this were dramatized in the 1984 novel ''[[Carnosaur (novel)|Carnosaur]]'' and the 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)#Biological issues and accuracy|Jurassic Park]]''.&lt;ref name=Holt/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ehrenfeld&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ehrenfeld|first=David|authorlink=David Ehrenfeld|year=2006|title=Transgenics and Vertebrate Cloning as Tools for Species Conservation|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=20|issue=3|pages=723–732|pmid=16909565|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00399.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of 9.4 percent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Biol.

In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last ''bucardo'' ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

In 2002, geneticists at the [[Australian Museum]] announced that they had replicated DNA of the [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using [[polymerase chain reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/05/28/aust.thylacines/|title=Cloning to revive extinct species|first=Grant|last=Holloway|publisher=CNN.com|date=2002-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 15 February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the ([[ethanol]]) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/researchers-revive-plan-to-clone-the-tassie-tiger-20050515-gdlbos.html|title=Researchers revive plan to clone the Tassie tiger|date=2005-05-15|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells. The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title =Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html | accessdate = 2009-02-01 |work = The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Richard | last1=Gray | first2=Roger | last2=Dobson | date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the [[woolly mammoth]], but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal.  In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3075381.stm|title=Scientists 'to clone mammoth'|work=BBC News|date=2003-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16068581 |title=BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted, however that the result, if possible, would be an elephant-mammoth hybrid rather than a true mammoth.&lt;ref name=rure&gt;[http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2015/05/kogda-oni-vernutsya/ &quot;Когда вернутся мамонты&quot;] (&quot;When the Mammoths Return&quot;), 5 February 2015 (retrieved 6 September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is the survival of the reconstructed mammoth: [[ruminant]]s rely on a [[symbiosis]] with specific [[microbiota]] in their stomachs for digestion.&lt;ref name=rure/&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and [[University of New South Wales]] announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct [[gastric-brooding frog]] would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Yong|first=Ed|title=Resurrecting the Extinct Frog with a Stomach for a Womb|website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=2013-03-15|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/15/resurrecting-the-extinct-frog-with-a-stomach-for-a-womb/|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many such &quot;De-extinction&quot; projects are described in the [[Long Now Foundation]]'s Revive and Restore Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://longnow.org/revive/ | title=Long Now Foundation, Revive and Restore Project| date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lifespan===
After an eight-year project involving the use of a pioneering cloning technique, Japanese researchers created 25 generations of healthy cloned mice with normal lifespans, demonstrating that clones are not intrinsically shorter-lived than naturally born animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakayama&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Cell Stem Cell | date = 7 March 2013  | volume=12 |issue=3 | pages=293–7 | title=Successful serial recloning in the mouse over multiple generations |vauthors=Wakayama S, Kohda T, Obokata H, Tokoro M, Li C, Terashita Y, Mizutani E, Nguyen VT, Kishigami S, Ishino F, Wakayama T | pmid = 23472871 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2013.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gen25&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/03/130307122958.htm |title=Generations of Cloned Mice With Normal Lifespans Created: 25th Generation and Counting|website=Science Daily|date=7 March 2013 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources have noted that the offspring of clones tend to be healthier than the original clones and indistinguishable from animals produced naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Epigenetics Revolution|last=Carey|first=Nessa|publisher=Icon Books Ltd.|year=2012|isbn=978-184831-347-7|location=London, UK|pages=149–150|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly the sheep was cloned from a six year old cell sample from a mammary gland. Because of this, some posited she may have aged more quickly than other naturally born animals, as she died relatively early for a sheep at the age of six. Ultimately, her death was attributed to a respiratory illness, and the &quot;advanced aging&quot; theory is disputed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burgstaller|first=Jörg Patrick|last2=Brem|first2=Gottfried|date=2017|title=Aging of Cloned Animals: A Mini-Review|journal=Gerontology|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|page=419|doi=10.1159/000452444|pmid=27820924|issn=0304-324X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=August 2018}}

A detailed study released in 2016 and less detailed studies by others suggest that once cloned animals get past the first month or two of life they are generally healthy. However, early pregnancy loss and neonatal losses are still greater with cloning than natural conception or assisted reproduction (IVF). Current research is attempting to overcome these problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCname&quot; /&gt;

Discussion of cloning in the popular media often presents the subject negatively. In an article in the 8 November 1993 article of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', cloning was portrayed in a negative way, modifying Michelangelo's ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' to depict Adam with five identical hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIME Magazine – U.S. Edition – Vol. 142 No. 19|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601931108,00.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105153733/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601931108,00.html|archivedate=5 November 2017|date=8 November 1993|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} 10 March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning, and included a graphic depicting identical babies in beakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Today The Sheep…|journal=Newsweek|date=9 March 1997|url=http://www.newsweek.com/today-sheep-170570|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of cloning, particularly human cloning, has featured a wide variety of [[science fiction]] works. An early fictional depiction of cloning is [[Bokanovsky's Process]] which features in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1931 dystopian novel ''[[Brave New World]]''. The process is applied to fertilized human [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] ''[[in vitro]]'', causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous; &quot;Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited&quot;; p. 19; HarperPerennial, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhelkar|first1=Ratnakar D.|title=Science Fiction: Fantasy and Reality|date=2009|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=9788126910366|page=58|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bvt_NyXYGb0C&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s, the subject was explored further in works such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1953 story ''UN-Man'', which describes a technology called &quot;exogenesis&quot;, and [[Gordon Rattray Taylor]]'s book ''[[The Biological Time Bomb]]'', which popularised the term &quot;cloning&quot; in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;stableford&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian M.|title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415974608|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sciencefactscien0000stab/page/91 91–92]|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uefwmdROKTAC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;pg=PA91|language=en|chapter=Clone|url=https://archive.org/details/sciencefactscien0000stab/page/91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films, ranging from action films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000), ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005), to comedies such as [[Woody Allen]]'s 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070707/|title=Sleeper (1973)|author=planktonrules|date=17 December 1973|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in [[artificial womb]]s. In the long-running British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Fourth Doctor]] and his companion [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples (&quot;[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]&quot;, 1977) and then — in an apparent [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' — shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus. The clones in this story are short-lived, and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire.&lt;ref name=&quot;muir&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=A Critical History of Doctor Who on Television|date=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476604541|pages=258–9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMKSCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;pg=PA259|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction films such as ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'' have featured scenes of human [[fetus|foetus]]es being cultured on an industrial scale in mechanical tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mumford|first1=James|title=Ethics at the Beginning of Life: A Phenomenological Critique|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199673964|page=108|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UCnmRCDGJ0cC&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning humans from body parts is also a common theme in science fiction. Cloning features strongly among the science fiction conventions parodied in Woody Allen's ''Sleeper'', the plot of which centres around an attempt to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humber|first1=James M.|last2=Almeder|first2=Robert|title=Human Cloning|date=1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781592592050|page=10|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vNGUBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 ''Doctor Who'' story &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, a duplicate version of the [[Tenth Doctor]] spontaneously grows from his severed hand, which had been cut off in a sword fight during an earlier episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;smithka&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Courtland|last2=Smithka|first2=Paula|title=Doctor Who and Philosophy: Bigger on the Inside|date=2010|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812697254|pages=32–33|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ShPnLHcKqUwC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en|chapter=What's Continuity without Persistence?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of her beloved 14-year old [[Coton de Tulear]] named Samantha in late 2017, [[Barbra Streisand]] announced that she had cloned the dog, and was now &quot;waiting for [the two cloned pups] to get older so [she] can see if they have [Samantha's] brown eyes and her seriousness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/streisand-dog-clone-1.4555800?cmp=rss|title=Twice as nice: Barbra Streisand cloned her beloved dog and has 2 new pups|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation cost $50,000 through the pet cloning company ViaGen.

===Cloning and identity===
Science fiction has used cloning, most commonly and specifically [[human cloning]], to raise the controversial questions of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Patrick|title=How Popular media represent cloning as an ethical problem|jstor=3527566|volume=28|issue=2|pages=6–13|doi=10.2307/3527566|pmid=9589288|journal=The Hastings Center Report|url=http://kie.georgetown.edu/nrcbl/documents/hcr/v28/h28n2p06.pdf|year=1998}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf |title=Yvonne A.

The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. ''A Number'' was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the [[BBC]] and [[HBO Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = Uma Thurman, Rhys Ifans and Tom Wilkinson star in two plays for BBC Two| publisher = BBC| date = 2008-06-19| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/06_june/19/stage.shtml| accessdate = 2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a Japanese television series named &quot;Bunshin&quot; was created. The story's main character, Mariko, is a woman studying child welfare in Hokkaido. She grew up always doubtful about the love from her mother, who looked nothing like her and who died nine years before. One day, she finds some of her mother's belongings at a relative's house, and heads to Tokyo to seek out the truth behind her birth. She later discovered that she was a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Review of Bunshin |url =http://doramaworld.blogspot.com/2012/06/review-of-bunshin.html|date =2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 television series ''[[Orphan Black]]'', cloning is used as a scientific study on the behavioral adaptation of the clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234222/|title=Orphan Black (TV Series 2013– )|author=foreverbounds|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the book ''[[The Double (Saramago novel)|The Double]]'' by Nobel Prize winner [[José Saramago]] explores the emotional experience of a man who discovers that he is a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Banville |title='The Double': The Tears of a Clone|work=The New York Times |date=2004-10-10|accessdate=14 January 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/books/review/10BANV01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning as resurrection===
Cloning has been used in fiction as a way of recreating historical figures. In the 1976 [[Ira Levin]] novel ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' and its [[The Boys from Brazil (film)|1978 film adaptation]], [[Josef Mengele]] uses cloning to create copies of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077269/|title=The Boys from Brazil (1978)|author=Christian Lee Pyle (CLPyle)|date=12 October 1978|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', which spawned a [[Jurassic Park|series of ''Jurassic Park'' feature films]], a bioengineering company develops a technique to resurrect extinct species of [[dinosaur]]s by creating cloned creatures using DNA extracted from [[fossil]]s. The cloned dinosaurs are used to populate the Jurassic Park [[Animal theme park|wildlife park]] for the entertainment of visitors. The scheme goes disastrously wrong when the dinosaurs escape their enclosures. Despite being selectively cloned as females to prevent them from breeding, the dinosaurs develop the ability to reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cohen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Daniel|title=Cloning|date=2002|publisher=Millbrook Press|isbn=9780761328025|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TpBEOaHhb4oC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning for warfare===
The use of cloning for military purposes has also been explored in several fictional works. In ''Doctor Who'', an alien race of armour-clad, warlike beings called [[Sontaran]]s was introduced in the 1973 serial &quot;[[The Time Warrior]]&quot;. Sontarans are depicted as squat, bald creatures who have been genetically engineered for combat. Their weak spot is a &quot;probic vent&quot;, a small socket at the back of their neck which is associated with the cloning process.&lt;ref name=&quot;thompson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Doctor Who FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Most Famous Time Lord in the Universe|date=2013|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781480342958|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QcEXAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT119&amp;pg=PT119|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of cloned soldiers being bred for combat was revisited in &quot;[[The Doctor's Daughter]]&quot; (2008), when the Doctor's DNA is used to create a female warrior called [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Jason|last2=Mustachio|first2=Camille D.

The 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' was set against the backdrop of a historical conflict called the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. The events of this war were not fully explored until the prequel films ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005), which depict a [[Space warfare in fiction|space war]] waged by a massive army of heavily armoured [[clone trooper]]s that leads to the foundation of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Cloned soldiers are &quot;manufactured&quot; on an industrial scale, genetically conditioned for obedience and combat effectiveness. It is also revealed that the popular character [[Boba Fett]] originated as a clone of [[Jango Fett]], a mercenary who served as the genetic template for the clone troopers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcdonald&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Paul F.|title=The Star Wars Heresies: Interpreting the Themes, Symbols and Philosophies of Episodes I, II and III|date=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786471812|pages=167–171|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wf4CAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en|chapter=The Clones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185834/|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)|author=compel_bast|date=15 August 2008|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning for exploitation===
A recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction is the use of clones as a supply of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]]. The 2005 [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] novel ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' and the [[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|2010 film adaption]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/|title=Never Let Me Go (2010)|author=espenshade55|date=11 February 2011|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are set in an [[alternate history]] in which cloned humans are created for the sole purpose of providing organ donations to naturally born humans, despite the fact that they are fully sentient and self-aware. The 2005 film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/|title=The Island (2005)|date=22 July 2005|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around a similar plot, with the exception that the clones are unaware of the reason for their existence.

The exploitation of human clones for dangerous and undesirable work was examined in the 2009 British science fiction film ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/|title=Moon (2009)|author=larry-411|date=17 July 2009|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the futuristic novel ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' and subsequent [[Cloud Atlas (film)|film]], one of the story lines focuses on a genetically-engineered fabricant clone named Sonmi~451, one of millions raised in an artificial &quot;wombtank,&quot; destined to serve from birth. She is one of thousands  created for manual and [[emotional labor]]; Sonmi herself works as a server in a restaurant. She later discovers that the sole source of food for clones, called 'Soap', is manufactured from the clones themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsdaily.com/8402-human-clones-cloud-atlas.html|title=Technology News – 2017 Innovations and Future Tech|access-date=15 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105103230/http://www.technewsdaily.com/8402-human-clones-cloud-atlas.html|archive-date=5 January 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film [[Us (2019 film)|Us]], at some point prior to the 1980s, the US Government creates clones of every citizen of the United States with the intention of using them to control their original counterparts, akin to [[voodoo doll]]s. This fails, as they were able to copy bodies, but unable to copy the souls of those they cloned. The project is abandoned and the clones are trapped exactly mirroring their above-ground counterparts' actions for generations. In the present day, the clones launch a surprise attack and manage to complete a mass-genocide of their unaware counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/us/280039/us-the-tethered-explained| title= Us: Who Are the Tethered? |author= Daniel Kurland | date = May 23, 2019 | access-date= July 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/us-ending-explained-could-be-a-sequel-1196643| title= 'Us' Ending Explained: Could There Be A Sequel? | author = Jason Spiegel | date = March 23, 2019 | access-date = July 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
