Although heavily influenced by Byzantine models, Cimabue is generally regarded as one of the first great Italian painters to break from the [[Italo-Byzantine art|Italo-Byzantine]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Kleiner|year=2008|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: A Global History|volume=2|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[medieval art]] then was scenes and forms that appeared relatively flat and highly stylized, Cimabue's figures were depicted with more advanced lifelike proportions and shading than other artists of his time. According to  Italian painter and historian [[Giorgio Vasari]], Cimabue was the teacher of [[Giotto]],&lt;ref name=vas/&gt; the first great artist of the Italian [[Proto-Renaissance]]. However, many scholars today tend to discount Vasari's claim by citing earlier sources that suggest otherwise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayden B.J. Maginnis 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Hayden B.J. Maginnis|section=In Search of an Artist|editor1=Anne Derbes|editor2=Mark Sandona|title=The Cambridge Companion to Giotto|location=Cambridge|year=2004|pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Cimabue (attr.), tavola di san francesco, museo della porziuncola.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[St. Francis of Assisi]]]]
Little is known about Cimabue's early life. One source that recounts his career is Vasari's ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'', but its accuracy is uncertain.   
[[File:San Francesco Cimabue.jpg|thumb|300px|Fresco in the Lower Basilica of Assisi]]

He was born in Florence and died in [[Pisa]]. Hayden Maginnis speculates that he could have trained in Florence under masters who were culturally connected to [[Byzantine art]].

Italian art historian [[Pietro Toesca]] attributed the ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Arezzo)|Crucifixion]]'' in the church of [[San Domenico, Arezzo|San Domenico]] in [[Arezzo]] to Cimabue, dating around 1270, making it the earliest known attributed work that departs from the Byzantine style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art in Renaissance Italy|last=Paoletti|first=John T.|last2=Radke|first2=Gary M.|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|year=2005|isbn=|location=|page=51|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimabue's Christ is bent, and the clothes have the golden striations that were introduced by [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]].

Around 1272, Cimabue is documented as being present in [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Short History of Italian Painting|last=Van Vechten Brown|first=Alice|last2=Rankin|first2=William|publisher=J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, ltd.|year=1914|isbn=|location=|pages=41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a little later he made another ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifix]]'' for the Florentine church of [[Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Carpentry and Symmetry in Cimabue's Santa Croce Crucifix|last=Brink|first=Joel|date=October 1978|work=The Burlington Magazine|issue=No. 907|volume=Volume 120|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now restored, having been damaged by the [[1966 Arno River flood]], the work was larger and more advanced than the one in [[Arezzo]], with traces of naturalism perhaps inspired by the works of [[Nicola Pisano]].

According to Vasari, Cimabue, while travelling from Florence to Vespignano, came upon the 10-year-old Giotto (c.&amp;nbsp;1277) drawing his sheep with a rough rock upon a smooth stone. He asked if Giotto would like to come and stay with him, which the child accepted with his father's permission.&lt;ref name=World/&gt; Vasari elaborates that during Giotto's apprenticeship, he allegedly painted a fly on the nose of a portrait Cimabue was working on; the teacher attempted to sweep the fly away several times before he understood his pupil's prank.&lt;ref name=World&gt;{{cite book |last=Eimerl |first=Sarel |others=et al |title=The World of Giotto: c. 1267–1337 |url=https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc100eime |url-access=registration |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1967 |isbn=0-900658-15-0 |pp=82, 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars now discount Vasari's claim that he took Giotto as his pupil, citing earlier sources that suggest otherwise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hayden B.J. Maginnis 2004&quot;/&gt;

Around 1280, Cimabue painted the ''[[Maestà (Cimabue)|Maestà]]'', originally displayed in the church of [[San Francesco, Pisa|San Francesco]] at [[Pisa]], but now at the [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tuscany &amp; Umbria|last=Maxwell|first=Virginia|last2=Leviton|first2=Alex|last3=Pettersen|first3=Leif|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=364|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work established a style that was followed subsequently by numerous artists, including [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]] in his ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'' (in the past, wrongly attributed to Cimabue) as well as Giotto. Other works from the period, which were said to have heavily influenced Giotto, include a ''Flagellation'' ([[Frick Collection]]), mosaics for the [[Baptistery of Florence]] (now largely restored), the ''Maestà'' at the [[Basilica di Santa Maria dei Servi|Santa Maria dei Servi]] in [[Bologna]] and the ''Madonna'' in the Pinacoteca of [[Castelfiorentino]]. A workshop painting, perhaps assignable to a slightly later period, is the ''Maestà with Saints Francis and Dominic'' currently housed in the [[Uffizi]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

During the [[pontificate]] of [[Pope Nicholas IV]], the first [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] pope,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dante and the Franciscans: Poverty and the Papacy in the 'Commedia'|last=Havely|first=Nick|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimabue worked in [[Assisi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Image of St. Francis: Responses to Sainthood in the Thirteenth Century|last=Brooke|first=Rosalind B.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Assisi, in the [[transept]] of the Lower [[Basilica di San Francesco di Assisi|Basilica of San Francesco]], he created a [[fresco]] named ''Madonna with Child Enthroned, Four Angels and St Francis''. The left portion of this [[fresco]] is lost, but it may have shown [[Anthony of Padua|St Anthony of Padua]] (the authorship of the painting has been recently disputed{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} for technical and stylistic reasons). Cimabue was subsequently commissioned to decorate the [[apse]] and the transept of the Upper Basilica of Assisi, in the same period of time that Roman artists were decorating the [[nave]]. The cycle he created there comprises scenes from the [[Gospel]]s, the lives of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]], [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]]. The paintings are now in poor condition because of oxidation of the brighter colours that were used by the artist.

The ''[[Santa Trinita Maestà|Maestà of Santa Trinita]]'', dated to c. 1290–1300, which was originally painted for the church of [[Santa Trinita, Florence|Santa Trinita]] in [[Florence]], is now in the [[Uffizi Gallery]]. The softer expression of the characters suggests that it was influenced by Giotto, who was by then already active as a painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art in Renaissance Italy|last=Paoletti|first=John T.|last2=Radke|first2=Gary M.|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cimabue spent the last period of his life, 1301 to 1302, in Pisa. There, he was commissioned to finish a mosaic of [[Christ enthroned with the Virgin and St John|Christ Enthroned]], originally begun by [[Maestro Francesco]], in the apse of the [[Pisa Cathedral|city's cathedral]]. Cimabue was to create the part of the mosaic depicting St [[John the Evangelist]], which remains the sole surviving work documented as being by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=John|title=Art and architecture in Italy 1250-1400|date=26 May 1993|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9707250208|page=175|edition=3rd Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimabue died around 1302.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia|last=Kleinhenz|first=Christopher|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
According to Vasari, quoting a contemporary of Cimabue, &quot;Cimabue of Florence was a painter who lived during the author's own time, a nobler man than anyone knew but he was as a result so haughty and proud that if someone pointed out to him any mistake or defect in his work, or if he had noted any himself... he would immediately destroy the work, no matter how precious it might be.&quot; &lt;ref name=GV&gt;{{cite book|last=Vasari|first=Giorgio|title=Lives of the Artists, 1550|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-281754-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/livesofartists0000vasa/page/13 13]|url=https://archive.org/details/livesofartists0000vasa/page/13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nickname Cimabue translates as &quot;bull-head&quot; but also possibly as &quot;one who crushes the views of others&quot;, from the Latin word ''cimare'', meaning &quot;top&quot;, &quot;shear&quot;, and &quot;blunt&quot;. The conclusion for the second meaning is drawn from similar commentaries on Dante, who was also known &quot;for being contemptuous of criticism&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T017771?q=cimabue&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|title=Cimabue|last=Gibbs|first=Robert|date=|publisher=www.oxfordartonline.com|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
History has long regarded Cimabue as the last of an era that was overshadowed by the [[Italian Renaissance]]. As early as 1543, Vasari wrote of Cimabue, &quot;Cimabue was, in one sense, the principal cause of the renewal of painting,&quot; with the qualification that, &quot;Giotto truly eclipsed Cimabue's fame just as a great light eclipses a much smaller one.&quot;&lt;ref name=GV /&gt;

In Canto XI of his ''[[Purgatorio]]'', [[Dante]] laments Cimabue's quick loss of public interest in the face of Giotto's revolution in art:&lt;ref&gt;Purgatio XI, cited in the [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03771a.htm Cenni di Petro Cimabue] article in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
O vanity of human powers,
how briefly lasts the crowning green of glory,
unless an age of darkness follows!
In painting Cimabue thought he held the field
but now it's Giotto has the cry,
so that the other's fame is dimmed.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Market ==
On 27 October 2019, ''[[Christ Mocked]]'', discovered the previous month in northern France, in the kitchen of an elderly French woman, sold for €24m (£20m; $26.6m) at auction, setting a new record. The sale price was four times the estimate. Acteon Auction House said the sum, paid by an anonymous buyer from northern France, was a new world record for a medieval painting sold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50201691|title=Masterpiece found in French kitchen fetches €24m|date=27 October 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
