'''Chipmunks''' are small, striped [[rodents]] of the family [[Sciuridae]]. Chipmunks are found in [[North America]], with the exception of the [[Siberian chipmunk]] which is found primarily in [[Asia]].

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Chipmunks may be classified either as a single genus, ''Tamias'', or as three genera: ''[[Tamias]]'', of which the [[eastern chipmunk]] (''T. striatus'') is the only living member; ''[[Eutamias]]'', of which the [[Siberian chipmunk]] (''E. sibiricus'') is the only living member; and ''[[Neotamias]]'', which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western, species. These classifications were treated as subgenera due to the chipmunks' morphological similarities.&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Mammalia |year=2016 |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=241–251 |title=Towards a uniform nomenclature for ground squirrels: the status of the Holarctic chipmunks |last=Patterson|first=Bruce D. |last2=Norris|first2=Ryan W. |doi=10.1515/mammalia-2015-0004 |url=https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/PattersonNorris.16.pdf |access-date=2019-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, most taxonomies over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks into a single genus. However, studies of [[mitochondrial DNA]] show that the divergence between each of the three chipmunk groups is comparable to the genetic dissimilarity between ''[[Marmot]]a'' and ''[[Spermophilus]]'',&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nmnhgoph.si.edu/msw/ | title = Mammal Species of the World | accessdate = 2007-06-27 | author = Wilson, D.

The common name originally may have been spelled &quot;chitmunk&quot;, from the native [[Ottawa language|Odawa]] (Ottawa) word ''jidmoonh'', meaning &quot;red squirrel&quot; (''cf.'' [[Anishinaabe language#Anishinaabemowin|Ojibwe]], ''ajidamoo'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=chipmunk |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, John D. and Earl Nyholm (1995).

Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest form cited in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (from 1842) is &quot;chipmonk&quot;, but &quot;chipmunk&quot; appears in several books from the 1820s and 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22chipmunk%22&amp;tbs=bks:1,cdr:1,cd_min:1800,cd_max:1834 |title=Google Books |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early forms include &quot;chipmuck&quot; and &quot;chipminck&quot;, and in the 1830s they were also referred to as &quot;chip squirrels&quot;, probably in reference to the sound they make. In the mid-1800s, [[John James Audubon]] and his sons included a lithograph of the chipmunk in their ''Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America'', calling it the &quot;chipping squirrel [or] hackee&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Audubon  | first1 = John James  | last2 = Bachman  | first2 = John  | title = Imperial Collection of Audubon Mammals  | publisher = Bonanza Books, a division of [[Crown Publishing Group]]  | year = 1967  | location = New York  | page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chipmunks have also been referred to as &quot;striped squirrels&quot;, &quot;timber tigers&quot;, &quot;minibears&quot;, and &quot;ground squirrels&quot; (although the name &quot;ground squirrel&quot; usually refers to other squirrels, such as those of the genus ''[[Spermophilus]]'').{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Diet==
[[File:Tamia striatus eating.jpg|thumb|left|An eastern chipmunk placing food in its cheek pouch]]
Chipmunks have an [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet primarily consisting of seeds, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] and other fruits, and [[bud]]s.&lt;ref name=hazard/&gt;&lt;ref name=WVDNR/&gt; They also commonly eat grass, shoots, and many other forms of plant matter, as well as [[fungi]], insects and other [[arthropod]]s, small frogs, worms, and bird eggs.

They mostly cache their foods in a larder in their burrows and remain in their nests until spring, unlike some other species which make many small caches of food.&lt;ref name=hazard/&gt; [[Cheek pouches]] allow chipmunks to carry food items to their burrows for either storage or consumption.&lt;ref name=WVDNR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvdnr.gov/Wildlife/Magazine/Archive/04Fall/Eastern_Chipmunk.shtm |title=West Virginia Wildlife Magazine: Wildlife Diversity Notebook.

These small mammals fulfill several important functions in [[forest]] [[ecosystem]]s. Their activities harvesting and hoarding tree seeds play a crucial role in [[seedling]] establishment. They consume many different kinds of [[fungi]], including those involved in [[Mycorrhiza|symbiotic mycorrhizal associations]] with trees, and are an important [[dispersal vector|vector for dispersal]] of the spores of subterranean [[Sporocarp (fungi)|sporocarps]] (truffles) which have co-evolved with these and other [[wikt:mycophagous|mycophagous]] mammals and thus lost the ability to disperse their spores through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Apostol | first = Dean  |author2=Marcia Sinclair | title = Restoring the Pacific Northwest: The Art and Science of Ecological Restoration in Cascadia | publisher = Island Press | year = 2006 | page =  112 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CsGyhzFBjyAC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=chipmunk+sporocarps| isbn  = 978-1-55963-078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification |date=April 2017|reason=The citation only discusses northern flying squirrels eating the truffles.

Chipmunks probably do eat truffles too, but this source does not say so.}}

Chipmunks construct extensive [[burrow]]s which can be more than {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length with several well-concealed entrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/aec/adks/mammals/chipmunk.htm | title=Eastern Chipmunk | publisher=Adirondack Ecological Center | work=Adirondack Mammals | date=1988 | accessdate=2015-09-19 | author=Saunders, D.

The eastern chipmunk [[hibernation|hibernates]] in the winter, while western chipmunks do not, relying on the stores in their burrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kays|first=R.

Chipmunks play an important role as prey for various predatory mammals and birds but are also opportunistic predators themselves, particularly with regard to bird eggs and [[nestling]]s, as in the case of [[eastern chipmunk]]s and [[mountain bluebird]]s (''Siala currucoides'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Janet|title=WILDLIFE SPECIES: Sialia currucoides|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/animals/bird/sicu/all.html|website=Fire Effects Information System, [Online]|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chipmunks typically live about three years although some have been observed living to nine years in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/information-chipmunks-56048.html |title=Information on Chipmunks |publisher=Essortment.com |date=1986-05-16 |accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chipmunks are [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. In captivity, they are said to sleep for an average of about 15 hours a day. It is thought that mammals which can sleep in hiding, such as rodents and bats, tend to sleep longer than those that must remain on alert.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;40 Winks?&quot; Jennifer S.
