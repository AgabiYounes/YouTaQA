'''Cytochromes''' are [[protein]]s containing [[heme]] as a [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]. They are classified according to the type of heme and its [[Chemical bond|mode of binding]]. Four varieties are recognized by the [[International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|IUBMB]], cytochromes a, cytochromes b, [[Cytochrome c family|cytochromes c]] and cytochrome d.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1992-01-05|title=Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB).

==History==
Cytochromes were initially described in 1884 by [[Charles Alexander MacMunn| MacMunn]] as respiratory pigments (myohematin or histohematin).&lt;ref name=MacMunn&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rstl.1886.0007 | jstor = 109482 | pages = 267–298 | author1 = Mac Munn, C. A | title = Researches on Myohaematin and the Histohaematins | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London | volume = 177 | year = 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, [[David Keilin|Keilin]] rediscovered these respiratory pigments and named them the cytochromes, or “cellular pigments”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keilin|first=D.|date=1925-08-01|title=On cytochrome, a respiratory pigment, common to animals, yeast, and higher plants|journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B|language=en|volume=98|issue=690|pages=312–339|doi=10.1098/rspb.1925.0039|issn=0950-1193}}&lt;/ref&gt; He classified these heme proteins on the basis of the position of their lowest [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|energy absorption band]] in their reduced state, as
cytochromes ''a'' (605&amp;nbsp;nm), ''b'' (≈565&amp;nbsp;nm), and ''c'' (550&amp;nbsp;nm). The ultra-violet (UV) to visible spectroscopic signatures of hemes are still used to identify heme type from the reduced bis-pyridine-ligated state, i.e., the pyridine hemochrome method. Within each class, cytochrome ''a'', ''b'', or ''c'', early cytochromes are numbered consecutively, e.g. cyt ''c'', cyt ''c&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and cyt ''c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', with more recent examples designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt ''c&lt;sub&gt;559&lt;/sub&gt;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14871137&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Reedy, C. J.  |author2=Gibney, B. R. | title = Heme protein assemblies | journal = Chem Rev | volume = 104 | issue = 2 | pages = 617–49 |date=February 2004 | pmid = 14871137 | doi = 10.1021/cr0206115 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and function==
The [[heme]] group is a highly conjugated ring system (which allows its [[electron]]s to be very mobile) surrounding an iron ion. The iron in cytochromes usually exists in a ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and a ferric (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) state with a ferroxo (Fe&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;)  state found in catalytic intermediates.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Cytochromes are, thus, capable of performing [[Electron transport chain|electron transfer reactions]] and [[catalysis]] by reduction or oxidation of their heme iron. The cellular location of cytochromes depends on their function. They can be found as [[globular protein]]s and [[membrane protein]]s.

In the process of [[dioxidative phosphorylation]], a globular [[Cytochrome c|cytochrome cc protein]] is involved in the electron transfer from the membrane-bound [[Coenzyme Q – cytochrome c reductase|complex III]] to [[Cytochrome c oxidase|complex IV]]. Complex II itself is composed of several subunits, one of which is a b-type cytochrome while another one is a c-type cytochrome. Both domains are involved in electron transfer within the complex. Complex IV contains a cytochrome a/a3-domain that transfers electrons and catalyzes the reaction of [[oxygen]] to water. Photosystem II, the first [[protein complex]] in the [[light-dependent reactions]] of oxygenic [[photosynthesis]], contains a cytochrome b subunit. [[Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2|Cyclooxygenase 2]], an enzyme involved in [[inflammation]], is a cytochrome b protein.

In the early 1960s, a linear [[Molecular evolution|evolution]] of cytochromes was suggested by [[Emanuel Margoliash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margoliash|first=E.|date=1963|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=50|issue=4|pages=672–679|issn=0027-8424|pmc=221244|pmid=14077496|doi=10.1073/pnas.50.4.672|title=Primary Structure and Evolution of Cytochrome C}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to the [[molecular clock]] hypothesis. The apparently constant evolution rate of cytochromes can be a helpful tool in trying to determine when various organisms may have diverged from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sudhir|date=2005|title=Molecular clocks: four decades of evolution|journal=Nature Reviews. Genetics|volume=6|issue=8|pages=654–662|doi=10.1038/nrg1659|issn=1471-0056|pmid=16136655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Several kinds of cytochrome exist and can be distinguished by [[spectroscopy]], exact structure of the heme group, inhibitor sensitivity, and reduction potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://intranet.tdmu.edu.ua/data/kafedra/internal/chemistry/classes_stud/en/med/lik/ptn/2/03.%20Investigation%20of%20biological%20oxidation,%20oxidative%20phosphorylation.htm|title=Investigation of biological oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis.

Four types of cytochromes are distinguished by their prosthetic groups:

There is no &quot;cytochrome e,&quot; but [[cytochrome f]], found in the [[Cytochrome b6f complex|cytochrome b&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;f complex]] of plants is a c-type cytochrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bendall |first=Derek S. |date=2004 |title=The Unfinished Story of Cytochrome f |journal=Photosynthesis Research |language=en |volume=80 |issue=1–3 |pages=265–276 |doi=10.1023/b:pres.0000030454.23940.f9 |issn=0166-8595 |pmid=16328825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, these cytochromes are often combined in [[Electron transfer chain|electron transport]] and related metabolic pathways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Doidge |first=Norman |date=2015 |title=The brain's way of healing : remarkable discoveries and recoveries from the frontiers of neuroplasticity |publisher=Penguin Group |page=173 |isbn=978-0-698-19143-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinct family of cytochromes is the [[cytochrome P450]] family, so named for the characteristic [[Soret peak]] formed by absorbance of light at wavelengths near 450&amp;nbsp;nm when the heme iron is reduced (with [[sodium dithionite]]) and complexed to [[carbon monoxide]]. These enzymes are primarily involved in [[steroidogenesis]] and [[detoxification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Miller|first=Walter L.|title=Disorders in the Initial Steps in Steroidogenesis|date=2014|work=Genetic Steroid Disorders|pages=145–164|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780124160064|last2=Gucev|first2=Zoran S.|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-416006-4.00011-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;
