'''Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ.lɛt|lang}}; 28 January 1873 – 3&amp;nbsp;August 1954), known [[Mononymous person|mononymously]] as '''Colette''', was a French author and woman of letters. She was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1948, and was also known as a [[Mime artist|mime]], actress, and journalist. Colette is best remembered for her 1944 novella ''[[Gigi (novella)|Gigi]]'' (1944), which was the basis for the [[Gigi (1958 film)|1958 film]] and the [[Gigi (musical)|1973 stage production]] of the same name.

==Life and career==
===Family and background===
Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette was born on 28 January 1873 to war hero and tax collector Jules-Joseph Colette and his wife Adèle Eugénie Sidonie (&quot;Sido&quot;), ''née'' Landoy, in the village of [[Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye]] in the department of [[Yonne]], [[Burgundy]]. Colette attended a public school from the ages of 6 to 17. The family was initially well off, but poor financial management substantially reduced the family's income.{{sfn |Tilburg |2008 |p=78}}{{sfn |Portuges |Jouve |1999 |p=79}}

===Early years, 1873–1912===
[[File:Colette and Mathilde “Missy” de Morny.jpg|thumb|Colette and Mathilde “Missy” de Morny]]
In 1893, Colette married [[Henry Gauthier-Villars]] (1859 – 1931), a well-known author and publisher who used the [[pen name]] &quot;Willy&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Book Tells Story of Colette's France&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/eye/people/book-tells-story-of-colettes-france-7264395?src=nl/wkEye/20140103 |title=Book Tells Story of Colette's France |publisher=WWD |date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2014 |author=Koski, Lorna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her first four novels – the four [[Claudine (book series)|Claudine stories:]] [[Claudine at School|''Claudine à l'école'']] (1900), ''Claudine à Paris'' (1901), ''Claudine en ménage'' (1902), and ''Claudine s'en va'' (1903) – appeared under his name. (The four are published in English as ''Claudine at School'', ''Claudine in Paris'', ''Claudine Married'', and ''Claudine and Annie''). The novels chart the coming of age and young adulthood of their titular heroine, Claudine, from an unconventional fifteen-year-old in a Burgundian village to a doyenne of the literary salons of turn-of-the-century Paris. The story they tell is semi-autobiographical, although Claudine, unlike Colette, is motherless.{{sfn |Southworth |2004 |pp=111–112}}{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=78}}

Colette later said that she would never have become a writer if it had not been for Willy.{{sfn |Ladimer |1999 |pp=51–53}}{{sfn |Portuges |Jouve |1994 |p=79}} Fourteen years older than his wife and one of the most notorious [[libertine]]s in Paris, he introduced his wife into avant-garde intellectual and artistic circles and encouraged her [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] alliances, and it was he who chose the titillating subject matter of the Claudine novels: &quot;the secondary myth of [[Sappho]]... the girls' school or convent ruled by a seductive female teacher&quot;, and &quot;locked her in her room until she produced enough pages to suit him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.autostraddle.com/8-fascinating-facts-about-bisexual-legend-colette-that-you-should-know-before-keira-knightlys-biopic-426889/ |title=8 Fascinating Facts About Bisexual Legend Colette That You Should Know Before Keira Knightly's Biopic |date=24 July 2018 |work=Autostraddle |access-date=31 July 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colette and Willy separated in 1906, although their divorce was not final until 1910. Colette had no access to the sizable earnings of the Claudine books – the copyright belonged to Willy – and until 1912 she initiated a stage career in music halls across France, sometimes playing Claudine in sketches from her own novels, earning barely enough to survive and often hungry and unwell. This period of her life is recalled in ''La Vagabonde'' (1910), which deals with women's independence in a male society, a theme to which she would regularly return in future works. During these years she embarked on a series of relationships with other women, notably with [[Mathilde de Morny|Mathilde de Morny, the Marquise de Belbeuf]] (&quot;Missy&quot;), with whom she sometimes shared the stage. On 3 January 1907, an onstage kiss between Missy and Colette in a pantomime entitled &quot;Rêve d'Égypte&quot; caused a near-riot, and as a result they were no longer able to live together openly, although their relationship continued for another five years.{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}}{{sfn |Rodriguez |2002 |p=131}}{{sfn |Benstock |1986 |pp=48–49}}

In 1912, Colette married [[Henry de Jouvenel]], the editor of ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]''. A daughter, [[Colette de Jouvenel]], nicknamed ''Bel-Gazou'', was born to them in 1913. During World War I Colette devoted herself to journalism.  The marriage allowed her to devote her time to writing.{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}}{{sfn |Portuges |Jouves |1994 |p=80}}{{sfn |Cottrell |1991 |p=262}}Around this point in time she became an avid amateur photographer.

===Writing career, 1920s and 1930s===
[[File:Jacques Humbert - Colette.jpg|thumb|Colette, painted c. 1896 by [[Jacques Humbert]]]]

In 1920 Colette published ''[[Chéri (novel)|Chéri]]'', portraying love between an older woman and a much younger man. Chéri is the lover of Léa, a wealthy [[courtesan]]; Léa is devastated when Chéri marries a girl his own age, and delighted when he returns to her, but after one final night together she sends him away again.{{sfn |Jouves |1987 |p=109–111}}

Colette's marriage to Jouvenel ended in divorce in 1924, due partly to his infidelities and partly to her affair with her 16-year-old stepson, [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]]. In 1925 she met Maurice Goudeket, who became her final husband; the couple stayed together until her death.{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}}{{sfn |Portuges |Jouves |1994 |p=80}}

Colette was by then an established writer (''The Vagabond'' had received three votes for the prestigious ''Prix Goncourt'').  The decades of the 1920s and 1930s were her most productive and innovative period.{{sfn|Ladimer|1999|p=57}} Set mostly in Burgundy or Paris during the [[Belle Époque]], her work focused on married life and sexuality. It was frequently quasi-autobiographical: ''[[Chéri (novel)|Chéri]]'' (1920) and ''Le Blé en Herbe'' (1923) both deal with love between an aging woman and a very young man, a situation reflecting her relationship with Bertrand de Jouvenel and with her third husband Goudeket, who was 16 years her junior.{{sfn|Portuges|Jouves|1994|p=80}}{{sfn|Flower|2013|p=145}} ''La Naissance du Jour'' (1928) is her explicit criticism of the conventional lives of women, expressed in a meditation on age and the renunciation of love by the character of her mother, Sido.{{sfn |Ladimer |1999 |p=57–58}}

By this time Colette was frequently acclaimed as France's greatest woman writer. &quot;It... has no plot, and yet tells of three lives all that should be known&quot;, wrote [[Janet Flanner]] of ''Sido'' (1929). &quot;Once again, and at greater length than usual, she has been hailed for her genius, humanities and perfect prose by those literary journals which years ago... lifted nothing at all in her direction except the finger of scorn.&quot;{{sfn |Flanner |1972 |p=70}}

===Last years, 1940–1954===
Colette was 67 years old when the Germans defeated and occupied France, and she remained in Paris, in her apartment in the [[Palais Royal]]. Her husband [[Maurice Goudeket]], who was Jewish, was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] in December 1941, and although he was released after a few months through the intervention of the French wife of the German ambassador, Colette lived through the rest of the war years with the anxiety of a possible second arrest.{{sfn|Portuges|Jouve|1994|pp=80–81}}{{sfn|Rosbottom|2014|p=unpaginated}} During the [[German occupation of France|Occupation]] she produced two volumes of memoirs, ''Journal à Rebours'' (1941) and ''De ma Fenêtre'' (1942; the two were issued in English in 1975 as ''Looking Backwards'').{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}} She wrote articles for several pro-Nazi newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v22/n06/terry-castle/yes-you-sweetheart |title=Terry Castle Reviews ''Secrets of the Flesh: A Life of Colette'' by Judith Thurman |date=16 March 2000 |work=London Review of Books |access-date=17 January 2019 |language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her novel ''Julie de Carneilhan'' (1941) contains many anti-Semitic slurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/07/colette-french-novelist-movie-keira-knightley |title=Wild, controversial and free: Colette, a life too big for film  |date=7 January 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=17 January 2019 |language=en-UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1944 Colette published what became perhaps her most famous work, ''[[Gigi (novella)|Gigi]]'', which tells the story of sixteen-year-old Gilberte (&quot;Gigi&quot;) Alvar. Born into a family of [[Demimonde|demimondaines]], Gigi is trained as a courtesan to captivate a wealthy lover, but defies the tradition by marrying him instead.{{sfn |Snodgrass |2015b |p=unpaginated}} In 1949 it was made into a French film starring [[Danièle Delorme]] and [[Gaby Morlay]], then in 1951 adapted for the stage with the then-unknown [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the title role, picked by Colette personally; the 1958 Hollywood musical movie, starring [[Leslie Caron]] and [[Louis Jourdan]], with a screenplay by [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and a score by Lerner and [[Frederick Loewe]], won the Academy Award for Best Picture.

In the postwar years, Colette became a famous public figure, crippled by arthritis and cared for by Goudeket, who supervised the preparation of her ''Œuvres Complètes'' (1948 – 1950). She continued to write during those years, bringing out ''L'Etoile Vesper'' (1944) and ''Le Fanal Bleu'' (1949), in which she reflected on the problems of a writer whose inspiration is primarily autobiographical. She was nominated by [[Claude Farrère]] for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=24 September 2018 |title=Sidonie Gabrielle Colette in the Nomination Database |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/redirector/?redir=archive/show_people.php&amp;id=1883 |website=The official website of the Nobel Prize - NobelPrize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon her death, on 3 August 1954, she was refused a religious funeral by the [[Catholic Church]] on account of her [[divorce]]s, but given a [[state funeral]], the first French [[Intellectual#Man_of_Letters|woman of letters]] to be granted the honour, and interred in [[Père-Lachaise]] cemetery.{{sfn |Portuges |Jouve |1994 |pp=80–81}}{{sfn |Rosbottom |2014 |p=unpaginated}}{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}}&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

==Legacy==
[[File:perelachaise-Colette-p1000342.jpg|thumb|Colette's tomb in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].]]
Colette was elected to the [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|Belgian Royal Academy]] (1935), the [[Edmond Louis Antoine Huot de Goncourt|Académie Goncourt]] (1945, and President in 1949), and a Chevalier (1920) and Grand Officer (1953) of the [[Légion d'honneur]].{{sfn |Cottrell |1991 |p=262}}

Colette's numerous biographers have proposed widely differing interpretations of her life and work over the decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/27/reviews/000227.27decourt.html |title=Claudine All Grown Up |website=archive.nytimes.com  |access-date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially considered a limited if talented novelist (despite the outspoken admiration in her lifetime of figures such as [[André Gide]] and [[Henry de Montherlant]]), she has been increasingly recognised as an important voice in women's writing.{{sfn |Flower |2013 |p=145}} Just before Colette's death, [[Katherine Anne Porter]] wrote in the ''New York Times'' that Colette &quot;is the greatest living French writer of fiction; and that she was while Gide and Proust still lived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/10/17/specials/colette-novels.html |title=A Most Lively Genius|website=archive.nytimes.com |access-date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer-songwriter [[Rosanne Cash]] paid tribute to the writer in the song, &quot;The Summer I Read Colette,&quot; on her 1996 album ''[[10 Song Demo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=POP MUSIC; Songwriters Who Followed Their Literary Muses |journal=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/07/books/pop-music-songwriters-who-followed-their-literary-muses.html |author=Dana Andrew Jennings |date=7 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Truman Capote]] wrote an essay about meeting her in 1970 called &quot;The White Rose.&quot; It tells how, when she saw him admiring a paperweight on a table (the &quot;white rose&quot; of the title), she insisted that he take it it; Capote initially refused the gift, but “…when I protested that I couldn’t accept as a present something she so clearly adored, [she replied] ‘My dear, really there is no point in giving a gift unless one also treasures it oneself.’” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Capote |first=Truman |date=2007 |title=Portraits and Observations: The Essays of Truman Capote |url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/23734/portraits-and-observations-by-truman-capote/9780812994391/ |publisher=Random House |page=368 |isbn=9780812994391 |author-link=Truman Capote}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&quot;Lucette Stranded on the Island&quot; by [[Julia Holter]], from her 2015 album ''[[Have You in My Wilderness]]'', is based on a minor character from Colette's short story ''Chance Acquaintances''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='There's Always A Piece Of Me': Julia Holter On Storytelling |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/442197547/theres-always-a-piece-of-me-julia-holter-on-storytelling |website=NPR.org |publisher=NPR |accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1991 film ''Becoming Colette'', Colette is played by the French actress [[Mathilda May]]. In the 2018 film ''[[Colette (2018 film)|Colette]]'', the title character is played by [[Keira Knightley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/22/colette-review-keira-knightley-is-on-top-form-in-exhilarating-literary-biopic |title=Colette review – Keira Knightley is on top form in exhilarating literary biopic |first=Jordan |last=Hoffman |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |access-date=27 January 2018 |date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both films focus on Colette's life in her twenties, her marriage to her first husband, and the publication of her first novels under his name.
