'''''Car Talk''''' is a  [[Talk radio|radio talk show]] that was broadcast weekly on [[NPR|National Public Radio]] (NPR) stations and elsewhere. Its subjects were automobiles and automotive repair, discussed often in a humorous way. It was hosted by brothers [[Tom and Ray Magliozzi]], known also as &quot;Click and Clack, the [[Tappet#Internal combustion engines|Tappet]] Brothers&quot;. The show won a [[Peabody Award]] in 1992.

The show was produced from 1977 to October 2012, when the Magliozzi brothers retired. Edited reruns (which are introduced as ''The Best of Car Talk'') continued to be available for weekly airing on NPR's national schedule&lt;ref name=Bauder&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jOCGFHXdRDFYjEtqQss6Z1jiCmtg?docId=a86195c0202f48b7962a89b1807dbd4f |title=NPR 'Car Talk' duo retiring; reruns to continue |first=David |last=Bauder |date=8 June 2012 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610175838/http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jOCGFHXdRDFYjEtqQss6Z1jiCmtg?docId=a86195c0202f48b7962a89b1807dbd4f |archivedate=2012-06-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Bauder | first=David | title=NPR 'Car Talk' duo retiring; reruns to continue | work=The Seattle Times | date=June 8, 2012 | url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/npr-car-talk-duo-retiring-reruns-to-continue/ | access-date=July 28, 2019 | agency=[[Associated Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; up through September 30, 2017, though some NPR affiliates have continued to broadcast reruns.

==Premise==
''Car Talk'' was presented in the form of a call-in radio show: listeners called in with questions related to motor vehicle maintenance and repair. Most of the advice sought was diagnostic, with callers describing symptoms and demonstrating sounds of an ailing vehicle while the Magliozzis made an attempt to identify the malfunction over the telephone and give advice on how to fix it. While the hosts peppered their call-in sessions with jokes directed at both the caller and at themselves, the Magliozzis were usually able to arrive at a diagnosis. However, when they were stumped, they attempted anyway with an answer they claimed was &quot;unencumbered by the thought process&quot;, the official motto of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.npr.org/wear/clothing/car-talk-unencumbered-latin-t-shirt |title=NPR Store Unencumbered by the thought process | publisher=[[NPR|National Public Radio]] (NPR) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912074149/http://shop.npr.org/wear/clothing/car-talk-unencumbered-latin-t-shirt |archivedate=September 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Car Talk'' [[theme music]] was &quot;Dawggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; by [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] artist [[David Grisman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/music-show-4|title=Music on the Show|date=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Call-in procedure===
Throughout the program, listeners were encouraged to dial the [[toll-free telephone number]], 1-888-CAR-TALK (1-888-227-8255), which connected to a 24-hour answering service. Although the approximately 2,000 queries received each week were screened by the ''Car Talk'' staff, the questions were unknown to the Magliozzis in advance as &quot;that would entail researching the right answer, which is what? ...&amp;nbsp;Work.&quot;&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/faq/faq-straight.html |title=Car Talk Official FAQs |publisher=Car Talk |accessdate=2007-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403211725/http://www.cartalk.com/content/faq/faq-straight.html#17 |archivedate=April 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}
The show originally consisted of two segments with a break in between but was changed to three segments. After the shift to the three-segment format, it became a running joke to refer to the last segment as &quot;the third half&quot; of the program.

The show opened with a short comedy segment, typically jokes sent in by listeners, followed by eight call-in sessions. The hosts ran a contest called the &quot;Puzzler&quot;, in which a riddle, sometimes car-related, was presented. The answer to the previous week's &quot;Puzzler&quot; was given at the beginning of the &quot;second half&quot; of the show, and a new &quot;Puzzler&quot; was given at the start of the &quot;third half&quot;. The hosts gave instructions to listeners to write answers addressed to &quot;Puzzler Tower&quot; on some non-existent or expensive object, such as a &quot;$26 bill&quot; or an advanced digital [[Single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] camera. This gag initially started as suggestions that the answers be written &quot;on the back of a $20 bill&quot;. A [[running gag]] concerned Tom's inability to remember the previous week's &quot;Puzzler&quot; without heavy prompting from Ray. For each puzzler, one correct answer was chosen at random, with the winner receiving a $26 gift certificate to the ''Car Talk'' store, referred to as the &quot;Shameless Commerce Division&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzler/ &quot;Puzzler&quot;], ''Car Talk'' website&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally $25, but was increased for inflation after a few years. Originally, the winner received a specific item from the store, but it soon changed to a gift certificate to allow the winner to choose the item they wanted (though Tom often made an item suggestion).

A recurring feature was &quot;Stump the Chumps,&quot; in which the hosts revisited a caller from a previous show to determine the accuracy and the effect, if any, of their advice. A similar feature began in May 2001, &quot;Where Are They Now, Tommy?&quot;  It began with a comical musical theme with a sputtering, backfiring car engine and a horn as a backdrop.  Tom then announced who the previous caller was, followed by a short replay of the essence of the previous call, preceded and followed by harp music often used in other audiovisual media to indicate recalling and returning from a dream.  The hosts then greeted the previous caller, confirmed that they had not spoken since their previous appearance and asked them if there had been any influences on the answer they were about to relate, such as arcane bribes by the NPR staff.  The repair story was then discussed, followed by a fanfare and applause if the Tappet Brothers' diagnosis was correct, or a wah-wah-wah music piece mixed with a car starter operated by a weak battery (an engine which wouldn't start) if the diagnosis was wrong.  The hosts then thanked the caller for their return appearance.

The brothers also had an official Animal-Vehicle Biologist and Wildlife Guru named Kieran Lindsey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.vt.edu/search/person.html?person=1376104 |title=Kieran Lindsey - People Search &amp;#124; Virginia Tech |work=Search.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09|quote=Kieran Jane Lindsey; Director, Natural Resources Distance Learning Corsortium, College of Natural Resources &amp; Env.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She answered questions like ''How do I remove a snake from my car?'' and offered advice on how those living in cities and suburbs could reconnect with wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://withgoodreasonradio.org/2011/10/girl-scouts-beyond-campfires-and-cookie/ |title=Girl Scouts: Beyond Campfires and Cookies |publisher=[[Virginia Foundation for the Humanities]] |date=October 29, 2011 |quote=Answering questions like how to remove a snake from your car, urban wildlife biologist Kieran Lindsey (Virginia Tech) is the new official Animal-Vehicle Biologist and Wildlife Guru for Car Talk on NPR. Lindsey offers tips for how those of us living in cities and suburbs can reconnect with the wildlife around us—what she calls &quot;next-door nature.&quot; |accessdate=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|famous_callers}} Celebrities were featured as &quot;callers&quot; as well, including [[Geena Davis]], [[Ashley Judd]], [[Morley Safer]], [[Gordon Elliott]], former Major League pitcher [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill Lee]], and astronaut [[John M. Grunsfeld]] calling from the [[Space Shuttle]]. There were numerous appearances from NPR personalities, including [[Bob Edwards]], [[Susan Stamberg]], [[Scott Simon]], [[Ray Suarez]], [[Will Shortz]], [[Sylvia Poggioli]], and commentator and author [[Daniel Pinkwater]]. On one occasion, the show featured [[Martha Stewart]] as an in-studio guest, whom the Magliozzis twice during the segment referred to as &quot;Margaret&quot;.

In addition to at least one on-orbit call, the Brothers once received a call asking advice on winterizing an electric car.  When they asked what kind of car, the caller stated it was a &quot;kit car&quot;, a $400 million &quot;kit car&quot;. It was a joke call from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] concerning the preparation of the [[Mars rover]] for the oncoming Martian winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Winter Driving Tips.

===Humor===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Humor and wisecracking pervaded the program. Tom and Ray are known for their [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating humor]], often joking about the supposedly poor quality of their advice and the show in general. They also commented at the end of each show: &quot;Well, it's happened again—you've wasted another perfectly good hour listening to ''Car Talk''.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At some point in almost every show, usually when giving the address for the Puzzler answers or fan mail, Ray mentioned [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] (where the show originated), at which point Tom reverently interjected with a tone of civic pride, &quot;Our fair city&quot;. Ray invariably mocked &quot;'Cambridge, MA', the United States Postal Service's two-letter abbreviation for 'Massachusetts&quot;', by pronouncing the &quot;MA&quot; as a word.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Preceding each break in the show, one of the hosts led up to the network identification with a humorous take on a disgusted reaction of some usually famous person to hearing that identification.  The full line went along the pattern of, for example, &quot;And even though [[Roger Clemens#SteroidUseControversy|Roger Clemens]] stabs his radio with a syringe whenever he hears ''us'' say it, this is NPR: National Public Radio&quot; (later just &quot;...&amp;nbsp;this is NPR&quot;).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

At one point in the show, often after the break, Ray usually stated that: &quot;Support for this show is provided by,&quot; followed by an absurd fundraiser.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The ending credits of the show started with thanks to the colorfully nicknamed actual staffers: producer Doug &quot;the subway fugitive, not a slave to fashion, bongo boy frogman&quot; Berman;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://o.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorials/2018445674_edit17talk.html| title=Tom and Ray, the Tappet Brothers, are exhausted| date=2012-06-16| newspaper=The Seattle Times| accessdate=2013-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;John 'Bugsy' Lawlor, just back from the&amp;nbsp;...&quot; every week a different eating event with rhyming foodstuff names; David &quot;Calves of Belleville&quot; Greene;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/music-show-0|title=Music on the Show |publisher=cartalk.com |accessdate=2012-03-24|date=2011-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine &quot;[[Young Frankenstein|Frau Blücher]]&quot; Fenollosa, whose name caused a horse to neigh and gallop (an allusion to a running gag in the movie ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/help-us-help-henry-2010-1 |title=Help Us Help Henry 2010 |publisher=cartalk.com |accessdate=2012-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713071358/http://www.cartalk.com/content/help-us-help-henry-2010-1 |archivedate=2012-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carly &quot;High Voltage&quot; Nix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/whos-real-high-voltage-car-talk-plaza |title=Who's the real &quot;High Voltage&quot; at Car Talk Plaza?| last= Nix |first= Carly| publisher= cartalk.com |accessdate=2012-03-31|date=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.  Following the real staff was a lengthy list of pun-filled fictional staffers and sponsors such as statistician Marge Innovera (&quot;[[margin of error]]&quot;), customer care representative Haywood Jabuzoff (&quot;Hey, would ya buzz off&quot;), meteorologist Claudio Vernight (&quot;cloudy overnight&quot;), optometric firm C.&amp;nbsp;F. Eye Care (&quot;see if I care&quot;), Russian chauffeur Picov Andropov (&quot;pick up and drop off&quot;), [[Leo Tolstoy]] biographer Warren Peace (&quot;[[War and Peace]]&quot;), hygiene officer and chief of the Tokyo office Oteka Shawa (&quot;oh, take a shower&quot;), Swedish snowboard instructor Soren Derkeister (&quot;sore in the keister&quot;), law firm [[Dewey, Cheatem &amp; Howe|Dewey, Cheetham &amp; Howe]] (&quot;Do we cheat 'em? And how!&quot;), Greek tailor Euripides Eumenades (&quot;You rip-a these, you mend-a these&quot;), cloakroom attendant Mahatma Coate (&quot;My hat, my coat&quot;), seat cushion tester Mike Easter (my keister) and many, many others, usually concluding with Erasmus B. Dragon (&quot;Her ass must be draggin'&quot;), whose job title varied, but who was often said to be head of the show's working mothers' support group.&lt;ref name=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/about/credits/credits.html | title=Car Talk Credits | publisher=Car Talk | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They sometimes advised that &quot;our chief counsel from the law firm of Dewey, Cheetham, &amp; Howe is Hugh Louis Dewey, known to a group of people in Harvard Square as Huey Louie Dewey.&quot;  [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey, Louie, and Dewey]] were the juvenile nephews being raised by [[Donald Duck]] in [[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]. Guest accommodations were provided by The Horseshoe Road Inn (&quot;the horse you rode in&quot;).

At the end of the show, Ray warns the audience, &quot;Don't drive like my brother!&quot; to which Tom replies, &quot;And don't drive like ''my'' brother!&quot;  The original tag line was &quot;Don't drive like a knucklehead!&quot;  There were variations such as, &quot;Don't drive like my brother&amp;nbsp;...&quot; &quot;And don't drive like his brother!&quot; and &quot;Don't drive like my sister&amp;nbsp;...&quot; &quot;And don't drive like ''my'' sister!&quot; The tagline was heard in the [[Pixar]] film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', in which Tom and Ray voiced [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] vehicles ([[List of Cars characters#Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze|Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze]], respectively a 1963 [[Dodge Dart]]  and 1963 [[Dodge A100]] van, as [[Lightning McQueen]]'s racing [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]]) with personalities similar to their own on-air personae.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0317219|Cars}}. Retrieved on June 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Tom notoriously once owned a &quot;convertible, green with large areas of rust!&quot; Dodge Dart, known jokingly on the program by the faux-elegant name &quot;Dartre&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cartalk.com/content/features/dart/ | title=1963 Dodge Dart test notes | publisher=Car Talk | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{expand section|date=August 2013}}
In 1977, radio station [[WBUR-FM]] in [[Boston]] scheduled a panel of local car mechanics to discuss car repairs on one of its programs, but only Tom Magliozzi showed up. He did so well that he was asked to return as a guest, and he invited his younger brother Ray (who was actually more of a car repair expert) to join him. The brothers were soon asked to host their own radio show on WBUR, which they continued to do every week. In 1986, NPR decided to distribute their show nationally.&lt;ref name=Lumsden&gt;{{cite news|title='Click and Clack': frick and frack gearheads|last=Lumsden|first=Carolyn|work=[[Daily Breeze]]|date=July 11, 1986|page=E19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;verge end&quot;/&gt;

In 1989, the brothers started a newspaper column ''Click and Clack Talk Cars'' which, like the radio show, mixed serious advice with humor. [[King Features]] distributes the column. Ray Magliozzi continued to write the column, retitled ''Car Talk'', after his brother's death in 2014, knowing he would have wanted the advice and humor to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kingfeatures.com/features/columns-a-z/click-and-clack-talk-cars/|title=Car Talk|publisher=[[King Features]]|accessdate=June 13, 2019|date=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, ''Car Talk'' won a [[List of Peabody Award winners (1990–99)#1992|Peabody Award]], saying &quot;Each week, master mechanics Tom and Ray Magliozzi provide useful information about preserving and protecting our cars. But the real core of this program is what it tells us about human mechanics&amp;nbsp;... The insight and laughter provided by Messrs. Magliozzi, in conjunction with their producer Doug Berman, provide a weekly mental tune-up for a vast and ever-growing public radio audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://peabodyawards.com/past-winners/award/?pbaward=999&amp;pb_search=1&amp;pb_title=&amp;pb_year=&amp;pb_porg=&amp;pb_query=car%20talk | title= Car Talk| year=1992| publisher= George Foster Peabody Awards| accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;verge end&quot;/&gt;

In May 2007, the program, which previously had been available digitally only as a paid subscription from [[Audible.com]], became a free [[podcast]] distributed by NPR, after a two-month test period where only a &quot;call of the week&quot; was available via podcast.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

As of 2012, it had 3.3 million listeners each week, on about 660 stations.&lt;ref name=Bauder /&gt; On June 8, 2012, the brothers announced that they would no longer broadcast new episodes as of October.  Executive producer Doug Berman said the best material from 25 years of past shows would be used to put together &quot;repurposed&quot; shows for NPR to broadcast. Berman estimated the archives contain enough for eight years' worth of material before anything would have to be repeated.&lt;ref name=Bauder /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/06/08/154576808/car-talk-guys-are-retiring-but-their-best-stuff-will-be-rebroadcast|title=Car Talk Guys Are Retiring, But Their Best Stuff Will Be Rebroadcast | publisher=[[NPR|National Public Radio]] (NPR)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray Magliozzi, however, would occasionally record new taglines and sponsor announcements that were aired at the end of the show.

The show was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radiohof.org/car_talk.htm |title=Car Talk |author= |date=2017 |publisher=National Radio Hall Of Fame |accessdate=January 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray Magliozzi hosted a special ''Car Talk'' memorial episode for his brother Tom after he died in November 2014. However, Ray continued to write their syndicated newspaper column, saying that his brother would want him to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kingfeatures.com/features/columns-a-z/click-and-clack-talk-cars/|title=Car Talk|publisher=[[King Features]]|accessdate=2016-03-03|date=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Best of Car Talk'' episodes ended their weekly broadcast on NPR on September 30, 2017, although past episodes would continue availability online and via podcasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;verge end&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rethink&gt;{{cite web|url=https://current.org/2017/09/best-of-car-talk-keeps-running-as-stations-rethink-weekends/|title='Best of Car Talk' keeps running as stations rethink weekends|last=Falk|first=Tyler|work=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]] |date=2017-09-26|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 120 of the 400 stations intended to continue airing the show.

Ray Magliozzi has a bachelor of science degree in humanities and science from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carpenter |first1=Susan |title=Hosts put the brakes on NPR's 'Car Talk' |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-xpm-2012-jun-09-la-et-0609-car-talk-20120609-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=5 September 2019 |date=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while Tom had a bachelor of science degree in economics from MIT, an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]]  from [[Northeastern University]], and a [[Doctor of Business Administration|DBA]] from the [[Boston University School of Management]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;mit news obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=Nancy |title=&quot;Car Talk&quot; host Tom Magliozzi ’58 left us laughing |url=https://news.mit.edu/2014/car-talk-host-tom-magliozzi-left-us-laughing-1105 |website=MIT News |accessdate=5 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magliozzis operated a do-it-yourself garage together in the 1970s which became more of a conventional repair shop in the 1980s. Ray continued to have a hand in the day-to-day operations of the shop for years, while his brother Tom semi-retired, often joking on ''Car Talk'' about his distaste for doing &quot;actual work&quot;. The show's offices were located near their shop at the corner of JFK Street and Brattle Street in [[Harvard Square]], marked as &quot;[[Dewey, Cheatem &amp; Howe|Dewey, Cheetham &amp; Howe]]&quot;, the imaginary law firm to which they referred on-air. DC&amp;H doubled as the business name of Tappet Brothers Associates, the corporation established to manage the business end of ''Car Talk''. Initially a joke, the company was incorporated after the show expanded from a single station to national syndication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Car Talk |url=https://www.cartalk.com/content/history-car-talk |website=Car Talk |accessdate=5 September 2019 |language=en |date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
