Cellulose is mainly used to produce [[paperboard]] and [[paper]]. Smaller quantities are converted into a wide variety of derivative products such as [[cellophane]] and [[rayon]]. Conversion of cellulose from [[energy crop]]s into [[biofuel]]s such as [[cellulosic ethanol]] is under development as a [[renewable fuel]] source. Cellulose for industrial use is mainly obtained from [[wood pulp]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Klemm&quot;/&gt;

Some animals, particularly [[ruminant]]s and [[termite]]s, can [[digestion|digest]] cellulose with the help of [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] micro-organisms that live in their guts, such as ''[[Trichonympha]]''. In [[human nutrition]], cellulose is a non-digestible constituent of [[insoluble]] [[dietary fiber]], acting as a [[hydrophilic]] [[bulking agent]] for [[feces]] and potentially aiding in [[defecation]].

== History ==

Cellulose was discovered in 1838 by the French chemist [[Anselme Payen]], who isolated it from plant matter and determined its chemical formula.&lt;ref name=Crawford /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Payen, A. (1838) &quot;Mémoire sur la composition du tissu propre des plantes et du ligneux&quot; (Memoir on the composition of the tissue of plants and of woody [material]), ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 7, pp. 1052–1056. Payen added appendices to this paper on December 24, 1838 (see: ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 8, p. 169 (1839)) and on February 4, 1839 (see: ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 9, p. 149 (1839)). A committee of the French Academy of Sciences reviewed Payen's findings in : Jean-Baptiste Dumas (1839) &quot;Rapport sur un mémoire de M. Payen, relatif à la composition de la matière ligneuse&quot; (Report on a memoir of Mr. Payen, regarding the composition of woody matter), ''Comptes rendus'', vol. 8, pp. 51–53. In this report, the word &quot;cellulose&quot; is coined and author points out the similarity between the empirical formula of cellulose and that of &quot;dextrine&quot; (starch). The above articles are reprinted in: Brongniart and Guillemin, eds., ''Annales des sciences naturelles'' ..., 2nd series, vol. 11 (Paris, France: Crochard et Cie., 1839), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VDRsFWwgUo4C&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21 pp. 21–31].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Production of [[rayon]] (&quot;artificial [[silk]]&quot;) from cellulose began in the 1890s and [[cellophane]] was invented in 1912. [[Hermann Staudinger]] determined the polymer structure of cellulose in 1920. The compound was first chemically synthesized (without the use of any biologically derived [[enzyme]]s) in 1992, by Kobayashi and Shoda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kobayashi|first=Shiro|author2=Kashiwa, Keita |author3=Shimada, Junji |author4=Kawasaki, Tatsuya |author5= Shoda, Shin-ichiro |title=Enzymatic polymerization: The first in vitro synthesis of cellulose via nonbiosynthetic path catalyzed by cellulase|journal=Makromolekulare Chemie.

It was shown to melt at 467&amp;nbsp;°C in pulse tests made by Dauenhauer ''et al.''

Cellulose is derived from [[Glucose|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]] units, which [[condensation reaction|condense]] through β(1→4)-[[glycosidic bond]]s. This linkage motif contrasts with that for α(1→4)-glycosidic bonds present in [[starch]] and [[glycogen]]. Cellulose is a straight chain polymer. Unlike starch, no coiling or branching occurs and the molecule adopts an extended and rather stiff rod-like conformation, aided by the equatorial conformation of the glucose residues. The multiple [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl groups]] on the glucose from one chain form [[hydrogen bond]]s with oxygen atoms on the same or on a neighbor chain, holding the chains firmly together side-by-side and forming ''microfibrils'' with high [[tensile strength]]. This confers tensile strength in [[cell wall]]s where cellulose microfibrils are meshed into a polysaccharide ''matrix''. The high tensile strength of plant stems and of the tree wood also arises from the arrangement of cellulose fibers intimately distributed into the [[lignin]] matrix. The mechanical role of cellulose fibers in the wood matrix responsible for its strong structural resistance, can somewhat be compared to that of the [[reinforcement bar]]s in [[concrete]], [[lignin]] playing here the role of the [[cement|hardened cement paste]] acting as the &quot;glue&quot; in between the cellulose fibers.

[[File:Cellulose spacefilling model.jpg|thumb|A triple strand of cellulose showing the [[hydrogen bond]]s (cyan lines) between glucose strands]]
[[File:Cotton.JPG|thumb|[[Cotton]] fibres represent the purest natural form of cellulose, containing more than 90% of this [[polysaccharide]].]]
Compared to starch, cellulose is also much more [[crystallinity|crystalline]]. Whereas starch undergoes a crystalline to [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] transition when heated beyond 60–70&amp;nbsp;°C in water (as in cooking), cellulose requires a temperature of 320&amp;nbsp;°C and pressure of 25 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]] to become amorphous in water.&lt;ref name=Deguchi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deguchi|first1=Shigeru|last2=Tsujii|first2=Kaoru|last3=Horikoshi|first3=Koki|title=Cooking cellulose in hot and compressed water|journal=Chemical Communications|year=2006|doi=10.1039/b605812d|pmid=16883414|issue=31|pages=3293–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several different crystalline structures of cellulose are known, corresponding to the location of hydrogen bonds between and within strands. Natural cellulose is cellulose I, with structures I&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;. Cellulose produced by bacteria and algae is enriched in I&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; while cellulose of higher plants consists mainly of I&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;. Cellulose in [[regenerated cellulose]] fibers is cellulose II. The conversion of cellulose I to cellulose II is irreversible, suggesting that cellulose I is [[Metastability|metastable]] and cellulose II is stable. With various chemical treatments it is possible to produce the structures cellulose III and cellulose IV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/glyco3d/lessons/cellulose/index.html Structure and morphology of cellulose] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426122947/http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/glyco3d/lessons/cellulose/index.html |date=April 26, 2009 }} by Serge Pérez and William Mackie, CERMAV-[[CNRS]], 2001. Chapter IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many properties of cellulose depend on its chain length or [[degree of polymerization]], the number of glucose units that make up one polymer molecule. Cellulose from wood pulp has typical chain lengths between 300 and 1700 units; cotton and other plant fibers as well as bacterial cellulose have chain lengths ranging from 800 to 10,000 units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klemm&quot;/&gt;  Molecules with very small chain length resulting from the breakdown of cellulose are known as [[cellodextrin]]s; in contrast to long-chain cellulose, cellodextrins are typically soluble in water and organic solvents.

Cellulose contains 44.44% carbon, 6.17% hydrogen, and 49.39% oxygen. The chemical formula of cellulose is (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)n where n is the degree  of polymerization and represents the number of glucose groups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789400768970-c2.pdf Chapter 2: Chemical Composition and Structure of Natural Lignocellulose]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant-derived cellulose is usually found in a mixture with [[hemicellulose]], [[lignin]], [[pectin]] and other substances, while [[bacterial cellulose]] is quite pure, has a much higher water content and higher tensile strength due to higher chain lengths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klemm&quot;/&gt;{{rp|3384}}

Cellulose is soluble in [[Schweizer's reagent]], [[cupriethylenediamine]] (CED), [[cadmiumethylenediamine]] (Cadoxen), [[N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide|''N''-methylmorpholine ''N''-oxide]], and [[lithium chloride]] / [[dimethylacetamide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stenius |first1= Per |title= Forest Products Chemistry |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume=Vol. 3 |year= 2000 |publisher= Fapet OY |location= Finland |isbn= 978-952-5216-03-5 |page= 35 |chapter=Ch. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is used in the production of regenerated celluloses (such as [[viscose]] and [[cellophane]]) from [[dissolving pulp]]. Cellulose is also soluble in many kinds of [[ionic liquids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Ionic liquid processing of cellulose|journal=Chemical Society Reviews |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=1519–37 |doi=10.1039/C2CS15311D |pmid=22266483 |year=2012 |last1=Wang |first1=Hui |last2=Gurau |first2=Gabriela |last3=Rogers |first3=Robin D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellulose consists of [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous solid|amorphous]] regions. By treating it with strong acid, the amorphous regions can be broken up, thereby producing [[nanocellulose|nanocrystalline cellulose]], a novel material with many desirable properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Chemistry and applications of nanocrystalline cellulose and its derivatives: A nanotechnology perspective|journal=The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering|volume=89|issue=5|pages=1191–1206|url=http://www.arboranano.ca/pdfs/Chemistry%20and%20applications%20of%20nanocrystalline%20cellulose%20and%20its%20derivatives%20A%20nanotechnology%20perspective-2011.pdf|author=Peng, B.

==Processing==

=== Assay ===

Given a cellulose-containing material, the carbohydrate portion that does not dissolve in a 17.5% solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C is ''α cellulose'', which is true cellulose.{{Clarify|date=May 2013}} Acidification of the extract precipitates ''β cellulose''. The portion that dissolves in base but does not precipitate with acid is ''γ cellulose''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Cellulose can be [[assay]]ed using a method described by Updegraff (1969),&lt;ref name=&quot;Updegraff_1969&quot;/&gt; where the fiber is dissolved in [[acetic acid|acetic]] and [[nitric acid]] to remove [[lignin]], [[hemicellulose]], and [[xylosan]]s. The resulting cellulose is allowed to react with [[anthrone]] in [[sulfuric acid]]. The resulting coloured compound is assayed [[spectrophotometry|spectrophotometrically]] at a wavelength of approximately 635 [[1 E-9 m|nm]].

In addition, cellulose can be represented by the difference between acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raffrenato|first=E.|last2=Van Amburgh|first2=M. E.|date=July 2011|title=Technical note: improved methodology for analyses of acid detergent fiber and acid detergent lignin|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|volume=94|issue=7|pages=3613–3617|doi=10.3168/jds.2010-3701|issn=1525-3198|pmid=21700050}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/acid-detergent-fiber|title=Acid Detergent Fiber - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2019-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luminescent conjugated oligo[[thiophene]]s can also be used to detect cellulose using [[fluorescence microscopy]] or [[Spectrofluorimetry|spectrofluorometric]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choong|first1=Ferdinand X.|last2=Bäck|first2=Marcus|last3=Steiner|first3=Svava E.|last4=Melican|first4=Keira|last5=Nilsson|first5=K.

=== Biosynthesis ===

In [[Viridiplantae|plant]]s cellulose is synthesized at the [[plasma membrane]] by rosette terminal complexes (RTCs). The RTCs are [[oligomer|hexameric]] protein structures, approximately 25 [[nanometre|nm]] in diameter, that contain the [[cellulose synthase (UDP-forming)|cellulose synthase]] enzymes that synthesise the individual cellulose chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3871010|last1=Kimura|first1=S|last2=Laosinchai|first2=W|last3=Itoh|first3=T|last4=Cui|first4=X|last5=Linder|first5=CR|last6=Brown Jr|first6=RM|title=Immunogold labeling of rosette terminal cellulose-synthesizing complexes in the vascular plant vigna angularis|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=11|issue=11|pages=2075–86|year=1999|pmid=10559435|pmc=144118|jstor=3871010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each RTC floats in the cell's plasma membrane and &quot;spins&quot; a microfibril into the [[cell wall]].

RTCs contain at least three different [[cellulose synthase]]s, encoded by ''CesA'' (''Ces'' is short for &quot;cellulose synthase&quot;) genes, in an unknown [[stoichiometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=N. G.|title=Interactions among three distinct CesA proteins essential for cellulose synthesis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=100|pages=1450–1455|year=2003|doi=10.1073/pnas.0337628100|issue=3|pmid=12538856|pmc=298793|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.1450T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate sets of ''CesA'' genes are involved in primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis.  There are known to be about seven subfamilies in the plant ''CesA'' superfamily, some of which include the more cryptic, tentatively-named ''Csl'' (cellulose synthase-like) enzymes.  These cellulose syntheses use UDP-glucose to form the β(1→4)-linked cellulose.&lt;ref name=richmond2000&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richmond|first1=Todd A|last2=Somerville|first2=Chris R|title=The Cellulose Synthase Superfamily|journal=Plant Physiology|date=October 2000|volume=124|issue=2|pages=495–498|doi=10.1104/pp.124.2.495|pmid=11027699|pmc=1539280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bacterial cellulose]] is produced using the same family of proteins, although the gene is called ''BcsA'' for &quot;bacterial cellulose synthase&quot; or ''CelA'' for &quot;cellulose&quot; in many instances.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24127606&quot;/&gt; In fact, plants acquired ''CesA'' from the endosymbiosis event that produced the [[chloroplast]].&lt;ref name=popper&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Popper ZA, Michel G, Hervé C, Domozych DS, Willats WG, Tuohy MG, Kloareg B, Stengel DB | display-authors = 6 | title = Evolution and diversity of plant cell walls: from algae to flowering plants | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 62 | pages = 567–90 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21351878 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-arplant-042110-103809 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed34/8d1ba67a0e3091d6a2776e1fcd60ae043da0.pdf | hdl = 10379/6762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All cellulose synthases known belongs to [[glucosyltransferase]] family 2 (GT2).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24127606&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Omadjela |first1=O |last2=Narahari |first2=A |last3=Strumillo |first3=J |last4=Mélida |first4=H |last5=Mazur |first5=O |last6=Bulone |first6=V |last7=Zimmer |first7=J |title=BcsA and BcsB form the catalytically active core of bacterial cellulose synthase sufficient for in vitro cellulose synthesis. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=29 October 2013 |volume=110 |issue=44 |pages=17856–61 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1314063110 |pmid=24127606 |pmc=3816479 |doi-access=free|bibcode=2013PNAS..11017856O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellulose synthesis requires chain initiation and elongation, and the two processes are separate.
Cellulose synthase (''CesA'') initiates cellulose polymerization using a [[steroid]] primer, [[beta-sitosterol|sitosterol]]-beta-[[glucoside]], and UDP-glucose. It then utilizes [[Uridine diphosphate|UDP]]-D-glucose precursors to elongate the growing cellulose chain. A [[cellulase]] may function to cleave the primer from the mature chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peng|first1=L|last2=Kawagoe|first2=Y|last3=Hogan|first3=P|last4=Delmer|first4=D|title=Sitosterol-beta-glucoside as primer for cellulose synthesis in plants|journal=Science|volume=295|issue=5552|pages=147–50|year=2002|pmid=11778054|doi=10.1126/science.1064281|bibcode=2002Sci...295..147P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellulose is also synthesised by [[tunicate]] animals, particularly in the [[test (biology)|test]]s of [[ascidian]]s (where the cellulose was historically termed &quot;tunicine&quot; (tunicin)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Endean, R|url=http://jcs.biologists.org/content/s3-102/57/107.full.pdf |title=The Test of the Ascidian, ''Phallusia mammillata''|journal= Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science|volume=102|issue=1|pages=107–117|year= 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Breakdown (cellulolysis) ===

Cellulolysis is the process of breaking down cellulose into smaller polysaccharides called [[cellodextrin]]s or completely into [[glucose]] units; this is a [[hydrolysis]] reaction. Because cellulose molecules bind strongly to each other, cellulolysis is relatively difficult compared to the breakdown of other [[polysaccharide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2014|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.118200|author1=Barkalow, David G.  |author2=Whistler, Roy L.|title=Cellulose|journal=AccessScience}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this process can be significantly intensified in a proper [[solvent]], e.g. in an [[ionic liquid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Synthesis of glucose esters from cellulose in ionic liquids&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ignatyev|first=Igor|author2=Doorslaer, Charlie Van |author3=Mertens, Pascal G.N. |author4=Binnemans, Koen |author5=Vos, Dirk.

Most mammals have limited ability to digest dietary fiber such as cellulose. Some [[ruminant]]s like cows and sheep contain certain [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria (such as ''[[Cellulomonas]]'' and ''[[Ruminococcus]]'' [[species|spp.]]) in the flora of the [[rumen]], and these bacteria produce [[enzyme]]s called [[cellulase]]s that help the microorganism to digest cellulose; the breakdown products are then used by the bacteria for proliferation.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Ruminococci: key symbionts of the gut ecosystem|journal = Journal of Microbiology|date = 2018|issn =|pages = 199–208| volume = 56 | issue = 3 |pmid =29492877|doi =10.1007/s12275-018-8024-4|first = A.J.|last = La Reau|first2 = G.|last2 = Suen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bacterial mass is later digested by the ruminant in its [[digestive system]] ([[stomach]] and [[small intestine]]). Horses use cellulose in their diet by [[hindgut fermentation|fermentation in their hindgut]] via symbiotic bacteria which produce [[cellulase]] to digest cellulose.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Similarly, some [[termite]]s contain in their [[hindgut]]s certain [[flagellate]] [[protozoa]] producing such enzymes, whereas others contain bacteria or may produce cellulase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hidden cellulases in termites: revision of an old hypothesis|journal=Biology Letters|volume=3|pages=336–339|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0073|date=22 June 2007|author8=Tokuda, Gaku and Hirofumi Watanabe|issue=3|pmid=17374589|last1=Tokuda|first1=G|last2=Watanabe|first2=H|pmc=2464699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enzymes used to [[wikt:cleave|cleave]] the [[glycosidic linkage]] in cellulose are [[glycoside hydrolase]]s including endo-acting [[cellulase]]s and exo-acting [[glucosidase]]s. Such enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include [[dockerin]]s and [[carbohydrate-binding module]]s.&lt;ref name=Bras&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Breakdown (thermolysis) ===

Semi-crystalline cellulose polymers react at pyrolysis temperatures (350–600&amp;nbsp;°C) in a few seconds; this transformation has been shown to occur via a solid-to-liquid-to-vapor transition, with the liquid (called ''intermediate liquid cellulose'' or ''molten cellulose'') existing for only a fraction of a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/B915068B  |title=Reactive Boiling of Cellulose for Integrated Catalysis through an Intermediate Liquid|journal=Green Chemistry|volume=11|issue=10|pages=1555|year=2009|last1=Dauenhauer|first1=Paul J.|last2=Colby|first2=Joshua L.|last3=Balonek|first3=Christine M.|last4=Suszynski|first4=Wieslaw J.|last5=Schmidt|first5=Lanny D.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2faf66b681797b9f46b6d293cedf4dcfb9e8dae0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glycosidic bond cleavage produces short cellulose chains of two-to-seven [[monomers]] comprising the melt.

== Hemicellulose ==
{{Main|Hemicellulose}}
[[Hemicellulose]]s are [[polysaccharide]]s related to cellulose that comprise about 20% of the biomass of [[embryophyte|land plants]]. In contrast to cellulose, hemicelluloses are derived from several sugars in addition to [[glucose]], especially [[xylose]] but also including [[mannose]], [[galactose]], [[rhamnose]], and [[arabinose]]. Hemicelluloses consist of shorter chains&amp;nbsp;– between 500 and 3000  sugar units.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22874093&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gibson LJ | title=The hierarchical structure and mechanics of plant materials | journal= [[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=9 | issue=76 | year=2013 | pages=2749–2766 | pmc=3479918 | pmid=22874093 | doi=10.1098/rsif.2012.0341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, hemicelluloses are branched, whereas cellulose is unbranched.

== Derivatives ==

The [[hydroxyl]] groups (-OH) of cellulose can be partially or fully reacted with various [[reagent]]s to afford derivatives with useful properties like mainly cellulose [[ester]]s and cellulose [[ether]]s (-OR). In principle, though not always in current industrial practice, cellulosic polymers are renewable resources.

Cellulose for industrial use is mainly obtained from [[wood pulp]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Klemm&quot;/&gt; The [[kraft process]] is used to separate cellulose from [[lignin]], another major component of plant matter.

* Paper products: Cellulose is the major constituent of [[paper]], [[paperboard]], and [[card stock]].
* Fibers: Cellulose is the main ingredient of [[textile]]s made from [[cotton]], [[linen]], and other [[plant fiber]]s. It can be turned into [[rayon]], an important fiber that has been used for textiles since the beginning of the 20th century. Both [[cellophane]] and rayon are known as &quot;regenerated [[cellulose fiber]]s&quot;; they are identical to cellulose in chemical structure and are usually made from [[dissolving pulp]] via [[viscose]]. A more recent and environmentally friendly method to produce a form of rayon is the [[Lyocell]] process.
* Consumables: [[Microcrystalline cellulose]] ([[E number|E460i]]) and powdered cellulose (E460ii) are used as inactive [[Excipient#Fillers and diluents|fillers]] in drug tablets&lt;ref&gt;
