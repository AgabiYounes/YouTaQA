Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of [[seizure disorders]] and [[neuropathic pain]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; It is used [[off-label use|off-label]] as a second-line treatment for bipolar disorder and in combination with an [[antipsychotic]] in some cases of [[schizophrenia]] when treatment with a conventional antipsychotic alone has failed.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceron-Litvoc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ceron-Litvoc D, Soares BG, Geddes J, Litvoc J, de Lima MS | title = Comparison of carbamazepine and lithium in treatment of bipolar disorder: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials | journal = Human Psychopharmacology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–28 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19053079 | doi = 10.1002/hup.990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not effective for [[absence seizure]]s or [[myoclonic seizure]]s.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt; Although carbamazepine may have a similar effectiveness (people continue on medication) and efficacy (medicine reduces seizure recurrence and improves remission) when compared to phenytoin and valproate the choice of medications should be considered for each person individually as further research is needed to determine which medication is most helpful for people with newly-onset seizures.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved medical uses are [[epilepsy]] (including [[partial seizure]]s, generalized [[tonic-clonic seizure]]s and [[mixed seizure]]s), [[trigeminal neuralgia]], and [[mania|manic]] and [[mixed state (psychiatry)|mixed episodes]] of [[bipolar I disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lexi-Comp&quot;/&gt;

As of 2014, a [[controlled release]] formulation was available for which there is tentative evidence showing fewer side effects and unclear evidence with regard to whether there is a difference in efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Powell G, Saunders M, Rigby A, Marson AG | title = Immediate-release versus controlled-release carbamazepine in the treatment of epilepsy | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD007124 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27933615 | pmc = 6463840 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007124.pub5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adverse effects==

In the US, the label for carbamazepine contains warnings concerning:
* effects on the [[Hematology|body's production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets]]:  rarely, there are major effects of [[aplastic anemia]] and [[agranulocytosis]] reported and more commonly, there are minor changes such as decreased [[Leukocyte|white blood cell]] or [[platelet]] counts, but these do not progress to more serious problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;carbamazepinelabel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbamazepine Drug Label|url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=7a1e523a-b377-43dc-b231-7591c4c888ea|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208063739/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=7a1e523a-b377-43dc-b231-7591c4c888ea|archive-date=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacogenetics===
Serious skin reactions such as [[Stevens–Johnson syndrome]] or [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] due to carbamazepine therapy are more common in people with a particular [[human leukocyte antigen]] allele, [[HLA-B75|HLA-B*1502]].&lt;ref name=&quot;carbamazepinelabel&quot;/&gt; [[Odds ratio]]s for the development of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or [[toxic epidermal necrolysis]] in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaniwa N, Saito Y | title = Pharmacogenomics of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and drug-induced liver injury | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 58 | issue = 6 | pages = 317–26 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23635947 | doi = 10.1038/jhg.2013.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24597466&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Amstutz U, Shear NH, Rieder MJ, Hwang S, Fung V, Nakamura H, Connolly MB, Ito S, Carleton BC | title = Recommendations for HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-A*31:01 genetic testing to reduce the risk of carbamazepine-induced hypersensitivity reactions | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | pages = 496–506 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24597466 | doi = 10.1111/epi.12564 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HLA-B75|HLA-B*1502]] occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;carbamazepinelabel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leckband SG, Kelsoe JR, Dunnenberger HM, George AL, Tran E, Berger R, Müller DJ, Whirl-Carrillo M, Caudle KE, Pirmohamed M | title = Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines for HLA-B genotype and carbamazepine dosing | journal = Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 324–8 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23695185 | pmc = 3748365 | doi = 10.1038/clpt.2013.103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele has been shown to be a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions, such as the [[DRESS syndrome]] form of severe cutaneous reactions, to carbamazepine among Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Europeans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24597466&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid28345177&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garon SL, Pavlos RK, White KD, Brown NJ, Stone CA, Phillips EJ | title = Pharmacogenomics of off-target adverse drug reactions | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 83 | issue = 9 | pages = 1896–1911 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28345177 | pmc = 5555876 | doi = 10.1111/bcp.13294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacokinetics==
Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but well absorbed after oral administration. Its plasma half-life is about 30 hours when it is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes and the plasma half-life shortens to about 15 hours when it is given repeatedly. {{mcn|date=December 2014}}

Carbamazepine is a [[sodium channel blocker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogawski MA, Löscher W, Rho JM | title = Mechanisms of Action of Antiseizure Drugs and the Ketogenic Diet | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = a022780 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26801895 | pmc = 4852797 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a022780 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It binds preferentially to voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive conformation, which prevents repetitive and sustained firing of an action potential.  Carbamazepine has effects on serotonin systems but the relevance to its antiseizure effects is uncertain. There is evidence that it is a [[serotonin releasing agent]] and possibly even a [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dailey JW, Reith ME, Steidley KR, Milbrandt JC, Jobe PC | title = Carbamazepine-induced release of serotonin from rat hippocampus in vitro | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 1054–63 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9776325 | doi = 10.1111/j.1528-1157.1998.tb01290.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dailey JW, Reith ME, Yan QS, Li MY, Jobe PC | title = Carbamazepine increases extracellular serotonin concentration: lack of antagonism by tetrodotoxin or zero Ca2+ | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 328 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 153–62 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9218697 | doi = 10.1016/s0014-2999(97)83041-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kawata Y, Okada M, Murakami T, Kamata A, Zhu G, Kaneko S | title = Pharmacological discrimination between effects of carbamazepine on hippocampal basal, Ca(2+)- and K(+)-evoked serotonin release | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 557–67 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11399673 | pmc = 1572811 | doi = 10.1038/sj.bjp.0704104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of [[Novartis]]) in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], in 1953.&lt;ref name=Scott1993&gt;D.F. Scott. &quot;Carbamazepine&quot;. Chapter 8 in The History of Epileptic Therapy: An Account of How Medication was Developed.  History of Medicine Series. CRC Press, 1993 {{ISBN|9781850703914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schindler W, Häfliger F |title=Über Derivate des Iminodibenzyls |journal=[[Helvetica Chimica Acta]] |year=1954 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=472–83 |doi=10.1002/hlca.19540370211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first marketed as a  drug to treat epilepsy in [[Switzerland]] in 1963 under the brand name &quot;Tegretol&quot;; its use for [[trigeminal neuralgia]] (formerly known as tic douloureux) was introduced at the same time.&lt;ref name=Scott1993/&gt; It has been used as an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] since 1965, and has been approved in the [[United States|US]] since 1968.&lt;ref name=AHFS2015/&gt;

In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka first used carbamazepine to control mania in patients refractory to antipsychotics ([[Lithium pharmacology|lithium]] was not available in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, did the same thing with success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the antiaggression effects of this drug. Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9682927&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Okuma T, Kishimoto A | title = A history of investigation on the mood stabilizing effect of carbamazepine in Japan | journal = Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 52 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–12 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9682927 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1819.1998.tb00966.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
