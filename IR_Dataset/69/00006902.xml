It lies across the boundaries of several English counties; mainly [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Oxfordshire]], and parts of [[Wiltshire]], [[Somerset]], [[Worcestershire]] and [[Warwickshire]].  The highest point of the region is [[Cleeve Hill, Gloucestershire|Cleeve Hill]] at {{convert|1083|ft|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?rf=2869|title=Hill Bagging: Cleeve Hill|publisher=Hill Bagging: the online version of the Database of British and Irish Hills|accessdate=14 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716025623/http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?rf=2869|archivedate=16 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; just east of [[Cheltenham]].

The hills give their name to the [[Cotswold District|Cotswold]] local-government district, formed on 1 April 1974, which administers over half of the area. Most of the District is in the county of [[Gloucestershire]]; some 80% of it is within the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The main town is [[Cirencester]] and the [[Cotswold District Council]] offices are located in that community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswold.gov.uk/about-the-council/|title=Cotswold District Council - About the Council|website=www.cotswold.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the {{convert|450|sqmi|adj=on}} District was about 83,000 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswold.gov.uk/guide-to-the-council/cotswold-factfile/|title=Cotswold District Council - Cotswold factfile|website=www.cotswold.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswold.gov.uk/media/240336/Census2011-who-we-are.pdf |title=Census data |date=2011 |website=www.cotswold.gov.uk |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The much larger area referred to as the Cotswolds encompasses nearly {{convert|800|sqmi}},&lt;ref name=&quot;cotswolds.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswolds.com/|title=Cotswolds.com - The Official Cotswolds Tourist Information Site|website=www.cotswolds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; over five counties: Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Wiltshire, and Worcestershire.&lt;ref name=&quot;butterfield.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.butterfield.com/blog/2017/08/14/deep-idyllic-england-cotswolds/|title=In Deep: Idyllic England in the Cotswolds - Butterfield &amp; Robinson|date=14 August 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty was 139,000 in 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotswoldsaonb.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NEW-FACT-SHEET-6-v1.pdf |title=Fact sheet |date=2017 |website=www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There is evidence of [[Neolithic]] settlement from burial chambers on Cotswold Edge, and there are remains of Bronze and Iron Age forts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gNgfAz70nOQC&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=vii|title=Slow Cotswolds|author=Carolione Mills|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|date=15 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118044503/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gNgfAz70nOQC&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the Romans built villas, such as at Chedworth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mswynZFMtqgC&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=90|title=Discovering Roman Britain|publisher=New Holland Publishers|date=2008|author=Andrew McCloy, Andrew Midgley|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118050410/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mswynZFMtqgC&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; settlements such as Gloucester, and paved the Celtic path later known as [[Fosse Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10367457/Roman-roads-were-actually-built-by-the-Celts-new-book-claims.html|title='Roman' roads were actually built by the Celts, new book claims|author=Hayley Dixon|journal=The Telegraph|date=9 October 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504110432/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10367457/Roman-roads-were-actually-built-by-the-Celts-new-book-claims.html|archivedate=4 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], thanks to the breed of sheep known as the Cotswold Lion, the Cotswolds became prosperous from the wool trade with the continent, with much of the money made from wool directed towards the building of churches. The most successful era for the wool trade was 1250–1350; much of the wool at that time was sold to Italian merchants. The area still preserves numerous large, handsome Cotswold Stone &quot;wool churches&quot;. The affluent area in the 21st century has attracted wealthy Londoners and others who own second homes there or have chosen to retire to the Cotswolds.&lt;ref name=&quot;butterfield.com&quot;/&gt;

The name Cotswold is popularly attributed the meaning &quot;sheep enclosure in rolling hillsides&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kingscote, Gloucestershire area|url=http://www.kingscotepark.co.uk/index.asp?page=6913|publisher=Kingscote Park|accessdate=1 January 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072311/http://www.kingscotepark.co.uk/index.asp?page=6913|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url= https://archive.org/details/localetymologya00chargoog | title= Local etymology: a derivative dictionary of geographical names | first= Richard Stephen | last= Charnock | publisher= Houlston and Wright | year= 1859 | page= [https://archive.org/details/localetymologya00chargoog/page/n175 76] | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating the term, ''[[The Wolds|wold]]'', meaning hills. Compare also [[the Weald]] from the Saxon/German word ''Wald'' meaning 'forest'. However, the [[English Place-Name Society]] has for many years accepted that the term Cotswold is derived from ''Codesuualt'' of the 12th century or other variations on this form, the etymology of which was given, 'Cod's-wold', which is 'Cod's high open land'.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. H. (1964) ''The Place-Names of Gloucestershire,'' part 1: &quot;The Rivers and Road-names, the East Cotswolds,&quot; Cambridge, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Cod was interpreted as an Old English personal name, which may be recognised in further names: [[Cutsdean]], Codeswellan, and Codesbyrig, some of which date back to the eighth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Smith A. H. 1964 The Place-Names of Gloucestershire part 2: The North and West Cotswolds, Cambridge pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been noticed that &quot;Cod&quot; could derive philologically from a Brittonic female cognate ''&quot;Cuda&quot;'', a hypothetical [[mother goddess]] in [[Celtic mythology]] postulated to have been worshipped in the Cotswold region.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, S. J. (2008) ''The Tribe of Witches: The Religion of the Dobunni and the Hwicce'', pp. 11–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, S. J. (2006) &quot;River-Names, Celtic and Old English: Their Dual Medieval and Post-medieval Personalities,&quot; ''Journal of the English Place-Name Society'' 38, pp.63–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Bibury Cottages in the Cotswolds - June 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Bibury]], a typical Cotswold village]]

The spine of the Cotswolds runs southwest to northeast through six counties, particularly Gloucestershire, west Oxfordshire and south western Warwickshire. The northern and western edges of the Cotswolds are marked by steep [[escarpment]]s down to the [[River Severn|Severn valley]] and the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|Warwickshire Avon]]. This feature, known as the Cotswold escarpment, or sometimes the Cotswold Edge, is a result of the uplifting (tilting) of the limestone layer, exposing its broken edge.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotsstone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecotswoldgateway.co.uk/cotswoldstone.htm|title=Cotswold Stone|publisher=Cotswold Gateway|accessdate=12 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215103858/http://thecotswoldgateway.co.uk/cotswoldstone.htm|archivedate=15 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[cuesta]], in geological terms. The [[dip slope]] is to the southeast. On the eastern boundary lies the city of [[Oxford]] and on the west is [[Stroud]]. To the southeast, the upper reaches of the [[Thames Valley]] and towns such as [[Lechlade]], [[Tetbury]] and [[Fairford]] are often considered to mark the limit of this region. To the south the Cotswolds, with the characteristic uplift of the Cotswold Edge, reach beyond [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and towns such as [[Chipping Sodbury]] and [[Marshfield, Gloucestershire|Marshfield]] share elements of Cotswold character.

The area is characterised by attractive small towns and villages built of the underlying Cotswold stone (a yellow [[oolite|oolitic]] [[limestone]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;cotsstone&quot;/&gt; This limestone is rich in [[fossil]]s, particularly of fossilised [[sea urchin]]s. Cotswold towns include [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]], [[Burford]], [[Chipping Campden]], [[Chipping Norton]], [[Cricklade]], [[Dursley]], [[Malmesbury]], [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], Nailsworth, [[Northleach]], [[Stow-on-the-Wold]], [[Stroud]], [[Witney]] and [[Winchcombe]]. In addition, much of [[Box, Wiltshire|Box]] lies in the Cotswolds. [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Cirencester]], [[Gloucester]], [[Stroud]] and [[Swindon]] are larger urban centres that border on, or are virtually surrounded by, the Cotswold AONB.

The town of [[Chipping Campden]] is notable for being the home of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], founded by [[William Morris]] at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/history|title=History|publisher=Court Barn Museum|accessdate=6 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131022655/http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/history|archivedate=31 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Morris lived occasionally in [[Broadway Tower, Worcestershire|Broadway Tower]], a folly, now part of a country park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldswebsite.com/broadway-tower.htm|title=Broadway Tower|publisher=Cotswold website|accessdate=12 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708014715/http://www.cotswoldswebsite.com/broadway-tower.htm|archivedate=8 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chipping Campden is also known for the annual [[Cotswold Olimpick Games]], a celebration of sports and games dating back to the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=862|title=Origins of Robert Dover's Games|publisher=Olympick Games|accessdate=12 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202114440/http://www.olimpickgames.co.uk/contentok.php?id=862|archivedate=2 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearly {{convert|800|sqmi}} of the Cotswolds, roughly 80% farmlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/united-kingdom/england/cotswolds/|title=Cotswolds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains over {{convert|3,000|mi}} of footpaths and bridleways. There are also {{convert|4,000|mi}} of historic stone walls.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotswolds.com&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:Broadway row b 8294.jpg|thumb|Row houses of Cotswold stone in [[Broadway, Worcestershire]]; the quaint buildings of the village attract numerous tourists]]
A 2017 report on employment within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, stated that the main sources of income were real estate, renting and business activities, manufacturing and wholesale &amp; retail trade repairs. Some 44% of residents were employed in these sectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotswoldsaonb.org.uk&quot;/&gt; Agriculture is also important. Some 86% of the land in the AONB is used for this purpose. The primary crops include barley, beans, rape seed oil and wheat, while the raising of sheep is also important; cows and pigs are also reared. The livestock sector has been declining since 2002, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/our-landscape/farming/|title=Farming - Cotswolds AONB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 Census data for the Cotswolds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswold.gov.uk/about-the-council/information-data/census-2011/|title=Cotswold District Council - Census 2011|website=www.cotswold.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the wholesale and retail trade was the largest employer (15.8% of the workforce), followed by education (9.7%) and health and social work (9.3%). The report also indicates that a relatively higher proportion of residents were working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, accommodation and food services as well as in professional, scientific and technical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswold.gov.uk/media/240333/Census2011-what-we-do.pdf |title=Census data |date=2011 |website=www.cotswold.gov.uk |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unemployment in the Cotswold District was among the lowest in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotswold.gov.uk&quot;/&gt; A report in August 2017 showed only 315 unemployed persons, a slight decrease of five from a year earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/cotswolds/15481499.Decrease_in_unemployment_in_the_Cotswolds/|title=Decrease in unemployment in the Cotswolds|website=Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
Tourism is a significant part of the economy. The Cotswold District area alone gained over £373 million from visitor spending on accommodation, £157 million on local attractions and entertainments, and about £100m on travel in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswold.gov.uk/news/february-2018/new-report-highlights-boom-time-for-tourism-in-cotswolds/|title=Cotswold District Council - New report highlights boom time for tourism in Cotswolds|website=www.cotswold.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the larger Cotswolds Tourism area, including Stroud, Cheltenham, Gloucester and Tewkesbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;cotswold.gov.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswold.gov.uk/guide-to-the-council/cotswold-factfile/|title=Cotswold District Council - Cotswold factfile|website=www.cotswold.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; tourism generated about £1 billion in 2016, providing 200,000 jobs. Some 38 million day visits were made to the Cotswold Tourism area that year.

Many travel guides direct tourists to [[Chipping Campden]], [[Stow-on-the-Wold]], [[Bourton-on-the-Water]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/englands-cute-and-cozy-cotswolds|title=England's Cute and Cozy Cotswolds by Rick Steves|website=www.ricksteves.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]], [[Bibury]], and [[Stanton, Gloucestershire|Stanton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldjourneys.com/top-five-best-cotswold-villages-visit/|title=The Top Five Best Cotswold Villages to Visit - CotswoldJourneys.com|website=www.cotswoldjourneys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-02-26/the-quintessential-guide-to-the-cotswolds|title=The Quintessential Guide to the Cotswolds|first=Daisy|last=Garnett|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these locations can be very crowded at times. Roughly 300,000 people visit Bourton per year, for example, with about half staying for a day or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/637119/cotswold-bans-buses-and-tourist-coaches|title=Cotswolds village TOO POSH for buses? Coaches officially BANNED|first=Kat|last=Romero|date=22 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report in ''Cotswold Life'' magazine in March 2018 however, named only two of those villages as among the &quot;prettiest places&quot; for tourists to visit:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldlife.co.uk/out-about/places/cotswold-villages-10-of-the-prettiest-places-to-visit-1-4307591|title=Cotswold villages: 10 of the prettiest places to visit|first=Hayley|last=Cooper|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Blockley]], &quot;with its peaceful nature and beautiful appearance ... golden Cotswold cottages and limestone walls punctuating the rolling hills...&quot;
* [[Lower Slaughter]], &quot;home to honey-coloured stone architecture, quaint little cottages and the most romantic street in Britain, Copse Hill Road&quot;.
* [[Kingham]], with its &quot;rows of unspoilt limestone cottages and open village greens ... a community you’d expect to find in a story book&quot;.
* [[Mickleton, Gloucestershire|Mickleton]], with an &quot;abundance of black and white thatched cottages interspersed with limestone architecture - creating a picture perfect Cotswold scene&quot;.
* [[Bibury]], &quot;one of England’s most iconic hamlets and home to the peaceful River Coln and some of the most photographed houses in the country&quot;.
* [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], with its &quot;tea rooms, museums, cosy pubs and picture-book houses ... the River Windrush trickles through the village ... [and] golden stone cottages built many centuries ago&quot;.
* [[Bredon]], by the River Avon, a &quot;delightful village ... steeped in history, ... full of medieval barns, thatched cottages and Cotswold stone houses&quot;.
* [[Ashton under Hill]], with its history going back to the Roman occupation, &quot;scattered with cosy timber-framed cottages and pretty Victorian houses&quot;.
* [[Naunton]], &quot;a peaceful and unspoilt Cotswold village ... a relatively tourist-free place&quot;.

The area also has numerous public walking trails and footpaths that attract visitors, including the 93-mile [[Cotswold Way]] (part of the [[National Trails System]]) from Bath to Chipping Camden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trip101.com/article/best-walks-trails-cotswold|title=7 Best Walks And Trails In The Cotswolds|date=25 May 2017 |publisher=TRIP101 Pte Ltd|access-date=12 January 2019|quote=The Cotswolds are quite simply a hiker's paradise. Miles upon miles of public pathways and bridleways to explore.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing development===
In August 2018, the final decision was made for a Local Plan that would lead to the building of nearly 7,000 additional homes by 2031, in addition to over 3,000 already built. Areas for development include Cirencester, Bourton-on-the-Water, Down Ampney, Fairford, Kemble, Lechlade, Northleach, South Cerney, Stow-on-the-Wold, Tetbury and Moreton-in-Marsh. Some of the money received from developers will be earmarked for new infrastructure to support the increasing population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiltsglosstandard.co.uk/news/16408113.10000-homes-will-be-built-across-cotswolds/|title=10,000 homes will be built across Cotswolds|website=Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cotswold stone==
Cotswold stone is a yellow [[oolite|oolitic]] [[Jurassic]] [[limestone]]. This limestone is rich in [[fossil]]s, particularly of fossilised [[sea urchin]]s. When weathered, the colour of buildings made or faced with this stone is often described as honey or golden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Cotswold stone | author=Freda Derrick | publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall | year=1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Broadway row houses b 8302.jpg|thumb|Broadway row houses of Cotswold stone]]
The stone varies in colour from north to south, being honey-coloured in the north and north east of the region, as shown in Cotswold villages such as [[Stanton, Gloucestershire|Stanton]] and [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]]; golden-coloured in the central and southern areas, as shown in [[Dursley]] and [[Cirencester]]; and pearly white in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswold.gov.uk/visitors/attractions/cotswold-stone/|title=Cotswold stone|work=cotswold.gov.uk|publisher=Cotswold District Council|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323121720/http://www.cotswold.gov.uk/visitors/attractions/cotswold-stone/|archivedate=23 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock outcrops at places on the Cotswold Edge; small quarries are common. The exposures are rarely sufficiently compact to be good for [[rock-climbing]], but an exception is Castle Rock, on [[Cleeve Hill, Gloucestershire|Cleeve Hill]], near [[Cheltenham]]. Due to the rapid expansion of the Cotswolds in order for nearby areas to capitalize on increased house prices, well known ironstone villages, such as [[Hook Norton]], have even been claimed by some to be in the Cotswolds despite lacking key features of Cotswolds villages such as Cotswold stone and are instead built using a deep red/orange [[ironstone]], known locally as Hornton Stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haywardmasonry.co.uk/2013/09/hornton-stone/|title=Hornton Stone|date=3 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty==
{{wide image|Cotswolds Panorama Fields.jpg|780px|align-cap=center|Rolling hills and farm fields that typify the Cotswolds landscape}}

The Cotswolds were designated as an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) in 1966, with an expansion on 21 December 1990 to {{convert|1990|km2|sqmi|0}}. In 1991, all AONBs were measured again using modern methods. The official area of the Cotswolds AONB was increased to {{convert|2038|km2|sqmi|0}}. In 2000, the government confirmed that AONBs had the same landscape quality and status as [[National Parks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aonb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=AONB|title=AONB|publisher=Cotswolds AONB|accessdate=12 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804044746/http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=aonb|archivedate=4 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Cotswolds AONB, which is the largest in [[England and Wales]], stretches from the border regions of South Warwickshire and Worcestershire, through West Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire, and takes in parts of Wiltshire, [[Bath and North East Somerset]] in the south.
Gloucestershire County Council is responsible for sixty-three percent of the AONB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/aonb/cotswolds.aspx Cotswolds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726170830/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/designatedareas/aonb/cotswolds.aspx |date=26 July 2010 }} ''[[Natural England]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2018, the final draft of the Cotswolds AONB Management Plan 2018–2023 was out for consultation. The final text should be written after 14 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/planning/cotswolds-aonb-management-plan/|title=Cotswolds AONB Management Plan - Cotswolds AONB|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cotswolds Conservation Board has the task of conserving and enhancing the AONB. Established under statute in 2004 as an independent public body, the Board carries out a range of work from securing funding for 'on the ground' conservation projects, to providing a strategic overview of the area for key decision makers, such as planning officials. The Board is funded by [[Natural England]] and the seventeen local authorities that are covered by the AONB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=ccb|title=Cotswolds Conservation Board|publisher=Cotswolds AONB|accessdate=12 December 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131091840/http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?Page=CCB|archivedate=31 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landscape of the AONB is varied, including escarpment outliers, escarpments, rolling hills and valleys, enclosed limestone valleys, settled valleys, ironstone hills and valleys, high wolds and high wold valleys, high wold dip-slopes, dip-slope lowland and valleys, a Low limestone plateau, cornbrash lowlands, farmed slopes, a broad floodplain valley, a large pastoral lowland vale, a settled unwooded vale and an unwooded vale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Landscape-of-the-Cotswolds.pdf |title=Landscape data |date=2017 |website=www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the beauty of the Cotswolds AONB is intertwined with that of the villages that seem almost to grow out of the landscape, the Cotswolds were primarily designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] for the rare limestone grassland habitats as well as the old growth [[beech]] woodlands that typify the area. These habitat areas are also the last refuge for many other flora and fauna, with some so endangered that they are protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]]. [[Cleeve Hill, Gloucestershire|Cleeve Hill]], and its associated commons, is a fine example of a limestone grassland and it is one of the few locations where the [[Duke of Burgundy butterfly]] may still be found in abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Areas – 55 Cotswolds|url=http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/science/natural/NA_Details.asp?NA_Id=55|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=6 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724015849/http://www.naturalareas.naturalengland.org.uk/science/natural/NA_Details.asp?NA_Id=55|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2018 report stated that the AONB receives &quot;23 million visitors a year, the third largest of any protected landscape&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldjournal.co.uk/news/16297750.mp-seeks-to-meet-new-chief-in-bid-to-promote-idea-of-cotswolds-becoming-a-national-park/|title=MP seeks to meet new chief in bid to promote idea of Cotswolds becoming a National Park|website=Cotswold Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier that year, Environment secretary [[Michael Gove]] announced that a panel would be formed to consider making some of the AONBs into National Parks.

The uniqueness and value of the Cotswolds is shown in the fact that five European [[Special Area of Conservation|Special Areas of Conservation]], three [[National Nature Reserves in England|National Nature Reserves]] and more than eighty [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] are within the Cotswolds AONB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cotswold AONB|url=http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=aonb|publisher=Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty|accessdate=6 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804044746/http://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/?page=aonb|archivedate=4 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cotswold Voluntary Wardens Service was established in 1968 to help conserve and enhance the area, and now has more than 300 wardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovingthecotswolds.com/cotswold-voluntary-wardens|title=101 Reasons to Love the Cotswolds, Cotswold Voluntary Wardens|website=www.lovingthecotswolds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cotswold Way]] is a long-distance footpath, just over {{convert|100|mi|km|0}} long, running the length of the AONB, mainly on the edge of the Cotswold escarpment with views over the [[Severn Valley]] and the Vale of [[Evesham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/Cotswold/text.asp?PageId=2 | title= Cotswold Way&amp;nbsp;– About this trail | work= National Trail | accessdate= 14 July 2015 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131113072256/http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/cotswold/text.asp?PageId=2 | archivedate= 13 November 2013 | df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[File:Cotswold roads 1933.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Cotswolds roads from 1933]]

The Cotswolds lie between the [[M5 motorway|M5]], [[M40 motorway|M40]] and [[M4 motorway]]s. The main A-roads through the area are the [[A46 road|A46]]: [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Stroud]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Cheltenham]]; the [[A419 road|A419]]: [[Swindon]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Cirencester]]&amp;nbsp;– Stroud; the [[A429 road|A429]]: Cirencester&amp;nbsp;– [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Moreton-in-Marsh]]; and the [[A40 road|A40]]: [[Oxford]]&amp;nbsp;– [[Burford]]&amp;nbsp;– Cheltenham. These all roughly follow the routes of ancient roads, some laid down by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]], such as [[Ermin Way]] and the [[Fosse Way]].

There are local bus services across the area, but some are infrequent.

The [[River Thames]] flows from the Cotswolds and is navigable from [[Inglesham]] and [[Lechlade|Lechlade-on-Thames]] downstream to [[Oxford]].

===Railways===
The area is bounded by two major rail routes: in the south by the main [[Great Western Main Line|Bristol–Bath–London High Speed line]] (including the [[South Wales Main Line]]) and in the west by the [[Cross Country Route|Bristol–Birmingham main line]]. In addition, the [[Cotswold Line]] runs through the Cotswolds from [[Oxford railway station|Oxford]] to [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Worcester]], and the [[Golden Valley Line]] runs from Swindon via [[Stroud railway station|Stroud]] to [[Gloucester railway station|Gloucester]], carrying high speed and local services.

Mainline, high-speed rail services to the big cities run from railway stations such as [[Bath Spa railway station|Bath]], [[Swindon railway station|Swindon]], [[Oxford]], [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham]] and [[Worcester Shrub Hill railway station|Worcester]]. Mainline trains run by [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] to [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] also are available from [[Kemble railway station|Kemble station]] near Cirencester, [[Kingham railway station|Kingham station]] near Stow-on-the-Wold, [[Charlbury railway station|Charlbury station]] and [[Moreton-in-Marsh railway station|Moreton-in-Marsh station]].

Additionally, there is the [[Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway]], a steam heritage railway serving the Cotswolds from [[Cheltenham Racecourse railway station|Cheltenham Racecourse]] through [[Gotherington railway station|Gotherington]], [[Winchcombe railway station|Winchcombe]] and [[Hayles Abbey Halt railway station|Hayles Abbey Halt]] to [[Toddington railway station|Toddington]] and Laverton. The preserved line is currently being extended to Broadway, with the aim of reaching [[Honeybourne railway station|Honeybourne]] and making a reconnection with the [[Cotswold Line]].

==In culture==

The Cotswold region has inspired several notable English composers. In the early 1900s, [[Herbert Howells]] and [[Ivor Gurney]] used to take long walks together over the hills, and Gurney urged Howells to make the landscape, including the nearby [[Malvern Hills]], the inspiration for his future work. Accepting, in 1916, Howells wrote his first major piece, the ''Piano Quartet in A minor,'' inspired by the magnificent view of the [[Malvern Hills|Malverns]]; he dedicated it to &quot;the hill at Chosen ([[Churchdown]]) and Ivor Gurney who knows it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webspace.webring.com/people/th/hauntedtv/long_remembered_hills.htm Long Remembered Hills] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919220827/http://webspace.webring.com/people/th/hauntedtv/long_remembered_hills.htm |date=19 September 2012 }} How the English composers Ivor Gurney and Herbert Howells were influenced by the Gloucestershire countryside.&lt;/ref&gt; Another contemporary of theirs, [[Gerald Finzi]], lived in nearby [[Painswick]].

[[Gustav Holst]] titled his Symphony in F major, Op. 8 H47 ''The Cotswolds''. The composer [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] composed his opera ''&quot;Hugh the Drover&quot;'' from 1913 to 1924, which depicts life in a Cotswold village and incorporates local folk melodies. In 1988 the [[Symphony No. 6 (Bourgeois)|6th symphony]] (Op. 109) of composer [[Derek Bourgeois]] was titled ''&quot;A Cotswold Symphony&quot;''.
 
The Cotswolds are a popular location for filming scenes for movies and television programmes.&lt;ref name=&quot;cotswoldlife.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cotswoldlife.co.uk/out-about/places/19-famous-filming-locations-in-the-cotswolds-1-5124821|title=19 famous filming locations in the Cotswolds|first=Joe|last=Meredith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lovingthecotswolds.com/cotswolds-film-locations-television-tv|title=The Cotswolds on Film - TV|website=www.lovingthecotswolds.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Better Things (film)|Better Things]]'' (2008), directed by Duane Hopkins, is set in a small Cotswold village. The fictional detective [[Agatha Raisin]] lives in the fictional village of [[Carsely]] in the Cotswolds. The [[Chipping Norton set]] are based in the Cotswolds.
