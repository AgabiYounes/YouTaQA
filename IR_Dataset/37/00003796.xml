Different religious groups include different books in their [[biblical canon]]s, in varying orders, and sometimes divide or combine books. The Jewish [[Tanakh]] (sometimes called the [[Hebrew Bible]]) contains 24 books divided into three parts: the five books of the ''[[Torah]]'' (&quot;teaching&quot;); the eight books of the ''[[Nevi'im]]'' (&quot;prophets&quot;); and the eleven books of ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (&quot;writings&quot;). It is composed mainly in [[Biblical Hebrew]], and its [[Septuagint]] is the main textual source for the Christian Greek Old Testament.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDWDS_(2001)&quot;/&gt;

[[Christian Bible]]s range from the 73 books of the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] canon, the 66 books of the canon of some denominations or the 80 books of the canon of other denominations of the [[Protestantism|Protestant Church]], to the 81 books of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] canon. The first part of Christian Bibles is the [[Greek Old Testament]], which contains, at minimum, the above 24 books of the Tanakh but divided into 39 books and ordered differently. The second part is the [[Greek New Testament]], containing 27 books; the four [[canonical gospels]], [[Acts of the Apostles]], 21 [[Epistle#New Testament epistles|Epistles]] or letters and the [[Book of Revelation]].

The [[Catholic Church]] and [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] churches hold that certain [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical books and passages]] are part of the [[development of the Old Testament canon|Old Testament canon]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Assyrian Church of the East|Assyrian Christian]] churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books. The list given here for these churches is the most inclusive: if at least one Eastern church accepts the book it is included here. The [[King James Bible]]—which has been called &quot;the [[King James Version#Influence|most influential version]] of the most influential book in the world, in what is now its most influential language&quot; and which in the United States is the [[King James Version#Influence|most used translation]], being still considered a standard among [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]] and being used liturgically in the [[Orthodox Church in America]]—contains 80 books: 39 in its Old Testament, 14 in its [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], and 27 in its New Testament.

The Eastern Orthodox use the [[Septuagint]] (translated in the 3rd century BCE) as the textual basis for the entire Old Testament in both protocanonical and deuteroncanonical books—to use both in the Greek for [[liturgical]] purposes, and as the basis for translations into the [[vernacular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ware|first=Timothy|title=The Orthodox Church: New Edition|year=1993|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-014656-1|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Orthodox Study Bible|year=2008|publisher=Thomas Nelson|location=Nashville, TN, USA|isbn=978-0-7180-0359-3|page=1824|edition=Annotated|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the quotations (300 of 400) of the Old Testament in the New Testament, while differing more or less from the version presented by the Masoretic text, align with that of the Septuagint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLay|first=R.

====Deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament====
{{Main|Deuterocanonical books|Biblical apocrypha|Pseudepigraph}}
These books, which were largely written during the [[intertestamental period]], are called the [[biblical apocrypha]] (&quot;hidden things&quot;) by Protestants, the [[deuterocanon]] (&quot;second canon&quot;) by Catholics, and the deuterocanon or ''[[anagignoskomena]]'' (&quot;worthy of reading&quot;) by Orthodox. These are works recognized by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches as being part of scripture (and thus deuterocanonical rather than apocryphal), but Protestants do not recognize them as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]]. Orthodox differentiate scriptural books by omitting these (and others) from corporate worship and from use as a sole basis for doctrine.{{citation needed |date=December 2015}}

Many recognize them as good, but not on the level of the other books of the Bible. [[Anglicanism]] considers the apocrypha worthy of being &quot;read for example of life&quot; but not to be used &quot;to establish any doctrine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;39articles&quot; /&gt; [[Luther's canon|Luther]] made a parallel statement in calling them: &quot;not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but...useful and good to read.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05742122&amp;id=rl3lcbLkHV0C&amp;pg=PA521&amp;lpg=PA521&amp;dq=luther+%22are+useful+and+good+to+read%22|title=The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopædia and Scriptural Dictionary, Fully Defining and Explaining All Religious Terms, Including Biographical, Geographical, Historical, Archæological and Doctrinal Themes |p=521|editor=[[Samuel Fallows]]|publisher=The Howard-Severance company|origyear=1901|year=1910|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference in canons derives from the difference in the Masoretic Text and the [[Septuagint]]. Books found in both the Hebrew and the Greek are accepted by all denominations, and by Jews, these are the protocanonical books. Catholics and Orthodox also accept those books present in manuscripts of the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament with great currency among the Jews of the ancient world, with the coda that Catholics consider [[3 Esdras]] and [[3 Maccabees]] apocryphal.

Most quotations of the Old Testament in the New Testament, differing by varying degrees from the Masoretic Text, are taken from the Septuagint. Daniel was written several hundred years after the time of Ezra, and since that time several books of the Septuagint have been found in the original Hebrew, in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Cairo Geniza]], and at [[Masada]], including a Hebrew text of Sirach (Qumran, Masada) and an Aramaic text of Tobit (Qumran); the additions to Esther and Daniel are also in their respective Semitic languages.

The unanimous consensus of modern (and ancient) scholars consider several other books, including 1 Maccabees and Judith, to have been composed in Hebrew or Aramaic.{{citation needed |date=January 2016}} Opinion is divided on the book of Baruch, while it is acknowledged that the Letter of Jeremiah, the Wisdom of Solomon, and 2 Maccabees are originally Greek compositions.

=====Eastern Orthodox=====
Additional books accepted by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]:
* [[1 Esdras]]/3 Esdras&lt;ref&gt;Including what is known as [[5 Ezra]] (ch. 1–2) and [[6 Ezra]] (ch. 15–16); only chapters 3–14 are denoted 4 Ezra proper in critical editions; the full book of 16 chapters is often printed as one work, &quot;2 Esdras&quot; or &quot;4 Esdras&quot;, in popular editions. See [[Esdras#Differences in names|Wikipedia's article on the naming conventions of all of the Books of Ezra (and Nehemiah)]]. The naming conventions of the various deuterocanonical and apocryphal Books of Ezra/Esdras are different in every tradition (Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Protestant). Critical editions generally have settled on the [[Vulgate]] naming conventions, where Ezra and Nehemiah were 1 and 2 Esdras, [[Greek Ezra|Esdras A]] is 3 Esdras, and the [[Latin Ezra|Latin Apocalypse of Ezra]] is 4 Esdras (Charlesworth's Old Testament Pseudepigrapha).&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[2 Baruch]] with the Letter of Baruch (only the letter has achieved canonical status)
* [[Psalms 152–155]] (not canonical)

=====Ethiopian Orthodox=====
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Tewahedo church]] accepts all of the deuterocanonical books of Catholicism and anagignoskomena of Eastern Orthodoxy except for the four Books of Maccabees.&lt;ref&gt;According to some enumerations, including Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobit, 1 Esdras, 4 Ezra (not including chs. 1-2 or 15-16), Wisdom, the rest of Daniel, Baruch, and 1-2 Maccabees&lt;/ref&gt; It accepts the 39 protocanonical books along with the following books, called the &quot;[[Bible translations into Amharic#New Haile Selassie I Bible (1962)|narrow canon]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;These books are accounted pseudepigrapha by all other Christian groups, Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox (Charlesworth's Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; The enumeration of books in the Ethiopic Bible varies greatly between different authorities and printings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Bible/Text/Canon/ethiopican.html |title=The Biblical Canon Of The Ethiopian Orthodox Church Today |publisher=Islamic-awareness.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Table====
The table uses the spellings and names present in modern editions of the Bible, such as the [[New American Bible Revised Edition]], [[Revised Standard Version]] and [[English Standard Version]]. The spelling and names in both the 1609–1610 [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douay]] Old Testament (and in the 1582 Rheims New Testament) and the 1749 revision by [[Bishop Challoner]] (the edition currently in print used by many Catholics, and the source of traditional Catholic spellings in English) and in the Septuagint differ from those spellings and names used in modern editions that derive from the Hebrew Masoretic text.&lt;ref&gt;Generally due to derivation from transliterations of names used in the Latin Vulgate in the case of Catholicism, and from transliterations of the Greek Septuagint in the case of the Orthodox (as opposed to derivation of translations, instead of transliterations, of Hebrew titles) such [[Ecclesiasticus]] (DRC) instead of [[Sirach]] (LXX) or [[Ben Sira]] (Hebrew), [[Paralipomenon]] (Greek, meaning &quot;things omitted&quot;) instead of [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]], Sophonias instead of [[Zephaniah]], Noe instead of [[Noah]], Henoch instead of [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Messias]] instead of [[Messiah]], Sion instead of [[Zion]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Orthodox canon, Septuagint titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. For the Catholic canon, the Douaic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. Likewise, the King James Version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the New Testament, such as &quot;Esaias&quot; (for Isaiah).

In the spirit of [[ecumenism]] more recent Catholic translations (e.g., the [[New American Bible]], [[Jerusalem Bible]], and ecumenical translations used by Catholics, such as the [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]]) use the same &quot;standardized&quot; (King James Version) spellings and names as Protestant Bibles (e.g., 1 Chronicles, as opposed to the Douaic 1 Paralipomenon, 1–2 Samuel and 1–2 Kings, instead of 1–4 Kings) in those books universally considered canonical—the [[Protocanonical books|protocanonicals]].

The [[Talmud]] in [[Bava Batra]] 14b gives a different order for the books in ''Nevi'im'' and ''Ketuvim''. This order is also quoted in [[Mishneh Torah]] Hilchot [[Sefer (Hebrew)|Sefer]] [[Torah]] 7:15. The order of the books of the Torah are universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity.

The disputed books, included in one canon but not in others, are often called the [[Biblical apocrypha]], a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern [[Protestant]] Bibles. Catholics, following the [[Canon of Trent]] (1546), describe these books as deuterocanonical, while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the [[Synod of Jerusalem (1672)]], use the traditional name of ''[[anagignoskomena]]'', meaning &quot;that which is to be read.&quot; They are present in a few historic Protestant versions; the German [[Luther Bible]] included such books, as did the English [[Authorized King James Version|1611 King James Version]].&lt;ref name=&quot;39articles&quot;&gt;The foundational [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of [[Anglicanism]], in [[:s:Thirty-Nine Articles|Article VI]], asserts that these disputed books are not (to be) used &quot;to establish any doctrine,&quot; but &quot;read for example of life.&quot; Although the Biblical apocrypha are still used in [[Anglican Liturgy]], (&quot;Two of the hymns used in the American Prayer Book office of Morning Prayer, the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus es]] and [[Benedicite]], are taken from the Apocrypha. One of the offertory sentences in Holy Communion comes from an apocryphal book (Tob. 4: 8-9). Lessons from the Apocrypha are regularly appointed to read in the daily, Sunday, and special services of Morning and Evening Prayer. There are altogether 111 such lessons in the latest revised American Prayer Book Lectionary [The books used are: II Esdras, Tobit, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Three Holy Children, and I Maccabees.]&quot; —[http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.pdf The Apocrypha, Bridge of the Testaments] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205074449/http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/apocrypha.pdf |date=February 5, 2009 }}), the modern trend has been to not even print the Old Testament Apocrypha in editions of Anglican-used Bibles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Empty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon.
