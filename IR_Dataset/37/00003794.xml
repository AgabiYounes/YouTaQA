'''Brassicaceae''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|r|æ|s|ᵻ|ˈ|k|eɪ|s|i|i}}) or '''Cruciferae''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|uː|ˈ|s|ɪ|f|ər|i}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cruciferae |volume=7 |page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a medium-sized and economically important [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[flowering plants]] commonly known as the '''mustards''', the '''crucifers''', or the '''cabbage family'''. Most are [[herbaceous plants]], some shrubs, with simple, although sometimes deeply incised, alternatingly set leaves without [[stipule]]s or in leaf rosettes, with terminal inflorescences without bracts, containing flowers with four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two short and four longer free stamens, and a fruit with seeds in rows, divided by a thin wall (or septum).

The family contains 372 [[genus|genera]] and 4,060 accepted [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theplantlist.org/1.1/browse/A/Brassicaceae/|title=Brassicaceae|publisher=The Plant List}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest genera are ''[[Draba]]'' (440 species), ''[[Erysimum]]'' (261 species), ''[[Lepidium]]'' (234 species), ''[[Cardamine]]'' (233 species), and ''[[Alyssum]]'' (207 species).

The family contains the [[cruciferous vegetables]], including species such as ''[[Brassica oleracea]]'' (e.g., broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards), ''[[Brassica rapa]]'' (turnip, Chinese cabbage, etc.), ''[[Brassica napus]]'' (rapeseed, etc.), ''[[Raphanus sativus]]'' (common radish), ''[[Armoracia rusticana]]'' (horseradish), but also a cut-flower ''[[Matthiola]]'' (stock) and the [[model organism]] ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' (thale cress).

''[[Pieris rapae]]'' and other butterflies of the family [[Pieridae]] are some of the best-known pests of Brassicaceae species planted as commercial crops. ''Trichoplusia ni'' ([[cabbage looper]]) moth is also becoming increasingly problematic for crucifers due to its resistance to commonly used pest control methods.&lt;ref&gt;Turini TA, Daugovish O, Koike ST, Natwick ET, Ploeg A, Dara SK, Fennimore SA, Joseph S, LeStrange M, Smith R, Subbarao KV, Westerdahl BB. Revised continuously. ''UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines Cole Crops.'' UC ANR Publication 3442. Oakland, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rarer ''Pieris'' butterflies, such as ''[[Pieris virginiensis]]'', depend upon native mustards for their survival, in their native habitats. Some non-native mustards, such as garlic mustard, ''[[Alliaria petiolata]]'', an extremely [[invasive species]] in the [[United States]], can be toxic to their larvae.

==Taxonomy==
[[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753 regarded the Brassicaceae as a natural group, naming them &quot;Klass&quot; Tetradynamia. [[Alfred Barton Rendle]] placed the family in the order [[Bessey system#Oppositifoliae|Rhoedales]], while [[George Bentham]] and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] in their system published from 1862–1883, assigned it to their cohort [[Parietales]] (now the class [[Violales]]). Following Bentham and Hooker, [[John Hutchinson (botanist)|John Hutchinson]] in 1948 and again in 1964 thought the Brassicaceae to stem from near the [[Papaveraceae]]. In 1994, a group of scientists including [[Walter Stephen Judd]] suggested to include the [[Capparaceae]] in the Brassicaceae. Early DNA-analysis showed that the Capparaceae—as defined at that moment—were [[paraphyletic]], and it was suggested to assign the genera closest to the Brassicaceae to the [[Cleomaceae]].&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;{{cite journal|title= Phylogeny of Capparaceae and Brassicaceae based on chloroplast sequence data|year= 2002|last1= Hall|first1= J.C.|last2= Sytsma|first2= K.J.|last3= Iltis|first3= H.H.|journal= [[American Journal of Botany]]|volume= 89|issue= 11|pages= 1826–1842|doi= 10.3732/ajb.89.11.1826|pmid= 21665611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae diverged approximately 41 million years ago.&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite book|title= Genetics and Genomics of the Brassicaceae|volume= 9|series= Plant Genetics and Genomics: Crops and Models|editors= Renate Schmidt, Ian Bancroft|publisher= Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three families have consistently been placed in one order (variably called [[Capparales]] or [[Brassicales]]).&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt; The [[APG II]] system, merged Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae. Other classifications have continued to recognize the Capparaceae, but with a more restricted circumscription, either including ''Cleome'' and its relatives in the Brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family [[Cleomaceae]]. The [[APG III system]] has recently adopted this last solution, but this may change as a consensus arises on this point. Current insights in the relationships of the Brassicaceae, based on a 2012 DNA-analysis, are summarized in the following tree.&lt;ref name=BioDis /&gt;&lt;ref name=Su2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Su|first1= Jun-Xia|last2= Wang|first2= Wei|last3= Zhang|first3= Li-Bing|last4= Chen|first4= Zhi-Duan|title= Phylogenetic placement of two enigmatic genera, Borthwickia and Stixis, based on molecular and pollen data, and the description of a new family of Brassicales, Borthwickiaceae|journal= Taxon|date= June 2012|volume= 61|issue= 3|pages= 601–611|url= http://ib.cas.cn/News/201207/W020120713414196219534.pdf|doi= 10.1002/tax.613009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationships within the family ===
Early classifications depended on morphological comparison only, but because of extensive [[convergent evolution]], these do not provide a reliable [[phylogeny]]. Although a substantial effort was made through [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic studies]], the relationships within the Brassicaceae have not always been well resolved yet. It has long been clear that the ''[[Aethionema]]'' are [[Sister group|sister]] of the remainder of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Ihsan A.|last= Al-Shehbaz|year= 2012|title= A generic and tribal synopsis of the Brassicaceae (Cruciferae)|journal= [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy#Taxon|Taxon]]|volume= 61|issue= 5|pages= 931–954|doi= 10.1002/tax.615002}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analysis from 2014 represented the relation between 39 tribes with the following tree.&lt;ref name=Edger&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Patrick P.|last1= Edger|first2= Michelle|last2= Tang|first3= Kevin A.|last3= Bird|first4= Dustin R.|last4= Mayfield|first5= Gavin|last5= Conant|first6= Klaus|last6= Mummenhoff|first7= Marcus A.|last7= Koch|first8= J.

=== Etymology ===
The name ''Brassicaceae'' comes to [[international scientific vocabulary]] from [[New Latin]], from ''[[Brassica]]'', the [[type genus]], + ''[[wikt:-aceae#Suffix|-aceae]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;MWU&quot;&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a standardized [[suffix]] for plant family names in modern taxonomy. The genus name comes from the [[Classical Latin]] word ''[[wikt:brassica#Noun 2|brassica]]'', referring to [[cabbage]] and other [[cruciferous vegetables]]. The alternative older name, [[wikt:Cruciferae|Cruciferae]], meaning &quot;cross-bearing&quot;, describes the four [[petal]]s of mustard flowers, which resemble a [[cross]]. Cruciferae is one of eight plant family names, not derived from a genus name and without the suffix ''-aceae'' that are authorized alternative names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website= [[ICBN]]|title= Article 18.|url= http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art18|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genera ===
{{main|List of Brassicaceae genera}}

Version 1 of the Plantlist website lists 349 genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website= The Plantlist|title= Brassicaceae|url= http://www.theplantlist.org/browse/A/Brassicaceae/|accessdate= 2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Species belonging to the Brassicaceae are mostly [[Annual plant|annual]], [[Biennial plant|biennial]], or [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous plant]]s, some are [[dwarf shrub]]s or [[shrub]]s, and very few [[vine]]s. Although generally terrestrial, a few species such as [[water awlwort]] live submerged in fresh water. They may have a [[taproot]] or a sometimes woody [[caudex]] that may have few or many branches, some have thin or tuberous [[rhizome]]s, or rarely develop [[Stolon|runners]]. Few species have multi-cellular glands. [[Trichome|Hairs]] consist of one cell and occur in many forms: from simple to forked, star-, tree- or T-shaped, rarely taking the form of a shield or scale. They are never topped by a gland. The [[Plant stem|stem]]s may be upright, rise up towards the tip, or lie flat, are mostly herbaceous but sometimes woody. Stems carry leaves or the stems may be leafless (in ''[[Caulanthus]]''), and some species lack stems altogether. The leaves do not have [[stipule]]s, but there may be a pair of glands at base of [[Petiole (botany)|leafstalks]] and [[Pedicel (botany)|flowerstalks]]. The leaf may be seated or have a leafstalk. The [[Leaf#Morphology (large-scale features)|leaf blade]] is usually simple, entire or [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|dissected]], rarely [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|trifoliolate]] or [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|pinnately compound]]. A leaf rosette at the base may be present or absent. The leaves along the stem are almost always [[Leaf#Arrangement on the stem|alternately arranged]], rarely apparently opposite.&lt;ref name=Neotropikey&gt;{{cite web|website= Neotropikey—Interactive key and information resources for flowering plants of the Neotropics|title= Neotropical Brassicaceae|author= Al-Shehbaz, I.A.|year= 2012|url=  http://www.kew.org/science/tropamerica/neotropikey/families/Brassicaceae.htm|accessdate= 2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stomata are of the [[Stoma#anisocytic|anisocytic]] type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= C.R.|last1= Metcalfe|first2= L.|last2= Chalk|year= 1950|title= Anatomy of Dicotyledons|volume= 1: Leaves, Stem, and Wood in relation to Taxonomy, with notes on economic Uses|pages= 79–87|url= https://archive.org/stream/anatomyofthedico033552mbp#page/n157/mode/2up|publisher= Oxford At The Clarendon Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[genome size]] of Brassicaceae compared to that of other Angiosperm families is very small to small (less than 3.425 million base pairs per cell), varying from 150 Mbp in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Sphaerocardamum]]'' spp., to 2375 Mbp ''[[Bunias orientalis]]''. The number of [[homologous chromosomes|homologous chromosome sets]] varies from four (n=4) in some ''[[Physaria]]'' and ''[[Stenopetalum]]'' species, five (n=5) in other ''Physaria'' and ''Stenopetalum'' species, ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and a ''[[Mathiola]]'' species, to seventeen (n=17). About 35% of the species in which chromosomes have been counted have eight sets (n=8). Due to [[polyploidy]], some species may have up to 256 individual chromosomes, with some very high counts in the North American species of ''Cardamine'', such as ''[[Cardamine diphylla|C. diphylla]]''. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridisation]] is not unusual in Brassicaceae, especially in ''[[Arabis]]'', ''[[Rorippa]]'', ''[[Cardamine]]'' and ''[[Boechera]]''. Hybridisation between species originating in Africa and California, and subsequent [[Speciation#Speciation via polyploidization|polyploidisation]] is surmised for ''[[Lepidium]]'' species native to Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=SB /&gt;

=== Inflorescence and flower ===
[[Image:Floral diagram Erysimum Bowles Mauve 2.jpg|thumb|left|Typical [[floral diagram]] of a Brassicaceae (''Erysimum'' &quot;Bowles' Mauve&quot;)]]Flowers may be arranged in [[raceme]]s, [[panicle]]s, or [[corymb]]s, with pedicels sometimes in the axil of a bract, and few species have flowers that sit individually on flower stems that spring from the axils of rosette leaves. The orientation of the pedicels when fruits are ripe varies dependent on the species. The flowers are [[Plant reproductive morphology#Terminology|bisexual]], [[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|star symmetrical]] (zygomorphic in ''[[Iberis]]'' and ''[[Teesdalia]]'') and the [[Ovary (botany)#Superior ovary|ovary positioned above the other floral parts]]. Each flower has four free or seldomly merged [[sepal]]s, the lateral two sometimes with a shallow spur, which are mostly shed after flowering, rarely persistent, may be reflexed, spreading, ascending, or erect, together forming a tube-, bell- or urn-shaped calyx. Each flower has four [[petal]]s, set alternating with the sepals, although in some species these are rudimentary or absent. They may be differentiated into a [[Petal#Shape and size|blade]] and a [[Petal#Shape and size|claw]] or not, and consistently lack basal appendages. The blade is entire or has an indent at the tip, and may sometimes be much smaller than the claws. The mostly six [[stamen]]s are set in two whorls: usually the two lateral, outer ones are shorter than the four inner stamens, but very rarely the stamens can all have the same length, and very rarely species have different numbers of stamens such as sixteen to twenty four in ''[[Megacarpaea]]'', four in ''[[Cardamine hirsuta]]'', and two in ''[[Coronopus]]''. The filaments are slender and not fused, while the anthers consist of two pollen producing cavities, and open with longitudinal slits. The pollen grains are [[tricolpate]]. The [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]] carries a variable number of [[nectar]]ies, but these are always present opposite the base of the lateral stamens.&lt;ref name=Neotropikey /&gt;&lt;ref name=BioDis&gt;{{cite web|website= biologydiscussion|title= Brassicaceae: Characters, Distribution and Types (With Diagram)|url= http://www.biologydiscussion.com/angiosperm/dicotyledons/brassicaceae-characters-distribution-and-types-with-diagram/47923|access-date= 12 July 2017|date= 2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ovary, fruit and seed ===
There is one [[Gynoecium#Gynoecium position|superior]] [[Gynoecium#Pistils|pistil]] that consists of two [[carpel]]s that may either sit directly above the base of the stamens or on a [[Gynophore|stalk]]. It initially consists of only one cavity but during its further development a thin wall grows that divides the cavity, both placentas and separates the two valves (a so-called false septum). Rarely, there is only one cavity without a septum. The 2–600 [[ovule]]s are usually along the side margin of the carpels, or rarely at the top. Fruits are capsules that open with two valves, usually towards the top. These are called [[silique]] if at least three times longer than wide, or [[silicle]] if the length is less than three times the width. The fruit is very variable in its other traits. There may be one persistent [[Stigma (botany)#Style|style]] that connects the ovary to the globular or conical [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]], which is undivided or has two spreading or connivent lobes. The variously shaped seeds are usually yellow or brown in color, and arranged in one or two rows in each cavity. The [[Cotyledon|seed leaves]] are entire or have a notch at the tip. The seed does not contain [[endosperm]].&lt;ref name=Neotropikey /&gt;

=== Differences with similar families ===
Brassicaceae have a bisymmetical corolla (left is mirrored by right, stem-side by out-side, but each quarter is not symmetrical), a septum dividing the fruit, lack [[stipule]]s and have simple (although sometimes deeply incised) leaves. The [[sister group|sister family]] [[Cleomaceae]] has [[Floral symmetry#Zygomorphic|bilateral symmetrical]] corollas (left is mirrored by right, but stem-side is different from out-side), stipules and mostly palmately divided leaves, and mostly no septum.&lt;ref name=Neotropikey /&gt; Capparaceae generally have a [[gynophore]], sometimes an [[androgynophore]], and a variable number of stamens.&lt;ref name=BioDis /&gt;

=== Phytochemistry ===
Almost all Brassicaceae have [[C3 carbon fixation]]. The only exceptions are a few ''[[Moricandia]]'' species, which have a hybrid system between C3 and [[C4 carbon fixation]], C4 fixation being more efficient in drought, high temperature and low nitrate availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Plant Family Brassicaceae: Contribution Towards Phytoremediation|series= Environmental Pollution|editors= Naser A.

They also contain enzymes called [[myrosinase]]s, that convert the glucosinolates into [[isothiocyanate]]s, [[thiocyanate]]s and [[nitrile]]s, which are toxic to many organisms, and so help guard against herbivory.&lt;ref name=HAW /&gt;

== Enemies ==
In New Zealand and Europe the plant is commonly preyed upon by the parasite ''[[Scaptomyza flava]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=N. A.|date=2004-01-01|title=History of an invader, Scaptomyza flava (Fallen, 1823) (Diptera: Drosophilidae)|journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=27–32|doi=10.1080/03014223.2004.9518356|issn=0301-4223}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Distribution ==
Brassicaceae can be found almost on the entire land surface of the planet, but the family is absent from Antarctica, and also absent from some areas in the tropics i.e. northeastern Brazil, the [[Congo basin]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and tropical [[Australasia]]. The area of origin of the family is possibly the [[Irano-Turanian Region]], where approximately 900 species occur in 150 different genera. About 530 of those 900 species are [[Endemism|endemics]]. Next in abundance comes the [[Mediterranean Region]], with around 630 species (290 of which are endemic) in 113 genera. The family is less prominent in the [[Saharo-Arabian Region]]—65 genera, 180 species of which 62 are endemic—and North America (comprising the [[North American Atlantic Region]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Floristic Region]])—99 genera, 780 species of which 600 are endemic -. South-America has 40 genera containing 340 native species, Southern Africa 15 genera with over 100 species, and Australia and New-Zealand have 19 genera with 114 species between them.&lt;ref name=SB /&gt;

== Ecology ==
Brassicaceae are almost exclusively [[Entomophily|pollinated by insects]]. A chemical mechanism in the pollen is active in many species to avoid [[selfing]]. Two notable exceptions are exclusive [[Cleistogamy|self pollination in closed flowers]] in ''[[Cardamine chenopodifolia]]'', and wind pollination in ''[[Pringlea|Pringlea antiscorbutica]]''.&lt;ref name=BioDis /&gt; Although it can be pollinated, ''[[Alliaria petiolata]]'' is self-fertile. Most species reproduce sexually through seed, but ''[[Cardamine bulbifera]]'' produces [[Gemma (botany)|gemmae]] and in others, such as ''[[Cardamine pentaphyllos]]'', the coral-like roots easily break into segments, that will grow into separate plants.&lt;ref name=BioDis /&gt; In some species, such as in the genus ''[[Cardamine]]'', seed pods open with force and so catapult the seeds quite far. Many of these have sticky seed coats, assisting long distance dispersal by animals, and this may also explain several intercontinental dispersal events in the genus, and its near global distribution. Brassicaceae are common on [[serpentine soil|serpentine]] and [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] rich in [[magnesium]]. Over a hundred species in the family accumulate [[heavy metals]], particularly [[zinc]] and [[nickel]], which is a record percentage.&lt;ref name=MOBOT&gt;{{cite web|website= MOBOT|title= Brassicales|url= http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/orders/brassicalesweb.htm#Brassicaceae|accessdate= 2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several ''Alyssum'' species can accumulate nickel up to 0.3% of their dry weight, and may be useful in [[soil remediation]] or even bio-mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Catherine L.|last1= Broadhurst|first2= Rufus L.|last2= Chaney|year= 2016|title= Growth and Metal Accumulation of an Alyssum murale Nickel Hyperaccumulator Ecotype Co-cropped with Alyssum montanum and Perennial Ryegrass in Serpentine Soil|journal= [[Frontiers in Plant Science]]|volume= 7|issue= 451|pages= 451|doi=10.3389/fpls.2016.00451|pmc=4824781|pmid=27092164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brassicaceae contain [[glucosinolate]]s as well as [[myrosinase]]s inside their cells. When the cell is damaged, the myrosinases [[Hydrolysis|hydrolise]] the glucosinolates, leading to the synthesis of [[isothiocyanate]]s, which are [[Plant defense against herbivory|compounds toxic to most animals]], fungi and bacteria. Some insect herbivores have developed counter adaptations such as rapid absorption of the glucosinates, quick alternative breakdown into non-toxic compounds and avoiding cell damage. In the whites family (Pieridae), one counter mechanisme involves glucosinolate sulphatase, which changes the glucosinolate, so that it cannot be converted to isothiocyanate. A second is that the glucosinates are quickly broken down, forming nitriles.&lt;ref name=HAW&gt;{{cite book|first= Harry Arthur|last= Woods|year= |title= Ecological and Environmental Physiology of Insects|volume= 3|series= Ecological and Environmental Physiology Series|publisher= Oxford biological}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between the mixtures of glucosinolates between species and even within species is large, and individual plants may produce in excess of fifty individual substances. The energy penalty for synthesising all these glucosinolates may be as high as 15% of the total needed to produce a leaf. ''[[Bittercress]]'' (''Barbarea vulgaris'') also produces [[triterpenoid saponin]]s. These adaptations and counter adaptations probably have led to extensive diversification in both the Brassicaceae and one of its major pests, the butterfly family [[Pieridae]]. A particular cocktail of volatile glucosinates triggers egg-laying in many species. Thus a particular crop can sometimes be protected by planting bittercress as a deadly bait, for the saponins kill the caterpillars, but the butterfly is still lured by the bittercress to lay its egg on the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Winde|first1= I|last2= Wittstock|first2= U.|title= Insect herbivore counteradaptations to the plant glucosinolate-myrosinase system|year= 2011|journal= Phytochemistry|volume= 72|issue= 13|pages= 1566–75|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2011.01.016|pmid=21316065}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A moth that feeds on a range of Brassicaceae is the [[diamondback moth]] (''Plutella xylostella''). Like the Pieridae, it is capable of converting isothiocyanates into less problematic [[nitrile]]s. Managing this pest in crops became more complicated after resistance developed against a toxin produced by ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'', which is used as a wide spectrum biological [[plant protection]] against caterpillars. [[Parasitoid]] wasps that feed on such insect herbivores are attracted to the chemical compounds released by the plants, and thus are able to locate their prey. The [[cabbage aphid]] (''Brevicoryne brassicae'') stores glucosinolates and synthesises its own myrosinases, which may deter its potential predators.&lt;ref name=MOBOT /&gt;

Since its introduction in the 19th century, ''[[Alliaria petiolata]]'' has been shown to be extremely successful as an [[invasive species]] in temperate North America due, in part, to its secretion of allelopathic chemicals. These inhibit the [[germination]] of most competing plants and kill beneficial soil [[fungi]] needed by many plants, such as many tree species, to successfully see their seedlings grow to maturity. The [[monoculture]] formation of an herb layer carpet by this plant has been shown to dramatically alter forests, making them wetter, having fewer and fewer trees, and having more vines such as poison ivy (''[[Toxicodendron radicans]]''). The overall herb layer [[biodiversity]] is also drastically reduced, particularly in terms of [[sedge]]s and [[forb]]s. Research has found that removing 80 percent of the garlic mustard [[infestation]] plants did not lead to a particularly significant recovery of that [[Biodiversity|diversity]]. Instead, it required around 100 percent removal. Given that not one of an estimated 76 [[species]] that [[prey]] on the plant has been approved for [[biological control]] in [[North America]] and the variety of mechanisms the plant has to ensure its dominance without them (e.g. high seed production, self-fertility, [[allelopathy]], spring growth that occurs before nearly all native plants, roots that break easily when pulling attempts are made, a complete lack of palatability for herbivores at all life stages, etc.) it is unlikely that such a high level of control can be established and maintained on the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Eubanks, HM.D., Hoffmann, J.H., Lewis, E.E., Liu, J., Melnick, R., Michaud, J.P., Ode, P., Pell, J.K., 2017.

This family includes important agricultural crops, among which many vegetables such as [[cabbage]], [[broccoli]], [[cauliflower]], [[kale]], [[Brussels sprouts]], [[collard greens]], [[savoy cabbage|Savoy]], [[kohlrabi]], and [[gai lan]]  (''[[Brassica oleracea]]''), [[turnip]], [[napa cabbage]], [[bomdong]], [[bok choy]] and [[rapini]] (''[[Brassica rapa]]''), [[rocket salad|rocket salad/arugula]] (''[[Eruca sativa]]''), [[garden cress]] (''[[Lepidium sativum]]''), [[watercress]] (''[[Nasturtium officinale]]'') and [[radish]] (''[[Raphanus]]'') and a few spices like [[horseradish]] (''[[Armoracia rusticana]]''), ''Brassica'', [[wasabi]] (''[[Eutrema japonicum]]''), white, Indian and black [[mustard plant|mustard]] (''[[Sinapis alba]]'', ''[[Brassica juncea]]'' and ''[[Brassica nigra|B. nigra]]'' respectively). Vegetable oil is produced from the seeds of several species such as ''[[Brassica napus]]'' (rapeseed oil), perhaps providing the largest volume of vegetable oils of any species. [[Woad]] (''[[Isatis tinctoria]]'') was used in the past to produce a blue textile dye ([[indigo]]), but has largely been replaced by the same substance from unrelated tropical species like ''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1= Carmine|last1= Guarino|first2= Paolo|last2= Casoria|first3= Bruno|last3= Menale|year= 2000|title= Cultivation and use of isatis tinctoria L.
