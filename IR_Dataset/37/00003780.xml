'''Bal Keshav Thackeray''' (also known as '''Balasaheb Thackeray''';   {{IPA-mr|ʈʰaːkəɾeː}}; 23 January 1926&amp;nbsp;– 17 November 2012) was an Indian politician who founded the [[Shiv Sena]], a right-wing pro-[[Marathi people|Marathi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBgLb8XIGR8C&amp;pg=PA179|title=The Modern Anthropology of India: Ethnography, Themes and Theory|last=Berger, Peter|last2=Heidemann, Frank|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134061110|location=|page=179|date=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hindu nationalist]] party active mainly in the state of [[Maharashtra]].

Thackeray began his professional career as a [[cartoonist]] with the English-language daily ''[[The Free Press Journal]]'' in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (now Mumbai), but he left the paper in 1960 to form his own political weekly, ''[[Marmik (periodical)|Marmik]]''. His political philosophy was largely shaped by his father [[Keshav Sitaram Thackeray]], a leading figure in the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|Samyukta Maharashtra]] (United Maharashtra) movement, which advocated the creation of a separate linguistic state for Marathi speakers. Through ''Marmik'', Bal Thackeray campaigned against the growing influence of non-Marathis in Bombay. In 1966, Thackeray formed the Shiv Sena party to advocate for the interests of [[Maharashtra]] in Bombay India political and professional landscape, and against certain segments of Bombay's Muslim population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time world&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaminsky&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hundreds of Thousands Mourn Indian Politician Thackeray|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/world/asia/hundreds-of-thousands-mourn-indian-politician-thackeray.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 18 November 2012|access-date = 8 February 2016|issn = 0362-4331|last = The New York Times|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171113003656/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/world/asia/hundreds-of-thousands-mourn-indian-politician-thackeray.html|archive-date = 13 November 2017|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Thackeray built the Shiv Sena by forming temporary alliances with nearly all of state's political parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaminsky&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaminsky|first1=Arnold P.|last2=Long|first2=Roger D.|title=India Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37462-3|pages=693–4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VVxlfDHGTFYC&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=|edition=illustrated|access-date=20 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205073008/https://books.google.com/books?id=VVxlfDHGTFYC&amp;pg=PA694&amp;dq=|archive-date=5 February 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thackeray was also the founder of the Marathi-language newspaper ''[[Saamana]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wan-ifra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.wan-press.org/3may/2000/profiles/IndiaGoenka.html|title = India|publisher = WAN-IFRA|accessdate = 30 September 2012|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410095734/http://www.wan-press.org/3may/2000/profiles/IndiaGoenka.html|archive-date = 10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the riots of 1992-93, he and his party took a [[Hindutva]] stance. In 1999, Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years on the recommendations of the Election Commission for indulging in seeking votes in the name of religion. Thackeray was arrested multiple times and spent a brief stint in prison, but he never faced any major legal repercussions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time world&quot; /&gt; Upon his death, he was accorded a [[state funeral]], at which many mourners were present. Thackeray did not hold any official positions, and he was never formally elected as the leader of his party.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

== Early life ==
Thackeray was born on 23 January 1926 in [[Pune]], the son of [[Keshav Sitaram Thackeray]] (also known as 'Prabodhankar') and his wife Ramabai Thackeray.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaminsky&quot; /&gt; The family belongs to the [[Marathi people|Marathi]] [[Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu]] or CKP community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai/milestones-in-the-life-of-sena-chief-bal-thackeray/article1-960556.aspx|title=Milestones in the life of Sena chief Bal Thackeray|website=hindustantimes|publisher=HT Media Limited.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120120712/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Milestones-in-the-life-of-Sena-chief-Bal-Thackeray/Article1-960556.aspx|archivedate=20 November 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;South Asia Bulletin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title = Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East | journal = South Asia Bulletin | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3-AUAQAAIAAJ | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | page = 116 | accessdate = 15 November 2012 | year = 1996 | publisher = University of California, Los Angeles | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032613/http://books.google.com/books?id=3-AUAQAAIAAJ | archive-date = 2 May 2014 | url-status = live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bal was the eldest of eight siblings, among them being brothers Shrikant Thackeray (father of [[Raj Thackeray]]) and Ramesh Thackeray, and five sisters (Sanjeevani Karandikar, Prabhavati (Pama) Tipnis, Sudha Sule, Sarla Gadkari and Susheela Gupte).

Bal's father, Keshav Thackeray, was a journalist and cartoonist by profession; he was also a social activist and writer who was involved in the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Movement]] of the 1950s, which argued for the creation of a unified state called Maharashtra for [[Marathi language|Marathi]]-speaking areas with [[Mumbai|Bombay]] as its capital. Bal Thackeray was inspired by his father's political philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time world&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Firebrand Who Renamed Bombay: Bal Thackeray (1926–2012)|url=http://world.time.com/2012/11/17/the-firebrand-who-renamed-bombay-bal-thackeray-1926-2012/|publisher=17 November 2012 Time World|accessdate=14 June 2013|date=17 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123041712/http://world.time.com/2012/11/17/the-firebrand-who-renamed-bombay-bal-thackeray-1926-2012/|archive-date=23 November 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Thackeray began his career as a cartoonist in the ''[[Free Press Journal]]'' in Bombay. His cartoons were also published in the Sunday edition of ''[[The Times of India]]''. In 1960, he launched the cartoon weekly ''[[Marmik]]'' with his brother Srikant.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; He used it to campaign against the growing numbers and influence of non-Marathi people in Bombay, targeting the South Indian population. After Thackeray's differences with the ''Free Press Journal'', he and four or five people, including politician [[George Fernandes]], left the paper and started their own daily, ''News Day''. The paper survived for one or two months.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Pinto, Naresh Fernandes. Bombay, Meri Jaan: Writings on Mumbai, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1966–1998 ====
The success of ''Maarmik'' prompted Thackeray to form the [[Shiv Sena]] on 19 June 1966. The name &quot;Shiv Sena&quot; ([[Shivaji]]'s Army) was after the 17th century [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] king. Initially, Thackeray said it was not a political party but an army of Shivaji Maharaj, inclined to fight for the Marathi ''manoos'' (person).&lt;ref name=&quot;Prakash2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Gyan Prakash|title = Mumbai Fables|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TeRWxaJLoDUC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate = 4 December 2012|date = 21 September 2010|publisher = Princeton University Press|isbn = 978-0-691-15317-9|pages = 228–237|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205073008/https://books.google.com/books?id=TeRWxaJLoDUC&amp;pg=PA232|archive-date = 5 February 2016|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It demanded that native speakers of the state's local language [[Marathi language|Marathi]] (the &quot;sons of the soil&quot; movement) be given preferential treatment in private and public sector jobs. The early objective of the Shiv Sena was to ensure their job security competing against [[South Indian]]s and [[Gujaratis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; In its 1966 party manifesto, Thackeray primarily blamed south Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why no one dared to mess with Shiv Sena? : Special Report - India Today|url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bal-thackeray-death-shiv-sena-harvester-of-fear/1/234428.html|website = indiatoday.intoday.in|access-date = 9 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160216185141/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bal-thackeray-death-shiv-sena-harvester-of-fear/1/234428.html|archive-date = 16 February 2016|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Marmik'', Thackeray published a list of corporate officials from a local directory, many being south Indians, citing it as proof that Maharashtrians were being discriminated against.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prakash2010&quot; /&gt;

His party grew in the next ten years. Senior leaders such as [[Babasaheb Purandare]], chief attorney for Trade Union of Maharashtra Madhav Mehere joined the party and chartered architect Madhav Gajanan Deshpande backed various aspects of the party operations. In 1969, Thackeray and [[Manohar Joshi]] were jailed after participating in a protest demanding the merger of [[Karwar]], [[Belgaum border dispute|Belgaum]] and [[Nipani]] regions in Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Obituary: Bal Thackeray-the tiger who ruled Mumbai : Bal Thackeray, News - India Today|url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bal-keshav-thackeray-obituary/1/229596.html|website = indiatoday.intoday.in|access-date = 11 February 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160216190808/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bal-keshav-thackeray-obituary/1/229596.html|archive-date = 16 February 2016|url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, it did not succeed in the local elections and it was active mainly in Bombay, compared to the rest of the state.

In 2008, following agitation against [[Biharis]] and other north Indians travelling to Maharashtra to take civil service examinations for the [[Indian Railways]] due to an overlimit of the quota in their home provinces, Thackeray also said of Bihari MPs that they were &quot;spitting in the same plate from which they ate&quot; when they criticised Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians.

===Opposition to Caste Based Reservations===
Thackeray firmly opposed caste based reservation and said - &quot;There are only two castes in the world, the rich are rich and the poor is poor, make the poor rich but don't make the rich poor. Besides these two castes I don't believe in any other casteism.&quot;
The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) supported caste based reservations based on the Mandal commission. Thackarey, despite being warned that opposition to the reservations would be politically suicidal for the Shiv Sena party, opposed the BJP over this issue and said he would initiate &quot;divorce proceedings against the BJP&quot;  if the BJP supported caste based reservations. This also let to his conflict with Chhagan Bhujbal, an OBC, who later left the Shiv Sena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bal Thackeray and the rise of Shiv Sena|publisher=Roli Books|author= Vaibhav Purandare|year=2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JS1hBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT178#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=178|isbn=9788174369918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-images-bal-thackeray-s-portraits-from-the-past/20121117.htm|title=Bal Thackeray on casteism|publisher=rediff news|year=2012|access-date=24 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190124152351/https://www.rediff.com/news/slide-show/slide-show-1-images-bal-thackeray-s-portraits-from-the-past/20121117.htm|archive-date=24 January 2019|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar===
Thackeray defended [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar]] against criticism and praised him as a great leader. In 2002, when [[President of India|President]] [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]] unveiled a portrait of Savarkar in the presence of [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the Congress Party opposed the unveiling of the portrait and boycotted the function. Thackeray criticised the opposition and said &quot;Who is [Congress president and Leader of the Opposition] [[Sonia Gandhi]] to object to the portrait? What relation does she have with the country? How much does she know about the history and culture of India?&quot;. Years later, when Congress General Secretary [[Digvijaya Singh]] made a statement that Savarkar was the first to suggest the two-nation theory that led to the partition, Thackeray defended Savarkar and accused Singh of distorting history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/thackeray-defends-savarkar-over-digvijays-statement/articleshow/7396685.cms|title=Thackeray defends Savarkar over Digvijay's statement|date=31 January 2011|publisher=|via=The Economic Times|access-date=25 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925142133/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/thackeray-defends-savarkar-over-digvijays-statement/articleshow/7396685.cms|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/2003/mar/05bal.htm|title=Savarkar was a great leader: Thackeray|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=24 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021170309/http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/mar/05bal.htm|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for Kashmiri Pandits ===
In 1990, the Islamic militant organisation [[Hizbul Mujahideen]], through the columns of an Urdu daily ''Aftab'', warned [[Kashmiri Pandits]] to leave the valley within 36 hours. Bal Thackeray got seats reserved in engineering colleges for the children of these [[Kashmiri Pandits]] in Maharashtra. He was one of the first persons to help them after which Punjab also followed suit. At a meeting with them he supported the idea that the [[Kashmiri Pandits]] could be armed for their self-defence against the Jihadis.
