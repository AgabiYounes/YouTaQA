==Biography==

===Early life===
Björn Kristian Ulvaeus was born in [[Gothenburg]] on 25 April 1945. In 1951, he moved with his family to [[Västervik]], [[Kalmar County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://abbaarticles.blogspot.com/2011/02/mix-1977-how-first-performance-by.html|title = How the first performance by Agnetha, Björn, Benny and Anni-Frid turned into an enormous failure|date = February 2011|work = [[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Aina Eliza Viktoria (née Bengtsson; 1909–2005) and Erik Gunnar Ulvaeus (1912–1999). Ulvaeus has one sister, Eva Margareta (born 1948). Ulvaeus studied business and law at [[Lund University]] after undertaking his [[Swedish Armed Forces|military service]], alongside comedian Magnus Holmström.

===Career===
[[File:Hootenanny Singers.jpg|thumb|left|Björn Ulvaeus (second from right) with [[Hootenanny Singers]]]]
Before gaining international recognition with [[ABBA]], Ulvaeus was a member of the Swedish folk-[[schlager]] band [[Hootenanny Singers]], known earlier as the &quot;West Bay Singers&quot;, who had an enormous following in [[Scandinavia]]. While on the road in southern Sweden in 1966, they encountered the [[Hep Stars]], and Ulvaeus quickly became friends with the group's keyboard player, [[Benny Andersson]]. The two musicians shared a passion for songwriting, and each found a composing partner in the other. On meeting again that summer, they composed their first song together: &quot;Isn't It Easy To Say&quot;, a song soon to be recorded by Andersson's group. The two continued teaming up for music, helping out each other's bands in the recording studio, and adding guitar or keyboards respectively to the recordings. In 1968, they composed two songs together: &quot;A Flower in My Garden&quot;, recorded by [[Hep Stars]], and their first &quot;real&quot; hit &quot;Ljuva Sextiotal&quot;, for which [[Stig Anderson]] wrote lyrics. The latter, a cabarét-style ironic song about the 1960s, was submitted for the 1969 Swedish heats for the [[Eurovision|Eurovision Song Contest]], but was rejected; it was later recorded by diva [[Brita Borg]]. Another hit came in 1969 with &quot;Speleman&quot;, also recorded by Hep Stars.

While filming a nostalgic schlager special for television in March 1969, Björn met eighteen-year-old future wife and singer-songwriter [[Agnetha Fältskog]]. Benny also met his future spouse, 23-year-old jazz and schlager vocalist [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]], only weeks before.

Björn Ulvaeus continued recording and touring with Hootenanny Singers to great acclaim while working as in-house producer at [[Polar Record Company]] (headed by future manager [[Stig Anderson]]), with Benny as his new partner. The twosome produced records by other artists and continued writing songs together. Polar artist Arne Lamberts Swedish version of &quot;A Flower in My Garden&quot; (&quot;''Fröken Blåklint''&quot;) was one of Björn &amp; Benny's first in-house productions. In December 1969, they recorded the new song &quot;She's My Kind of Girl&quot;, which became their first single as a duo.  It was released in March 1970, giving them a minor hit in Sweden and a top-ten hit in Japan two years later.

The Hootenanny Singers entered [[Svensktoppen]], the Swedish radio charts, in 1970 with &quot;Omkring Tiggarn Från Luossa&quot;, a cover of an old folk-schlager song.  It remained on the charts for 52 consecutive weeks, a record which endured until 1990; the song was produced by Björn and Benny, and had Ulvaeus's solo vocal and Benny's piano.

After ABBA went on hiatus in 1982, Ulvaeus and Andersson created the musicals ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'', a collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/05/1025667057155.html |title=	 Happily ABBA after |date=6 July 2002 |first=Peter |last=Paphides |newspaper=smh.com.au |accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kristina från Duvemåla]]'' (based on ''[[The Emigrants (novels)|The Emigrants]]'' novels by Swedish writer [[Vilhelm Moberg]]), and ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'' (based on ABBA songs).

Together with Andersson, Ulvaeus was nominated for the [[Drama Desk Award]] in the category &quot;Outstanding Music&quot; (for the musical ''Chess''), and for a [[Tony Award]] in a category &quot;Best Orchestrations&quot; (for the musical ''Mamma Mia!''). The original cast recordings for both musicals were nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].

For the 2004 semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest in [[Istanbul]], thirty years after ABBA had won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 contest]] in [[Brighton]], UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutcliffe|first1=Libby|title=Abba's Eurovision win in Brighton remembered 40 years on|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-26901044|work=BBC|date=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ulvaeus appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled &quot;Our Last Video&quot;. Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] roles, as did others such as [[Cher]] and [[Rik Mayall]]. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split. In fact, they each filmed their appearances separately.

Ulvaeus also shared with Andersson &quot;The Special International [[Ivor Novello]] Award&quot; from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors]], &quot;The Music Export Prize&quot; from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 &quot;The Government's Music Export Prize for 2008 goes to...&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314085034/http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/11367/a/118215 |date=14 March 2012 }}. Sweden.gov.se (7 January 2009). Retrieved on 22 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; from the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF).

On 15 April 2013, it was officially announced by the [[EBU]] and the [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] that Ulvaeus and Andersson, with the Late Swedish DJ and record producer [[Avicii]], had composed the anthem for the [[2013 Eurovision Song Contest]]. The song was performed for the first time in the Final on 18 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=abbas_benny_bjoern_and_aviccii_to_write_eurovision_anthem|title=ABBA's Benny, Björn and Avicii to write 'Eurovision anthem'|work=[[EBU]]|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 Ulvaeus worked with Swedish songwriter [[Andreas Carlsson]] to arrange an English dub of [[Tomas Ledin|Tomas Ledin's]] [[jukebox musical]] film ''[[En del av mitt hjärta (film)|En del av mitt hjärta]]'' ([[English language|English]]: ''A Piece of My Heart'') directed by [[Edward af Sillén]]. Ulvaeus was asked to write English lyrics for Ledin's songs as they are long term friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bjorn Dub&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last1=PHAM |first1=ANNIKA |title=ABBA touch to musical comedy A Piece of My Heart |url=http://www.nordiskfilmogtvfond.com/news/stories/abba-touch-to-musical-comedy-a-piece-of-my-heart |website=Nordisk Film &amp; TV Fond |accessdate=18 December 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
On 6 July 1971, Ulvaeus married [[Agnetha Fältskog]]; the marriage resulted in two children: [[Linda Ulvaeus|Linda Elin Ulvaeus]] (born 23 February 1973), and [[Christian Ulvaeus|Peter Christian Ulvaeus]] (born 4 December 1977). The couple decided to separate in early 1979, and their divorce was finalised in July 1980. Ulvaeus then married music journalist Lena Källersjö on 6 January 1981. This marriage produced two daughters: Emma Eleonora (born 3 January 1982) and Anna Linnea (born 29 April 1986).

Ulvaeus and Källersjö currently live in [[Djursholm]], an area of [[Stockholm]]. From 1984 to 1990 they lived in the [[United Kingdom]], where Ulvaeus founded an IT business with his brother.

He is also one of four people (including [[Per Gessle]]) who own NoteHeads, a Swedish company which publishes the [[Scorewriter|music notation program]] [[Igor Engraver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noteheads.com/noteheads/noteheads.html |title=Noteheads.com – Corporate |accessdate=29 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928005121/http://www.noteheads.com/noteheads/noteheads.html |archivedate=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ulvaeus is a member of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]'s Swedish member organisation [[Humanisterna]], and was awarded their annual prize, ''Hedenius-priset'', in 2006.  Ulvaeus describes himself as an atheist. He has gone on several shows and interviews discussing his views about religion and why he is an agnostic .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/node/2298 |title=Björn Ulvaeus speaks on Humanism |accessdate=3 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207141100/http://www.iheu.org/node/2298 |archivedate=7 February 2012|work=International Humanist|date=14 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ulvaeus said that he suffered from severe [[long-term memory]] loss and now no longer remembers many important events in his life.  He now has little memory of some of the critical events in his professional history and has resorted to images of his past and even [[hypnotism]] to try to bring back his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1035412/Abba-star-Bjorns-shock-admission-Im-battling-long-term-memory-loss.html |title = Abba star Bjorn's shock admission: 'I'm battling long-term memory loss'|accessdate = 16 July 2008 | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Marcus | last=Oscarsson | date=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a 2009 interview, he stated that reports of his memory loss were &quot;hugely exaggerated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2009/09/02/bjorn-abba-will-never-reunite-375934/|title=Björn: 'Abba will never reunite'|work=Metro|date=2 September 2009|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a TV interview with Fredrik Skavlan, Ulvaeus said the memory loss pertained to [[episodic memory]]. He said that, for instance, he was not nostalgic for his days with ABBA: &quot;It was good while it lasted.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media|author=Skavlan|title=Björn Ulvaeus Interview (English Subtitles) {{!}} ABBA {{!}} Skavlan|date=26 September 2014|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IePHjAdNtmw|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' called him Sweden's &quot;highest-profile cash-free campaigner&quot;, explaining that &quot;after his son was robbed several years ago, Ulvaeus became an evangelist for the electronic payment movement, claiming that cash was the primary cause of crime and that 'all activity in the [[Black market|black economy]] requires cash'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Helen|title=Welcome to Sweden – the most cash-free society on the planet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/11/welcome-sweden-electronic-money-not-so-funny|work=The Guardian|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has reportedly been living cash-free for more than a year, and [[ABBA The Museum]] has operated cash-free since it opened in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ulvaeus|first1=Björn|title=Why we don't accept cash at ABBA the Museum|url=http://www.abbathemuseum.com/en/cashless-EN|website=ABBA the Museum|accessdate=15 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129030222/http://www.abbathemuseum.com/en/cashless-EN|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax vindication===

The [[Swedish Tax Agency]] accused Björn Ulvaeus of failing to pay 90 million [[Swedish krona|kronor]] (US$12.8&amp;nbsp;million) in [[back taxes]] for eight years ending in 2005. The agency claimed that he &quot;[[Money laundering|laundered]]&quot; his music [[Royalties|royalty]] income through institutions in several foreign countries. Ulvaeus paid the taxes as a precautionary measure during the 2½-year dispute. In October 2008, the county administrative court decided the case in Ulvaeus' favour, ruling that he never owed any of the 90 million kronor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/music/abba-star-bjorn-wins-17m-tax-case/2008/10/15/1223750070878.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=ABBA's Bjorn wins $17m tax case | date=15 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b54103_swedens_taxman_after_abbas_ulvaeus_again.html &quot;Sweden's Taxman After ABBA's Ulvaeus Again&quot;], ''E!
