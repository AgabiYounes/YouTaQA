[[File:A Corner of Bundestag, Aug 2016.png|alt=Southeaster corner of Bundestag.|thumb|Southeastern corner of Bundestag.]]
The '''Bundestag''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbʊndəstaːk}}, ‘Federal [[diet (assembly)|Diet]]’) is the [[Germany|German]] federal [[parliament]]. It can be compared to the [[lower house|chamber of deputies]] along the lines of the [[United States House of Representatives]] or the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]].

Through the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the individual states ([[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]) of Germany participate in legislation similar to a second house in a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament. According to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] however&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grundgesetz für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland|date=8 May 1949|publisher=Parlamentarischer Rat|location=Bonn|edition=23.12.2014|url=https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/10060000.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Grundgesetz}}), these two chambers form constitutional bodies principally separate from each other, so to say not forming ''the'' German parliament, but they work closely together in most aspects of lawmaking on the federal level.

The Bundestag was established by article III of the ''Grundgesetz'' in 1949 as one of the legislative bodies of Germany and thus the historical successor to the earlier [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].

Since 1999 it has met in the [[Reichstag Building]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wegderdemokratie.de/en/plenarsaal-deutscher-bundestag|title=Plenarsaal „Deutscher Bundestag“ – The Path of Democracy|website=www.wegderdemokratie.de|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Schäuble]] is the current [[President of the Bundestag]]. Members of the Bundestag ({{lang-de|Mitglieder des Bundestages}}) are usually elected every four years by all adult German citizens in a mixed system of constituency voting and list voting. The constitutional minimum number of seats is 598; with [[overhang seat|overhang]] and [[leveling seat]]s there are currently 709 seats. The Election Day can be called earlier than four years after the last if the Federal [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] ({{lang-de|Bundeskanzler}}) loses a [[motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] and asks the Federal [[President of Germany|President]] ({{lang-de|Bundespräsident}}) to dissolve the Bundestag in order to hold new general elections.

In the 19th century, the name Bundestag was the unofficial designation for the assembly of the sovereigns and mayors of the Monarchies and Free Cities which formed the [[German Confederation]] (1815–1866). Its seat was in the [[Free City of Frankfurt]] on the Main.

==History==
Bundestag translates accurately as &quot;League Council&quot;, literally meaning &quot;bound day&quot;. &quot;Tag&quot; (day) came to mean &quot;sitting in conference&quot; — another example being [[Reichstag (disambiguation)|Reichstag]] — because a council gathering would happen on a given day of the week, month, or year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=bundestag Online Etymology Dictionary — Bundestag]&lt;/ref&gt;

With the dissolution of the [[German Confederation]] in 1866 and the founding of the [[German Empire]] ([[Deutsches Reich]]) in 1871, the Reichstag was established as the German parliament in Berlin, which was the capital of the then [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (the largest and most influential state in both the Confederation and the empire). Two decades later, the current parliament building was erected. The Reichstag delegates were elected by direct and equal male suffrage (and not the [[Prussian three-class franchise|three-class electoral system]] prevailing in Prussia until 1918). The Reichstag did not participate in the appointment of the Chancellor until the parliamentary reforms of October 1918. After the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of November 1918]] and the establishment of the Weimar Constitution, women were given the right to vote for (and serve in) the Reichstag, and the parliament could use the no-confidence vote to force the chancellor or any cabinet member to resign. In March 1933, one month after the [[Reichstag fire]], the then President of the Weimar Republic, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a retired war hero, gave [[Adolf Hitler]] ultimate power through the [[Reichstag Fire Decree|Decree for the Protection of People and State]] and the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], although Hitler remained at the post of Federal Government Chancellor (though he called himself the Führer). After this, the Reichstag met only rarely, usually at the [[Kroll Opera House#1933-1951: Seat of the Reichstag and destruction|''Krolloper'']] (Kroll Opera House) to unanimously rubber-stamp the decisions of the government. It last convened on 26 April 1942.

With the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|new Constitution of 1949]], the Bundestag was established as the new West German parliament. Because [[West Berlin]] was not officially under the jurisdiction of the Constitution, a legacy of the [[Cold War]], the Bundestag met in [[Bonn]] in several different buildings, including (provisionally) a former waterworks facility. In addition, owing to the city's legal status, citizens of West Berlin were unable to vote in elections to the Bundestag, and were instead represented by 22 non-voting delegates&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F54jJBcrs50C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=bundestag+west+berlin+22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fHvcgFedJi&amp;sig=TOHuagAFxKdwr04qEslLTYLQzyM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQxITa37PKAhUC1hQKHddqCikQ6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=bundestag%20west%20berlin%2022&amp;f=true ''Germany at the Polls: The Bundestag Elections of the 1980s''], Karl H. Cerny, Duke University Press, 1990, page 34&lt;/ref&gt; chosen by the [[House of Representatives of Berlin|House of Representatives]], the city's legislature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/GERMANY_FEDERAL_REPUBLIC_1980.PDF GERMANY (FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF) Date of Elections: 5 October 1980], [[International Parliamentary Union]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|Bundeshaus in Bonn]] is the former parliament building of Germany. The sessions of the German Bundestag were held there from 1949 until its move to Berlin in 1999. Today it houses the International Congress Centre Bundeshaus Bonn and in the northern areas the branch office of the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] (&quot;Federal Council&quot;), which represents the ''Länder'' – the federated states). The southern areas became part of German offices for the [[United Nations]] in 2008.

The former [[Reichstag building]] housed a history exhibition (''Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte'') and served occasionally as a conference center. The Reichstag building was also occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the [[Bundesversammlung (German Confederation)|Bundesversammlung]] (Federal Assembly), the body which elects the German Federal President. However, the Soviets harshly protested against the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and tried to disturb the sittings by flying supersonic jets close to the building.

Since April 19, 1999, the German parliament has again assembled in [[Berlin]] in its original [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]], which was built in 1888 based on the plans of German architect Paul Wallot and underwent a significant renovation under the lead of British architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Lord Norman Foster]]. Parliamentary committees and subcommittees, public hearings and parliamentary group meetings take place in three auxiliary buildings, which surround the Reichstag building: the ''Jakob-Kaiser-Haus'', ''Paul-Löbe-Haus'' and ''Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus''.

In 2005, a small aircraft crashed close to the German Parliament. It was then decided to ban private air traffic over Central Berlin.

Together with the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]], the Bundestag is the [[legislative branch]] of the [[Politics of Germany|German political system]].

Although most legislation is initiated by the executive branch, the Bundestag considers the legislative function its most important responsibility, concentrating much of its energy on assessing and amending the government's legislative program. The committees (see below) play a prominent role in this process. Plenary sessions provide a forum for members to engage in public debate on legislative issues before them, but they tend to be well attended only when significant legislation is being considered.

The Bundestag members are the only federal officials directly elected by the public; the Bundestag in turn elects the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] and, in addition, exercises oversight of the executive branch on issues of both substantive policy and routine administration. This check on executive power can be employed through binding legislation, public debates on government policy, investigations, and direct questioning of the chancellor or cabinet officials. For example, the Bundestag can conduct a question hour (''Fragestunde''), in which a government representative responds to a previously submitted written question from a member. Members can ask related questions during the question hour. The questions can concern anything from a major policy issue to a specific constituent's problem. Use of the question hour has increased markedly over the past forty years, with more than 20,000 questions being posed during the 1987-90 term. Understandably, the opposition parties are active in exercising the parliamentary right to scrutinize government actions.

Constituent service does also take place in the form of the Petition Committee. In 2004, the Petition Committee received over 18,000 complaints from citizens and was able to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution to more than half of them. In 2005, as a pilot of the potential of [[internet petition]]s, a version of [[e-Petitioner]] was produced for the Bundestag. This was a collaborative project involving The [[Scottish Parliament]], [[International Teledemocracy Centre]] and the Bundestag ‘Online Services Department’. The system was formally launched on 1 September 2005, and in 2008 the Bundestag moved to a new system based on its evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tab.fzk.de/de/brief/brief32.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316102923/http://www.tab.fzk.de/de/brief/brief32.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 March 2009 |title=''Öffentliche Petitionen beim deutschen Bundestag - erste Ergebnisse der Evaluation des Modellversuchs'' = An Evaluation Study of Public Petitions at the German Parliament'' |accessdate=16 June 2009 |last=Trenel |first=M. |work=TAB Brief Nr 32 |publisher=Deutscher Bundestag |year=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electoral term ==
The Bundestag is elected for four years, and new elections must be held between 46 and 48 months after the beginning of its electoral term, unless the Bundestag is dissolved prematurely. Its term ends when the next Bundestag convenes, which must occur within 30 days of the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Electoral term&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0197 ||title= Basic Law, Article 39: Electoral term – Convening| accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1976, there could be a period where one Bundestag had been dissolved and the next Bundestag could not be convened; during this period, the rights of the Bundestag were exercised by a so-called &quot;Permanent Committee&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |language=German |page=28 ||title=Der Bundestag: Eine Darstellung seiner Aufgaben und seiner Arbeitsweise |trans-title=The Bundestag: Its tasks and procedures|last= Schäfer| first=Friedrich |isbn=9783322836434 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JefKBgAAQBAJ |date=2013 |publisher=VS Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The historical reasons for this constitutional arrangement (Weimar + 1976) should possibly be discussed --&gt;
&lt;!-- Parts of the following section should probably be moved here and the section heading changed to &quot;Electoral term and premature dissolution&quot; --&gt;

==Election==
Members serve four-year terms, with elections held every four years, or earlier in the relatively rare case that the Bundestag is dissolved prematurely by the [[President of Germany|president]]. The Bundestag can be dissolved by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor if the latter has lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag if the recommendation is made and accepted before the Bundestag acts to elect a new Chancellor. This has happened three times: 1972 under Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], 1983 under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] and 2005 under Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]. The procedures for these situations are governed by Articles 67 and 68 of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Law regarding the election procedure itself is the Federal Election Act 1956 (Bundeswahlgesetz/BWahlG)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text des Bundeswahlgesetz (BWahlG)|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bwahlg/|website=gesetz-im-internet.de|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All candidates must be at least eighteen years old; there are no term limits. The election uses the [[Mixed member proportional representation|MMP electoral system]]. In addition, the Bundestag has a minimum threshold of either 5% of the national party vote or three (directly elected) constituency representatives for a [[political party|party]] to gain additional representation through the system of proportional representation. Thus, small minority parties cannot easily enter the Bundestag and prevent the formation of stable majority governments as they could under the Weimar constitution.

The most recent election, the [[2017 German federal election]], was held on 24 September 2017.

===Distribution of seats in the Bundestag===
{{See also|List of German Bundestag constituencies}}
[[File:Bundestagswahl 05 stimmzett.jpg|thumb|right|Bundestag ballot: constituency vote on left, party list (showing top five list candidates) vote on right]]
Half of the Members of the Bundestag are elected directly from 299 constituencies (using the [[first-past-the-post system]]), whilst the other half are elected from the parties’ Land lists in such a way as to achieve [[proportional representation]] for the total Bundestag (if possible).

Accordingly, each voter has two votes in the elections to the Bundestag. The first vote, allowing voters to elect their local representatives to the Bundestag, decides which candidates are sent to Parliament from the constituencies.

The second vote is cast for a party list; it determines the relative strengths of the parties represented in the Bundestag.

At least 598 Members of the Bundestag are elected in this way. Parties that gain more than 5% of the second votes or win at least three direct mandates are allocated seats in the Bundestag in proportion to the number of votes it has received ([[d'Hondt method]] until 1987, [[largest remainder method]] until the 2005 election, and now the [[Sainte-Laguë method]]).

In addition to this, there are certain circumstances in which some candidates win what are known as [[overhang seat]]s when the seats are being distributed. If a party has gained more direct mandates in a Land than it is entitled to according to the results of the second vote: it does not forfeit these mandates because all directly elected candidates are guaranteed a seat in the Bundestag. The other parties are then compensated by getting additional seats as well: the ''balance seats'', and thus, proportionality is preserved.

==Election result==

The last Federal elections were held on Sunday, 24 September 2017, to elect the members of the 19th Bundestag.

The election saw the CDU/CSU win 33% of the vote, a drop of more than 8% and its lowest share of the vote since [[1949 West German federal election|1949]], while the SPD achieved its worst result since the [[World War II|Second World War]] with just 20% of the vote. [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD)—which was previously unrepresented in the Bundestag—became the third party in the Bundestag with 12.6% of the vote and a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the vote in [[Saxony]]. No party won an outright majority in any state, including Bavaria, where the CSU often wins majorities and won a majority of the vote in 2013.

===Parliamentary groups===
The most important organisational structures within the Bundestag are [[fraction (politics)|parliamentary groups]] (''Fraktionen''; sing. ''Fraktion''), which are traditionally formed by political parties who win at least 5% of the &quot;second vote.&quot; The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] and [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] have always formed a [[CDU/CSU|single united ''Fraktion'']]. The size of a party's ''Fraktion'' determines the extent of its representation on legislative committees, the time slots allotted for speaking, the number of committee chairs it can hold, and its representation in executive bodies of the Bundestag. The ''Fraktionen,'' not the members, receive the bulk of government funding for legislative and administrative activities.

The leadership of each ''Fraktion'' consists of a parliamentary party leader, several deputy leaders, and an executive committee. The leadership's major responsibilities are to represent the ''Fraktion,'' enforce party discipline and orchestrate the party's parliamentary activities. The members of each ''Fraktion'' are distributed among [[working group]]s focused on specific policy-related topics such as social policy, economics, and foreign policy. The ''Fraktion'' meets every Tuesday afternoon in the weeks in which the Bundestag is in session to consider legislation before the Bundestag and formulate the party's position on it.

Parties that do not cross the 5% threshold but win at least three seats by direct elections (i.e. which have at least three MPs representing a constituency seat) can be granted the status of a ''group'' in the Bundestag. This applied to the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) from 1990-1998. This status entails some privileges which are in general less than those of a ''Fraktion''. In the current Bundestag, there are no such groups (the PDS had only two constituency MPs in parliament until 2005 and could thus not even considered a group anymore; the party—now [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]—has held full ''Fraktion'' status in the Bundestag since 2005).

===Executive bodies===
The Bundestag's executive bodies include the [[Council of Elders of the Bundestag (Germany)|Council of Elders]] and the [[Presidium of the Bundestag|Presidium]]. The council consists of the Bundestag leadership, together with the most senior representatives of each ''Fraktion'', with the number of these representatives tied to the strength of the Parliamentary groups in the chamber. The council is the coordination hub, determining the daily legislative agenda and assigning committee chairpersons based on Parliamentary group representation. The council also serves as an important forum for interparty negotiations on specific legislation and procedural issues. The Presidium is responsible for the routine administration of the Bundestag, including its clerical and research activities. It consists of the chamber's president (usually elected from the largest ''Fraktion'') and vice presidents (one from each ''Fraktion'').

===Committees===
Most of the legislative work in the Bundestag is the product of standing committees, which exist largely unchanged throughout one legislative period. The number of committees approximates the number of federal ministries, and the titles of each are roughly similar (e.g., defense, agriculture, and labor). There are, as of the current nineteenth Bundestag, 24 standing committees. The distribution of committee chairs and the membership of each committee reflect the relative strength of the various Parliamentary groups in the chamber. In the current nineteenth Bundestag, the [[CDU/CSU]] chaired ten committees, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] five, the [[Alternative for Germany|AfD]] and the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] three each, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens]] two each. Members of the opposition party can chair a significant number of standing committees (e.g. the budget committee is always chaired by the biggest opposition party). These committees have either a small staff or no staff at all.

==Principle of discontinuation==
As is the case with some other parliaments, the Bundestag is subject to the ''principle of discontinuation'', meaning that a newly elected Bundestag is legally regarded to be a body and entity completely different from the previous Bundestag. This leads to the result that any motion, application or action submitted to the previous Bundestag, e.g. a bill referred to the Bundestag by the Federal Government, is regarded as void by non-decision (German terminology: &quot;''Die Sache fällt der Diskontinuität anheim''&quot;). Thus any bill that has not been decided upon by the beginning of the new electoral period must be brought up by the government again if it aims to uphold the motion, this procedure in effect delaying the passage of the bill. Furthermore, any newly elected Bundestag will have to freshly decide on the rules of procedure (''Geschäftsordnung''), which is done by a formal decision of taking over such rules from the preceding Bundestag by reference.

Any Bundestag is considered dissolved only once a newly elected Bundestag has actually gathered in order to constitute itself (Article&amp;nbsp;39 sec.&amp;nbsp;1 sentence&amp;nbsp;2 of the Basic Law), which has to happen within 30 days of its election (Article&amp;nbsp;39 sec.&amp;nbsp;2 of the Basic Law). Thus, it may happen (and has happened) that the old Bundestag gathers and makes decisions even after the election of a new Bundestag that has not gathered in order to constitute itself. For example, elections to the 16th Bundestag took place on 18 September 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/wahlen/pm-wahl-16-dbt/pd040211.htm |title=Verkürzte Fristen zur vorgezogenen Neuwahl des Deutschen Bundestages |access-date=20 October 2008 |publisher=[[Federal Returning Officer|Bundeswahlleiter]] |date=25 July 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007072932/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/wahlen/pm-wahl-16-dbt/pd040211.htm |archive-date=7 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the 15th Bundestag still convened after election day to make some decisions on German military engagement abroad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btp/15/15187.pdf |title=Stenographischer Bericht der 187.
