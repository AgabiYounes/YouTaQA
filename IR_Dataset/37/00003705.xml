The '''Bosporus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|s|p|ər|ə|s}}) or '''Bosphorus''' ({{IPAc-en|-|p|ər|-|,_|-|f|ər|-}};&lt;ref name=spelling&gt;The spelling ''Bosporus'' is listed first or exclusively in all major British and American dictionaries (e.g. [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bosporus?q=Bosphorus Oxford Online Dictionaries], [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/bosporus Collins], [https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/bosporus Longman], Merriam-Webster, [https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Bosporus American Heritage], and Random House) as well as the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and the [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/bosporus ''Columbia Encyclopedia'']. The ''American Heritage Dictionary''{{'}}s online version has only this spelling and its search function does not even find anything for the spelling ''Bosphorus''. The ''Columbia Encyclopedia'' specifies that the pronunciation of the alternative spelling ''ph'' is also /p/, but dictionaries also list the pronunciation /f/.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|Βόσπορος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Bosporos}} {{IPA-el|bós.po.ros|}}; also known as the '''Strait of Istanbul'''; {{lang-tr|İstanbul Boğazı}}) is a narrow, natural [[strait]] and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern [[Turkey]]. It forms part of the continental boundary between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], and divides Turkey by separating [[Anatolia]] from [[East Thrace|Thrace]]. It is the world's narrowest strait used for [[international waterway|international navigation]], the Bosporus connects the [[Black Sea]] with the [[Sea of Marmara]], and, by extension via the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] seas.

Most of the shores of the strait are heavily settled, straddled by the city of [[Istanbul]]'s [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] [[population]] of 17 million inhabitants extending inland from both coasts.

Together with the [[Dardanelles]], the Bosporus forms the [[Turkish Straits]].

== Name ==
The name of the channel comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Βόσπορος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Bósporos}}), which was folk-etymologised as {{lang|grc|βοὸς πόρος}}, i.e. &quot;cattle strait&quot; (or &quot;[[Oxford|Ox-ford]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;There is a certain (Oxonian) tradition of equating the name &quot;Oxford&quot; with &quot;Bosporus&quot;, see e.g. Wolstenholme Parr, ''Memoir on the propriety of the word Oxford'', Oxford,1820, esp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qSwrr71vA7IC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;), from the genitive of {{lang|grc-Latn|boûs}} {{wikt-lang|grc|βοῦς}} 'ox, cattle' + {{lang|grc-Latn|poros}} {{wikt-lang|grc|πόρος}} 'passage', thus meaning 'cattle-passage', or 'cow passage'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosporos&quot;&gt;Entry: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2320416 '''{{lang|grc|Βόσπορος|nocat=y}}'''] at Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, 1940, ''A Greek–English Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is in reference to the [[Greek mythology|mythological story]] of [[Io (mythology)|Io]], who was transformed into a cow, and was subsequently condemned to wander the Earth until she crossed the Bosporus, where she met the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]], who comforted her with the information that she would be restored to human form by [[Zeus]] and become the ancestress of the greatest of all heroes, [[Heracles]] (Hercules).

The site where Io supposedly went ashore was near [[Üsküdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]] (present-day [[Üsküdar]]), and was named {{lang|grc-Latn|Bous}} 'the Cow'. The same site was also known as {{lang|grc-Latn|Damalis}} ({{lang|grc|Δάμαλις}}), as it was where the Athenian general [[Chares of Athens|Chares]] had erected a monument to his wife Damalis, which included a colossal statue of a cow (the name {{wikt-lang|grc|δαμάλις}} translating to 'heifer').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=F. Sickler |title=Handbuch der alten Geographie |publisher=Bonné |year=1824 |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_07JCAAAAcAAJ |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_07JCAAAAcAAJ/page/n632 551] |language=de |quote={{lang|de|Die ihr entgegenstehende Landspitze hieß auch ''Bous'' oder ''Damalis'', mit einer ehernen coloss.

The English spelling with ''-ph-'', ''Bosfor'' has no justification in the ancient Greek name, and dictionaries prefer the spelling with ''-p-''&lt;ref name=spelling/&gt; but ''-ph-'' occurs as a variant in [[medieval Latin]] (as {{lang|la|Bosfor}}, and occasionally {{lang|la|Bosforus}}, {{lang|la|Bosferus}}), and in [[medieval Greek]] sometimes as {{lang|grc|Βόσφορος}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DBosporus Bosporus] in Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'' (1879).&lt;/ref&gt; giving rise to the French form {{lang|fr|Bosphore}}, Spanish {{lang|es|Bósforo}} and Russian {{lang|ru|Босфор}}. The 12th century Greek scholar [[John Tzetzes]] calls it {{lang|grc-Latn|Damaliten Bosporon}} (after ''Damalis''), but he also reports that in popular usage the strait was known as {{lang|grc-Latn|Prosphorion}} during his day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carl Müller |title=Geographi graeci minores |publisher=Didot |year=1861 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VxFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7 |language=la |quote={{lang|la|Herodotus (4, 85) nominat Bosporum Calchedoniæ ({{lang|grc|τῆς Καλχηδονίς τὸν Βόσπορον}}); Strabo, os Byzantiacum (p. 125 {{lang|grc|στόμα Βυζαντιακόν}}, p. 318 {{lang|grc|στόμα τὸ κατὰ Βυζάντιον}}); Joannes Tzetzes (Chil. 1, 886) appellat Bosporum Damaliten ({{lang|grc|τὸν Δαμαλίτην Βόσπορον}}) sua ætate nuncupatum vulgo Prosphorium.}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; the name of [[Prosphorion Harbour|the most ancient northern harbour]] of [[Constantinople]].

Historically, the Bosporus was also known as the &quot;Strait of Constantinople&quot;, or the [[Thrace|Thracian]] Bosporus, in order to distinguish it from the [[Cimmerian Bosporus]] in [[Crimea]]. These are expressed in [[Herodotus]]'s ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', 4.83; as {{lang|la|Bosporus Thracius}}, {{lang|la|Bosporus Thraciae}}, and {{lang|grc|Βόσπορος Θρᾴκιος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Bósporos Thráikios}}), respectively. Other names by which the strait is referenced by Herodotus include [[Chalcedon]]ian Bosporus ({{lang|la|Bosporus Chalcedoniae}}, {{lang|grc|Βοσπορος της Χαλκηδονιης}} [{{lang|grc-Latn|Bosporos tes Khalkedonies}}], Herodotus 4.87), or [[Mysia]]n Bosporus ({{lang|la|Bosporus Mysius}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Friedrich Heinrich Theodor Bischoff |title=Verleichendes wörterbuch der alten, mittleren und neuen geographie |publisher=Becker |year=1829 |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_NvYRAAAAYAAJ |pages=195f |language=de }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term eventually [[generic trademark#Trademark erosion|came to be used as common noun]] {{lang|el|βόσπορος}}, meaning &quot;a strait&quot;, and was also formerly applied to the [[Hellespont]] in [[Classical Greek]] by [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]].

== Geography ==
As a [[wikt:maritime|maritime]] [[waterway]], the Bosporus connects various seas along the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Near East]], and [[Western Eurasia]], and specifically connects the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Sea of Marmara]]. The Marmara further connects to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean]] seas via the [[Dardanelles]]. Thus, the Bosporus allows maritime connections from the Black Sea all the way to the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean via Gibraltar, and the Indian Ocean through the [[Suez Canal]], making it a crucial international waterway, in particular for the passage of goods coming in from [[Russia]].

=== Formation ===
{{Main|Black Sea deluge hypothesis}}

The exact cause and date of the formation of the Bosporus remain the subject of debate among geologists. One recent hypothesis, dubbed the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]], which was launched by a study of the same name in 1997 by two scientists from [[Columbia University]], postulates that the Bosporus was flooded around 5600 BC (revised to 6800 BC in 2003) when the rising waters of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] breached through to the [[Black Sea]], which at the time, according to the hypothesis, was a low-lying body of fresh water.

Many geologists,{{who|date=May 2018}} however, claim that the strait is much older, even if relatively young on a geologic timescale.

From the perspective of [[ancient Greek mythology]], it was said that colossal floating rocks known as the [[Symplegades]], or Clashing Rocks, once occupied the hilltops on both sides of the Bosporus, and destroyed any ship that attempted passage of the channel by rolling down the strait's hills and violently crushing all vessels between them. The Symplegades were defeated when the lyrical hero [[Jason]] obtained successful passage, whereupon the rocks became fixed, and Greek access to the Black Sea was opened.

=== Present morphology ===
The limits of the Bosporus are defined as the connecting line between the lighthouses of [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] in the north, and between the [[Ahırkapı Feneri]] and the [[Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri]] in the south. Between these limits, the strait is {{convert|31|km|nmi|abbr=on}} long, with a width of {{convert|3329|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the northern entrance and {{convert|2826|m|nmi|abbr=on}} at the southern entrance. Its maximum width is {{convert|3420|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between Umuryeri and Büyükdere Limanı, and minimum width {{convert|700|m|nmi|abbr=on}} between [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[Aşiyan]].

The depth of the Bosporus varies from {{convert|13|to|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} in midstream with an average of {{convert|65|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest location is between Kandilli and [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]] with {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The shallowest locations are off Kadıköy İnciburnu on the northward route with {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and off Aşiyan Point on the southward route with {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;d&quot; /&gt;

The smallest section is on a sill located in front of [[Dolmabahçe Palace]]. It is around 38 000 square meter. The Southbound flow is 16 000 m3/s (fresh water at surface) and the northbound flow is 11 000 m3/s (salt water near bottom)&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, M. C., and E. O¨ zsoy (2002), Flow, water
mass changes, and hydraulics in the Bosphorus, J. Geophys. Res., 107(C3), 3016, doi:10.1029/2000JC000485&lt;/ref&gt;. Some even speak about a [[Black Sea undersea river]].

The [[Golden Horn]] is an [[estuary]] off the main strait that historically acted as a moat to protect Old Istanbul from attack, as well as providing a sheltered anchorage for the imperial navies of various empires until the 19th century, after which it became a historic neighborhood at the heart of the city, popular with tourists and locals alike.

=== Newer explorations ===
It had been known since before the 20th century that the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara flow into each other in a geographic example of &quot;density flow&quot;, and in August 2010, a continuous 'underwater channel' of [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] composition was discovered to flow along the floor of the Bosporus, which would be the sixth largest river on Earth if it were to be on land.&lt;ref name=&quot;leeds.ac.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Leeds Researchers Study Undersea Rivers with a Yellow Submarine |url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803145648/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/866/leeds_researchers_study_undersea_rivers_with_a_yellow_submarine |archive-date=3 August 2010 |publisher=University of Leeds |date=2 August 2010 |access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the [[water erosion|water]] and [[wind erosion]] of the straits relates to that of its formation. Sections of the shore have been reinforced with concrete or rubble and sections of the strait prone to [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] are periodically dredged.

The 2010 team of scientists, led by the [[University of Leeds]], used a robotic &quot;yellow submarine&quot; to observe detailed flows within an &quot;undersea river&quot;, scientifically referred to as a [[submarine channel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;leeds.ac.uk&quot;/&gt; for the first time. Submarine channels are similar to land rivers, but they are formed by density currents—underwater flow mixtures of sand, mud and water that are denser than sea water and so sink and flow along the bottom. These channels are the main transport pathway for sediments to the deep sea where they form sedimentary deposits. These deposits ultimately hold not only untapped reserves of gas and oil, they also house important secrets—from clues on past climate change to the ways in which mountains were formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;leeds.ac.uk&quot;/&gt;

The team studied the detailed flow within these channels and findings included:

{{quote|The channel complex and the density flow provide the ideal natural laboratory for investigating and detailing the structure of the flow field through the channel. Our initial findings show that the flow in these channels is quite different to the flow in river channels on land. Specifically, as flow moves around a bend it spirals in the opposite direction in the deep sea compared to the spiral found in river channels on land. This is important in understanding the sedimentology and layers of sediment deposited by these systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurity.org/earth-environment/robotic-sub-records-flow-of-undersea-river/|title=Robotic sub records flow of undersea river – Futurity|date=2 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The central tenet of the [[Black Sea deluge hypothesis]] is that as the ocean rose {{convert|72.5|m}} at the end of the last Ice Age when the massive ice sheets melted, the sealed Bosporus was overtopped in a spectacular flood that increased the then fresh water Black Sea Lake 50%, and drove people from the shores for many months. This was supported by findings of undersea explorer [[Robert Ballard]], who discovered settlements along the old shoreline; scientists dated the [[flood]] to 7500 BP or 5500 BC from fresh-salt water microflora. The peoples driven out by the constantly rising water, which must have been terrifying and inexplicable, spread to all corners of the Western world carrying the story of the Great Flood, which is how it probably entered most religions.  As the waters surged, they scoured a network of sea-floor channels less resistant to denser suspended solids in liquid, which remains a very active layer today.

The first images of these submarine channels were obtained in 1999, showing them to be of great size&lt;ref&gt;Di Iorio, D., and Yüce, H. (1999). &quot;Observations of Mediterranean flow into the Black Sea&quot;. ''Journal of Geophysical Research'' 104(C2), 3091–3108.&lt;/ref&gt; during a [[NATO]] [[SACLANT ASW Research Centre|SACLANT Undersea Research]] project using jointly the NATO RV ''Alliance'', and the [[Turkish Navy]] survey ship ''Çubuklu''. In 2002, a survey was carried out on board the Ifremer RV ''Le Suroit'' for BlaSON project (Lericolais, et al., 2003&lt;ref&gt;Lericolais, G., Le Drezen, E., Nouzé, H., Gillet, H., Ergun, M., Cifci, G., Avci, M., Dondurur, D., and Okay, S. (2002). &quot;Recent canyon heads evidenced at the Bosporus outlet&quot;. ''EOS transactions'', AGU Fall Meet. Suppl. 83(47), Abstract PP71B-0409.&lt;/ref&gt;) completed the multibeam mapping of this underwater channel fan-delta. A complete map was published in 2009&lt;ref&gt;Flood, R. D., Hiscott, R. N., and Aksu, A. E. (2009). &quot;Morphology and evolution of an anastomosed channel network where saline underflow enters the Black Sea&quot;. ''Sedimentology'' 56(3), 807–839.&lt;/ref&gt; using these previous results with high quality mapping obtained in 2006 (by researchers at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] who are project partners in this study).

The team will use the data obtained to create innovative computer simulations that can be used to model how sediment flows through these channels. The models the team will produce will have broad applications, including inputting into the design of seafloor engineering by oil and gas companies.

The project was led by Jeff Peakall and Daniel Parsons at the [[University of Leeds]], in collaboration with the [[University of Southampton]], Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the [[Dokuz Eylül University|Institute of Marine Sciences]]. The survey was run and coordinated from the Institute of Marine Sciences research ship, the [[RV K. Piri Reis|R/V ''Koca Piri Reis'']].

== History ==
As part of the only passage between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosporus has always been of great importance from a commercial and military point of view, and remains strategically important today. It is a major sea access route for numerous countries, including [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Control over it has been an objective of a number of conflicts in modern history, notably the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]], as well as of the attack of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] on the [[Dardanelles]] during the 1915 [[Battle of Gallipoli]] in the course of [[World War I]].

This is the oldest surviving map of the city, and the only surviving map which predates the [[Fall of Constantinople|Turkish conquest]] of 1453. The Bosporus is visible along the right hand side of the map, wrapping vertically around the historic city.]]

The strategic importance of the Bosporus dates back millennia. In the 5th century BC the Greek city-state of [[Athens]], which depended on grain imports from the Black Sea ports of [[Scythia]], maintained critical alliances with cities which controlled the straits, such as the [[Megara| Megarian]] colony [[Byzantium]].

Persian King [[Darius I]] the Great ({{reign | 522 BC | 486 BC}}), in an attempt to subdue the [[Scythia]]n horsemen who roamed across the north of the [[Black Sea]], crossed the Bosporus, then marched towards the [[River Danube]]. His army crossed the Bosporus using an enormous bridge made by connecting [[Achaemenid]] boats.&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, Historiae IV, 39, 16;{{failed verification|date= January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.karalahana.com/makaleler/kitap/pontus-antik-cagdan-gunumuze-karadeniz-etnik-siyasi-tarihi.htm |title= PONTUS: Antikçağ'dan Günümüze Karadeniz'in Etnik ve Siyasi Tarihi |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120915062836/http://www.karalahana.com/makaleler/kitap/pontus-antik-cagdan-gunumuze-karadeniz-etnik-siyasi-tarihi.htm |archivedate= 2012-09-15 |author= [[Özhan Öztürk]] |location= Ankara |year= 2011 |pages= 28–29 |others= Archived at the [[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bridge essentially connected the farthest geographic tip of Asia to Europe, encompassing at least some 1,000 metres of open water if not more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The History of Herodotus: a new English version, Volume 3|author= Herodotus |translator= George Rawlinson |translator2= Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson |translator3= Sir John Gardner Wilkinson|publisher= John Murray|year= 1859|pages= [https://archive.org/details/historyherodotu00unkngoog/page/n93 77] (Chp. 86) |url= https://archive.org/details/historyherodotu00unkngoog|quote= bosphorus width.}}&lt;/ref&gt; )Years later, [[Xerxes I]] would construct a similar [[Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges |boat bridge]] on the [[Dardanelles]] ([[Hellespont]]) strait (480 BC), during his [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|invasion of Greece]].)

The strategic significance of the strait was one of the factors in the decision of the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] the Great to found there in AD 330 his new capital, [[Constantinople]], which became the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. The expressions &quot;swim the Bosporus&quot; and &quot;cross the Bosporus&quot; were and are still used to indicate religious conversion to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}

On 29 May 1453, the then-emergent [[Ottoman Empire]] [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] the city of [[Constantinople]] following a lengthy campaign wherein the Ottomans constructed fortifications on each side of the strait, the [[Anadoluhisarı]] (1393) and the [[Rumelihisarı]] (1451), in preparation for not only the primary battle but to assert long-term control over the Bosporus and surrounding waterways. The final 53-day campaign, which resulted in Ottoman victory, constituted an important turn in world history. Together with [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage to the Americas in 1492, the 1453 conquest of Constantinople is commonly noted as among [[Middle Ages#Terminology and periodisation|the events that brought an end to the Middle Ages]] and marked the transition to the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].

The event also marked the end of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]—the final remnants of the [[Roman Empire]]—and the transfer of the control of the Bosporus into Ottoman hands, who made Constantinople their new capital, and from where they expanded their empire in the centuries that followed.

At its peak between the 16th and 18th centuries, the Ottoman Empire had used the strategic importance of the Bosporus to expand their regional ambitions and to wrest control of the entire [[Black Sea]] area, which they regarded as an &quot;Ottoman lake&quot;, on which Russian warships were prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_koprulu_era.html |title=Turkey – Köprülü Era |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, several international treaties have governed vessels using the waters. Under the [[Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi]] of 8 July 1833, the Bosporus and [[Dardanelles]] straits were to be closed on Russian demand to naval vessels of other powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/turkey/turkey_history_external_threats_and_internal_transformations.html |title=Turkey – External Threats and Internal Transformations |publisher=Workmall.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the terms of the [[London Straits Convention]] concluded on 13 July 1841, between the [[Great Powers]] of [[Europe]]—[[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Second French Republic|France]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]—the &quot;ancient rule&quot; of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was re-established by closing the Turkish Straits to any and all [[warship]]s, barring those of the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]]'s allies during wartime. It thus benefited [[Royal Navy|British naval]] power at the expense of Russian, as the latter lacked direct access for its [[Imperial Russian Navy|navy]] to the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name = Rozakis&gt;{{cite book | title = The Turkish Straits | author = Christos L.

Following the [[First World War]], the 1920 [[Treaty of Sèvres]] demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the [[League of Nations]].

=== Turkish republican era (1923–present) ===
This was amended under the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], which restored the straits to Turkish territory—but allowed all foreign warships and commercial shipping to traverse the straits freely. Turkey eventually rejected the terms of that treaty, and subsequently Turkey remilitarised the straits area. The reversion was formalised under the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits]] of 20 July 1936. That convention, which is still in force, treats the straits as an international shipping lane save that Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non–Black Sea states.

Turkey was neutral in the [[Second World War]] until February 1945, and the straits were closed to the warships of belligerent nations during this time, although some German [[auxiliaries|auxiliary vessels]] were permitted to transit. In diplomatic conferences, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] representatives had made known [[Turkish Straits crisis|their interest]] in Turkish concession of Soviet naval bases on the straits. This, as well as Stalin's demands for the restitution of the Turkish provinces of [[Kars Province|Kars]], [[Artvin]] and [[Ardahan]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (which were lost by Turkey in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, but were regained with the [[Treaty of Kars]] in 1921), were considerations in Turkey's decision to abandon [[country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality in foreign affairs]]. Turkey declared war against Germany in February 1945, but did not engage in offensive actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpri.org/enotes/20030110.balkansturkey.torbakov.turkeypostsovietspace.html |title=Foreign Policy Research Institute: The Turkish Factor in the Geopolitics of the Post-Soviet Space (Igor Torbakov) |publisher=Fpri.org |date=2003-01-10 |accessdate=2010-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731000411/http://www.fpri.org/enotes/20030110.balkansturkey.torbakov.turkeypostsovietspace.html |archivedate=2010-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertcutler.org/ch91dc.htm |title=Turkish-Soviet Relations |publisher=Robert Cutler |date=1999-03-28 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/yazarDetay.do;jsessionid=DC0C8B5C41104733FE75243EF5E99B20.node1?haberno=36433 |title=Today's Zaman: Against who and where are we going to stand?

Turkey joined [[NATO]] in 1952, thus affording its straits even more strategic importance as a commercial and military waterway.

During the early 21st century, the [[Turkish Straits]] have become particularly important for the oil industry. Russian oil, from ports such as [[Novorossyisk]], is exported by tankers primarily to western Europe and the U.S. via the Bosporus and the Dardanelles straits. In 2011 Turkey planned a 50&amp;nbsp;km canal through [[Silivri]] as a second waterway, reducing risk in the Bosporus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.nce.co.uk/news/water/turkey-to-build-bosphorus-bypass/8614313.article Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass]&quot; ''[[New Civil Engineer]]'', 20 April 2011.

=== Maritime ===
The waters of the Bosphorus are traversed by numerous passenger and vehicular ferries daily, as well as recreational and fishing boats ranging from dinghies to yachts owned by both public and private entities.

The strait also experiences significant amounts of international commercial shipping traffic by [[Cargo ship|freighters]] and [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]]. Between its northern limits at [[Rumeli Feneri]] and [[Anadolu Feneri]] and its southern ones at [[Ahırkapı Feneri]] and [[Kadıköy İnciburnu Feneri]], there are numerous dangerous points for large-scale maritime traffic that require sharp turns and management of visual obstructions. Famously, the stretch between [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli Point]] and [[Aşiyan]] requires a 45-degree course alteration in a location where the currents can reach {{convert|7|to|8|kn|m/s|abbr=out}}. To the south, at [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]], the necessary course alteration is 80 degrees. Compounding these difficult changes in trajectory, the rear and forward sight lines at [[Kandilli, Üsküdar|Kandilli]] and [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]] are also completely blocked prior to and during the course alteration, making it impossible for ships approaching from the opposite direction to see around these bends. The risks posed by geography are further multiplied by the heavy ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city. As such, all the dangers and obstacles characteristic of narrow waterways are present and acute in this critical sea lane.

In 2011, the Turkish Government discussed creating a large-scale canal project roughly {{convert|80|km|mi}} long that runs north-south through [[Silivri|the western edges of Istanbul Province]] as a second waterway between the Black Sea and the Marmara, intended to reduce risk in the Bosphorus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey to build Bosphorus bypass&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ing.dk&quot; /&gt; This [[Kanal İstanbul]] project currently continues to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-223806-istanbul-canal-project-to-open-debate-on-montreux-convention.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |title=İstanbul Canal project to open debate on Montreux Convention |date=2010-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430073318/http://www.todayszaman.com/news-223806-istanbul-canal-project-to-open-debate-on-montreux-convention.html |archivedate=2011-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/turkey-debates-whether-international-treaty-is-obstacle-to-plan-to-bypass-the-bosporus/2011/04/29/AFcaFrCF_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Turkey debates whether international treaty is obstacle to plan to bypass the Bosporus |date=2011-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Turkey's Ambitious Canal Proposal | url= http://www.stratfor.com/image/turkeys-ambitious-canal-proposal | publisher=[[STRATFOR]] | date= May 16, 2013| accessdate=2013-05-16|quote=Registry required.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategical Importance ==
The Bosphorus is the only way for [[Bulgaria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] to reach the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and other seas. Sovereignty over the straits is also an important issue for the riparian countries besides [[Turkey]].

Although it is only one of the natural borders separating the [[Europe|European]] and [[Asia|Asian]] mainland, the most known is the Bosphorus. Since it is a favorable region in terms of climate and geographical conditions, it has a great role in being a settlement area for ages. The city of [[Istanbul]], divided by the Bosphorus, is one of the few intercontinental cities in the world.

Even if Turkey has no right to receive tolls from ships passing through the strait Turkey's military has broad powers in accordance with [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Straits|Montreux Convention]]. Today, the Bosphorus Command is located on the shores of the Bosphorus and the military ships connected to the Command are anchoring in the Bosphorus waters.

Located on a peninsula at the intersection of the Black Sea, the Bosphorus and the Marmara Sea, Istanbul has been one of the most protected and hardest cities for centuries.

== Sightseeing ==
{{See also|Yalı|Ferries in Istanbul|İDO}}

The Bosphorus has 620 [[yalı|waterfront houses (''yalı'')]] built during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period along the strait's European and Asian shorelines. Ottoman palaces such as the [[Topkapı Palace]], [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], [[Yıldız Palace]], [[Çırağan Palace]], [[Feriye Palaces]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace]], [[Küçüksu Palace]], [[Ihlamur Palace]], [[Hatice Sultan Palace]], [[Adile Sultan Palace]] and [[Khedive Palace]] are within its view.  Buildings and landmarks within view include the [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Hagia Irene]], [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]], [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Mosque]], [[Kılıç Ali Pasha Complex|Kılıç Ali Pasha Mosque]], [[Nusretiye Mosque]], [[Dolmabahçe Mosque]], [[Ortaköy Mosque]], [[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (Üsküdar)|Üsküdar Mihrimah Sultan Mosque]], [[Yeni Valide Mosque]], [[Maiden's Tower]], [[Galata Tower]], [[Rumelihisarı|Rumelian Castle]], [[Anadoluhisarı|Anatolian Castle]], [[Yoros Castle]], [[Selimiye Barracks]], [[Sakıp Sabancı Museum]], [[Sadberk Hanım Museum]], [[İstanbul Modern|Istanbul Museum of Modern Art]], [[Perili Köşk|Borusan Museum of Contemporary Art]], [[Tophane]]-i Amire Museum, [[Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University]], [[Galatasaray University]], [[Boğaziçi University]], [[Robert College]], [[Kabataş High School]], [[Kuleli Military High School]].

Two points in [[Istanbul]] have most of the [[ferries in Istanbul|public ferries]] that traverse the strait: from [[Eminönü]] (ferries dock at the ''Boğaz İskelesi'' pier) on the [[Constantinople|historic peninsula]] of Istanbul to [[Yoros Castle#Anadolu Kavağı|Anadolu Kavağı]] near the [[Black Sea]], zigzagging and calling briefly multiple times at the [[Rumelia]]n and [[Anatolia]]n sides of the city.  At central piers shorter, regular ride in one of the public ferries cross.

Private ferries operate between [[Üsküdar]] and [[Beşiktaş]] or [[Kabataş, Istanbul|Kabataş]] in the city.  The few well-known geographic hazards are multiplied by ferry traffic across the strait, linking the European and Asian sides of the city, particularly for the largest ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;d&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc |publisher=Denizcilik |title=Türk Boğazları ve Marmara Denizi'nin Coğrafi Konumu-İstanbul Boğazı |language=Turkish |accessdate=2010-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008023403/http://www.denizcilik.gov.tr/tr/egitim/dugm/bogazlar.doc |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The catamaran [[İDO|seabuses]] offer high-speed commuter services between the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus, but they stop at fewer [[port]]s and [[pier]]s in comparison to the public ferries. Both the public ferries and the seabuses also provide commuter services between the Bosphorus and the [[Prince Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]].

There are also tourist rides available in various places along the coasts of the Bosphorus. The prices vary according to the type of the ride, and some feature loud popular music for the duration of the trip.

== Architecture of Bosphorus ==
The architectural structure of the Bosphorus began to be shaped by simple houses in the fishing villages established on the coast during the Byzantine period.

The mansions, which were placed on the shores during the Ottoman period, became one of the most outstanding examples of Bosphorus architecture and have been identified with the Bosphorus for years. The number of mansions built on the two sides of the Bosphorus for centuries and has reached today is about 360.

Today, the majority of them still preserves their old forms, are among the most expensive real estate both in Turkey and Istanbul.

Many palace buildings has also built in the Bosphorus, which was one of the most popular places of the palace people during the Ottoman period. [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], [[Çırağan Palace]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace|Beylerbeyi Sarayı]], [[Küçüksu Palace|Küçüksu Kasrı]], [[Beykoz kasrı|Beykoz Kasrı]] ve [[Adile Sultan Palace|Adile Sultan Kasrı]] are some of most striking structures used by sultans and his relatives from time to time. Historical buildings such as [[Galatasaray University]], Egyptian Consulate and [[Sakıp Sabancı Museum]] are among the most famous architectural examples of the Bosphorus.

In the Ottoman era there was a tradition of building mosques and pier squares as well as pier buildings in the important districts of the Bosphorus. Beşiktaş Pier, Ortaköy Square, [[Ortaköy Mosque]], [[Bebek Mosque]], [[Beylerbeyi Mosque]] and [[Şemsi Pasha Mosque|Şemsipaşa Mosque]] are some of traces from that tradition.
