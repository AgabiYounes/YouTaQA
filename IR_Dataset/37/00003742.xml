'''Bluetooth''' is a [[wireless]] technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using short-wavelength [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[radio waves]] in the [[ISM band|industrial, scientific and medical radio bands]], from 2.400 to 2.485{{nbsp}}GHz, and building [[personal area network]]s (PANs). It was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to [[RS-232]] data cables.

Bluetooth is managed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (SIG), which has more than 35,000 member companies in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics. The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]] standardized Bluetooth as '''IEEE 802.15.1''', but no longer maintains the standard. The Bluetooth SIG oversees development of the specification, manages the qualification program, and protects the trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/about-us/ |title=About us - Bluetooth Technology Website |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=8 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; A manufacturer must meet [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group#Qualification|Bluetooth SIG standards]] to market it as a Bluetooth device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bluetooth.com/develop-with-bluetooth/marketing-branding/brand-enforcement-program/ |title=Brand Enforcement Program |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=8 May 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A network of [[patent]]s apply to the technology, which are licensed to individual qualifying devices. {{As of|2009}}, Bluetooth [[integrated circuit]] chips ship approximately {{#expr:2000/1.2*0.55 round -1}}{{nbsp}}million units annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;Happich&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Happich |first1=Julien |title=Global shipments of short range wireless ICs to exceed 2 billion units in 2010 |url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1254987 |accessdate=25 October 2019 |work=[[EE Times]] |date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The development of the &quot;short-link&quot; radio technology, later named Bluetooth, was initiated in 1989 by Nils Rydbeck, CTO at [[Ericsson Mobile]] in [[Lund]], Sweden. The purpose was to develop wireless headsets, according to two inventions by Johan Ullman, {{ cite patent |country=SE |number=8902098-6 |gdate=1989-06-12 }} and {{ cite patent |country=SE |number=9202239 |gdate=1992-07-24 }}. Nils Rydbeck tasked Tord Wingren with specifying and Dutchman [[Jaap Haartsen]] and Sven Mattisson with developing. Both were working for Ericsson in Lund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 May 2001|title=The Bluetooth Blues|publisher=Information Age|url=http://www.information-age.com/article/2001/may/the_bluetooth_blues|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222231740/http://www.information-age.com/article/2001/may/the_bluetooth_blues|archivedate=22 December 2007|accessdate=1 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, Jaap Haartsen was nominated by the European Patent Office for the European Inventor Award. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/who-invented-bluetooth-4038864|title=Who Invented Bluetooth?|last=Nguyen|first=Tuan C.|website=ThoughtCo|language=en|access-date=11 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 Örjan Johansson became the project leader and propelled the technology and standardization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etn.se/index.php/nyheter/45972-grattis-bluetooth-10-ar|title=Grattis Bluetooth, 10 år|website=etn.se|access-date=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.se/nyheter/2015/06/24/sveriges-20-framsta-innovationer-de-senaste-35-aren/|title=Sveriges 20 främsta innovationer de senaste 35 åren|website=Veckans affärer|access-date=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stik.se/122nobelkandidater_sv.pdf|title=122 Nobel price candidates|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovatorsradet.se/innovationer.htm|title=De största innovationerna i modern tid|website=innovatorsradet.se|access-date=29 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1997, Adalio Sanchez, then head of IBM ThinkPad product R&amp;D, approached Nils Rybeck about collaborating on integrating a [[mobile phone]] into a ThinkPad notebook. The two assigned engineers from Ericsson and IBM to study the idea.  The conclusion was that power consumption on cellphone technology at that time was too high to allow viable integration into a notebook and still achieve adequate battery life. Instead, the two companies agreed to integrate Ericsson's short-link technology on both a ThinkPad notebook and an Ericsson phone to accomplish the goal.  Since neither IBM ThinkPad notebooks nor Ericsson phones were the market share leaders in their respective markets at that time, Adalio Sanchez and Nils Rydbeck agreed to make the short-link technology an open industry standard to permit each player maximum market access.  Ericsson contributed the short-link radio technology, and IBM contributed patents around the logical layer. Adalio Sanchez of IBM then recruited Stephen Nachtsheim of Intel to join and then Intel also recruited Toshiba and Nokia. In May 1998, the Bluetooth SIG was launched with IBM and Ericsson as the founding signatories and a total of five members: Ericsson, Intel, Nokia, Toshiba and IBM. 

The first consumer Bluetooth device was launched in 1999. It was a hands-free mobile headset which earned the &quot;Best of show Technology Award&quot; at COMDEX. 
The first Bluetooth mobile phone was the Ericsson T36 but it was the revised T39 model which actually made it to store shelves in 2001. In parallel, IBM introduced the IBM ThinkPad A30 in October 2001 which was the first notebook with integrated Bluetooth.

== Name and logo ==
=== Name ===
The name '''''Bluetooth''''' is an [[Anglicised]] version of the Scandinavian ''Blåtand''/''Blåtann'' ([[Old Norse]] ''blátǫnn''), the [[epithet]] of the tenth-century king [[Harald Bluetooth]] who united dissonant Danish tribes into a single kingdom. The implication is that Bluetooth unites communication protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsson.com/bluetooth/companyove/history-bl/|title=Milestones in the Bluetooth advance|publisher=Ericsson Technology Licensing|date=22 March 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040620150507/http://www.ericsson.com/bluetooth/companyove/history-bl/|archivedate=20 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of this name was proposed in 1997 by Jim Kardach of [[Intel]], who developed a system that would allow mobile phones to communicate with computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2061288/so-thats-why-its-called-bluetooth-and-other-surprising-tech-name-origins.html|title='So, that's why it's called Bluetooth!' and other surprising tech name origins|work=PCWorld|access-date=16 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of this proposal he was reading [[Frans G. Bengtsson]]'s historical novel ''[[The Long Ships]]'' about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth.&lt;ref name=&quot;EETimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=eetimes|url=https://www.eetimes.com/tech-history-how-bluetooth-got-its-name|title=Tech History: How Bluetooth got its name|first=Jim|last=Kardach|date=5 March 2008|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Forsyth, Mark|title= The Etymologicon|publisher= Icon Books Ltd.|location= London |date= 2011|page= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bluetooth logo [[File:Bluetooth FM Color.png|25px]] is a [[bind rune]] merging the [[Younger Futhark]] [[runic alphabet|runes]] [[File:Runic letter ior.svg|8px]]&amp;nbsp;(ᚼ, [[Haglaz|Hagall]]) and [[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|8px]]&amp;nbsp;(ᛒ, [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]]), Harald's initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BluetoothSIG/status/704694301201043456|title=Bluetooth on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=46091|title=Bluetooth Experience Icons|publisher=Bluetooth Special Interest Group|quote=Bluetooth Experience Icons borrow two of these three features: the blue color and the rune-inspired symbol.|access-date=21 October 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
Bluetooth operates at frequencies between 2.402 and 2.480{{nbsp}}GHz, or 2.400 and 2.4835{{nbsp}}GHz including [[guard band]]s 2{{nbsp}}MHz wide at the bottom end and 3.5{{nbsp}}MHz wide at the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio-Electronics.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/wireless/bluetooth/radio-interface-modulation.php |title=Bluetooth Radio Interface, Modulation &amp; Channels |publisher=Radio-Electronics.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in the globally unlicensed (but not unregulated) industrial, scientific and medical ([[ISM band|ISM]]) 2.4{{nbsp}}GHz short-range radio frequency band. Bluetooth uses a radio technology called [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]]. Bluetooth divides transmitted data into packets, and transmits each packet on one of 79 designated Bluetooth channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1{{nbsp}}MHz. It usually performs 1600{{nbsp}}hops per second, with [[adaptive frequency-hopping spread spectrum|adaptive frequency-hopping]] (AFH) enabled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio-Electronics.com&quot;/&gt; [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] uses 2{{nbsp}}MHz spacing, which accommodates 40 channels.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=421043 Bluetooth Specification Version 5.0]'' (PDF download). Bluetooth Special Interest Group. Retrieved from [https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/bluetooth-core-specification Bluetooth Core Specifications], 1 December 2017. Page 2535.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying]] (GFSK) modulation was the only modulation scheme available. Since the introduction of Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, π/4-[[DQPSK]] (differential quadrature phase-shift keying) and 8-DPSK modulation may also be used between compatible devices. Devices functioning with GFSK are said to be operating in basic rate (BR) mode where an instantaneous [[bit rate]] of 1{{nbsp}}[[data rate units|Mbit/s]] is possible. The term Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) is used to describe π/4-DPSK and 8-DPSK schemes, each giving 2 and 3{{nbsp}}Mbit/s respectively. The combination of these (BR and EDR) modes in Bluetooth radio technology is classified as a ''BR/EDR radio''.

Bluetooth is a [[packet switching|packet-based protocol]] with a [[master/slave (technology)|master/slave architecture]]. One master may communicate with up to seven slaves in a [[piconet]]. All devices within a given piconet use the clock provided by the master as the base for packet exchange. The master clock ticks with a period of 312.5{{nbsp}}[[μs]], two clock ticks then make up a slot of 625{{nbsp}}µs, and two slots make up a slot pair of 1250{{nbsp}}µs. In the simple case of single-slot packets, the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots. The slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master's transmission begins in even slots and the slave's in odd slots.

The above excludes Bluetooth Low Energy, introduced in the 4.0 specification, which [[Bluetooth Low Energy#Radio interface|uses the same spectrum but somewhat differently]].

=== Communication and connection ===
A master BR/EDR Bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet (an ad-hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology), though not all devices reach this maximum. &lt;!-- This sentence contains redundant text, repeated from the previous paragraph. --&gt; The devices can switch roles, by agreement, and the slave can become the master (for example, a headset initiating a connection to a phone necessarily begins as master—as an initiator of the connection—but may subsequently operate as the slave).

The Bluetooth Core Specification provides for the connection of two or more piconets to form a [[scatternet]], in which certain devices simultaneously play the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another.
.

At any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one other device (except for the little-used broadcast mode). The master chooses which slave device to address; typically, it switches rapidly from one device to another in a [[round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion. Since it is the master that chooses which slave to address, whereas a slave is (in theory) supposed to listen in each receive slot, being a master is a lighter burden than being a slave. Being a master of seven slaves is possible; being a slave of more than one master is possible. The specification is vague as to required behavior in scatternets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last3=Patil |last2=Koul |last=Kurawar |first3=Viki Tukaram |first2=Ayushi |first=Arwa |date=August 2014 |title=Survey of Bluetooth and Applications |journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Engineering &amp; Technology |volume=3 |pages=2832–2837 |issn=2278-1323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluetooth is a standard wire-replacement communications protocol primarily designed for low power consumption, with a short range based on low-cost [[transceiver]] [[integrated circuit|microchips]] in each device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Technology/Works/|title=How Bluetooth Technology Works|publisher=Bluetooth SIG|accessdate=1 February 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117000828/http://bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Technology/Works/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the devices use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not have to be in visual line of sight of each other; however, a ''[[Quasi-optical|quasi optical]]'' wireless path must be viable.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Newton, Harold. (2007). ''Newton’s telecom dictionary.'' New York: Flatiron Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Range is power-class-dependent, but effective ranges vary in practice. See the table &quot;Ranges of Bluetooth devices by class&quot;.

Officially Class 3 radios have a range of up to {{Convert|1|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, Class 2, most commonly found in mobile devices, {{Convert|10|m|ft}}, and Class 1, primarily for industrial use cases,{{Convert|100|m|ft|sigfig=1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;bluetooth1&quot;/&gt; Bluetooth Marketing qualifies that Class 1 range is in most cases {{Convert|20-30|m|ft}}, and Class 2 range {{Convert|5|-|10|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=BTrange/&gt; The actual range achieved by a given link will depend on the qualities of the devices at both ends of the link, as well as the air conditions in between, and other factors.

The effective range varies depending on propagation conditions, material coverage, production sample variations, antenna configurations and battery conditions. Most Bluetooth applications are for indoor conditions, where attenuation of walls and signal fading due to signal reflections make the range far lower than specified line-of-sight ranges of the Bluetooth products.

Most Bluetooth applications are battery-powered Class&amp;nbsp;2 devices, with little difference in range whether the other end of the link is a Class&amp;nbsp;1 or Class&amp;nbsp;2 device as the lower-powered device tends to set the range limit. In some cases the effective range of the data link can be extended when a Class&amp;nbsp;2 device is connecting to a Class&amp;nbsp;1 transceiver with both higher sensitivity and transmission power than a typical Class&amp;nbsp;2 device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amperordirect.com/pc/r-electronic-resource/z-reference-bluetooth-class1-myth.html |title=Class 1 Bluetooth Dongle Test |publisher=Amperordirect.com |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly, however, the Class&amp;nbsp;1 devices have a similar sensitivity to Class&amp;nbsp;2 devices. Connecting two Class&amp;nbsp;1 devices with both high sensitivity and high power can allow ranges far in excess of the typical 100m, depending on the throughput required by the application. Some such devices allow open field ranges of up to 1&amp;nbsp;km and beyond between two similar devices without exceeding legal emission limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;WT41&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluegiga.com/WT41_Long_Range_Bluetooth_Module |title=WT41 Long Range Bluetooth Module}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BluBear&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesswire.com/en/products/embedded-wireless-modules/bluetooth/bluebear/overview/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717051641/http://www.lesswire.com/en/products/embedded-wireless-modules/bluetooth/bluebear/overview/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 July 2013 |title=BluBear Industrial Long Range Bluetooth 2.1 Module with EDR  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OBS433&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectblue.com/products/classic-bluetooth-products/classic-bluetooth-modules/bluetooth-serial-port-module-obs433/ |title=OEM Bluetooth Serial Port Module OBS433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bluetooth Core Specification mandates a range of not less than {{Convert|10|m|ft}}, but there is no upper limit on actual range. Manufacturers' implementations can be tuned to provide the range needed for each case.&lt;ref name=&quot;bluetooth1&quot;/&gt;

=== Bluetooth profile ===
{{Main|List of Bluetooth profiles}}

To use Bluetooth wireless technology, a device must be able to interpret certain Bluetooth profiles, which are definitions of possible applications and specify general behaviors that Bluetooth-enabled devices use to communicate with other Bluetooth devices. These profiles include settings to parameterize and to control the communication from the start. Adherence to profiles saves the time for transmitting the parameters anew before the bi-directional link becomes effective. There are a wide range of Bluetooth profiles that describe many different types of applications or use cases for devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/profiles-overview/|title=Traditional Profile Specifications |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=28 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Ian|first=Paul|title=Wi-Fi Direct vs. Bluetooth 4.0: A Battle for Supremacy|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/208778/Wi_Fi_Direct_vs_Bluetooth_4_0_A_Battle_for_Supremacy.html|magazine=PC World|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bluetooth vs Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) ===
Bluetooth and [[Wi-Fi]] (Wi-Fi is the brand name for products using [[IEEE 802.11]] standards) have some similar applications: setting up networks, printing, or transferring files. Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high-speed cabling for general [[local area network]] access in work areas or home. This category of applications is sometimes called [[wireless local area network]]s (WLAN). Bluetooth was intended for portable equipment and its applications. The category of applications is outlined as the wireless [[personal area network]] (WPAN). Bluetooth is a replacement for cabling in a variety of personally carried applications in any setting, and also works for fixed location applications such as smart energy functionality in the home (thermostats, etc.).

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth serves well in simple applications where two devices need to connect with a minimal configuration like a button press, as in headsets and remote controls, while Wi-Fi suits better in applications where some degree of client configuration is possible and high speeds are required, especially for network access through an access node. However, Bluetooth access points do exist, and ad-hoc connections are possible with Wi-Fi though not as simply as with Bluetooth. [[Wi-Fi Direct]] was recently developed to add a more Bluetooth-like ad-hoc functionality to Wi-Fi.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Drone 4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Bluetooth [[USB]] dongle with a 100&amp;nbsp;m range]]
Bluetooth exists in numerous products such as telephones, [[Wireless speaker|speakers]], tablets, media players, robotics systems, laptops, and console gaming equipment as well as some high definition [[Headset (audio)|headsets]], [[modem]]s, [[hearing aid]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Bluetooth Hearing Aids&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Bluetooth hearing aids: Hearing aids with Bluetooth technology use today's wireless technology to help you easily stay connected to iOS and Android phones, televisions, tablets and other favorite audio devices |last=Mroz |first=Mandy |date=21 May 2018 |url=https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/hearing-aids/bluetooth |website=Healthy Hearing |access-date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Products/Pages/Watch.aspx |title=Watch |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=4 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918122452/http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Products/pages/watch.aspx |archive-date=18 September 2010 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the variety of devices which use the Bluetooth, coupled with the contemporary deprecation of headphone [[Phone connector (audio)|jack]]s by Apple, Google, and other companies, and the lack of regulation by the FCC, the technology is prone to interference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why does Bluetooth still suck?&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-bluetooth-sucks-bad-problems-issues-disconnects-2018-2 |title=Why does Bluetooth still suck? |last=Eizikowitz |first=Grant |date=5 March 2018 |website=Business Insider |access-date=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Bluetooth is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations. Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with telephones (i.e., with a Bluetooth headset) or byte data with hand-held computers (transferring files).

Bluetooth protocols simplify the discovery and setup of services between devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devices&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/bluetooth.htm |title=How Bluetooth Works|publisher=How Stuff Works |date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluetooth devices can advertise all of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications |title=Specification Documents |publisher=Bluetooth.com |date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes using services easier, because more of the security, [[network address]] and permission configuration can be automated than with many other network types.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devices&quot; /&gt;

A personal computer that does not have embedded Bluetooth can use a Bluetooth adapter that enables the PC to communicate with Bluetooth devices. While some [[desktop computer]]s and most recent laptops come with a built-in Bluetooth radio, others require an external adapter, typically in the form of a small USB &quot;[[dongle]].&quot;

Unlike its predecessor, [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], which requires a separate adapter for each device, Bluetooth lets multiple devices communicate with a computer over a single adapter.&lt;!-- please clarify - all versions? or only some? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/rudolph/Teaching/Articles/PartOfBTBook.pdf|title=Bluetooth for Programmers|publisher=MIT Computer Science And Artificial Intelligence Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operating system implementation ===
{{details|Bluetooth stack}}

For [[Microsoft]] platforms, [[Windows XP Service Pack 2]] and SP3 releases work natively with Bluetooth v1.1, v2.0 and v2.0+EDR.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/c/5/9c5b2167-8017-4bae-9fde-d599bac8184a/Bth_FAQ.docx |title=Bluetooth Wireless Technology FAQ{{nbsp}}– 2010 |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous versions required users to install their Bluetooth adapter's own drivers, which were not directly supported by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Microsoft Technet|website=Changes to Functionality in Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2|title=Network Protection Technologie|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2netwk.mspx|accessdate=1 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101194700/http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2netwk.mspx|archive-date=1 January 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's own Bluetooth dongles (packaged with their Bluetooth computer devices) have no external drivers and thus require at least Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows Vista RTM/SP1 with the Feature Pack for Wireless or Windows Vista SP2 work with Bluetooth v2.1+EDR.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot; /&gt; Windows 7 works with Bluetooth v2.1+EDR and Extended Inquiry Response (EIR).&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot; /&gt;
The Windows XP and Windows Vista/Windows 7 Bluetooth stacks support the following Bluetooth profiles natively: PAN, SPP, [[Dial-up Internet access|DUN]], HID, HCRP. The Windows XP stack can be replaced by a third party stack that supports more profiles or newer Bluetooth versions. The Windows Vista/Windows 7 Bluetooth stack supports vendor-supplied additional profiles without requiring that the Microsoft stack be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot; /&gt; It is generally recommended to install the latest vendor driver and its associated stack to be able to use the Bluetooth device at its fullest extent.

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products have worked with Bluetooth since [[Mac OS X v10.2|Mac OS{{nbsp}}X&amp;nbsp;v10.2]], which was released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/jul/17jaguar.html|title=Apple Introduces &quot;Jaguar,&quot; the Next Major Release of Mac OS X|publisher=Apple|date=17 July 2002|accessdate=4 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218140207/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/jul/17jaguar.html|archive-date=18 February 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linux]] has two popular [[Bluetooth stack]]s, [[BlueZ]] and [[Fluoride (software)|Fluoride]]. The BlueZ stack is included with most Linux kernels and was originally developed by [[Qualcomm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluez.org/ |title=Official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack |publisher=BlueZ |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoride, earlier known as Bluedroid is included in Android OS and was originally developed by [[Broadcom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@zpcat/bluedroid-stack-in-android-564c58b451f4 |title=Bluedroid stack in android |publisher=Jacob su |accessdate=19 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specifications and features ==
The specifications were formalized by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (SIG) and formally announced on 20 May 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.com/about-us/our-history|title=Our History |publisher=Bluetooth.com |date= |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it has a membership of over 30,000 companies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/members/introduction-to-membership |title=English Introduction to Membership |website=Bluetooth.org |date= |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by [[Ericsson]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Nokia]] and [[Toshiba]], and later joined by many other companies.

All versions of the Bluetooth standards support [[Backward compatibility|downward compatibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kohls.com/media/digital/ecom/pdfs/pdf/Bluetooth_Compatibility_Guide_May_2015.pdf |title=Compatibility guide |publisher= |date=2016 |accessdate=18 December 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; That lets the latest standard cover all older versions.

The Bluetooth Core Specification Working Group (CSWG) produces mainly 4 kinds of specifications:
* The Bluetooth Core Specification, release cycle is typically a few years in between
* Core Specification Addendum (CSA), release cycle can be as tight as a few times per year
* Core Specification Supplements (CSS), can be released very quickly
* Errata (Available with a user account: [https://www.bluetooth.com/log-in?btorgReturnURL=/errata/index.cfm?_ga=1.184939692.467079692.1485266743 Errata login])

=== Bluetooth 1.0 and 1.0B ===
Versions 1.0 and 1.0B{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} had many problems, and manufacturers had difficulty making their products interoperable. Versions 1.0 and 1.0B also included mandatory Bluetooth hardware device address (BD_ADDR) transmission in the Connecting process (rendering anonymity impossible at the protocol level), which was a major setback for certain services planned for use in Bluetooth environments.

=== Bluetooth 1.1 ===
* Ratified as [[IEEE 802.15#Task group 1 (WPAN/Bluetooth)|IEEE Standard 802.15.1–2002]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IEEE Std 802.15.1–2002&amp;nbsp;– IEEE Standard for Information technology&amp;nbsp;– Telecommunications and information exchange between systems&amp;nbsp;– Local and metropolitan area networks&amp;nbsp;– Specific requirements Part 15.1: Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2002.93621 |isbn=978-0-7381-3335-5 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many errors found in the v1.0B specifications were fixed.
* Added possibility of non-encrypted channels.
* Received Signal Strength Indicator ([[RSSI]]).

=== Bluetooth 1.2 ===
Major enhancements include:
* Faster Connection and Discovery
* ''Adaptive [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] (AFH)'', which improves resistance to [[radio frequency interference]] by avoiding the use of crowded frequencies in the hopping sequence.
* Higher transmission speeds in practice than in v1.1, up to 721 kbit/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guy Kewney&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Extended Synchronous Connections (eSCO), which improve voice quality of audio links by allowing retransmissions of corrupted packets, and may optionally increase audio latency to provide better concurrent data transfer.
* [[Bluetooth protocols#Host/controller interface (HCI)|Host Controller Interface]] (HCI) operation with three-wire [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]].
* Ratified as [[IEEE 802.15#Task group 1 (WPAN/Bluetooth)|IEEE Standard 802.15.1–2005]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=IEEE Std 802.15.1–2005{{nbsp}}– IEEE Standard for Information technology&amp;nbsp;– Telecommunications and information exchange between systems&amp;nbsp;– Local and metropolitan area networks&amp;nbsp;– Specific requirements Part 15.1: Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for Wireless Personal Area Networks (W Pans) |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2005.96290 |isbn=978-0-7381-4708-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Introduced Flow Control and Retransmission Modes for L2CAP.

=== Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR ===
This version of the Bluetooth Core Specification was released before 2005. The main difference is the introduction of an Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) for [[Bit rate|faster data transfer]]. The bit rate of EDR is 3{{nbsp}}Mbit/s, although the maximum data transfer rate (allowing for inter-packet time and acknowledgements) is 2.1{{nbsp}}Mbit/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guy Kewney&quot; /&gt; EDR uses a combination of [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying|GFSK]] and [[phase-shift keying]] modulation (PSK) with two variants, π/4-[[DQPSK]] and 8-[[DPSK]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bluetooth_specs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=3 May 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDR can provide a lower power consumption through a reduced [[duty cycle]].

The specification is published as ''Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR'', which implies that EDR is an optional feature. Aside from EDR, the v2.0 specification contains other minor improvements, and products may claim compliance to &quot;Bluetooth v2.0&quot; without supporting the higher data rate. At least one commercial device states &quot;Bluetooth v2.0 without EDR&quot; on its data sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR ===
Bluetooth Core Specification Version 2.1 + EDR was adopted by the Bluetooth SIG on 26 July 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;bluetooth_specs&quot; /&gt;

The headline feature of v2.1 is [[#Pairing|secure simple pairing]] (SSP): this improves the pairing experience for Bluetooth devices, while increasing the use and strength of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|date=3 August 2006
|title=Simple Pairing Whitepaper

|archivedate = 18 October 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 2.1 allows various other improvements, including ''extended inquiry response'' (EIR), which provides more information during the inquiry procedure to allow better filtering of devices before connection; and sniff subrating, which reduces the power consumption in low-power mode.

=== Bluetooth 3.0 + HS ===
Version 3.0 + HS of the Bluetooth Core Specification&lt;ref name=&quot;bluetooth_specs&quot; /&gt; was adopted by the Bluetooth SIG on 21 April 2009. Bluetooth v3.0 + HS provides theoretical data transfer speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s, though not over the Bluetooth link itself. Instead, the Bluetooth link is used for negotiation and establishment, and the high data rate traffic is carried over a colocated [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] link.

The main new feature is AMP (Alternative MAC/PHY), the addition of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] as a high-speed transport. The high-speed part of the specification is not mandatory, and hence only devices that display the &quot;+HS&quot; logo actually support Bluetooth over 802.11 high-speed data transfer. A Bluetooth v3.0 device without the &quot;+HS&quot; suffix is only required to support features introduced in Core Specification Version 3.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=40560|title=Bluetooth Core Version 3.0 + HS specification}}&lt;/ref&gt; or earlier Core Specification Addendum 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=174214|title=Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum (CSA) 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[#L2CAP|L2CAP]] Enhanced modes: Enhanced Retransmission Mode (ERTM) implements reliable L2CAP channel, while Streaming Mode (SM) implements unreliable channel with no retransmission or flow control. Introduced in Core Specification Addendum 1.
; Alternative MAC/PHY: Enables the use of alternative [[Media Access Control|MAC]] and [[PHY]]s for transporting Bluetooth profile data. The Bluetooth radio is still used for device discovery, initial connection and profile configuration. However, when large quantities of data must be sent, the high-speed alternative MAC PHY 802.11 (typically associated with Wi-Fi) transports the data. This means that Bluetooth uses proven low power connection models when the system is idle, and the faster radio when it must send large quantities of data. AMP links require enhanced L2CAP modes.
; Unicast Connectionless Data: Permits sending service data without establishing an explicit L2CAP channel. It is intended for use by applications that require low latency between user action and reconnection/transmission of data. This is only appropriate for small amounts of data.
; Enhanced Power Control: Updates the power control feature to remove the open loop power control, and also to clarify ambiguities in power control introduced by the new modulation schemes added for EDR. Enhanced power control removes the ambiguities by specifying the behaviour that is expected. The feature also adds closed loop power control, meaning RSSI filtering can start as the response is received. Additionally, a &quot;go straight to maximum power&quot; request has been introduced. This is expected to deal with the headset link loss issue typically observed when a user puts their phone into a pocket on the opposite side to the headset.

==== Ultra-wideband ====
The high-speed (AMP) feature of Bluetooth v3.0 was originally intended for [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], but the WiMedia Alliance, the body responsible for the flavor of UWB intended for Bluetooth, announced in March 2009 that it was disbanding, and ultimately UWB was omitted from the Core v3.0 specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2009, the [[WiMedia Alliance]] announced it was entering into technology transfer agreements for the WiMedia [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB) specifications. WiMedia has transferred all current and future specifications, including work on future high-speed and power-optimized implementations, to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), [[Wireless USB]] Promoter Group and the [[USB Implementers Forum]]. After successful completion of the technology transfer, marketing, and related administrative items, the WiMedia Alliance ceased operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wimedia.org/ |title=Wimedia.org |publisher=Wimedia.org |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=4 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020426095418/http://www.wimedia.org/ |archivedate=26 April 2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wimedia.org/imwp/download.asp?ContentID=15506 |title=Wimedia.org |accessdate=4 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323120814/http://www.wimedia.org/imwp/download.asp?ContentID=15506 |archivedate=23 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Press-Releases-Detail.aspx?ItemID=4 |title=bluetooth.com |accessdate= 29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usb.org/press/WiMedia_Tech_Transfer/ |title=USB.org |publisher=USB.org |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610211240/http://www.usb.org/press/WiMedia_Tech_Transfer/ |archive-date=10 June 2011 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incisor.tv/2009/03/what-to-make-of-bluetooth-sig-wimedia.html |title=Incisor.tv |publisher=Incisor.tv |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] suspended development of UWB as part of the alternative MAC/PHY, Bluetooth v3.0 + HS solution. A small, but significant, number of former [[WiMedia Alliance|WiMedia]] members had not and would not sign up to the necessary agreements for the [[intellectual property|IP]] transfer. The Bluetooth SIG is now in the process of evaluating other options for its longer term roadmap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=J5E0PN3NQ5BNLQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=221100170|title=Bluetooth group drops ultrawideband, eyes 60 GHz|website=EETimes|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=J5E0PN3NQ5BNLQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=217201265|title=Report: Ultrawideband dies by 2013|website=EETimes|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incisor.tv/download.php?file=140november2009.pdf|title=Simon Stenhouse - Leech Attempt|website=incisor.tv|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{Anchor|v4.0}}Bluetooth 4.0 ===
{{main|Bluetooth Low Energy}}

The Bluetooth SIG completed the Bluetooth Core Specification version 4.0 (called Bluetooth Smart) and has been adopted {{as of|2010|June|30|lc=y}}. It includes ''Classic Bluetooth'', ''Bluetooth high speed'' and ''[[Bluetooth Low Energy]]'' (BLE) protocols. Bluetooth high speed is based on Wi-Fi, and Classic Bluetooth consists of legacy Bluetooth protocols.

[[Bluetooth Low Energy]], previously known as Wibree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.wibree.com/press/Wibree_pressrelease_final_1206.pdf |title=Wibree forum merges with Bluetooth SIG |date=12 June 2007 |publisher=Nokia |accessdate=4 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229073516/http://www.wibree.com/press/Wibree_pressrelease_final_1206.pdf |archive-date=29 December 2014 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack for rapid build-up of simple links. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications powered by a [[Button cell|coin cell]]. Chip designs allow for two types of implementation, dual-mode, single-mode and enhanced past versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Press/SIG/SIG_INTRODUCES_BLUETOOTH_LOW_ENERGY_WIRELESS_TECHNOLOGY_THE_NEXT_GENERATION_OF_BLUETOOTH_WIRELESS_TE.htm |title=Bluetooth.com |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=4 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221175650/http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Press/SIG/SIG_INTRODUCES_BLUETOOTH_LOW_ENERGY_WIRELESS_TECHNOLOGY_THE_NEXT_GENERATION_OF_BLUETOOTH_WIRELESS_TE.htm |archive-date=21 December 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The provisional names ''Wibree'' and ''Bluetooth ULP'' (Ultra Low Power) were abandoned and the BLE name was used for a while.

Compared to ''Classic Bluetooth'', Bluetooth Low Energy is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a [[#Radio interface|similar communication range]]. In terms of lengthening the battery life of Bluetooth devices, {{abbr|BLE|Bluetooth Low Energy}} represents a significant progression.

== Technical information ==

=== Architecture ===

==== Software ====
Seeking to extend the compatibility of Bluetooth devices, the devices that adhere to the standard use an interface called HCI (Host Controller Interface) between the host device (e.g. laptop, phone) the Bluetooth device (e.g. Bluetooth wireless headset).

High-level protocols such as the SDP (Protocol used to find other Bluetooth devices within the communication range, also responsible for detecting the function of devices in range), RFCOMM (Protocol used to emulate serial port connections) and TCS (Telephony control protocol) interact with the baseband controller through the L2CAP Protocol (Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol). The L2CAP protocol is responsible for the segmentation and reassembly of the packets.

==== Hardware ====
The hardware that makes up the Bluetooth device is made up of, logically, two parts; which may or may not be physically separate. A radio device, responsible for modulating and transmitting the signal; and a digital controller. The digital controller is likely a CPU, one of whose functions is to run a Link Controller; and interfaces with the host device; but some functions may be delegated to hardware. The Link Controller is responsible for the processing of the baseband and the management of ARQ and physical layer FEC protocols. In addition, it handles the transfer functions (both asynchronous and synchronous), audio coding and data encryption. The CPU of the device is responsible for attending the instructions related to Bluetooth of the host device, in order to simplify its operation. To do this, the CPU runs software called Link Manager that has the function of communicating with other devices through the LMP protocol.

A Bluetooth device is a [[short-range device|short-range]] [[wireless]] device. Bluetooth devices are [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on [[RF CMOS]] [[integrated circuit]] ([[RF circuit]]) chips.&lt;ref name=&quot;Happich&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Veendrick |first1=Harry J. M. |title=Nanometer CMOS ICs: From Basics to ASICs |date=2017 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319475974 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv_EDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bluetooth protocol stack ===
{{Main|Bluetooth protocols}}
[[File:Bluetooth protokoly.svg|thumb|250px|right|Bluetooth Protocol Stack]]

Bluetooth is defined as a layer protocol architecture consisting of core protocols, cable replacement protocols, telephony control protocols, and adopted protocols.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Stallings, William. (2005). ''Wireless communications &amp; networks.'=' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.''&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory protocols for all Bluetooth stacks are LMP, L2CAP and SDP. In addition, devices that communicate with Bluetooth almost universally can use these protocols: [[Bluetooth protocols#Host Controller Interface (HCI)|HCI]] and RFCOMM.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==== Link Manager ====
The Link Manager (LM) is the system that manages establishing the connection between devices. It is responsible for the establishment, authentication and configuration of the link. The Link Manager locates other managers and communicates with them via the management protocol of the LMP link. In order to perform its function as a service provider, the LM uses the services included in the Link Controller (LC).
The Link Manager Protocol basically consists of a number of PDUs (Protocol Data Units) that are sent from one device to another. The following is a list of supported services:
* Transmission and reception of data.
* Name request
* Request of the link addresses.
* Establishment of the connection.
* Authentication.
* Negotiation of link mode and connection establishment.

==== Host Controller Interface ====
The Host Controller Interface provides a command interface for the controller and for the link manager, which allows access to the hardware status and control registers.
This interface provides an access layer for all Bluetooth devices. The HCI layer of the machine exchanges commands and data with the HCI firmware present in the Bluetooth device. One of the most important HCI tasks that must be performed is the automatic discovery of other Bluetooth devices that are within the coverage radius.

==== Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol ====
The ''Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol'' (L2CAP) is used to multiplex multiple logical connections between two devices using different higher level protocols.
Provides segmentation and reassembly of on-air packets.

In ''Basic'' mode, L2CAP provides packets with a payload configurable up to 64&amp;nbsp;kB, with 672 bytes as the default [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]], and 48 bytes as the minimum mandatory supported MTU.

In ''Retransmission and Flow Control'' modes, L2CAP can be configured either for isochronous data or reliable data per channel by performing retransmissions and CRC checks.

Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum 1 adds two additional L2CAP modes to the core specification. These modes effectively deprecate original Retransmission and Flow Control modes:
; Enhanced Retransmission Mode (ERTM): This mode is an improved version of the original retransmission mode. This mode provides a reliable L2CAP channel.
; Streaming Mode (SM): This is a very simple mode, with no retransmission or flow control. This mode provides an unreliable L2CAP channel.

Reliability in any of these modes is optionally and/or additionally guaranteed by the lower layer Bluetooth BDR/EDR air interface by configuring the number of retransmissions and flush timeout (time after which the radio flushes packets). In-order sequencing is guaranteed by the lower layer.

Only L2CAP channels configured in ERTM or SM may be operated over AMP logical links.

==== Service Discovery Protocol ====
The ''Service Discovery Protocol'' (SDP) allows a device to discover services offered by other devices, and their associated parameters. For example, when you use a mobile phone with a Bluetooth headset, the phone uses SDP to determine which [[Bluetooth profile]]s the headset can use (Headset Profile, Hands Free Profile, [[Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)]] etc.) and the protocol multiplexer settings needed for the phone to connect to the headset using each of them. Each service is identified by a [[Universally Unique Identifier]] (UUID), with official services (Bluetooth profiles) assigned a short form UUID (16 bits rather than the full 128).

==== Radio Frequency Communications ====
''Radio Frequency Communications'' (RFCOMM) is a cable replacement protocol used for generating a virtual serial data stream. RFCOMM provides for binary data transport and emulates [[EIA-232]] (formerly RS-232) control signals over the Bluetooth baseband layer, i.e., it is a serial port emulation.

RFCOMM provides a simple, reliable, data stream to the user, similar to TCP. It is used directly by many telephony related profiles as a carrier for AT commands, as well as being a transport layer for OBEX over Bluetooth.

Many Bluetooth applications use RFCOMM because of its widespread support and publicly available API on most operating systems. Additionally, applications that used a serial port to communicate can be quickly ported to use RFCOMM.

==== Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol ====
The ''Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol'' (BNEP) is used for transferring another protocol stack's data via an L2CAP channel.
Its main purpose is the transmission of IP packets in the Personal Area Networking Profile.
BNEP performs a similar function to [[Subnetwork Access Protocol|SNAP]] in Wireless LAN.

==== Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol ====
The ''Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol'' (AVCTP) is used by the remote control profile to transfer AV/C commands over an L2CAP channel. The music control buttons on a stereo headset use this protocol to control the music player.

==== Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol ====
The ''Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol'' (AVDTP) is used by the advanced audio distribution ([[A2DP]]) profile to stream music to stereo headsets over an [[List of Bluetooth protocols#Logical link control and adaptation protocol (L2CAP)|L2CAP]] channel intended for video distribution profile in the Bluetooth transmission.

==== Telephony Control Protocol ====
The ''Telephony Control Protocol{{nbsp}}– Binary'' (TCS BIN) is the bit-oriented protocol that defines the call control signaling for the establishment of voice and data calls between Bluetooth devices. Additionally, &quot;TCS BIN defines mobility management procedures for handling groups of Bluetooth TCS devices.&quot;

TCS-BIN is only used by the cordless telephony profile, which failed to attract implementers. As such it is only of historical interest.

==== Adopted protocols ====
Adopted protocols are defined by other standards-making organizations and incorporated into Bluetooth's protocol stack, allowing Bluetooth to code protocols only when necessary. The adopted protocols include:
;[[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP): Internet standard protocol for transporting [[IP datagram]]s over a point-to-point link.
;[[TCP/IP]]/UDP: Foundation Protocols for TCP/IP protocol suite
;[[OBject EXchange|Object Exchange Protocol]] (OBEX): Session-layer protocol for the exchange of objects, providing a model for object and operation representation
;[[Wireless Application Protocol|Wireless Application Environment/Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAE/WAP): WAE specifies an application framework for wireless devices and WAP is an open standard to provide mobile users access to telephony and information services.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

=== Baseband error correction ===
Depending on packet type, individual packets may be protected by [[error correction]], either 1/3 rate [[forward error correction]] (FEC) or 2/3 rate. In addition, packets with CRC will be retransmitted until acknowledged by [[automatic repeat request]] (ARQ).

=== Setting up connections ===
Any Bluetooth device in ''discoverable mode'' transmits the following information on demand:
* Device name
* Device class
* List of services
* Technical information (for example: device features, manufacturer, Bluetooth specification used, clock offset)

Any device may perform an inquiry to find other devices to connect to, and any device can be configured to respond to such inquiries. However, if the device trying to connect knows the address of the device, it always responds to direct connection requests and transmits the information shown in the list above if requested. Use of a device's services may require pairing or acceptance by its owner, but the connection itself can be initiated by any device and held until it goes out of range. Some devices can be connected to only one device at a time, and connecting to them prevents them from connecting to other devices and appearing in inquiries until they disconnect from the other device.

Every device has a [[MAC address|unique 48-bit address]]. However, these addresses are generally not shown in inquiries. Instead, friendly Bluetooth names are used, which can be set by the user. This name appears when another user scans for devices and in lists of paired devices.

Most cellular phones have the Bluetooth name set to the manufacturer and model of the phone by default. Most cellular phones and laptops show only the Bluetooth names and special programs are required to get additional information about remote devices. This can be confusing as, for example, there could be several cellular phones in range named [[Sony Ericsson T610|T610]] (see [[Bluejacking]]).

{{anchor|Pairing}}

=== Pairing and bonding ===

==== Motivation ====
Many services offered over Bluetooth can expose private data or let a connecting party control the Bluetooth device. Security reasons make it necessary to recognize specific devices, and thus enable control over which devices can connect to a given Bluetooth device. At the same time, it is useful for Bluetooth devices to be able to establish a connection without user intervention (for example, as soon as in range).

To resolve this conflict, Bluetooth uses a process called ''bonding'', and a bond is generated through a process called ''pairing''. The pairing process is triggered either by a specific request from a user to generate a bond (for example, the user explicitly requests to &quot;Add a Bluetooth device&quot;), or it is triggered automatically when connecting to a service where (for the first time) the identity of a device is required for security purposes. These two cases are referred to as dedicated bonding and general bonding respectively.

Pairing often involves some level of user interaction. This user interaction confirms the identity of the devices. When pairing successfully completes, a bond forms between the two devices, enabling those two devices to connect to each other in the future without repeating the pairing process to confirm device identities. When desired, the user can remove the bonding relationship.

==== Implementation ====
During pairing, the two devices establish a relationship by creating a [[shared secret]] known as a ''link key''. If both devices store the same link key, they are said to be ''paired'' or ''bonded''. A device that wants to communicate only with a bonded device can [[cryptography|cryptographically]] [[authentication|authenticate]] the identity of the other device, ensuring it is the same device it previously paired with. Once a link key is generated, an authenticated [[Asynchronous Connection-Less]] (ACL) link between the devices may be [[encryption|encrypted]] to protect exchanged data against [[eavesdropping]]. Users can delete link keys from either device, which removes the bond between the devices—so it is possible for one device to have a stored link key for a device it is no longer paired with.

Bluetooth services generally require either encryption or authentication and as such require pairing before they let a remote device connect. Some services, such as the Object Push Profile, elect not to explicitly require authentication or encryption so that pairing does not interfere with the user experience associated with the service use-cases.

==== Pairing mechanisms ====
Pairing mechanisms changed significantly with the introduction of Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth v2.1. The following summarizes the pairing mechanisms:
* ''Legacy pairing'': This is the only method available in Bluetooth v2.0 and before. Each device must enter a [[Personal identification number|PIN code]]; pairing is only successful if both devices enter the same PIN code. Any 16-byte UTF-8 string may be used as a PIN code; however, not all devices may be capable of entering all possible PIN codes.
** ''Limited input devices'': The obvious example of this class of device is a Bluetooth Hands-free headset, which generally have few inputs. These devices usually have a ''fixed PIN'', for example &quot;0000&quot; or &quot;1234&quot;, that are hard-coded into the device.
** ''Numeric input devices'': Mobile phones are classic examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter a numeric value up to 16 digits in length.
** ''Alpha-numeric input devices'': PCs and smartphones are examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter full UTF-8 text as a PIN code. If pairing with a less capable device the user must be aware of the input limitations on the other device; there is no mechanism available for a capable device to determine how it should limit the available input a user may use.
* ''Secure Simple Pairing'' (SSP): This is required by Bluetooth v2.1, although a Bluetooth v2.1 device may only use legacy pairing to interoperate with a v2.0 or earlier device. Secure Simple Pairing uses a form of [[public key cryptography]], and some types can help protect against [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]], or MITM attacks. SSP has the following authentication mechanisms:
** ''Just works'': As the name implies, this method just works, with no user interaction. However, a device may prompt the user to confirm the pairing process. This method is typically used by headsets with very limited IO capabilities, and is more secure than the fixed PIN mechanism this limited set of devices uses for legacy pairing. This method provides no man-in-the-middle (MITM) protection.
** ''Numeric comparison'': If both devices have a display, and at least one can accept a binary yes/no user input, they may use Numeric Comparison. This method displays a 6-digit numeric code on each device. The user should compare the numbers to ensure they are identical. If the comparison succeeds, the user(s) should confirm pairing on the device(s) that can accept an input. This method provides MITM protection, assuming the user confirms on both devices and actually performs the comparison properly.
** ''Passkey Entry'': This method may be used between a device with a display and a device with numeric keypad entry (such as a keyboard), or two devices with numeric keypad entry. In the first case, the display presents a 6-digit numeric code to the user, who then enters the code on the keypad. In the second case, the user of each device enters the same 6-digit number. Both of these cases provide MITM protection.
** ''Out of band'' (OOB): This method uses an external means of communication, such as [[near-field communication]] (NFC) to exchange some information used in the pairing process. Pairing is completed using the Bluetooth radio, but requires information from the OOB mechanism. This provides only the level of MITM protection that is present in the OOB mechanism.

SSP is considered simple for the following reasons:
* In most cases, it does not require a user to generate a passkey.
* For use cases not requiring MITM protection, user interaction can be eliminated.
* For ''numeric comparison'', MITM protection can be achieved with a simple equality comparison by the user.
* Using OOB with NFC enables pairing when devices simply get close, rather than requiring a lengthy discovery process.

==== Security concerns ====
Prior to Bluetooth v2.1, encryption is not required and can be turned off at any time. Moreover, the encryption key is only good for approximately 23.5 hours; using a single encryption key longer than this time allows simple [[Stream cipher attack|XOR attacks]] to retrieve the encryption key.
* Turning off encryption is required for several normal operations, so it is problematic to detect if encryption is disabled for a valid reason or for a security attack.
Bluetooth v2.1 addresses this in the following ways:
* Encryption is required for all non-SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) connections
* A new Encryption Pause and Resume feature is used for all normal operations that require that encryption be disabled. This enables easy identification of normal operation from security attacks.
* The encryption key must be refreshed before it expires.
Link keys may be stored on the device file system, not on the Bluetooth chip itself. Many Bluetooth chip manufacturers let link keys be stored on the device—however, if the device is removable, this means that the link key moves with the device.

Bluetooth implements [[confidentiality]], [[authentication]] and [[key (cryptography)|key]] derivation with custom algorithms based on the [[SAFER|SAFER+]] [[block cipher]]. Bluetooth key generation is generally based on a Bluetooth PIN, which must be entered into both devices. This procedure might be modified if one of the devices has a fixed PIN (e.g., for headsets or similar devices with a restricted user interface). During pairing, an initialization key or master key is generated, using the E22 algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[E0 (cipher)|E0]] stream cipher is used for encrypting packets, granting confidentiality, and is based on a shared cryptographic secret, namely a previously generated link key or master key. Those keys, used for subsequent encryption of data sent via the air interface, rely on the Bluetooth PIN, which has been entered into one or both devices.

In September 2008, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) published a Guide to Bluetooth Security as a reference for organizations. It describes Bluetooth security capabilities and how to secure Bluetooth technologies effectively. While Bluetooth has its benefits, it is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, message modification, and resource misappropriation. Users and organizations must evaluate their acceptable level of risk and incorporate security into the lifecycle of Bluetooth devices. To help mitigate risks, included in the NIST document are security checklists with guidelines and recommendations for creating and maintaining secure Bluetooth piconets, headsets, and smart card readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Bluetooth v2.1&amp;nbsp;– finalized in 2007 with consumer devices first appearing in 2009&amp;nbsp;– makes significant changes to Bluetooth's security, including pairing. See the [[#Pairing mechanisms|pairing mechanisms]] section for more about these changes.

=== Bluejacking ===
{{main|Bluejacking}}
Bluejacking is the sending of either a picture or a message from one user to an unsuspecting user through Bluetooth wireless technology. Common applications include short messages, e.g., &quot;You've just been bluejacked!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/bluejacking.htm|title=What is bluejacking?|author=John Fuller|publisher=howstuffworks|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluejacking does not involve the removal or alteration of any data from the device.&lt;ref&gt;Kaviarasu, S., &amp; Muthupandian, P. (2016). Bluejacking Technology: A Review. International
 	Journal of Trend in Research and Development, 3(6), 1. Retrieved October 2018, from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314233155_Bluejacking_Technology_A_Review
&lt;/ref&gt; Bluejacking can also involve taking control of a mobile device wirelessly and phoning a premium rate line, owned by the bluejacker. Security advances have alleviated this issue.

=== History of security concerns ===

In 2001, Jakobsson and Wetzel from [[Bell Laboratories]] discovered flaws in the Bluetooth pairing protocol and also pointed to vulnerabilities in the encryption scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A new attack called [[Bluebugging|BlueBug]] was used for this experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the first purported [[computer virus|virus]] using Bluetooth to spread itself among mobile phones appeared on the [[Symbian OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=1 February 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The virus was first described by [[Kaspersky Lab]] and requires users to confirm the installation of unknown software before it can propagate. The virus was written as a proof-of-concept by a group of virus writers known as &quot;29A&quot; and sent to anti-virus groups. Thus, it should be regarded as a potential (but not real) security threat to Bluetooth technology or [[Symbian OS]] since the virus has never spread outside of this system. In August 2004, a world-record-setting experiment (see also [[Bluetooth sniping]]) showed that the range of Class&amp;nbsp;2 Bluetooth radios could be extended to {{convert|1.78|km|mi|abbr=on}} with directional antennas and signal amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This poses a potential security threat because it enables attackers to access vulnerable Bluetooth devices from a distance beyond expectation. The attacker must also be able to receive information from the victim to set up a connection. No attack can be made against a Bluetooth device unless the attacker knows its Bluetooth address and which channels to transmit on, although these can be deduced within a few minutes if the device is in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==== 2005 ====
In January 2005, a mobile [[malware]] worm known as Lasco surfaced. The worm began targeting mobile phones using [[Symbian OS]] ([[S60 (software platform)|Series 60 platform]]) using Bluetooth enabled devices to replicate itself and spread to other devices. The worm is self-installing and begins once the mobile user approves the transfer of the file (Velasco.sis) from another device. Once installed, the worm begins looking for other Bluetooth enabled devices to infect. Additionally, the worm infects other [[.SIS]]&amp;nbsp;files on the device, allowing replication to another device through the use of removable media ([[Secure Digital]], [[CompactFlash]], etc.). The worm can render the mobile device unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In April 2005, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] security researchers published results of their actual implementation of passive attacks against the [[Personal identification number|PIN-based]] pairing between commercial Bluetooth devices. They confirmed that attacks are practicably fast, and the Bluetooth symmetric key establishment method is vulnerable. To rectify this vulnerability, they designed an implementation that showed that stronger, asymmetric key establishment is feasible for certain classes of devices, such as mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The passive attack allows a suitably equipped attacker to eavesdrop on communications and spoof if the attacker was present at the time of initial pairing. The active method makes use of a specially constructed message that must be inserted at a specific point in the protocol, to make the master and slave repeat the pairing process. After that, the first method can be used to crack the PIN. This attack's major weakness is that it requires the user of the devices under attack to re-enter the PIN during the attack when the device prompts them to. Also, this active attack probably requires custom hardware, since most commercially available Bluetooth devices are not capable of the timing necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
