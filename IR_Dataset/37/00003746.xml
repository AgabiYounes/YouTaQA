'''''Blade Runner''''' is a 1982 [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]], and written by [[Hampton Fancher]] and [[David Peoples]]. Starring [[Harrison Ford]], [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Sean Young]], it is loosely based on [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (1968). The film is set in a [[dystopia]]n future [[Los Angeles]] of 2019, in which [[android (robot)|synthetic humans]] known as [[replicant]]s are [[bio-engineered]] by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on [[space colonization|off-world colonies]]. When a fugitive group of advanced replicants led by [[Roy Batty]] (Hauer) escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop [[Rick Deckard]] (Ford) reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.

''Blade Runner'' initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals, while others were displeased with its slow pacing and lack of action. It later became an acclaimed [[cult film]] regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the best|all-time best science fiction films]]. Hailed for its production design depicting a &quot;[[retrofitted]]&quot; future, ''Blade Runner'' is a leading example of [[neo-noir]] cinema. The [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack]], composed by [[Vangelis]], was nominated in 1982 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and a [[Golden Globe]] as best original [[film score|score]].

The film has influenced many science fiction films, [[video game]]s, [[anime]], and television series. It brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood, and several later big-budget films were based on his work. In the year after its release, ''Blade Runner'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], and in 1993 it was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. A sequel, ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'', was released in October 2017.

[[Versions of Blade Runner|Seven versions of ''Blade Runner'']] exist as a result of controversial changes requested by studio executives. A [[director's cut]] was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a [[workprint]]. This, in conjunction with the film's popularity as a video rental, made it one of the earliest movies to be released on [[DVD]]. In 2007, [[Warner Bros.]]&amp;nbsp;released ''[[Versions of Blade Runner#The Final Cut (2007)|The Final Cut]]'', a 25th-anniversary digitally remastered version; the only version over which Scott retained artistic control.

In 2019 Los Angeles, former policeman [[Rick Deckard]] is detained by officer [[List of Blade Runner characters#Gaff|Gaff]], and brought to his former supervisor, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Harry Bryant|Bryant]]. Deckard, whose job as a &quot;blade runner&quot; was to track down bioengineered humanoids known as [[replicant]]s and &quot;retire&quot; (kill) them, is informed that four replicants are on Earth illegally. Deckard starts to leave, but Bryant ambiguously threatens him, and he stays. The two watch a video of a blade runner named [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dave Holden|Holden]] administering the Voight-Kampff test, which is designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject, [[Leon Kowalski|Leon]], shoots Holden on the second question. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three Nexus-6 replicants: [[List of Blade Runner characters#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], [[Characters in Blade Runner#Zhora Salome|Zhora]], and [[List of Blade Runner characters#Pris Stratton|Pris]].

Bryant has Deckard meet with the CEO of the company that creates the replicants, [[List of Blade Runner characters#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Eldon Tyrell]], so he can administer the test on a Nexus-6 to see if it works. Tyrell expresses his interest in seeing the test fail first and asks him to administer it on his assistant [[List of Blade Runner characters#Rachael|Rachael]]. After a much longer than standard test, Deckard concludes that Rachael is a replicant who believes she is human. Tyrell explains that she is an experiment who has been given false memories to provide an &quot;emotional cushion&quot;.

Searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds photos and a synthetic snake scale. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of [[List of Blade Runner characters#J. F. Sebastian|J. F. Sebastian]], a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Deckard returns to his apartment where Rachael is waiting. She tries to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, she leaves in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.

A photograph from Leon's apartment and the snake scale lead Deckard to a strip club, where Zhora works. After a confrontation and chase, Deckard kills Zhora. Bryant orders him also to retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, who knocks the gun out of Deckard's hand and brutally attacks him. As he's about to kill Deckard, Rachael saves him by using Deckard's gun to kill Leon. They return to Deckard's apartment and during a discussion, he promises not to track her down; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard restrains her, making her kiss him. She continues to resist, and he blocks her attempts to leave. He persists in his advances, and she ultimately relents.

Arriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris that the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of &quot;Methuselah Syndrome&quot;, a genetic [[premature aging]] disorder, his life will be cut short, just like them. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done &quot;questionable things&quot;, but Tyrell dismisses this, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator, followed by Roy, who rides the elevator down alone.{{#tag:ref|Sebastian's death was never shot because of concerns over too much violence in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Deckard is later told by Bryant that Sebastian was found dead.

At Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he kills her as Roy returns. Roy's body begins to fail as the end of his lifespan nears. He chases Deckard through the building, ending up on the roof. Deckard tries to jump onto another roof, but is left hanging on the edge. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. Before Roy dies, he delivers a monolog about how his memories &quot;[[Tears in rain monologue|will be lost in time, like tears in rain]]&quot;. Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard about Rachael: &quot;It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?&quot; Deckard returns to his apartment and finds Rachael asleep in his bed. They leave the apartment block together.

== Themes ==
{{Main|Themes in Blade Runner}}
The film operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It employs some of the conventions of [[film noir]], among them the character of a ''[[femme fatale]]''; narration by the protagonist (in the original release); [[chiaroscuro]] cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook&amp;nbsp;– extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;&gt;Barlow, Aaron &quot;Reel Toads and Imaginary Cities: Philip K.

''Blade Runner'' delves into the effects of technology on the environment and society by reaching to the past, using literature, [[religious symbolism]], classical dramatic themes, and ''film noir'' techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is represented in the &quot;retrofitted&quot; future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as &quot;extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel&quot;. He also said that he &quot;liked the idea of exploring pain&quot; in the wake of his brother's death: &quot;When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scottobserver&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Barber |first=Lynn |title=Scott's Corner |date=January 6, 2002 |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,628186,00.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720054223/http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0%2C%2C628186%2C00.html |url-status=dead |work=[[The Observer]] |location=London |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-date=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sense of foreboding and paranoia pervades the world of the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored&amp;nbsp;–
especially regarding replicants' implanted memories. Control over the environment is exercised on a vast scale, and goes hand in hand with the absence of any natural life; for example, artificial animals stand in for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to &quot;off-world&quot; (extraterrestrial) colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Leaver |first=Tama |year=1997 |title=Post-Humanism and Ecocide in William Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' and Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' |url=http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130703104841/http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |via=The Cyberpunk Project}}{{self-published source|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question the nature of reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heldreth, Leonard G. &quot;The Cutting Edges of ''Blade Runner''&quot; in Kerman (1991), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals&amp;nbsp;– seemingly an essential indicator of one's &quot;humanity&quot;. The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy, while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to question if Deckard might be a replicant, in the process asking the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.&lt;ref&gt;Gwaltney, Marilyn. &quot;Androids as a Device for Reflection on Personhood&quot; in Kerman (1991), pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 80–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/deckard-replicant-history-blade-runners-enduring-mystery/ |title=Is Deckard a Replicant?

''Blade Runner'' used a number of then-lesser-known actors: [[Sean Young]] portrays Rachael, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece, causing her to believe she is human;&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nina Axelrod]] auditioned for the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; [[Daryl Hannah]] portrays Pris, a &quot;basic pleasure model&quot; replicant; [[Stacey Nelkin]] auditioned for the role, but was given another part in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; Casting Pris and Rachael was challenging, requiring several screen tests with [[Morgan Paull]] playing the role of Deckard. Paull was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; [[Brion James]] portrays Leon Kowalski, a combat and laborer replicant, and [[Joanna Cassidy]] portrays Zhora, an assassin replicant.

[[Edward James Olmos]] portrays Gaff.

Interest in adapting [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director [[Martin Scorsese]] was interested in filming the novel, but never [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]] it.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 13; Sammon, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Herb Jaffe]] optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: &quot;Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done&amp;nbsp;... Robert flew down to [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?{{' &quot;}}&lt;ref&gt;Dick quoted in Sammon, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenplay by [[Hampton Fancher]]&lt;!--Not titled &quot;Android&quot; initially&amp;nbsp;– See Sammon, pp. 32 and 38 for explanation--&gt; was optioned in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 23–30&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Michael Deeley]] became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]'', wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised [[Filmways]] financing from US$13&amp;nbsp;million to $15&amp;nbsp;million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by [[William S. Burroughs]] for [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s novel ''[[The Bladerunner]]'' (1974), titled ''[[Blade Runner (a movie)]]''.{{refn|Some editions of Nourse's novel use the two-word spacing ''Blade Runner'', as does the Burroughs book.|group=nb}} Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Riesman,

Having invested over $2.5 million in pre-production,&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5&amp;nbsp;million in financing through a three-way deal between [[The Ladd Company]] (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer [[Run Run Shaw|Sir Run Run Shaw]] and [[Tandem Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 18–19; Sammon, pp. 64–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles ''Select TV Guide'', the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 67–69&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p284&quot;&gt;Sammon, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; He said, &quot;I saw a segment of [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s special effects for ''Blade Runner'' on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly.&quot; He also approved of the film's script, saying, &quot;After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick's final interview&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Boonstra |first=John |title=A final interview with science fiction's boldest visionary, who talks candidly about ''Blade Runner'', inner voices and the temptations of Hollywood |work=Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone Magazine |via=Philip K.

In 1992, Ford revealed, &quot;''Blade Runner'' is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the [[voice-over|voiceovers]]: &quot;When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration.

The Voight-Kampff machine is a fictional interrogation tool, originating from the novel (where it is spelled &quot;Voigt-Kampff&quot;). The Voight-Kampff is a [[polygraph]]-like machine used by blade runners to determine whether an individual is a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement in response to questions dealing with empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; (Tyrell states: &quot;Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary dilation of the iris?&quot;) In the film, two replicants&amp;nbsp;– Leon and Rachael&amp;nbsp;– take the test. Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes six or seven questions to make a determination. In the film, it takes more than a hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant. ''Blade Runner 2049'' uses a different but related tool called the Baseline Test.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Blade Runner (soundtrack)}}
The ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack by [[Vangelis]] is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by Ridley Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;NSVan&quot;&gt;{{citation |author=Vangelis |author-link=Vangelis |title=Blade Runner&amp;nbsp;– Scoring the music |work=NemoStudios.co.uk |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/bladerunner/index.htm |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131019015508/http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/bladerunner/index.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2013}}{{self-published source |date=February 2018 |reason=This SPS is permissible per WP:ABOUTSELF.}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed and performed the music on his synthesizers.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 271–274&lt;/ref&gt; He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator [[Demis Roussos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot;&gt;Sammon, pp. 419–423&lt;/ref&gt; Another memorable sound is the tenor sax solo &quot;Love Theme&quot; by British saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]], who performed on many of Vangelis's albums. Ridley Scott also used &quot;Memories of Green&quot; from the Vangelis album ''[[See You Later]], ''an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Larsen |first=Peter |title=Film music |publisher=[[Reaktion Books]] |location=London |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-86189-341-3 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Vangelis' compositions and ambient textures, the film's soundscape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia&amp;nbsp;– &quot;Ogi no Mato&quot; or &quot;The Folding Fan as a Target&quot; from the Nonesuch Records release ''Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music''&amp;nbsp;– and a track by harpist Gail Laughton from &quot;Harps of the Ancient Temples&quot; on Laurel Records.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1982 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from [[Polydor Records]] in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from ''Blade Runner''. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the [[New American Orchestra]] recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation ''Vangelis: Themes'', but not until the 1992 release of the ''Director's Cut'' version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot; /&gt;

These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many [[bootleg recording]]s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 &quot;Off World Music, Ltd&quot; created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot; /&gt; A set with three CDs of ''Blade Runner''-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled ''Blade Runner Trilogy'', the first disc contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second features previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third disc is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |title=Album Review: Vangelis: ''Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary'' |first=Mike |last=Orme |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=July 27, 2011 |date=February 7, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200702/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==

=== Theatrical run ===
''Blade Runner'' was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer [[Alan Ladd Jr.]] because his previous highest-grossing films (''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'') had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the 25th of the month his &quot;lucky day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blade Runner'' grossed reasonably good ticket sales in its opening weekend; earning $6.1 million during its first weekend in theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Harmetz |first=Aljean |title=''E.T.'' May Set Sales Record |at=Section C, Cultural Desk, page 9 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 29, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released close to other major science-fiction and fantasy releases such as ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which affected its commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Versions ===
{{Main|Versions of Blade Runner}}
Several versions of ''Blade Runner'' have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kaplan |first=Fred |title=A Cult Classic Restored, Again |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/movies/30kapl.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 30, 2007 |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131220052847/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/movies/30kapl.html |archive-date=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 36–37; Sammon, pp. 334–340&lt;/ref&gt; Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 306 and 309–311&lt;/ref&gt;

Two versions were shown in the film's 1982 theatrical release: the U.S. theatrical version (117 minutes),&lt;ref name=bbfcoriginal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/blade-runner-film-1 |title=''Blade Runner'' |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |date=May 27, 1982 |access-date=January 8, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160322161256/http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/blade-runner-film-1 |archive-date=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the original version or ''Domestic Cut'' (released on [[Betamax]], [[CED Videodisc]] and [[VHS]] in 1983, and on [[LaserDisc]] in 1987), and the ''International Cut'' (117 minutes), also known as the &quot;Criterion Edition&quot; or &quot;uncut version&quot;, which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S. and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases, the ''International Cut'' was later released on VHS and [[Criterion Collection]] Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 326–329&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 90% approval rating based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 8.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads, &quot;Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir ''Blade Runner'' has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner |title=Blade Runner (1982) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512035445/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blade_runner/ |archive-date=May 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 89 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/blade-runner |title=Blade Runner (1982) |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 29, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604162806/https://www.metacritic.com/movie/blade-runner |archive-date=June 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reactions among film critics were mixed. Some wrote that the plot took a back seat to the film's special effects and did not fit the studio's marketing as an action and adventure movie. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 313–315.&lt;/ref&gt; Negative criticism in the United States cited its slow pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hicks |first=Chris |date=September 11, 1992 |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000200/Blade-Runner.html |title=Movie review: Blade Runner |work=[[Deseret News]] |access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140407001657/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000200/Blade-Runner.html |archive-date=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheila Benson from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it &quot;Blade Crawler&quot;, and Pat Berman in ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'' and ''[[Columbia Record]]'' described it as &quot;science fiction pornography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sammon, p. 313 and p. 314, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] praised ''Blade Runner'' as worthy of a place in film history for its distinctive sci-fi vision, yet criticized the film's lack of development in &quot;human terms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kael&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Kael |first=Pauline |title=Taking It All In |year=1984 |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |isbn=978-0-03-069361-8 |pages=360–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before filming began, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write a special issue about ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s production which became the book ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner''.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The book chronicles ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s evolution, focusing on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] has said, &quot;Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was 'ready to kill Ridley', said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadn't been talked out of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shone |first=Tom |year=2004 |title=Blockbuster |isbn=978-0-7432-3990-5 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Future Noir'' has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences, and photographs of the film's production and preliminary sketches. A second edition of ''Future Noir'' was published in 2007, and additional materials not in either print edition have been published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://scribble.com/uwi/br/fn/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20010624131853/http://scribble.com/uwi/br/fn/ |archive-date=June 24, 2001 |title=''Future Noir'': Lost Chapters |work=2019: Off-World |via=Scribble.com |access-date=February 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip K. Dick]] refused a $400,000 offer to write a ''Blade Runner'' [[novelization]], saying: &quot;[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience&quot; and it &quot;would have probably been disastrous to me artistically&quot;. He added, &quot;That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization&amp;nbsp;– they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick's final interview&quot; /&gt; ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' was eventually reprinted as a [[Movie tie-in (book)|tie-in]], with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the ''Blade Runner'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=n0pzCsR6yDQC |via=Google Books |title=Blade Runner: (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) |last=Dick |first=Philip K. |year=2007 |publisher=Del Rey Books |page=216 |access-date=July 27, 2011 |isbn=978-0-345-35047-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a novelization of the movie entitled ''Blade Runner: A Story of the Future'' by Les Martin was released in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/09/hear-novelizations-of-blade-runner-terminator-videodrome-other-70s-80s-90s-movies-in-audiobook-format.html |title=Hear ''Blade Runner'', ''Terminator'', ''Videodrome'' &amp; Other 70s, 80s &amp; 90s Movies as Novelized AudioBooks |first=Colin |last=Marshall |work=Open Culture |date=September 14, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161224213224/http://www.openculture.com/2015/09/hear-novelizations-of-blade-runner-terminator-videodrome-other-70s-80s-90s-movies-in-audiobook-format.html |archive-date=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] scripted the comic book adaptation, ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|A Marvel Super Special]]: Blade Runner'', published in September 1982, which was illustrated by Al Williamson, Carlos Garzon, Dan Green, and Ralph Reese, and lettered by Ed King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/issue/36674/ |title=''Marvel Super Special'' #22 |work=Grand Comics Database |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140406235318/http://www.comics.org/issue/36674/ |archive-date=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two [[video game]]s based on the film, both titled ''Blade Runner'': [[Blade Runner (1985 video game)|one from 1985]], an action-adventure [[side-scroller]] for [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], and [[Amstrad CPC]] by CRL Group PLC, marked as based on the music by Vangelis rather than the film itself (due to licensing issues); and [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|another from 1997]], a point-and-click adventure by [[Westwood Studios]]. The 1997 video game featured new characters and branching storylines based on the ''Blade Runner'' world. Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, J. F. Sebastian and Howie Lee appear, and their voice files are recorded by the original actors, with the exception of Gaff, who is replaced by Javier Grajeda (as [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)#Main characters|Victor Gardell]]) and Howie Lee, who is replaced by Toru Nagai.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Game_MW01.htm |title=The ''Blade Runner'' Game |work=BRMovie.com |editor-first=Lukas |editor-last=Mariman |display-editors=etal|access-date=August 10, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080714055512/http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Game_MW01.htm |archive-date = July 14, 2008}}{{self-published source|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working at the same time as Deckard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkins&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosca&quot; /&gt;

The PC game featured a non-linear plot, [[non-player character]]s that each ran in their own independent [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of [[Voxel#Computer gaming|voxel]] elements) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bates |first=Jason |title=Westwood's Blade Runner |work=PC Gamer |volume=4 |issue=9 |via=''BladeZone'' |date=September 9, 1997 |url=http://media.bladezone.com/contents/game/BR-PCGame1.html | access-date=July 27, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121127104952/http://media.bladezone.com/contents/game/BR-PCGame1.html |archive-date=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television film (and later series) ''[[Total Recall 2070]]'' was initially planned as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the film ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (based on Philip K. Dick's short story &quot;[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]&quot;), but was produced as a hybrid of ''Total Recall'' and ''Blade Runner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Robb |first=Brian J. |title=Counterfeit Worlds: Philip K.
