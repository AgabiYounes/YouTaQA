The '''Beastie Boys''' were an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group from New York City formed in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Erlwine |first1=Stephen |title=Beastie Boys: Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/beastie-boys-mn0000038469/biography |website=AllMusic |publisher=RhythmOne Group |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was composed of [[Mike D|Michael &quot;Mike D&quot; Diamond]] (vocals, drums), [[Adam Yauch|Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch]] (vocals, bass) and [[Ad-Rock|Adam &quot;Ad-Rock&quot; Horovitz]] (vocals, guitar, programming).

The Beastie Boys were formed as a four-piece [[hardcore punk]] band, [[the Young Aborigines]], in 1978 by Mike D (vocals), MCA (bass), [[John Berry (musician)|John Berry]] (guitar) and [[Kate Schellenbach]] (drums). They appeared on the compilation cassette ''[[New York Thrash]]'', contributing two songs from their first [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Polly Wog Stew]]'', in 1982. Berry left shortly thereafter and was replaced by Horovitz. After achieving local success with the 1983 [[experimental hip hop]] single &quot;[[Cooky Puss]]&quot;, the Beastie Boys made a full transition to hip hop, and Schellenbach left the group soon after. They toured with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 1985 and a year later released their debut album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]''. It was followed by ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'', ''[[Check Your Head]]'', ''[[Ill Communication]]'', ''[[Hello Nasty]]'', ''[[To the 5 Boroughs]]'', ''[[The Mix-Up]]'', and ''[[Hot Sauce Committee Part Two]]''.

The Beastie Boys have sold 26&amp;nbsp;million records in the United States and 50&amp;nbsp;million records worldwide, making them the biggest-selling rap group since ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' began recording sales in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/489107/beastie-boys-blazed-billboard-chart-history |title=Beastie Boys Blazed Billboard Chart History |work=Billboard |date=May 4, 2012 |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204053400/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/489107/beastie-boys-blazed-billboard-chart-history |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With seven [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-selling albums from 1986 to 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Adam 'MCA' Yauch |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17959743 |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |work=BBC News |date=May 4, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508115240/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17959743 |archivedate=May 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Beastie Boys were one of the longest-lived hip hop acts worldwide. In 2012, they became the third rap group to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==History==
===1979–1983: Formation and early years===
Prior to forming the Beastie Boys, Michael Diamond was part of a number of bands such as the [[Walden School (New York City)|Walden]] Jazz Band, BAN, and [[The Young Aborigines]]. The Beastie Boys formed in July 1981 when the Young Aborigines bassist Jeremy Shatan left New York City for the summer and the remaining members Michael Diamond, [[John Berry (musician)|John Berry]] and [[Kate Schellenbach]] formed a new [[hardcore punk]] band with Adam Yauch called Beastie Boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beastiemania timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beastiemania.com/timeline/ |title=Timeline |publisher=Beastiemania.com |accessdate=June 3, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611025716/http://www.beastiemania.com/timeline/ |archivedate=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In an interview on ''The Tonight Show'' in October 2018, Mike D stated that the Beastie name is an acronym. It stands for &quot;Boys Entering Anarchistic States Towards Inner Excellence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8482716/beastie-boys-remember-adam-mca-yauch-share-origins-of-name-fallon|title=Beastie Boys Remember Adam 'MCA' Yauch, Share Origins of Their 'Stupid Name' on 'Fallon'|work=Billboard|date=1 November 2018|accessdate=27 December 2018|author=Brandle, Lars}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band supported [[Bad Brains]], the [[Dead Kennedys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollicino |first=Raul |url=http://www.beastiemania.com/gigog/show.php?g=19830706 |title=Gigography |publisher=BeastieMania.com |date=July 6, 1983 |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225185940/http://www.beastiemania.com/gigog/show.php?g=19830706 |archivedate=December 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pollicino|first=Raul|url=http://www.beastiemania.com/gigog/show.php?g=19820625|title=Gigography|publisher=BeastieMania.com|date=June 25, 1982|accessdate=December 7, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123065116/http://beastiemania.com/gigog/show.php?g=19820625|archivedate=November 23, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reagan Youth]] at venues such as [[CBGB]], A7, Trudy Hellers Place and [[Max's Kansas City]], playing at the latter venue on its closing night. In November 1982, the Beastie Boys recorded the 7&quot; [[extended play|EP]] ''[[Polly Wog Stew]]'' at 171A studios, an early recorded example of [[New York hardcore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zwickel|first1=Jonathan A.|title=Beastie Boys: A Musical Biography: A Musical Biography|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313365591|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaj7mCy0ZqgC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Polly+Wog+Stew+early+hardcore#v=onepage&amp;q=Polly%20Wog%20Stew%20early%20hardcore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hampton |first1=Chris |title=A video guide to Beastie Boys' hardcore punk years {{!}} Chart Attack |url=http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/05/20/remembering-when-the-beastie-boys-were-hardcore-punks/ |website=Chart Attack |accessdate=June 27, 2017 |date=May 20, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221005723/http://www.chartattack.com/features/2016/05/20/remembering-when-the-beastie-boys-were-hardcore-punks/ |archivedate=December 21, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hidden Gems: Beastie Boys' &quot;Aglio E Olio&quot; EP |url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2012/04/12/hidden-gems-beastie-boys-aglio-e-olio-ep/ |website=www.magnetmagazine.com |accessdate=June 27, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630023059/http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2012/04/12/hidden-gems-beastie-boys-aglio-e-olio-ep/ |archivedate=June 30, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 1982, the Beastie Boys played Philip Pucci's birthday for the purposes of his short concert film of the Beastie Boys, ''Beastie''.&lt;ref name=pucci&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philippucci.com/shorts/beastie.html |title=Philip Pucci&amp;nbsp;– Shorts&amp;nbsp;– Beastie |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426180936/http://www.philippucci.com/shorts/beastie.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012|website=www.philippucci.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pucci held the concert in [[Bard College]]'s Preston Drama Dance Department Theatre. This performance marked the Beastie Boys' first on screen appearance in a published motion picture. Pucci's concept for ''Beastie'' was to distribute a mixture of both a half dozen 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[Bell &amp; Howell]] Filmo cameras, and 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[Bolex]] cameras to audience members and ask that they capture the Beastie Boys performance from the audience's own point of view while a master sync sound camera filmed from the balcony of the abandoned theater where the performance was held.&lt;ref name=pucci/&gt; The opening band for that performance was [[The Young and the Useless]], which featured [[Ad-Rock|Adam Horovitz]] as the lead singer. A one-minute clip of ''Beastie'' was subsequently excerpted and licensed by the Beastie Boys for use in the &quot;Egg Raid on Mojo&quot; segment of the &quot;Skills to Pay the Bills&quot; long-form home video released by [[Capitol Records]]. &quot;Skills to Pay the Bills&quot; later went on to be certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Berry left the group in 1982 (later forming Thwig, Big Fat Love and Bourbon Deluxe) and was replaced by Horovitz, who had become close friends with the Beastie Boys; Schellenbach left the band in 1984 and was not replaced, with Diamond filling the role of drummer. As of that year, the Beastie Boys band made a full transition to hip hop, and was composed of three young Americans of [[Jewish]] descent: [[Michael Diamond (musician)|&quot;Mike D&quot;]], [[Adam Yauch|&quot;MCA&quot;]], and &quot;[[Ad-Rock]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;forget&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forget|first1=Thomas|title=The Beastie Boys|date=2006|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=9781404205192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwbGK6MTjQgC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Schellenbach+left+the+band+in+1984#v=onepage&amp;q=Schellenbach%20left%20the%20band%20in%201984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band also recorded and then performed its first [[hip hop music|hip hop]] track, &quot;[[Cooky Puss]]&quot;, based on a [[prank call]] by the group to a [[Carvel (restaurant)|Carvel Ice Cream]] franchise in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barshad |first1=Amos |title=Rude Boys |url=https://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ |website=NYMag.com |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |page=2 |date=April 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301015036/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/beastie-boys-2011-5/ |archivedate=March 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a part of the new lineup's first EP, also called ''Cooky Puss'', which was the first piece of work that showed their incorporation of the underground [[rap]] phenomenon and the use of samples. It quickly became a hit in New York underground dance clubs and night clubs. &quot;Beastie Revolution&quot; was later sampled for a [[British Airways]] commercial. The Beastie Boys sued them over the use of the song, earning them $40,000 in royalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Icons of Hip Hop: 1|date=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313339028|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LldOLnIQ66cC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=beastie+revolution+british+airways#v=onepage&amp;q=beastie%20revolution%20british%20airways}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984–1987: Def Jam years and ''Licensed to Ill''===
Following the success of &quot;Cooky Puss&quot;, the Beastie Boys began to incorporate rap into their sets. They hired a DJ for their live shows, [[New York University]] student [[Rick Rubin]], who began producing records soon thereafter. He formed [[Def Jam Recordings]] with fellow NYU student [[Russell Simmons]], and approached the band about producing them for his new label.

They released the 12-inch single &quot;[[Rock Hard]]&quot; in 1984, the second record released by Def Jam crediting Rubin as producer (the first was &quot;It's Yours&quot; by T La Rock and Jazzy Jay). In 1985, the band opened for [[John Lydon]]'s post-[[Sex Pistols]] band [[Public Image Ltd.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/beastie_boys/1875933653/in/set-72157600129157602/ |title=Fader magazine 2 sur Flickr : partage de photos ! |publisher=Flickr.com |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106034412/http://www.flickr.com/photos/beastie_boys/1875933653/in/set-72157600129157602/ |archivedate=November 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as supporting [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] on her North American [[The Virgin Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peters |first1=Mitchell |title=Watch Ad-Rock Discuss Beastie Boys Opening for Madonna, Refuse to Touch a Fish on 'Tonight Show' |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6516809/watch-ad-rock-discuss-beastie-boys-opening-for-madonna-jimmy-fallon-tonight-show |website=Billboard |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |date=March 28, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612141946/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6516809/watch-ad-rock-discuss-beastie-boys-opening-for-madonna-jimmy-fallon-tonight-show |archivedate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then headlining with [[Fishbone]] and [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]] with [[DJ Hurricane]] and later in the year, the group was on the ''Raising Hell'' tour with [[Run-DMC]], [[Whodini]], [[LL Cool J]], and the [[Timex Social Club]].

The band recorded ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' in 1986 and released it on November 15, 1986.

It was a tour clouded in controversy featuring female members of the crowd dancing in cages and a 20-foot tall motorized hydraulic penis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2018/10/21/the-beastie-boys-have-kept-a-giant-penis-is-storage-for-30-years/|title=The Beastie Boys have kept a giant penis in storage for 30 years|last=Phull|first=Hardeep|date=2018-10-21|website=New York Post|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson |first1=Mark |title=Beastie Boys: What Happened? {{!}} Pitchfork |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/6349-resonant-frequency-37/ |website=pitchfork.com |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128233228/http://pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/6349-resonant-frequency-37/ |archivedate=January 28, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to one used by [[The Rolling Stones]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Luling |first1=Todd Van |title=5 Things You Didn't Know About The Rolling Stones |url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/rolling-stones-trivia_us_55afe729e4b08f57d5d35c03 |website=Huffington Post |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |date=July 27, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109203033/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rolling-stones-trivia_us_55afe729e4b08f57d5d35c03 |archivedate=November 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was troubled by lawsuits and arrests, with the band accused of provoking the crowd. This culminated in their notorious gig at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool]], England, on May 30, 1987, that erupted into a riot approximately 10 minutes after the Beasties hit the stage and the arrest of Adam Horovitz by [[Merseyside Police]]. He was charged with assault causing grievous bodily harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beastie Boy Seized After Concert Melee |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/02/arts/beastie-boy-seized-after-concert-melee.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |date=June 2, 1987 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524203017/http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/02/arts/beastie-boy-seized-after-concert-melee.html |archivedate=May 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988–1989: Move to Capitol Records and ''Paul's Boutique''===
After the success of ''Licensed to Ill'', the Beastie Boys parted ways with Def Jam and signed with [[Capitol Records]]. ''[[Tougher Than Leather (film)|Tougher Than Leather]]'', a movie made by Rick Rubin as a [[star vehicle]] for [[Run-D.M.C.]] and Def Jam Recordings, with appearances by the Beastie Boys when they were still with the label, was released in 1988.

The group re-entered the studio in 1988, emerging with a more artistically mature second album, ''[[Paul's Boutique]]'', released on July 25, 1989 by [[Capitol Records]] and peaking at number 14 on the US Album Charts&lt;ref name=&quot;bb200&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Beastie Boys – Chart history – Billboard 200 |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/280828/Beastie%20Boys/chart?f=305 |website=www.billboard.com |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416222635/http://www.billboard.com/artist/280828/Beastie%20Boys/chart?f=305 |archivedate=April 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the album was viewed as a disappointment as it failed to match its predecessor (''Licensed to Ill'' was certified at 4 million copies during its run, with current sales at 10 million; ''Paul's Boutique'' was certified gold, sales of 500,00 during its run, with current sales at 2 million). The album peaked at number 24 on the US ''Billboard'' R&amp;B charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;rnbalbums&quot;/&gt; Of the album's two singles, one of them, &quot;[[Hey Ladies]]&quot;, reached the Top 40, peaking at number 36 on the US Hot 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;hot100&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Beastie Boys – Chart history – Hot 100 |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/280828/Beastie%20Boys/chart?f=379 |website=www.billboard.com |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408132935/http://www.billboard.com/artist/280828/beastie%20boys/chart?f=379 |archivedate=April 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbhotrnb&quot;/&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' would describe the album as &quot;the ''[[Pet Sounds]]''/''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' of hip hop.&quot; Produced by the [[Dust Brothers]] and Matt Dike, ''Paul's Boutique'' is an extremely [[sampling (music)|sample]]-laden opus and is considered one of the strongest works by the Beastie Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Clayton|last=Purdom|url=http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/4311/beastieboys-paulsboutique-2009|title=Beastie Boys: Paul's Boutique (20th Anniversary Edition) (Capitol; 1988)|publisher=Cokemachineglow.com|date=February 24, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009212123/http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/4311/beastieboys-paulsboutique-2009|archivedate=October 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' ranked it number 156 on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6599020/156_pauls_boutique|title=156) Paul's Boutique|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 1, 2003|accessdate=December 7, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205053912/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6599020/156_pauls_boutique|archivedate=December 5, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered a landmark in hip hop recordings due to its large array of samples and intricate use of multi-layering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/paul-s-boutique |title=Paul's Boutique: Information and Much More from Answers.com |publisher=Answers.com&lt;! |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821065752/http://www.answers.com/topic/paul-s-boutique |archivedate=August 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paul's Boutique'' has current sales of two million copies, despite the initially slow commercial reception.

===1990–1996: ''Check Your Head'' and ''Ill Communication''===
[[File:Beastie-boys.jpg|thumb|The Beastie Boys at Club Citta Kawasaki, Japan, on the ''Check Your Head'' tour (1992)]]
The follow-up album, ''[[Check Your Head]]'', was recorded in the band's own &quot;G-Son&quot; studio in [[Atwater Village, California]], and released on its [[Grand Royal]] record label.&lt;ref name=&quot;weiss&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weiss|first1=Jeff|title=Why The Beastie Boys' Check Your Head Is Still Rap-Rock's Greatest Masterpiece|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/why-the-beastie-boys-check-your-head-is-still-rap-rocks-greatest-masterpiece-8144874|website=L.A.

[[Mario Caldato, Jr.]], who had helped in the production of ''Paul's Boutique'', engineered the record and became a longtime collaborator. ''Check Your Head'' was released in 1992 and was certified double Platinum in the US and peaked at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;bb200&quot;/&gt; The single &quot;[[So What'cha Want]]&quot; reached number 93 on the ''Billboard'' 100&lt;ref name=&quot;hot100&quot;/&gt; and charted on both the Rap and [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Chart]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cyhsingles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Billboard singles |url=https://www.allmusic.com:80/album/check-your-head-mw0000279571/awards |website=allmusic |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410000937/http://www.allmusic.com/album/check-your-head-mw0000279571/awards |archivedate=April 10, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the album's first single, &quot;[[Pass the Mic]]&quot;, peaked at number 38 on the Hot Dance Music chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;cyhsingles&quot;/&gt; The album also introduced a more experimental direction, with [[funk]] and [[jazz]] inspired songs including &quot;Lighten Up&quot; and &quot;[[Something's Got to Give (song)|Something's Got to Give]]&quot;. The band returned to their hardcore punk roots for the song &quot;[[Time for Livin']]&quot;, a [[cover song|cover]] song originally by Frontline, a New York hardcore band from the early 80s.

Beastie Boys signed an eclectic roster of artists to their [[Grand Royal]] label, including Luscious Jackson, [[Sean Lennon]], and Australian artist [[Ben Lee]]. The group owned Grand Royal Records until 2001. Grand Royal's first independent release was Luscious Jackson's album ''[[In Search of Manny]]'' in 1993. Also in 1993, the band contributed the track &quot;It's the New Style&quot; (with [[DJ Hurricane]]) to the AIDS benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

The Beastie Boys also published ''Grand Royal Magazine'', with the first edition in 1993 featuring a cover story on [[Bruce Lee]], artwork by [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], and interviews with [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and [[A Tribe Called Quest]]'s MC [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]]. The 1995 issue of the magazine contained a memorable piece on the [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]]. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites this as the first published use of the term, along with the lyrics from the Beasties' 1994 song, &quot;Mullet Head&quot;. That term was not heard in the 1980s, even though that decade has retroactively been hailed as the mullet's peak in popularity. The ''OED'' says that the term was &quot;apparently coined, and certainly popularized, by US hip-hop group the Beastie Boys&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/253382|title=mullet, n.9|work=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Grand Royal Magazine'' is also responsible for giving British band [[Sneaker Pimps]] their name.

''[[Ill Communication]]'', released in 1994, saw the Beastie Boys' return to the top of the charts when the album debuted at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200&lt;ref name=&quot;bb200&quot;/&gt; and peaked at number 2 on the R&amp;B/hip hop album chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;rnbalbums&quot;/&gt; The single &quot;[[Sabotage (song)|Sabotage]]&quot; became a hit on the [[modern rock]] charts and the music video, directed by [[Spike Jonze]], received extensive play on MTV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/1267/index2.html |title=Spike Jonze Unmasked |first=Ethan |last=Smith |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |year=2012 |accessdate=August 31, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021035935/http://nymag.com/nymetro/movies/features/1267/index2.html |archivedate=October 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Get It Together (Beastie Boys song)|Get It Together]]&quot; reached Top 10 on the ''Billboard''.

Beastie Boys headlined at [[Lollapalooza]]—an American travelling music festival—in 1994, together with [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. In addition, the band performed three concerts (in Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington D.C.) to raise money for the [[Milarepa Fund]] and dedicated the [[royalties]] from &quot;[[Shambala (Beastie Boys song)|Shambala]]&quot; and &quot;Bodhisattva Vow&quot; from the ''Ill Communication'' to the cause. The Milarepa Fund aims to raise awareness of [[Tibet]]an [[human rights]] issues and the exile of the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]. In 1996, Yauch organized the largest rock benefit show since 1985's [[Live Aid]] – the [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]], a two-day festival at [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco that attracted over 100,000 attendees.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs96&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stolder |first1=Steven |title=Beastie Boys, Smashing Pumpkins Headline Tibetan Freedom Concert |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beastie-boys-smashing-pumpkins-headline-tibetan-freedom-concert-in-san-francisco-19960808 |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |work=Rolling Stone |date=August 8, 1996 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227125603/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beastie-boys-smashing-pumpkins-headline-tibetan-freedom-concert-in-san-francisco-19960808 |archivedate=February 27, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the popularity of Beastie Boys was underlined when tickets for an arena tour went on sale in the US and [[Madison Square Garden]] and Chicago's [[Allstate Arena|Rosemont Horizon]] sold out within 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beastie Boys guest program 2007 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rage/guest/2007/beastieboys2.htm |website=www.abc.net.au |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |date=March 31, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825004135/http://www.abc.net.au/rage/guest/2007/beastieboys2.htm |archivedate=August 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One dollar from each ticket sold went through Milarepa to local charities in each city on the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Darzin |first1=Dana |title=Beastie Boys Deliver a Mixed Bag in New York |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beastie-boys-deliver-a-mixed-bag-in-new-york-19950713 |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |work=Rolling Stone |date=July 13, 1995 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430015850/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beastie-boys-deliver-a-mixed-bag-in-new-york-19950713 |archivedate=April 30, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beastie Boys toured South America and Southeast Asia for the first time. The band also released ''[[Aglio e Olio (EP)|Aglio e Olio]]'', a collection of eight songs lasting just 11 minutes harking back to their punk roots, in 1995. ''[[The In Sound from Way Out! (Beastie Boys album)|The in Sound from Way Out!]]'', a collection of previously released [[jazz]]/[[funk]] instrumentals, was released on Grand Royal in 1996 with the title and artwork a homage to [[The In Sound from Way Out! (Perrey and Kingsley album)|an album]] by electronic pop music pioneers [[Perrey and Kingsley]].

In 1992, The Beastie Boys decided to sample portions of the sound recording of &quot;Choir&quot; by [[James Newton]] in various renditions of their song &quot;Pass the Mic&quot;. The band did not obtain a license from Newton to use the composition. Pursuant to their license from ECM Records, the Beastie Boys digitally sampled the opening six seconds of Newton's sound recording of &quot;Choir&quot;, and repeated this six-second sample as a background element throughout their song.&lt;ref name=BB_statement&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021202091247/http://www.grandroyal.com/talk/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=296454&amp;t=3420|url=http://www.grandroyal.com/talk/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=296454&amp;t=3420|archivedate=December 2, 2002|title=[statement re] james newton case|work=grandroyal.com|author=[[Adam Yauch|Yauch, Adam]]|date=September 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton brought suit, claiming that the Beastie Boys infringed his copyright in the underlying composition of &quot;Choir&quot;. The district court granted the Beastie Boys summary judgment.&lt;ref name=legal/&gt; The district court said that no license was required because the three-note segment of &quot;Choir&quot; lacked the requisite originality and was therefore not copyrightable. The decision was affirmed on appeal.&lt;ref name=legal/&gt;

At the 1999 ceremony in the wake of the horror stories that were coming out of [[Woodstock 99]], Adam Horovitz addressed the fact that there had been many cases of sexual assaults and rapes at the festival, suggesting the need for bands and festivals to pay much more attention to the security details at their concerts.&lt;ref name=&quot;mtvlovesmtv&quot;/&gt;

On September 28, 1999, Beastie Boys joined [[Elvis Costello]] to play &quot;Radio Radio&quot; on the 25th anniversary season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

Beastie Boys released ''[[Beastie Boys Anthology: The Sounds of Science|The Sounds of Science]]'', a two-CD anthology of their works in 1999.

In 2000, Beastie Boys had planned to co-headline the &quot;Rhyme and Reason Tour&quot; with [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Busta Rhymes]], but the tour was canceled when drummer Mike D suffered a serious injury due to a bicycle accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Beasties, Rage Tour Officially Canceled|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=115557|accessdate=June 20, 2017|work=ABC News|date=January 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official diagnosis was fifth-degree [[Separated shoulder|acromioclavicular joint dislocation]]; he needed surgery and extensive rehabilitation. By the time he recovered, Rage Against the Machine had disbanded, although they would reunite seven years later.

Under the name &quot;Country Mike&quot;, Mike D recorded an album, ''[[Country Mike's Greatest Hits]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider |first1=Martin |title='Country Mike's Greatest Hits': The Beastie Boys' secret country album |url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/country_mikes_greatest_hits_the_beastie_boys_secret_country_album |website=DangerousMinds |accessdate=June 20, 2017 |date=March 28, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404133919/http://dangerousminds.net/comments/country_mikes_greatest_hits_the_beastie_boys_secret_country_album |archivedate=April 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave it to friends and family for Christmas in 2000.

The first single from the album, &quot;[[Ch-Check It Out]]&quot;, reached number 1 in Canada and on the [[Modern Rock Tracks|US Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.

The album was the cause of some controversy with allegations that it installed [[spyware]] when inserted into the CD drive of a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greene |first=Thomas C |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/23/beastie_boy_cd_virus |title=Beastie Boys CD Virus |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=June 23, 2004 |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220090411/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/23/beastie_boy_cd_virus/ |archivedate=December 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The band denied this allegation, defending that there is no copy protection software on the albums sold in the US and UK. While there is [[Macrovision CDS-200]] copy protection software installed on European copies of the album, this is standard practice for all European releases on [[EMI Records|EMI]]/Capitol Records released in Europe, and it does not install spyware or any form of permanent software.

The band stated in mid-2006 that they were writing material for their next album and would be producing it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Daniell |first=Mark |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2006/08/01/1713379-ca.html |title=CANOE&amp;nbsp;– JAM!

===2009–2012: ''Hot Sauce Committee''===
In February 2009, Yauch revealed their forthcoming new album had taken the band's sound in a &quot;bizarre&quot; new direction, saying &quot;It's a combination of playing and sampling stuff as we're playing, and also sampling pretty obscure records.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzmaurice|first1=Larry|title=Beastie Boys Talk About &quot;Bizarre&quot; New Record|url=http://www.spin.com/2009/02/beastie-boys-talk-about-bizzare-new-record/|website=Spin|accessdate=June 20, 2017|date=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tentative title for the record was ''Tadlock's Glasses'', of which Yauch explained the inspiration behind the title:

{{quote|We had a bus driver years ago who used to drive Elvis' back up singers. His name was Tadlock and Elvis gave him a pair of glasses which he was very proud of. So for some reason that title—''Tadlock's Glasses''—has just been bouncing around.&lt;ref name=&quot;spin&quot;/&gt;}}

On May 25, 2009, it was announced during an interview on ''Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'' that the name of their new album would be ''[[Hot Sauce Committee Part Two|Hot Sauce Committee]]'' and was set for release on September 15&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2009/05/the_beastie_boy.php|title=The Beastie Boys Preview New Record, Play Old Song, on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|date=May 26, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724221216/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2009/05/the_beastie_boy.php|archivedate=July 24, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with the track listing of the album announced through their mailing list on June 23). The album included a collaboration with [[Santigold]] who co-wrote and sang with the band on the track &quot;[[Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win]]&quot;.

In June, the group appeared at [[Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival]] and performed the new single from the album titled &quot;Too Many Rappers&quot; alongside rapper [[Nas]] who appears on the track. It would be the last live performance by the Beastie Boys as a trio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popcrush.com/watch-the-beastie-boys-last-performance-with-adam-mca-yauch/ |title=Watch the Beastie Boys' Last Performance With Adam 'MCA' Yauch |publisher=popcrush.com |date=May 5, 2012 |accessdate=May 18, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710045053/http://popcrush.com/watch-the-beastie-boys-last-performance-with-adam-mca-yauch/ |archivedate=July 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group would have toured the UK later in the year in support of the new record.&lt;ref name=beastie&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7906287.stm|title=Beasties promise 'strange' record|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=February 23, 2009|date=February 23, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226160054/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7906287.stm|archivedate=February 26, 2009|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'', the Beastie Boys revealed that Part 2 was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anonymous |first=Adam |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137232-boys-will-be-boys--beastie-boys-talk-hot-sauce-committee-pt-1 |title=Boys will be boys: Beastie Boys talk Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 1 / In Depth // Drowned In Sound |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704120344/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4137232-boys-will-be-boys--beastie-boys-talk-hot-sauce-committee-pt-1 |archivedate=July 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike D also hinted it may be released via unusual means:

In late October 2010, the Beastie Boys sent out two emails regarding the status of ''Hot Sauce Committee'' Pts. 1 and 2 to their online mailing list. An email dated October 18 read: &quot;Although we regret to inform you that ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 1'' will continue to be delayed indefinitely, ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 2'' will be released on time as originally planned in spring of 2011.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/News/Beastie_Boys_Skip_Hot_Sauce_Committee_Part_1_Go_Straight_to_Part_2 |title=Beastie Boys Skip Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 1 and Go Straight to Pt. 2 |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=October 18, 2010 |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006181148/http://exclaim.ca/News/Beastie_Boys_Skip_Hot_Sauce_Committee_Part_1_Go_Straight_to_Part_2 |archivedate=October 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, a second email was sent out, reading as follows:

{{quote|In what can only be described as a bizarre coincidence, following an exhaustive re-sequence marathon, Beastie Boys have verified that their new ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 2'' will be composed of the same 16 tracks originally slated for inclusion on ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 1''. The record (part 2 that is) will be released as planned in spring 2011 on Capitol. The tracks originally recorded for ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 2'' (which now are actually back on Part 1) have now apparently been bumped to make room for the former ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 1'' material. Wait, what?

I know it's weird and confusing, but at least we can say unequivocally that ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 2'' is coming out on time, which is more than I can say about Part 1, and really is all that matters in the end.&quot; says Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch. &quot;We just kept working and working on various sequences for part 2, and after a year and half of spending days on end in the sequencing room trying out every possible combination, it finally became clear that this was the only way to make it work. Strange but true, the final sequence for ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 2'' works best with all its songs replaced by the 16 tracks we originally had lined up in pretty much the same order we had them in for ''Hot Sauce Committee Part 1''. So we've come full circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/ae/specials/culturedesk/2010/10/beastie_boys_ready_hot_sauce_p.html |first=Steve |last=Greenlee |title=Beastie Boys ready 'Hot Sauce' Part 2 |date=October 26, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028055317/http://www.boston.com/ae/specials/culturedesk/2010/10/beastie_boys_ready_hot_sauce_p.html |archivedate=October 28, 2010 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On April 22, the Beastie Boys emailed out the cryptic message ''&quot;This Sat, 10:35&amp;nbsp;am EST&amp;nbsp;– Just listen, listen, listen to the beat box&quot;''. A day later, they live streamed their album online via beatbox inside Madison Square Garden.

The band was announced as an inductee into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in December 2011.

==Sampling lawsuit==
{{See also|Legal issues surrounding music sampling}}
In 2003, Beastie Boys were involved in the landmark [[sampling (music)|sampling]] decision, ''Newton v. Diamond''. In that case, a federal judge ruled that the band was not liable for sampling [[James Newton]]'s &quot;Choir&quot; in their track, &quot;Pass the Mic&quot;. The sample used is the six-second flute stab. In short, the Beastie Boys cleared the sample but obtained only the rights to use the sound recording and not the composition rights to the song &quot;Choir&quot;. In the decision, the judge found that:

{{quote|when viewed in relation to Newton's composition as a whole, the portion is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant... Because Beastie Boys' use of the sound recording was authorized, the sole basis of Newton's infringement action is his remaining copyright interest in the 'Choir' composition. We hold today that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=legal&gt;{{cite web|title=Newton v.
