'''Bauxite''' is a [[sedimentary rock]] with a relatively high [[aluminium]] content. It is the world's main source of aluminium. Bauxite consists mostly of the aluminium [[mineral]]s [[gibbsite]] (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[boehmite]] (γ-AlO(OH)) and [[diaspore]] (α-AlO(OH)), [[Mixture|mixed]] with the two [[iron oxide]]s [[goethite]] (FeO(OH)) and [[haematite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), the aluminium [[Clay minerals|clay mineral]] [[kaolinite]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)) and small amounts of [[anatase]] (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[ilmenite]] (FeTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or FeO.TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clays.org/GLOSSARY/Clay_Glossary.htm The Clay Minerals Society Glossary for Clay Science Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416024036/http://www.clays.org/GLOSSARY/Clay_Glossary.htm |date=2016-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821 the [[French people|French]] [[Geology|geologist]] [[Pierre Berthier]] discovered bauxite near the village of [[Les Baux-de-Provence|Les Baux]] in [[Provence]], southern [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Berthier (1821) [https://books.google.com/books?id=53wkLqfF6tQC&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Analyse de l'alumine hydratée des Beaux, département des Bouches-du-Rhóne&quot;] (Analysis of hydrated alumina from Les Beaux, department of the Mouths-of-the-Rhone), ''Annales des mines'', 1st series,  '''6''' :  531-534. Notes:
*  In 1847, in the cumulative index of volume 3 of his series, ''Traité de minéralogie'', French mineralogist [[Ours-Pierre-Armand Petit-Dufrénoy|Armand Dufrénoy]] listed the hydrated alumina from Les Beaux as &quot;beauxite&quot;.  (See:  A. Dufrénoy, ''Traité de minéralogie'', volume 3 (Paris, France:  Carilian-Goeury et Vor Dalmont, 1847), [https://books.google.be/books?hl=en&amp;id=XxwOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA799#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 799.])  
*  In 1861, H. Sainte-Claire Deville credits Berthier with naming &quot;bauxite&quot;, on p. 309, &quot;Chapitre 1.  Minerais alumineux ou bauxite&quot; of:  H.

== Formation ==
[[File:Bauxite with unweathered rock core. C 021.jpg|thumb|left|Bauxite with core of unweathered rock]]
Numerous classification schemes have been proposed for bauxite but, {{As of|1982|lc=y}}, there was no consensus.&lt;ref name=&quot;BatdossyKarst1982&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Karst Bauxites | publisher=Elsevier | author=Bárdossy, G. | year=1982 | location=Amsterdam | pages=16 | isbn=978-0-444-99727-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vadász (1951) distinguished [[Laterite|lateritic]] bauxites (silicate bauxites) from [[karst]] bauxite [[ore]]s (carbonate bauxites):&lt;ref name=&quot;BatdossyKarst1982&quot;/&gt;

* The carbonate bauxites occur predominantly in [[Europe]], [[Guyana]], and [[Jamaica]] above [[carbonate rock]]s ([[limestone]] and [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]]), where they were formed by lateritic [[weathering]] and residual accumulation of intercalated [[clay]] layers – dispersed clays which were concentrated as the enclosing limestones gradually dissolved during [[chemical weathering]].
* The lateritic bauxites are found mostly in the countries of the [[tropics]].  They were formed by [[lateritization]] of various [[Silicate#Silicate rock|silicate rocks]] such as [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[basalt]], [[syenite]], and [[shale]].  In comparison with the iron-rich laterites, the formation of bauxites depends even more on intense weathering conditions in a location with very good drainage. This enables the dissolution of the [[kaolinite]] and the precipitation of the [[gibbsite]].  Zones with highest aluminium content are frequently located below a [[Iron oxide|ferruginous]] surface layer.  The [[aluminium hydroxide]] in the lateritic bauxite deposits is almost exclusively gibbsite.

In the case of Jamaica, recent analysis of the soils showed elevated levels of [[cadmium]], suggesting that the bauxite originates from recent [[Miocene]] [[Volcanic ash|ash]] deposits from episodes of significant volcanism in Central America.

In November 2010, [[Nguyen Tan Dung]], the prime minister of [[Vietnam]], announced that Vietnam's bauxite reserves might total 11,000 [[Megatonne|Mt]] (11 trillion kg); this would be the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mining-journal.com/exploration--and--development/vietnams-bauxite-reserves-may-total-11-billion-tonnes |accessdate=2010-11-28 |title=Mining Journal - Vietnam's bauxite reserves may total 11 billion tonnes |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616203641/http://www.mining-journal.com/exploration--and--development/vietnams-bauxite-reserves-may-total-11-billion-tonnes |archivedate=2011-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing==
[[File:CaboRojoDRBauxite.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Bauxite being loaded at Cabo Rojo, [[Dominican Republic]], to be shipped elsewhere for processing; 2007]]
[[File:Bauxite being digested by washing with hot Sodium Hydroxide.webm|thumb|Bauxite being digested by washing with a hot solution of sodium hydroxide at {{convert|175|C}} under pressure at National Aluminium Company, Nalconagar, India.]]
Bauxite is usually [[surface mining|strip mined]] because it is almost always found near the surface of the terrain, with little or no [[overburden]]. {{As of|2010}}, approximately 70% to 80% of the world's dry bauxite production is processed first into [[alumina]] and then into aluminium by [[electrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_gateway_pre_2011/periodictable/electrolysisrev3.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Making aluminium|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225224144/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/add_gateway_pre_2011/periodictable/electrolysisrev3.shtml|archive-date=2018-02-25|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauxite rocks are typically classified according to their intended commercial application: metallurgical, abrasive, cement, chemical, and refractory.

Usually, bauxite ore is heated in a pressure vessel along with a [[sodium hydroxide]] solution at a temperature of {{cvt|150|to|200|°C|-1|}}. At these temperatures, the [[aluminium]] is dissolved as [[sodium aluminate]] (the [[Bayer process]]). The aluminium compounds in the bauxite may be present as [[gibbsite]](Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[boehmite]](AlOOH) or [[diaspore]](AlOOH); the different forms of the aluminium component will dictate the extraction conditions. The undissolved waste, [[bauxite tailings]], after the aluminium compounds are extracted contains [[iron oxides]], [[silica]], [[calcia]], [[Titanium dioxide|titania]] and some un-reacted [[alumina]]. After separation of the residue by filtering, pure gibbsite is precipitated when the liquid is cooled, and then seeded with fine-grained aluminium hydroxide. The gibbsite is usually converted into [[aluminium oxide]], Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, by heating in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to a temperature in excess of {{cvt|1000|°C||||}}. This aluminium oxide is dissolved at a temperature of about {{cvt|960|°C||||}} in molten [[cryolite]]. Next, this molten substance can yield metallic aluminium by passing an [[electric current]] through it in the process of electrolysis, which is called the [[Hall–Héroult process]], named after its American and French discoverers.

Prior to the invention of this process, and prior to the [[Deville process]], aluminium ore was refined by heating ore along with elemental [[sodium]] or [[potassium]] in a [[vacuum]]. The method was complicated and consumed materials that were themselves expensive at that time. This made early elemental aluminium more expensive than [[gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/aluminium.htm |title=Aluminium versus aluminum | author=Michael Quinion |publisher=Worldwidewords.org |date=2006-01-23 |accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source of gallium==
Bauxite is the main source of the rare metal [[gallium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2013/1272/pdf/ofr2013-1272.pdf |title=Compilation of Gallium Resource Data for Bauxite Deposits Author: USGS |accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the processing of bauxite to [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] in the [[Bayer process]], gallium accumulates in the [[sodium hydroxide]] liquor. From this it can be extracted by a variety of methods. The most recent is the use of [[ion-exchange resin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frenzel|first=Max|last2=Ketris|first2=Marina P.|last3=Seifert|first3=Thomas|last4=Gutzmer|first4=Jens|date=March 2016|title=On the current and future availability of gallium|journal=Resources Policy|volume=47|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.resourpol.2015.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 percent of the contained gallium is extractable.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; The remainder reports to the [[red mud]] and [[aluminium hydroxide]] streams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moskalyk&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moskalyk|first=R. R.|date=2003|title=Gallium: the backbone of the electronics industry|journal=Minerals Engineering|volume=16|issue=10|pages=921–929|doi=10.1016/j.mineng.2003.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
