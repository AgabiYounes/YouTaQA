'''Bornholm''' ({{IPA-da|pɒːnˈhɒlˀm|lang}}; {{lang-non|Burgundaholmr}}) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] island in the [[Baltic Sea]], to the east of the rest of [[Denmark]], south of [[Sweden]], northeast of [[Germany]] and north of the westernmost part of [[Poland]]. Occupying an area of {{convert|588.36|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noegletal.dk Economy and Interior Ministry: Municipal Key Figures]&lt;/ref&gt; the island had a total population of 39,572 on 1 January 2019.

Among Bornholm's chief industrial activities are [[dairy farming]] and [[arts and crafts]] industries such as [[glass production]] and [[pottery]] using locally worked [[clay]]. [[Tourism]] is also important during the summer months. The island is home to a large number of Denmark's [[Nordic round churches|round churches]].

The island is known as ''solskinsøen'' (''Sunshine Island'') because of its weather and ''klippeøen'' (''Rock Island'') because of its geology, which consists of [[granite]], except along the southern coast. The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October. As a result of the climate, a local variety of the [[common fig]], known as ''Bornholm's Diamond'', can grow locally on the island.  The island's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north (unlike the rest of [[Denmark]], which is mostly gentle rolling hills) sloping down towards pine and [[deciduous]] forests (greatly affected by storms in the 1950s), farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Blecher| first = Lone Thygesen|author2=George Blecher| title = Swedish Folktales &amp; Legends| date = August 2004| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| isbn = 978-0-8166-4575-6| pages = xvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategically located in the [[Baltic Sea]], Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. Usually it had been ruled by Denmark, but also by [[Sweden]] and [[Lübeck|Lübeck, Germany]]. The ruin of [[Hammershus]], at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest [[castle#History|medieval fortress]] in [[northern Europe]], testament to the importance of its location. This island and [[Ertholmene]] is what remains in Denmark of [[Skåneland]] east of [[Øresund]], having been surrendered to Sweden in [[Treaty of Roskilde|1658]] but with Bornholm after a local revolt later regained in [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|1660]].

==Language==
{{Main|Bornholmsk dialect}}

Many inhabitants speak the [[Bornholmsk dialect]], which is officially a [[Danish language#Dialects|dialect of Danish]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Skautrup, ''Det Danske Sprogs Historie'', Gyldendal, 1968, vol. 4, p. 105ff. (Danish)&lt;/ref&gt; Bornholmsk retains three [[grammatical gender]]s, like [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and most dialects of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but unlike standard [[Danish language|Danish]]. Its [[phonology]] includes [[archaism]]s (unstressed {{IPA|[a]}} and internal {{IPA|[d̥, ɡ̊]}}, where other dialects have {{IPA|[ə]}} and {{IPA|[ð̞, ʊ / ɪ]}}) and innovations ({{IPA|[tɕ, dʝ]}} for {{IPA|[kʰ, ɡ̊]}} before and after front-tongue vowels). This makes the dialect difficult to understand for some Danish speakers. However, [[Swedish language|Swedish speakers]] often consider Bornholmian to be easier to understand than standard Danish. The [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] resembles the [[Scanian dialect]] spoken in nearby [[Scania]], the southernmost province of [[Sweden]].

Bornholm Regional Municipality is the local authority ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''kommune'') covering the entire island. It is the result of a merger of the five former (1 April 1970 until 2002) municipalities on the island ([[Allinge-Gudhjem Municipality|Allinge-Gudhjem]], [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Nexø]], [[Rønne]] and [[Aakirkeby]]) and the former [[Bornholm County]]. Bornholm Regional Municipality was also a county in its own right during its first four years from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2006. From 1 January 2007 all counties were abolished, and Bornholm became part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]] whose main responsibility is the health service. The municipality still retains its name Bornholm ''Regional'' Municipality. The island had 21 municipalities until March 1970, of which 6 were market towns and 15 parishes. In addition to supervising parish municipalities, which was the responsibility of the counties in ''all'' of Denmark, the market town municipalities of Bornholm were supervised by Bornholm County as well and not by the Interior Ministry as was the case in the rest of Denmark. The seat of the municipal council is the island's main town, Rønne. The voters decided to merge the county with the municipalities in a referendum May 29, 2001, effective from January 1, 2003. The question on the [[ballot]] was, &quot;Do you want the six municipal entities of Bornholm to be joined to form one municipal entity as of 1 January 2003?&quot; 73.9% voted in favour. The lowest percentage for the merger was in [[Nexø]] municipality (966 more people voting &quot;Yes&quot; than &quot;No&quot;), whose mayor, Annelise Molin, a Social Democrat, spoke out against the merger. It was required that each municipality had more &quot;Yes&quot; votes than &quot;No&quot; votes. Otherwise the merger would have to be abandoned altogether. The six municipal entities had 122 councillors (of which county clls were 15) and the new regional municipality would have 27 councillors from the start. They were reduced to 23 from 1 January 2018 ([[2017 Danish local elections|election November 2017]]). The merger was approved in a law by the [[Folketing]] 19 March 2002, transferring the tasks of the abolished county and old municipalities to the new ''Bornholm Regional Municipality''. The first regional mayor in the first three years from 2003 until 2005 was Thomas Thors (born 28 July 1949), a physician and member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and previously the last mayor of Rønne Municipality for five years from 1998 until 2002. Bjarne Kristiansen, who was the last mayor of [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]] 2½ years from the summer of 2000 until 2002, representing the local Borgerlisten political party, served as mayor for four years from January 1, 2006 until 2009. From January 1, 2007, Bornholm became a part of the [[Capital Region of Denmark]]. From January 1, 2010 the mayor has been Winni Grosbøll, a high school teacher and a member of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''Socialdemokratiet'') [[Politics of Denmark|political party]].

== Transport ==

Ferry services connect Rønne to [[Świnoujście]] ([[Poland]]), [[Sassnitz]] ([[Germany]]), [[Køge]], {{convert|45|km|abbr=off}} by road ({{convert|34|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=off}} as the crow flies) south of Copenhagen, [[Denmark]]; the destination to Køge replaced the nighttime route directly to and from Copenhagen (for both cargo and passengers) from 1 October 2004; and [[HSC Leonora Christina|catamaran]] services to [[Ystad]] ([[Sweden]]). [[Simrishamn]] ([[Sweden]]) has a ferry connection during the summer. There are also regular [[catamaran]] services between [[Nexø]] and the Polish ports of [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Łeba]] and [[Ustka]]. There are direct bus connections Ystad-Copenhagen, coordinated with the catamaran. There are also flights from [[Bornholm Airport]] to Copenhagen and other locations.

Because of its remote location Bornholm Regional Municipality has its own traffic company, [[BAT (transit agency)|BAT]], and is its own employment region, and also performs other tasks normally carried out by the regions in the rest of Denmark. In some respects the municipality forms a region of its own.

Bornholm Regional Municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 in the nationwide [[Municipalities of Denmark#Municipal Reform 2007|Municipal Reform of 2007]].

==Towns and villages==
The larger towns on the island are located on the coast and have harbours. There is however one exception, centrally placed [[Aakirkeby]], which was also the name of the municipality from 1970 until 2002, which did, however, include the harbor, Boderne, {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} to the south. The largest town is [[Rønne]], the seat, in the southwest. The other main towns (clockwise round the island) are [[Hasle, Bornholm|Hasle]], [[Allinge-Sandvig]], [[Gudhjem]], [[Svaneke]] and [[Nexø]]. Monday morning 22 September 2014 it was documented by ''Folkeregistret'' in the municipality that the number of people living in the municipality that day were 39,922, the lowest number in over 100 years.&lt;ref name=40k&gt;[http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE7049169/der-bor-nu-under-40000-pa-bornholm/ Der bor nu under 40.000 på Bornholm]. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 25 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''town'' of Rønne after the merger of the island's administrative entities 1 January 2003 reached a low point of 13,568 inhabitants 1 January 2014. 15,957 people in 1965 (date unknown;number not registerbased) lived in the two parishes that would become Rønne municipality from 1 April 1970.  In the table, numbers for Rønne are for the parish of Rønne, Rønne Sogn, alone. Year unknown, but between 2000 and 2005. It does not include Knudsker Sogn, which was also a part of Rønne Municipality. Other localities (with approximate populations, not updated) include [[Aarsballe]] (86), [[Arnager]] (151), [[Olsker]] (67), [[Rutsker]] (64), [[Rø]] (181), [[Stenseby]] (?) and [[Vang, Bornholm|Vang]] (92). In 2010 and 2018 10,297 and 9,111 respectively lived in rural districts, and 88 and 71 had no fixed address.

Population numbers are from 1 January. Christiansø Parish (which encompasses [[Ertholmene]]) is not a part of Bornholm Regional Municipality. It is included because [[Statistics Denmark|Danmarks Statistik]] includes it as parish number 7568. Bornholm has 21 parishes (2018). There are 2,163 parishes (November 2019) in the [[Church of Denmark]].

== History ==
[[File:Burg Hammershus 5.jpg|{{largethumb}}|right|[[Hammershus]] Ruin.]]

In Old Norse the island was known as ''Borgundarholm'', and in [[History of Danish|ancient Danish]] especially the island's name was ''Borghand'' or ''Borghund''; these names were related to [[Old Norse]] ''borg'' &quot;height&quot; and ''bjarg/berg'' &quot;mountain, rock&quot;, as it is an island that rises high from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. P. Mallory|Mallory, J.P.]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams|D.Q. Adams]]. ''[[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture]]''. London: [[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers]], 1997: p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; Other names known for the island include ''Burgendaland'' (9th century), ''Hulmo'' / ''Holmus'' (''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]''), ''Burgundehulm'' (1145), and ''Borghandæholm'' (14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Politikens Nudansk Ordborg (1993), 15th edition, entry &quot;Bornholm&quot; {{in lang|da}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Old English translation of Orosius uses the form ''Burgenda land''.&lt;ref&gt;King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version of Orosius, London, 1859, edited by J. Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Essai sur l'histoire du peuple burgonde, de Bornholm (Burgundarholm) vers la Bourgogne et les Bourguignons, 1965, by Rene Guichard, published by A. et J. Picard et Cie.&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the [[Burgundians]] are named after Bornholm; the Burgundians were [[Germanic peoples]] who moved west when the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed and occupied and named [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] in [[France]].

[[File:GudhjemMill.JPG|thumb|140px|left|Windmill in Gudhjem, Bornholm]]
Bornholm formed part of the historical [[Lands of Denmark]] when the nation united out of a series of petty [[chiefdom]]s. It was originally administratively part of the province of [[Scania]] and was administered by the [[Scanian Law]] after this was codified in the 13th century. Control over the island evolved into a long-raging dispute between the [[Archbishop of Lund|See of Lund]] and the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish crown]] culminating in several battles. The first fortress on the island was ''[[Gamleborg]]'' which was replaced by ''[[Lilleborg, Bornholm|Lilleborg]]'', built by the king in 1150. In 1149, the king accepted the transfer of three of the island's four [[Hundred (country subdivision)|herreder]] (districts) to the archbishop. In 1250, the archbishop constructed his own fortress, [[Hammershus]]. A campaign launched from it in 1259 conquered the remaining part of the island including Lilleborg. The island's status remained a matter of dispute for an additional 200 years.

Bornholm was pawned to [[Lübeck]] for 50 years starting in 1525. Its first militia, [[Bornholms Milits]], was formed in 1624.

Swedish forces conquered the island in 1645, but returned the island to Denmark in the following peace settlement. After the war in 1658, Denmark ceded the island to Sweden under the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] along with the rest of the [[Skåneland]], [[Bohuslän]] and [[Trøndelag]], and it was occupied by Swedish forces.

A revolt broke out the same year, culminating in Villum Clausen's shooting of the Swedish commander [[Johan Printzensköld]] on 8 December 1658.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; Following the revolt, a deputation of islanders presented the island as a gift to King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] on the condition that the island would never be ceded again. This status was confirmed in the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] in 1660.

[[Swedes]], notably from [[Småland]] and Scania, emigrated to the island during the 19th century, seeking work and better conditions. Most of the migrants did not remain.

Bornholm also attracted many famous artists at the beginning of the 20th century, forming a group now known as the [[Bornholm school of painters]]. In addition to [[Oluf Høst]], they include [[Karl Isaksson]] (1878–1922), from Sweden, and the Danes [[Edvard Weie]] (1879–1943), [[Olaf Rude]] (1886–1957), [[Niels Lergaard]] (1893–1982), and [[Kræsten Iversen]] (1886–1955).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitdenmark.com/en-us/bornholm/art/bornholms-culture-and-heritage &quot;Bornholm's culture and heritage&quot;], Visit Denmark. Retrieved 13 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== German occupation (1940–1945) ===
Bornholm, as a part of Denmark, was [[Denmark in World War II|captured by Germany]] on [[Timeline of World War II (1940)#April 1940|10 April 1940]], and served as a lookout post and [[listening station]] during the war, as it was a part of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. The island's perfect central position in the [[Baltic Sea]] meant that it was an important &quot;natural fortress&quot; between [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]], effectively keeping submarines and destroyers away from Nazi-occupied waters. Several concrete coastal installations were built during the war, and several coastal batteries, which had tremendous range. However, none of them were ever used, and only a single test shot was fired during the occupation. These remnants of Nazi rule have since fallen into disrepair and are mostly regarded today as historical curiosities. Many tourists visit the ruins each year, however, providing supplemental income to the tourist industry.

On 22 August 1943 a [[V-1 flying bomb]] (numbered V83, probably launched from a [[Heinkel He 111]]) crashed on Bornholm during a test – the warhead was a dummy made of concrete. This was photographed or sketched by the Danish Naval Officer-in-Charge on Bornholm, Lieutenant Commander Hasager Christiansen. This was the first sign British Intelligence saw of Germany's aspirations to develop flying bombs and rockets which were to become known as V-1 and [[V-2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mindling |first1=George |last2=Bolton |first2=Robert |title=U.S. Air Force Tactical Missiles, 1949-1969: The Pioneers |date=2011 |publisher=Lulu.com |location=Morrisville, NC, USA |pages=4 }}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}

=== Soviet occupation (1945–1946) ===
Bornholm was heavily bombarded by the [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] in May 1945, as it was a part of the Eastern Front. The German garrison commander, German Navy Captain [[List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (Ka-Km)|Gerhard von Kamptz]] (1902–1998), refused to surrender to the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], as his orders were to surrender to the Western Allies. The Germans sent several telegrams to Copenhagen requesting that at least one British soldier should be transferred to Bornholm, so that the Germans could surrender to the Western Allied forces instead of the Soviets. When von Kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders, Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]] and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more on 7–8 May 1945. The population had been forewarned of the bombardments, and the towns were evacuated, but 10 local people were killed. Soldiers were also killed and wounded. Some of them were [[Baltic states|Baltic]] allies of Germany fighting the Soviets.

During the Soviet bombing of the two main towns on 7 and 8 May, Danish radio was not allowed to broadcast the news because it was thought it would spoil the liberation festivities in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;En Ø i krig / An island at war by Børge Kure&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May Soviet troops landed on the island, and after a short fight, the German garrison (about 12,000 strong&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform/m9004261|title=Soviet Information Bureau report|date=11 May 1945|accessdate=2007-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720160020/http://eng.9may.ru/eng_inform/m9004261#|archive-date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2|title=Bornholm during World War II|accessdate=2007-09-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023108/http://www.bornholm.info/Historie/482we.aspx?langId=2 |archivedate = 28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet forces left the island on 5 April 1946.

===Cold War===
After the evacuation of their forces from Bornholm, the Soviets took the position that the stationing of foreign troops on Bornholm would be considered a declaration of war against the Soviet Union, and that Denmark should keep troops on it at all times to protect it from such foreign aggression. This policy remained in force after NATO was formed, with Denmark as a founding member. The Soviets accepted the stationing there of Danish troops, which were part of NATO but viewed as militarily inferior elements of the alliance, but they strongly objected to the presence of other NATO troops on Bornholm, US troops in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/ACFB01.pdf Vojtech Mastny, &quot;NATO in the Beholder’s Eye: Soviet Perceptions and Policies, 1949–56&quot;.

On 5 March 1953, the day of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] death, Polish pilot [[Franciszek Jarecki]] defected from the Eastern Bloc and landed a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] fighter on the island. He was later granted asylum and rewarded for providing Western intelligence with the then-newest Soviet jet fighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubentein|first1=Joshua|title=The Last Days of Stalin|date=31 May 2016|publisher=Yale University Press)|edition=Kindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sights and landmarks==
[[File:Bornholm Landsat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Landsat]] satellite photo]]

On the surface of Bornholm older geological formations can be seen better than in the rest of Denmark. ''Stubbeløkken'' – which is still operating (Danish ''i drift'') – and ''Klippeløkken'' granite quarries in Knudsker parish just east of central [[Rønne]] – and statistically a part of the town – are among the few remaining quarries of what was once many active quarries on the island. The island's varied geography and seascapes attract visitors to its many beauty spots from the [[Hammeren]] promontory in the northwest to the [[Almindingen]] forest in the centre and the [[Dueodde]] beaches in the southeast. Of special interest are the rocky sea cliffs at [[Jons Kapel]] and [[Helligdomsklipperne]], the varied topography of [[Paradisbakkerne]] and rift valleys such as [[Ekkodalen]] and [[Døndalen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bornholmnatur.dk/ &quot;Bornholms Natur&quot;], BornholmNatur.dk. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 10 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Bornholm's [[List of windmills on Bornholm|numerous windmills]] include the [[post mill]] of [[Egeby Mølle|Egeby]] and the well-kept [[Aarsdale Windmill|Dutch mill at Aarsdale]]. The lighthouse at [[Dueodde Lighthouse|Dueodde]] is Denmark's tallest, while [[Hammeren Lighthouse]] stands at a height of {{convert|85|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] and [[Rønne Lighthouse]] rises over the waterfront.&lt;ref name=Bornholm&gt;{{cite web|title=Lighthouses of Denmark: Bornholm|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/lighthouse/dnkb.htm|accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of roads that have (very) steep [[Grade (slope)|climbs]] and descents are: (inland) [[Simblegårdsvej]] in [[Klemensker]], which begins by the village inn [[Klemens Kro]], and [[Slamrebjergvej]] just outside [[Nexø]] extending northward from the main road from [[Rønne]]. Along the coast there are several steep roads, which is also the case in some parts of [[Denmark]] as a whole, for instance in and around [[Vejle Municipality|Vejle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danskebjerge.dk/artikler-stejlesteveje2.htm Danske Bjerge:Steepest Danish roads.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hammershus castle.jpg|thumb | right |Ruins of [[Hammershus]], a medieval fortress]]

The island hosts examples of 19th- and early-20th-century architecture, and about 300 wooden houses in [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]], donated by [[Sweden]] after [[World War II]], when the island was repairing damage caused by the war.
The island is home to 15 [[list of Bornholm churches|medieval churches]], four of which are [[Nordic round churches|round churches]] with unique artwork and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Haagensen, Erling and Lincoln, Henry, The Templar's secret island, London, 2006, {{ISBN|9781900624374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient site of [[Rispebjerg]] has remains of sun temples from the [[Neolithic]] and earthworks from the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Naturoplevelser/Beskrivelser/Bornholm/Rispebjerg/ &quot;Rispebjerg&quot;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023084119/http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Naturoplevelser/Beskrivelser/Bornholm/Rispebjerg# |date=23 October 2012 }}, Naturstyrelsen. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Because of the dilapidated state of their buildings, all secondary educational facilities in Rønne, including adult evening classes, are being transferred to new facilities at Campus Bornholm in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docplayer.dk/710029-Uddannelser-paa-bornholm-uden-vand-intet-liv-uden-viden-intet-samfund.html Education on Bornholm] Retrieved 8 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Campus Bornholm is a merger formed in June 2010 consisting of [[Bornholms Erhvervsskole]] (youth and adults), Bornholm High School (youth) and [[VUC Bornholm]] (adults), then occupying separate addresses. Learning institutions not part of this formalised collaboration will also be housed at Minervavej in Rønne. The building costs were over 300 million DKK (US$46.9 million (29 June 2018)). The [[A.P. Møller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney Møllers Fond til almene Formaal|A.P. Møller Foundation]] contributed a sum of 56 million DKK (US$8.76 million (29 June 2018)) to the project.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Economy==
[[Jensen-Group]], an industrial washing and folding machine company, was founded on the island and has a factory in Rønne. It is headquartered in [[Belgium]].

===Electricity supply===
Bornholm is connected to the Swedish electricity grid by a submarine 60 kV AC cable, which is among the longest AC cables in Europe. This cable is capable of delivering all the electrical energy consumed on Bornholm. However Bornholm also generates its own electricity at small thermal power plants and especially [[wind turbine]]s.

Bornholm is also home to a large internationally funded demonstration project to test the viability of novel energy market mechanisms to regulate energy networks with a high prevalence of renewables (such as wind turbines and photovoltaics). 50% of the project is EU-funded, with the remainder coming mainly from large corporations. See http://www.eu-ecogrid.net/ecogrid-eu for more.

==Climate==
Bornholm has an [[oceanic climate]] relatively similar to southern Sweden and mainland Denmark, whose summer highs and winter lows are heavily moderated by its maritime and isolated position. Even though heat is rare, the climate is sunny during summers and rainfall is generally sparse for a climate of this type. The winter (November–December) 2010 – (January–April) 2011 was exceptionally extreme with snow depth reaching at least 146 [[centimeter|cm]], 2 inches short of 5 [[foot (unit)|feet]] ([[snowdrift]]s 6 [[Metre|meters]], almost 20 feet) the highest in Northern Europe. Military assistance was needed. The [[Danish Meteorological Institute|DMI]] estimated the weight of snow to be 100 [[million]] [[ton]].  2013 was a cold year, with only June, July, and August being warm.

== Sports ==
Bornholm's geography as an island and moderate climate makes Bornholm an ideal location for sailing and other water-based sports. Bornholm has also become an internationally recognised venue for 'match racing', a sailing sport where two identical yachts are raced in one-on-one events on the water. The [[Danish Open (yachting)|Danish Open]] event was held in Bornholm in September 2010 at the port town of Rønne on the western coast of Bornholm. The five-day Danish Open is a key event in the [[World Match Racing Tour]] calendar which is one of only 3 events awarded 'special event' status by the [[International Sailing Federation]]. The Tour is the world's leading professional 'match racing' series and features a nine-event calendar which crosses three continents during the series. Points accrued during the Danish Open contribute directly to the World Match Racing Tour championship with the winner of the season finale at the Monsoon Cup in Malaysia claiming the ultimate match racing title ISAF World Match Racing Champion.

There are two small stadiums: [[Nexø Stadion]], in [[Nexø]], where [[NB Bornholm]] [[association football]] club play; and the slightly larger multi-use stadium [[Rønne Stadion Nord]] in [[Rønne]], which serves the [[Non-FIFA international football|Bornholm national football team]], multi-section club most well known for [[sport of athletics|athletics]] IK Viking, and several local football clubs. The [[DBU Bornholm]] is the local branch governing football on the island.

== Religion ==
Most inhabitants are members of the [[Lutherans|Lutheran]] [[Church of Denmark]] (''Folkekirken''). Various Christian denominations have become established on the island, most during the 19th century.
* ''[[Church of Denmark|Folkekirken]]'' (State church) (1536)
* [[Baptist church]] (1843)
* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) (1850)
* [[Methodist church]] (1895)
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1897)
* [[Roman Catholic Church]] (ca 1150-1536, 1849)

==Cultural references==
* The [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning 1987 [[Bille August]] film ''[[Pelle the Conqueror]]'', an adaptation of [[Martin Andersen Nexø]]'s four volume novel by the same name, is set and was shot on the island.
* A considerable part of the Second World War spy thriller ''[[Hornet Flight]]'' by [[Ken Follett]] takes place on Bornholm, depicting the island under German occupation.
* ''[[Megaheavy]]'' by Danish filmmaker [[Fenar Ahmad]] is set on Bornholm in the 1980s. It won the Grand Prix at the 2010 Odense Film Festival.
