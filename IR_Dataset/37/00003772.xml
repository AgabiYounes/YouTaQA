'''Bayerische Motoren Werke AG''', translated in English as '''Bavarian Motor Works''', commonly referred to as '''BMW''' ({{IPA-de|ˈbeːˈʔɛmˈveː|–|De-BMW.ogg}}), is a German multinational company which produces [[automobile]]s and [[motorcycle]]s. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.

Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] and [[Rolls-Royce Motor Cars|Rolls-Royce]], and motorcycles are marketed under the brand [[BMW Motorrad]]. In 2015, BMW was the world's [[List of manufacturers by motor vehicle production|twelfth-largest producer of motor vehicles]], with 2,279,503 vehicles produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD MOTOR VEHICLE PRODUCTION - OICA correspondents survey|url=http://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads//ranking2015.pdf|website=www.oica.net|accessdate=19 September 2017|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828220013/http://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/ranking2015.pdf|archivedate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG'' was formed in 1916. This company was renamed to ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' (BMW) in 1922. However the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name BMW was born (initially as ''Rapp Motorenwerke''). BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the ''BMW R 32'' in 1923.

BMW became an automobile manufacturer in 1928 when it purchased ''Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach'', which, at the time, built [[Austin 7|Austin Sevens]] under licence under the Dixi marque.&lt;ref name=Odin&gt;Odin, L.C. ''World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production''. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG.&lt;/ref&gt; The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]] called the ''BMW 3/15'', following BMW's acquisition of the car manufacturer Automobilwerk Eisenach. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.

Aircraft engines, motorcycles, and automobiles would be BMW's main products until World War II. During the war, against the wishes of its director [[Franz Josef Popp]] {{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2019}}, BMW concentrated on aircraft engine production using forced labor consisting primarily of prisoners from [[Nazi concentration camps| concentration camps]], with motorcycles as a side line and automobile manufacture ceased altogether. BMW's factories were heavily bombed during the war and its remaining West German facilities were banned from producing motor vehicles or aircraft after the war. Again, the company survived by making pots, pans, and bicycles. In 1948, BMW restarted motorcycle production. BMW resumed car production in Bavaria in 1952 with the ''BMW 501'' luxury saloon. The range of cars was expanded in 1955, through the production of the cheaper [[Isetta]] microcar under licence.  Slow sales of luxury cars and small profit margins from microcars meant BMW was in serious financial trouble and in 1959 the company was nearly taken over by rival Daimler-Benz. A large investment in BMW by Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt resulted in the company surviving as a separate entity. The ''BMW 700'' was successful and assisted in the company's recovery.

The 1962 introduction of the ''BMW New Class'' compact sedans was the beginning of BMW's reputation as a leading manufacturer of sport-oriented cars. Throughout the 1960s, BMW expanded its range by adding coupe and luxury sedan models. The ''BMW 5 Series'' mid-size sedan range was introduced in 1972, followed by the ''BMW 3 Series'' compact sedans in 1975, the ''BMW 6 Series'' luxury coupes in 1976 and the ''BMW 7 Series'' large luxury sedans in 1978.

The ''BMW M'' division released its first road car, a mid-engine supercar, in 1978. This was followed by the ''BMW M5'' in 1984 and the ''BMW M3'' in 1986. Also in 1986, BMW introduced its first V12 engine in the 750i luxury sedan.

The company purchased the Rover Group in 1994, however the takeover was not successful and was causing BMW large financial losses. In 2000, BMW sold off most of the Rover brands, retaining only the Mini brand. 

In 1998, BMW also acquired the rights to the Rolls Royce brand from Vickers Plc.

The 1995 ''BMW Z3'' expanded the line-up to include a mass-production two-seat roadster and the 1999 ''BMW X5'' was the company's entry into the SUV market.

The first mass-produced turbocharged petrol engine was introduced in 2006, with most engines switching over to turbocharging over the following decade. The first hybrid BMW was the 2010 ''BMW ActiveHybrid 7'', and BMW's first electric car was the ''BMW i3'' city car, which was released in 2013. After many years of establishing a reputation for sporting rear-wheel drive cars, BMW's first front-wheel drive car was the 2014 ''BMW 2 Series Active Tourer'' multi-purpose vehicle (MPV).

=== Company name ===
The name BMW is an abbreviation for ''Bayerische Motoren Werke'' ({{IPA-de|ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩ ˈvɛɐ̯kə}}). This name is grammatically incorrect (in German, compound words must not contain spaces), which is why the name's grammatically correct form ''Bayerische Motorenwerke'' ({{IPA-de|ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩vɛɐ̯kə|-|GT BMW-AG.ogg}}) has been used in several publications and advertisements in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Hans List: ''Vorwort und Einführung zum Gesamtwerk.

=== Logo ===
The circular blue and white BMW logo or [[Roundel#Corporate use|roundel]] evolved from the circular [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the [[flag of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znBnNJ1Fv08 |title=The origin of the BMW logo |accessdate=29 December 2011 |author=BMW |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202033152/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znBnNJ1Fv08 |archivedate=2 February 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BMW logo still used today was created in 1917, albeit with various minor styling changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BMW logo|url=https://bmwdrives.com/bmw-logo.php|website=www.bmwdrives.com|accessdate=20 October 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912135017/http://www.bmwdrives.com/bmw-logo.php|archivedate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the logo is often thought to be a portrayal of the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky. However, this portrayal was first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929 – twelve years after the logo was created – so this is not the origin of the logo itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/bmw-roundel-not-born-from-planes/ |title=BMW Roundel: Not Born From Planes |accessdate=29 December 2011 |author=Stephen Williams |work=The New York Times |date=7 January 2010 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110222011/http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/bmw-roundel-not-born-from-planes |archivedate=10 January 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slogan ===
The slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' was first used in North America in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Stories Behind 10 of the Most Iconic Brand Slogans|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/04/07/brand-slogan-history/|website=www.highsnobiety.com|accessdate=2 November 2017|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014947/https://www.highsnobiety.com/2015/04/07/brand-slogan-history/|archivedate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Lutz repeat his BMW marketing magic at GM?|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20090821/COPY02/308209997/can-lutz-repeat-his-bmw-marketing-magic-at-gm|website=www.autonews.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by a campaign intended to make the brand more approachable and to better appeal to women, 'Joy'. By 2012 BMW had returned to 'The Ultimate Driving Machine'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2012/05/31/bmw-still-the-ultimate-driving-machine-not-that-it-ever-wasnt/ |title=BMW Still the Ultimate Driving Machine |magazine=Forbes.com |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2013 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201121816/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2012/05/31/bmw-still-the-ultimate-driving-machine-not-that-it-ever-wasnt/ |archivedate=1 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;artof&quot;&gt;Peter Gantriis, Henry Von Wartenberg. &quot;The Art of BMW: 85 Years of Motorcycling Excellence&quot;. MotorBooks International, September 2008, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Its motorcycle brand is now known as [[BMW Motorrad]]. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the &quot;[[BMW R32|R32]]&quot; in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/vehicles/history-bmw-motorcycles-usa-5e17ca6bfcbc7a67?qo=cdpArticles|title=What is the history of BMW motorcycles in the USA?|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824225728/https://www.reference.com/vehicles/history-bmw-motorcycles-usa-5e17ca6bfcbc7a67?qo=cdpArticles|archivedate=24 August 2017|access-date=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had a &quot;[[Flat-twin engine|boxer]]&quot; twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].

The entire BMW Motorcycle production has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.

During the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached, combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|last=|first=|date=30 November 2018|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=229|title=BMW R75|last=|first=|date=9 September 2016|website=Military Factory|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&amp;nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

BMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).
Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.

BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:4 cilindros y museo BMW, Múnich, Alemania 2012-04-28, DD 02.JPG|thumb|right|upright|BMW Headquarters]]
The global [[BMW Headquarters]] in Munich represents the cylinder head of a [[inline-four engine|4-cylinder engine]]. It was designed by [[Karl Schwanzer]] and was completed in 1972. The building has become an European icon&lt;ref name=Patton2009/&gt; and was declared a protected historic building in 1999. The main tower consists of four vertical cylinders standing next to and across from each other. Each cylinder is divided horizontally in its center by a mold in the facade. Notably, these cylinders do not stand on the ground; they are suspended on a central support tower.

[[BMW Museum]] is a futuristic cauldron-shaped building, which was also designed by Karl Schwanzer and opened in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Touring the Temples of German Automaking|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/automobiles/03museums.html|website=www.nytimes.com|accessdate=21 October 2017|url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022085155/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/automobiles/03museums.html|archivedate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior has a spiral theme and the roof is a 40-metre diameter BMW logo.

[[BMW Welt]], the company's exhibition space in Munich, was designed by [[Coop Himmelb(l)au]] and opened in 2007. It includes a showroom and lifting platforms where a customer's new car is theatrically unveiled to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UPi7nca0jukC&amp;pg=PA64 |page= 64 |title= Happy Customers Everywhere: How Your Business Can Profit from the Insights of Positive Psychology |first1= Bernd |last1= Schmitt |first2= Glenn |last2= Van Zutphen |publisher= Macmillan |year= 2012 |isbn= 9781137000460 |url-status = live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180319230302/https://books.google.com/books?id=UPi7nca0jukC&amp;pg=PA64 |archivedate= 19 March 2018 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Africa ====
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmw.co.za/products/automobiles/bmw_insights/history.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070425185539/http://www.bmw.co.za/products/automobiles/bmw_insights/history.asp|url-status = dead|archive-date=25 April 2007|publisher=BMW South Africa|title=Corporate Information: History}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in [[Rosslyn, Gauteng|Rosslyn]], near [[Pretoria]]. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became ''BMW South Africa'', the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Unlike United States manufacturers, such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]], which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa.

Following the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5 Series and 7 Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3 Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to [[right hand drive]] markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in [[left-hand drive]] for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.

Three unique models that [[BMW Motorsport]] created for the South African market were the [[BMW E23|E23]] M745i (1983), which used the [[BMW M88|M88]] engine from the [[BMW M1]], the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre [[BMW M30|M30]] engine to the [[BMW E30|E30]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmwplant.co.za/Content/frame_content.jsp@content=http-3a-2f-2fhaf0gau02~5.htm |title=BMW South Africa – Plant Rosslyn |publisher=Bmwplant.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2009 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327080227/http://www.bmwplant.co.za/Content/frame_content.jsp@content=http-3a-2f-2fhaf0gau02~5.htm |archivedate=27 March 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|E30]] BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an [[Alpina]]-derived 2.7-litre engine.
