== Early life and education ==
Stroustrup was born in Aarhus, Denmark. His family was [[working class]], and he went to the local schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/draper_acceptance_speech.pdf|title=NAE Honors 2018 Draper Prize Winner|date=2 January 2020|website=stroustrup.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Aarhus University]] 1969–1975 and graduated with a [[master's degree]] in [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]]. His interests focused on microprogramming and machine architecture. He learned the fundamentals of object-oriented programming from its inventor, [[Kristen Nygaard]], who frequently visited Aarhus. 

In 1979, he received a [[PhD]] in computer science from the [[University of Cambridge]], England&lt;ref name=&quot;wong&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://electronicdesign.com/dev-tools/bjarne-stroustrup-c-creator-keeps-developing|title=Bjarne Stroustrup: C++ Creator Keeps RUNE Developing|last=Wong|first=William|date=26 November 2013|work=Electronic Design|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where he was supervised by [[David Wheeler (computer scientist)|David Wheeler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mathgene&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stroustrupphd&quot;&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Bjarne |last=Stroustrup |title=Communication and control in distributed computer systems |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1979 |id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.474113}} |url=https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/5546543?style=html |authorlink=Bjarne Stroustrup |website=jisc.ac.uk |oclc=219769715 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116001244/https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/5546543?style=html |archivedate=16 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis concerned communication in distributed computer systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.474113|title=Communication and control in distributed computer systems.|last=Stroustrup|first=Bjarne|date=2 January 2020|website=British Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Career==
In 1979, Stroustrup began his career as a member of technical staff in 1979 in the Computer Science Research Center of Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA. There, he began his work on C++ and programming techniques. Stroustrup was the head of [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T Bell Labs']] Large-scale Programming Research department, from its creation until late 2002. In 1993, he was made a Bell Lab's fellow and in 1996, an AT&amp;T Fellow.

From 2002 to 2014, Stroustrup was the College of Engineering Chair in [[Computer Science]] Professor at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bio.html|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701083013/http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bio.html|archivedate=1 July 2007|accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.tamu.edu/people/faculty|title=Faculty – People – Computer Science &amp; Engineering – College of Engineering|last=Communications|first=Texas A&amp;M Engineering|date=8 September 2015|website=Cse.tamu.edu|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011, he was made a University Distinguished Professor.

As of January 2014, Stroustrup is a Technical Fellow and Managing Director in the technology division of [[Morgan Stanley]] in New York City and a Visiting Professor in Computer Science at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.columbia.edu/people/faculty|title=Department of Computer Science, Columbia University – Faculty|website=Cs.columbia.edu|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==C++==
Stroustrup is best known for his work on C++. In 1979, he began developing C++ (initially called &quot;[[C (programming language)|C]] with Classes&quot;). In his own words, he &quot;invented C++, wrote its early definitions, and produced its first implementation [...] chose and formulated the design criteria for C++, designed all its major facilities, and was responsible for the processing of extension proposals in the C++ standards committee.&quot; C++ was made generally available in 1985. For non-commercial use, the source code of the compiler and the foundation libraries was the cost of shipping (US$75); this was before everyone had Internet access. Stroustrup also published a textbook for the language in 1985, [[The C++ Programming Language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stroustrup.com/4th.html|title=The C++ Programming Language|last=Stroustrup|first=Bjarne|date=2 January 2020|website=stroustrup.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:C++ Standards Committee meeting - March 1996 Santa Cruz - Wednesday general session.jpg|thumb|left|Stroustrup (standing on left) at the March 1996 Santa Cruz meeting of the C++ Standards Committee]]

The key language-technical areas of contribution of C++ are:

* A static type system with equal support for built-in types and user-defined types (that requires control of the construction, destruction, copying, and movement of objects; and operator overloading).
* Value and reference semantics. 
* Systematic and general resource management (RAII): constructors, destructor, and exceptions relying on them.
* Support for efficient object-oriented programming: based on the Simula model with statically checked interfaces, multiple inheritance, and efficient implementation based on virtual function tables.
* Support for flexible and efficient generic programming: templates with specialization and concepts.
* Support for compile-time programming: template metaprogramming and compile-time evaluated functions (&quot;constexpr functions&quot;).
* Direct use of machine and operating system resources .
* Concurrency support through libraries (where necessary, implemented using intrinsics).

Stroustrup documented his principles guiding the design of C++ and the evolution of the language in his 1994 book ”The Design and Evolution of C++”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stroustrup.com/dne.html|title=The Design and Evolution of C++|last=Stroustrup|first=Bjarne|date=2 January 2020|website=stroustrup.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two papers for ACM's History of Programming Languages conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl2.pdf|title=A History of C++: 1979– 1991|last=Stroustrup|first=Bjarne|date=2 January 2020|website=stroustrup.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stroustrup.com/hopl-almost-final.pdf|title=Evolving a language in and for the real world: C++ 1991–2006|last=Stroustrup|first=Bjarne|date=2 January 2020|website=stroustrup.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroustrup was a founding member of the C++ standards committee (from 1989, it was an ANSI committee and from 1991 an ISO committee) and has remained an active member ever since. For 24 years he chaired the subgroup chartered to handle proposals for language extensions (Evolution Working Group).
