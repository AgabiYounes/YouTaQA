'''Bitola''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|t|oʊ|l|ə|,_|-|t|ə|l|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-mk|Битола}} {{IPA-mk|ˈbitɔɫa||Mk-Bitola.ogg}}) is a city in the southwestern part of [[North Macedonia]]. It is located in the southern part of the [[Pelagonia]] valley, surrounded by the [[Baba (North Macedonia)|Baba]], [[Nidže]] and [[Kajmakčalan]] mountain ranges, {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} north of the [[Medžitlija-Níki]] border crossing with [[Greece]]. The city stands at an important junction connecting the south of the [[Adriatic Sea]]  region with the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Central Europe]], and is an administrative, cultural, industrial, commercial, and educational centre. It has been known since the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period as &quot;The City of The Consuls&quot;, since many European countries had consulates in Bitola.

Bitola, known during the Ottoman Empire as Manastir/Monastir, is one of the oldest cities in North Macedonia. It was founded as [[Heraclea Lyncestis]] in the middle of the 4th century BC by [[Philip II of Macedon]]. The city was the last capital of [[Ottoman Rumelia]], from 1836 to 1867. According to the 2002 census, Bitola is the [[List of municipalities in North Macedonia by population|second-largest city]] in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistical Office&quot;&gt;[http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaX.pdf Macedonian census, language and religion]&lt;/ref&gt; Bitola is also the seat of the [[Bitola Municipality]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Bitola'' is derived from the [[Old Church Slavonic]] word {{lang|cu|{{Script|Cyrs|ѡ҆би́тѣл҄ь}}}} ({{lang|cu-Latn|obitěĺь}}, meaning &quot;monastery, cloister&quot;) as the city was formerly noted for its monastery. When the meaning of the name was no longer understood, it lost its prefix &quot;o-&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Room |first=Adrian |title=Placenames of the world: origins and meanings of the names for 6,600 countries, cities, territories, natural features, and historic sites |place=Jefferson, N.C. |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. |year=2006 |edition=2nd |page=60 |isbn=0-7864-2248-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Bitola'' is mentioned in the [[Bitola inscription]], related to the old city fortress built in 1015 during the ruling of [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria]] (1014–1015) when Bitola served as capital of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Modern Slavic variants include the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] {{lang|mk-Latn|Bitola}} ({{lang|mk|Битола}}), the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] {{lang|sr-Latn|Bitolj}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|Битољ}}) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] {{lang|bg-Latn|Bitolya}} ({{lang|bg|Битоля}}). In [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times, the name was Hellenized to {{lang|grc-Latn|Voutélion}} ({{lang|grc|Βουτέλιον}}) or {{lang|grc-Latn|Vitólia}} ({{lang|grc|Βιτώλια}}), hence the names ''Butella'' used by [[William of Tyre]] and ''Butili'' by the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]]. The [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] name is {{lang|rup|Bituli}}.

The [[Greek language|Modern Greek]] name for the city ({{lang|el-Latn|Monastíri}}, {{lang|el|Μοναστήρι}}), also meaning &quot;monastery&quot;, is a [[calque]] of the Slavic name. The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name {{lang|tr|Manastır}} ({{lang-ota|مناستر}}) is derived from the Greek name, as is the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name ({{lang|sq|Manastir}}), and the [[Ladino language|Ladino]] name ({{lang|lad|מונאסטיר}} {{lang|lad-Latn|Monastir}}).

==Geography==
Bitola is located in the southwestern part of North Macedonia. The [[Dragor River]] flows through the city. Bitola lies at an elevation of 615 meters above sea level, at the foot of [[Baba (North Macedonia)|Baba Mountain]]. Its magnificent [[Pelister]] mountain (2601 m) is a national park with exquisite flora and fauna, among which is the rarest species of pine, known as [[Macedonian pine]] or [[pinus peuce]]. It is also the location of a well-known ski resort.

Covering an area of {{convert|abbr=on|1798|km2|0}}. and with a population of 122,173 (1991), Bitola is an important industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational, and cultural center. It represents an important junction that connects the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the south with the [[Aegean Sea]] and [[Central Europe]].

==Climate==
Bitola has a mild [[humid continental climate]] typical of the Pelagonija region, experiencing warm and dry summers, and cold and snowy winters. The [[Köppen climate classification]] for this climate is Cfb, which would be an [[oceanic climate]], going by the original {{convert|-3|C|F}} threshold.

==History==
[[File:Catolic church bitola.jpg|thumb|left|The Catholic Church &quot;Holy Heart of Jesus&quot;, on the main street of Bitola.]]

===Prehistory===
Bitola is very rich in archaeological sites from the prehistoric period. Two important ones are [[Veluška Tumba]], and [[Bara Tumba]] near the village of Porodin. From the [[Copper Age]] there are remains from the settlements of Tumba near the village of Crnobuki, Šuplevec near the village of Suvodol, and Visok Rid near the village of Bukri. The [[Bronze Age]] is represented by ruins from the settlement of Tumba near the village of Kanino and another settlement with the same name near the village of Karamani.

===Ancient and early Byzantine periods===
The area of the town is located in ancient [[Lynkestis]], a region of [[Upper Macedonia]], which was ruled by semi-independent chieftains until the later [[Argead dynasty|Argead]] rulers of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]]. The tribes of Lynkestis were known as ''Lynkestai''. They were a [[Greeks|Greek]] tribe and belonged to the [[Molossians|Molossian]] group of the [[Epirotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=edited by John Boardman [and] N.G.L.|title=The expansion of the Greek world, eighth to sixth centuries B.C.|year=1982|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-521-23447-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qAoqP4g1fEC&amp;pg=PA266 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière|title=Collected Studies: Further studies on various topics|year=1993|publisher=A.M.

[[Heraclea Lyncestis]] ({{lang-grc|Ἠράκλεια Λυγκηστίς}}&lt;ref&gt;[[NGL Hammond|Hammond, N. G. L.]], (1972), ''A History of Macedonia'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; - ''City of Hercules upon the Land of the Lynx'') was an important settlement from the [[Hellenistic period]] till the early [[Middle Ages]]. It was founded by [[Philip II of Macedon]] by the middle of the 4th century BC, and named after the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] hero [[Heracles]]. With its strategic location, it became a prosperous city. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered this part of Macedon in 148 BC and destroyed the political power of the city. However, its prosperity continued mainly due to the Roman [[Via Egnatia]] road which passed near the city. Several monuments from the Roman times remain in Heraclea, including a [[portico]], [[thermae]] (baths), an [[amphitheater]] and a number of [[basilica]]s. The theatre was once capable of housing an audience of around 3,000 people.

In the early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period (4th to 6th centuries AD) Heraclea was an important episcopal centre. Some of its bishops were mentioned in the acts of the Church Councils, including Bishop Evagrius of Heraclea in the Acts of the [[Archbishopric of Sardica#Council of Sardica|Sardica Council]] of 343. A small and a great (Large) basilica, the bishop's residence, and a funeral basilica near the necropolis are some of the remains of this period. Three [[nave]]s in the Great Basilica are covered with [[mosaic]]s of very rich floral and figurative [[iconography]]; these well preserved mosaics are often regarded as fine examples of the early [[Christian art]] period. During the 4th and 6th centuries, the names of other bishops from Heraclea were recorded. The city was sacked by [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] forces, commanded by [[Theodoric the Great]] in 472 and, despite a large gift to him from the city's bishop, it was sacked again in 479. It was restored in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In the late 6th century the city suffered successive attacks by [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes and was gradually abandoned.

===Middle Ages===
In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region around Bitola experienced a demographic shift as more and more Slavic tribes settled in the area. In place of the deserted theater, several houses were built during that time. The Slavs also built a fortress around their settlement. Bitola was a part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] from the middle of the 8th to the early 11th centuries. The spread of Christianity was assisted by St. [[Clement of Ohrid]] and [[Naum of Preslav]] in the 9th and early 10th centuries. Many monasteries and churches were built in the city.
[[File:Bitolski nadpis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Bitola inscription. The name of the city of Bitola is mentioned in the inscription for the first time. The inscription reveals the fortress was built as a haven for the local Bulgarians.]]
In the 10th century, Bitola was under the rule of the Bulgarian Tsar [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuil]]. He built a castle in the town, later used by his successor [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria]]. The town is mentioned in several medieval sources. [[John Skylitzes]]'s 11th-century chronicle mentions that Emperor [[Basil II]] burned Gavril's castles in Bitola, when passing through and ravaging Pelagonia. The second [[chrysobull]] (1019) of Basil II mentioned that the Bishop of Bitola depended on the [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. During the reign of Samuil, the city was the seat of the Bitola Bishopric. In many medieval sources, especially Western, the name ''Pelagonia'' was synonymous with the Bitola Bishopric. In some sources Bitola was known as Heraclea since what once was the Heraclea Bishopric later became the Pelagonian Metropolitan's Diocese. In 1015, Tsar Gavril Radomir was killed by his cousin [[Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria|Ivan Vladislav]], who then declared himself tsar and rebuilt the city's fortress. To commemorate the occasion, a [[Bitola inscription|stone inscription]] written in the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet was set in the fortress; in it the Slavic name of the city is mentioned: Bitol.

Following battles with Tsar Ivan Vladislav, the Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] recaptured Monastiri in 1015. The town is mentioned as an episcopal centre in 1019 in a record by Basil II. Two important uprisings against Byzantine rule took place in the Bitola area in 1040 and 1072. After the Bulgarian state was restored in the late 12th century, Bitola came under the rule of Tsar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]]. It was conquered again by Byzantium at the end of the 13th century, but it became part of [[Serbia]] in the first half of the 14th century, after the conquests of [[Stefan Dušan]].

As a military, political and cultural center, Bitola played a very important role in the life of the medieval society in the region, prior to the Ottoman conquest in the mid-14th century. On the eve of the Ottoman conquest, Bitola (Monastir in Ottoman Turkish) experienced great growth with its well-established trading links all over the Balkan Peninsula, especially with big economic centers like [[Constantinople]], [[Thessalonica]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] and [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]. Caravans carrying  various goods came and went from Bitola.

From 1382 to 1912, Manastır (today's Bitola) was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Fierce battles took place near the city during the Ottoman conquest. Ottoman rule was completely established after the death of [[Prince Marko]] in 1395 when the Ottoman Empire established the [[Sanjak of Ohrid]] as a part of the [[Rumelia Eyalet]] and one of the earliest established sanjaks in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Stojanovski |first=Aleksandar  |authorlink=Aleksandar Stojanovski |title=Makedonija vo turskoto srednovekovie : od krajot na XIV--početokot na XVIII vek |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ND4yAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22&amp;dq=%22%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22  |accessdate= 24 December 2011 |year= 1989 |publisher= Kultura |location= Skopje |language= Macedonian |oclc=21875410 |page= 49 |quote= Овој санџак исто така е еден од најстарите санџаци во Румелискиот беглербеглак}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1395 Bitola was part of the realm of [[Prince Marko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Stojanovski |first=Aleksandar  |authorlink=Aleksandar Stojanovski |title=Makedonija vo turskoto srednovekovie : od krajot na XIV--početokot na XVIII vek |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ND4yAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22&amp;dq=%22%D0%9E%D1%85%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B4%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%9F%D0%B0%D0%BA%22  |accessdate= 24 December 2011 |year= 1989 |publisher= Kultura |location= Skopje |language= Macedonian |oclc=21875410 |page= 49 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=  ОХРИДСКИ САНЏАК (Liva i Ohri): Овој санџак исто така е еден од најстарите санџаци во Румелискиот беглербеглак.

After the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Austro-Ottoman wars]], the trade development and the overall prosperity of the city declined. But in the late 19th century, it again became the second-largest city in the wider southern Balkan region after [[Salonica]].

In 1874, Manastır became the center of [[Monastir Vilayet]] which included the sanjaks of [[Sanjak of Dibra|Debra]], [[Servia, Greece|Serfidze]], [[Sanjak of Elbasan|Elbasan]], Manastır (Bitola), [[Korçë|Görice]] and the towns of [[Kicevo|Kırcaova]], [[Prilep|Pirlepe]], [[Florina]], [[Kastoria|Kesriye]] and [[Grevena]].

Traditionally a strong trading center, Bitola was also known as &quot;the city of the consuls&quot;. In the final period of Ottoman rule (1878-1912), Bitola had consulates from twelve countries. During the same period, there were a number of prestigious schools in the city, including a military academy that, among others, was attended by the Turkish reformer [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. In 1883, there were 19 schools in Monastir, of which 11 were Greek, 5 were Bulgarian and 3 were Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;AYE, Consulates of Macedonia, Monastir, 12th January 1883, no.44 and Thessaloniki, 8th February 1883, no.200 &quot;Analytic census of the educational condition of Monastir from the early 19th century&quot; from the book ''Educational and societal activity of the Hellenism of Macedonia'' of St. Papadopoulos, p.133-130&lt;/ref&gt; Bitola was also the headquarters of many cultural organizations at that time.

There are opposing ethnographic data from that period, but it appears that no one ethnic or religious group could claim an absolute majority of the population. According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060527053759/http://www.univ.trieste.it/~storia/corsi/Dogo/tabelle/popolaz-ottomana1911.jpg 1911 Ottoman census], [[Greeks]] were the largest Christian group in the vilayet.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} There were 740,000 Greeks, 517,000 Bulgarians and 1,061,000 Muslims in the vilayets of Selanik (Thessaloniki) and Manastır. The basis of the Ottoman censuses was the millet system. People were assigned an ethnicity according to their religion. So all Sunni Muslims were categorised as Turks, although many of them were [[Albanians]], and all members of the Greek Orthodox church as Greeks, although their numbers included a large number of [[Aromanians]] and South Albanians. The Slavs were divided between the Bulgarian majority and a small Serbian minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/9/6/6/19669/19669.txt |last=Durham M. |first=Edith |title= Twenty Years Of Balkan Tangle |publisher=Gutenberg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Serbian propaganda in Monastir was, however, then only in its infancy, and nothing but very elementary school books were to be had. The Bulgarians had a big school and church. If anyone had suggested that Monastir was Serb or ever likely to be Serb, people would have thought him mad—or drunk. The pull was between Greek and Bulgarian, there was no mention of the Serbs. There was a large &quot;Greek&quot; population, both in town and country, but of these a very large proportion were Vlachs. Many were South Albanians, others were Slavs. Few probably were genuine Greeks. But they belonged to the Greek branch of the Orthodox Church, and were categorized as Greek in the census. Those Slavs who called themselves Serbs, and the Serb schoolmasters who had come for propaganda purposes, all went to the Greek churches.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Ortayli 2006 89-8&quot;&gt;Ortaylı, İlber.

Bitola’s population itself was greatly diverse. It numbered some 50,000 at the end of the 19th century. There were around 7,000 Aromanians, most of whom fully embraced the Hellenist culture, although some preferred the Romanian culture. Bitola also had a significant Muslim population - 11,000 (Turks, Roma, and Albanians) as well as a Jewish community of 5,200. The Slavic-speakers were divided between the Bulgarian Exarchate - 8,000, and the Greek Patriarchate - 6,300.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0810862956}}, pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Manastır was connected with [[Salonika|Selanik]] by train. The first motion picture made in the Balkans was produced by the [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] [[Manakis brothers]] in Manastır in 1903. In their honour, the annual Manaki Brothers International Film Camera Festival is held in modern Bitola.

In November 1905, the [[Secret Committee for the Liberation of Albania]], a secret organization formed to fight for the liberation of [[Albania]] from the Ottoman Empire, was founded by [[Bajo Topulli]] and other Albanian nationalists and intellectuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsie2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert |last=Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA449|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=30 March 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6188-6|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the [[Congress of Manastir]] of 1908, which standardized the modern [[Albanian alphabet]], was held in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campbell2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=George L. |last=Campbell|title=Compendium of the World's Languages: Abaza to Kurdish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYvPvqO2J6wC&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=29 May 2012|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-20296-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The congress was held at the house of [[Fehim Zavalani]]. [[Mit'hat Frashëri]] was chairman of the congress. The participants in the Congress were prominent figures from the cultural and political life of Albanian-inhabited territories in the [[Balkans]], and the [[Albanian diaspora]].

===Ilinden Uprising===
[[File:Bitola.1914.jpg|thumb|Street in Bitola in 1914]]

The Bitola region was a stronghold of the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising|Ilinden Uprising]]. The uprising was conceived in 1903 in Thessaloniki by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO).&lt;ref&gt;Dimitar Bechev, Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Historical Dictionaries of Europe, Scarecrow Press, 2009, {{ISBN|0810862956}}, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising in the Bitola region was planned in [[Smilevo]] village in May 1903. Battles were fought in the villages of Bistrica, Rakovo, Buf, Skocivir, Paralovo, Brod, Novaci, Smilevo, Gjavato, Capari and others. Smilevo was defended by 600 rebels led by [[Dame Gruev]] and [[Georgi Sugarev]]. They were defeated and the villages were burned.

===Balkan Wars===
In 1912, [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]] fought the Ottomans in the [[First Balkan War]]. After a victory [[Battle of Sarantaporo|at Sarantaporo]], Greek troops advanced towards Monastir but were defeated by the Ottomans [[Battle of Sorovich|at Sorovich]]. The [[Battle of Monastir]] (16–19 November 1912) led to Serbian occupation of the city. According to the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913]], the region of Macedonia was divided into three parts among Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria. Monastir was ceded to Serbia and given the name ''Bitola''.

===World War I===
[[File:Vivat-bander - 1915-12-04 - Monastir by O. R. Bossert.jpg|thumb|70px|left|German [[Vivat ribbons|Vivat ribbon]] commemorating the Bulgarian occupation (1915).]]

During [[World War I]] Bitola was on the [[Salonica Front]]. Bulgaria, a [[Central Powers|Central Power]], took the city on 21 November 1915, while the Allied forces [[Monastir Offensive|recaptured it in 1916]]. Bitola was divided into French, Russian, Italian and Serbian sections, under the command of French general [[Maurice Sarrail]]. Until Bulgaria's surrender in late autumn 1918, Bitola remained a front line city and was bombarded almost daily by air bombardment and artillery fire and was nearly destroyed.

===Inter-war period===
At the end of World War I Bitola was restored to the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], and, consequently, in 1918 became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. Bitola became one of the major cities of the [[Vardarska banovina]].

===World War II===
During [[World War II]] (1939–45), the Germans (on 9 April 1941) and Bulgarians (on 18 April 1941) took control of the city. But in September 1944, Bulgaria switched sides in the war and withdrew from Yugoslavia. On 4 November, the 7th Macedonian Liberation Brigade entered Bitola after the German withdrawal. The [[History of the Jews in Monastir|historical Jewish community]], of Sephardic origin, lived in the city until World War II, when some were able to immigrate to the United States and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/monastir1839-1943.html|title=Last Century of a Sephardic Community - The Jews of Monastir, 1839-1943.|website=www.sephardicstudies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest were murdered by the Nazis at [[Treblinka]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/communities/monastir/during_holocaust.asp Monastir During the Holocaust] - at [[Yad Vashem]] website&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the war, [[SR Macedonia]] was established within [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. In 1945, the first Gymnasium (named &quot;[[Josip Broz Tito]]&quot;) to use the Macedonian language, was opened in Bitola.

==Main sights==
[[File:Apteka Calovski, Bitola, Manaki.jpg|thumb|The building of Calovski pharmacy, glass disk (c. 1930)]]
The city has many historical building dating from many historical periods. The most notable ones are from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman age]], but there are some from the more recent past.

===Širok Sokak===
{{Main|Širok Sokak}}
Širok Sokak ({{lang-mk|Широк Сокак}}, meaning &quot;Wide Alley&quot;) is a long [[pedestrian street]] that runs from [[Magnolia Square]] to the City Park.

===Clock Tower===
[[File:The Clock Tower in Bitola town - Republic of Macedonia.jpg|thumb|left|The clock tower in Bitola.]]

[[File:Хамам_Дебој_(Битола).jpg|thumb|Hamam Deboj-[[Turkish bath]]]]

It is unknown when Bitola's [[clock tower]] was built. Written sources from the 16th century mention a clock tower, but it is not clear if it is the same one. Some believe it was built at the same time as St. Dimitrija Church, in 1830. Legend says that the Ottoman authorities collected around 60,000 eggs from nearby villages and mixed them in the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to make the walls stronger.

The tower has a rectangular base and is about 30 meters high. Near the top is a rectangular terrace with an iron fence. On each side of the fence is an iron console construction which holds the lamps for lighting the clock. The clock is on the highest of three levels. The original clock was replaced during World War II with a working one, given by the Nazis because the city had maintained German graves from World War I.
The massive tower is composed of walls, massive spiral stairs, wooden mezzanine constructions, [[pendentive]]s and the dome. During the construction of the tower, the façade was simultaneously decorated with simple stone plastic.

===Church of Saint Demetrius===
The Church of [[Saint Demetrius]] was built in 1830 with voluntary contributions of local merchants and craftsmen. It is plain on the outside, as all churches in the [[Ottoman Empire]] had to be, but lavishly decorated with [[chandelier]]s, a carved bishop throne and an engraved [[iconostasis]] on the inside. According to some theories, the iconostasis is a work of the [[Mijaks|Mijak]] engravers. Its most impressive feature is the arc above the imperial quarters with modeled figures of [[Jesus]] and the apostles.

Other engraved wood items include the bishop's throne made in the spirit of Mijak engravers, several [[icon frames]] and five more-recent pillars shaped like thrones. The frescoes originate from two periods: the end of the 19th century, and the end of [[World War I]] to the present. The icons and frescoes were created thanks to voluntary contributions of local businessmen and citizens. The authors of many of the icons had a vast knowledge of iconography schemes of the [[New Testament]]. The icons show a great sense of color, dominated by red, green and ochra shades. The abundance of golden ornaments is noticeable and points to the presence of [[late-Byzantine]] artwork and [[baroque style]]. The icon of Saint Demetrius is signed with the initials &quot;D. A. Z.&quot;, showing that it was made by iconographer Dimitar Andonov the [[zograph]] in 1889. There are many other items, including the [[chalice]]s made by local masters, a darohranilka of Russian origin, and several paintings of scenes from the New Testament, brought from Jerusalem by pilgrims.

The opening scenes of the film ''[[The Peacemaker (1997 film)|The Peacemaker]]'' were shot in the &quot;St. Dimitrija&quot; church in Bitola, as well as some ''[[Welcome to Sarajevo]]'' scenes.

===Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart===
{{main|Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, Bitola}}

===Heraclea Lyncestis===
[[Heraclea Lyncestis]] ({{lang-mk|Хераклеа Линкестис}}) was an important ancient settlement from the [[Hellenistic period]] till the early Middle Ages. It was founded by [[Philip II of Macedon]] by the middle of the 4th century BC. Today, its ruins are in the southern part of Bitola, {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} from the city center.

===The covered bazaar===
[[File:Bitola.1914 01.jpg|left|thumb|The Monastir bazaar in 1914]]

Situated near the city centre, the covered [[bazaar]] ({{lang-mk|Bezisten, Безистен}}) is one of the most impressive and oldest buildings in Bitola from the Ottoman period. With its numerous cupolas that look like a fortress, with its tree-branch-like inner streets and four large metal doors it is one of the biggest covered markets in the region.

It was built in the 15th century by [[Kara Daut Pasha Uzuncarsili]], then [[Rumelia Eyalet|Rumelia]]'s [[Beylerbey]]. Although the bazaar appears secure, it has been robbed and set on fire, but has managed to survive. The Bezisten, from the 15th to the 19th centuries, was rebuilt, and many stores, often changing over time, were located there. Most of them were selling textile and other luxurious fabrics. At the same time the Bezisten was a treasury, where in specially made small rooms the money from the whole Rumelian Vilaet was kept, before it was transferred into the royal treasury. In the 19th century the Bezisten held a total of 84 shops. Today most of them are contemporary and they sell different types of products, but despite the internal renovations, the outwards appearance of the structure has remained unchanged.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque===
The [[Gazi Hajdar Kadi Mosque]] is one of the most attractive monuments of Islamic architecture in Bitola. It was built in the early 1560s, as the project of the architect [[Mimar Sinan]], ordered by the Bitola kadija Ajdar-kadi. Over time, it was abandoned and heavily damaged, and at one point used as a stare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The settlements with muslim population in Macedonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMCWdjCBjQYC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2005|publisher=Logos-A|isbn=978-9989-58-155-7|pages=206–}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent restoration and conservation has restored to some extent its original appearance.

===Jeni Mosque===
[[File:2011 Bitola, Meczet Jeni 01.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jeni Mosque]]]]
The [[Jeni Mosque]] is located in the center of the city. It has a square base, topped with a dome. Near the mosque is a minaret, 40 m high. Today, the mosque's rooms house permanent and temporary art exhibitions. Recent archaeological excavations have revealed that it has been built upon an old church.

===Ishak Çelebi Mosque===
The [[Ishak Çelebi Mosque]] is the inheritance of the kadi [[Ishak Çelebi]]. In its spacious yard are several tombs, attractive because of the soft, molded shapes of the sarcophagi.

===Kodža Kadi Mosque===
===The old bazaar===
The old [[bazaar]] ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: ''Стара Чаршија'') is mentioned in a description of the city from the 16th and the 17th centuries. The present [[bezisten]] does not differ much in appearance from the original one. The bezisten had eighty-six shops and four large iron gates. The shops used to sell textiles, and today sell food products.

===Deboj Bath===
The Deboj Bath is a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] bath ([[Turkish bath|hamam]]). It is not known when exactly it was constructed. At one point, it was heavily damaged, but after repairs it regained its original appearance: a façade with two large domes and several minor ones.
