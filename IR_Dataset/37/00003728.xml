}}}}'''Bass music''' (or '''UK bass''') is [[club music]] that emerged in the [[United Kingdom]] during the mid-2000s under the influence of diverse genres such as [[dubstep]], [[UK garage]], [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[purple sound|wonky]], [[house music|house]], and [[Grime (music genre)|grime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryce|first1=Andrew|title=Bass / House|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/1539|website=[[Resident Advisor]]|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase &quot;bass music&quot; came into use as artists began ambiguously blending the sounds of these defined genres while maintaining an emphasis on percussive, [[bass (music)|bass]]-led [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sound&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=timi|title=The Best UK Bass Music of 2012 (so far)|url=http://salacioussound.com/2012/07/the-best-uk-bass-music-of-2012-so-far/|website=Salacious Sound|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bass music is sometimes confused with [[Bassline (music genre)|bassline]] or [[post-dubstep]].&lt;ref name=P&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/features/grime-dubstep/7965-grime-dubstep |title=Grime / Dubstep |last=Clark |first=Martin |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=4 May 2011|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardiansam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Sam|title=The UK leads the way|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/uk-leads-the-way|website=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Origins==
The breadth of styles that have come to be associated with the term preclude it from being a specific musical genre. ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' writer Martin Clark has suggested that &quot;well-meaning attempts to loosely define the ground we're covering here are somewhat futile and almost certainly flawed. This is not one genre. However, given the links, interaction, and free-flowing ideas&amp;nbsp;... you can't dismiss all these acts as unrelated.&quot;&lt;ref name=P /&gt; [[Dubstep]] producer [[Skream]] is quoted in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'' in September 2011 as saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The word dubstep is being used by a lot of people and there were a lot of people being tagged with the dubstep brush. They don't want to be tagged with it and shouldn't be tagged with it – that's not what they're pushing... When I say 'UK bass', it's what everyone UK is associated with so it would be a lot easier if it was called that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skream: &quot;I want to make sure once this fad dies out, I'm still standing&quot; |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/09/13/skream-%E2%80%98i-want-to-make-sure-once-this-fad-dies-out-i%E2%80%99m-still-standing%E2%80%99/ |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2012-01-04 |location=London |first=Sam |last=Moir |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226221922/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2011/09/13/skream-%E2%80%98i-want-to-make-sure-once-this-fad-dies-out-i%E2%80%99m-still-standing%E2%80%99/ |archivedate=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], bass music, or UK bass has had major mainstream success since the late 2000s and early 2010s, with artists such as [[James Blake (musician)|James Blake]],&lt;ref name=P/&gt; [[Benga (musician)|Benga]], [[Example (musician)|Example]], [[Burial (musician)|Burial]], [[Sophie Xeon]], [[Zomby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22322-ultra/|title=Zomby: Ultra Album Review – Pitchfork|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chase &amp; Status]], [[Skream]], [[TNGHT]], Ash Bowles and [[Wretch 32]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/30/example-uk-bass|title=Example: 'I have a formula now'|first=Rob|last=Fitzpatrick|date=30 June 2011|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;post-dubstep&quot; has been used synonymously to refer to artists, such as Blake, [[Mount Kimbie]] and Fantastic Mr. Fox whose work drew on UK garage, 2-step, and other forms of underground dance music, as well as [[ambient music]] and early [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]].&lt;ref name=&quot;S&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2011/03/listen-10-post-dubstep-artists-who-matter/ |title=10 Post-Dubstep Artists Who Matter |last=Aaron |first=Charles |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailygamecock.com/mix/item/1538-sbtrkt-adds-to-post-dubstep-genre |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716210144/http://www.dailygamecock.com/mix/item/1538-sbtrkt-adds-to-post-dubstep-genre |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 July 2011 |title=SBTRKT adds to post-dubstep genre |last=Moore |first=Thad |work=[[The Daily Gamecock]] |date=12 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2011/05/bubblin-blawan-takes-post-dubste |title=Blawan takes post-dubstep and UK house out of its comfort zone |last=Guidry |first=Jake |work=[[XLR8R]] |date=19 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902065804/http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2011/05/bubblin-blawan-takes-post-dubste |archivedate=2 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/16/new-band-fantastic-mr-fox |title=Fantastic Mr Fox (No 910) |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/a-profile-of-james-blake-post-dubstep-artist/11912.html |title=A profile of James Blake – post-dubstep artist |work=[[BBC News]] |date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of nightclubs, bass music has mainly been promoted and played on [[internet radio]] stations such as [[Sub.FM]] and [[Rinse FM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thethingis.co.uk/2008/04/05/the-rise-of-online-radio |title=The Rise of Online Radio |last=Tidey |first=Jimmy |date=5 April 2008 |access-date=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719113614/http://thethingis.co.uk/2008/04/05/the-rise-of-online-radio/ |archive-date=19 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Martin|title=Grime / Dubstep|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/grime-dubstep/7901-grime-dubstep/|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
