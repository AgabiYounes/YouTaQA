Brandenburg is located in the northeast of Germany covering an area of {{convert|29478|km2}} and has a population of 2.5 million residents, the fifth-largest German state by area and tenth-most populous. [[Potsdam]] is the state capital and largest city, while other major cities include [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], [[Cottbus]], and [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. Brandenburg surrounds the national capital and city-state of [[Berlin]], which together form the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region]], the third-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Germany. Brandenburg borders the states of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Saxony]], and the country of [[Poland]].

Brandenburg originated in the [[Northern March]] in the 900s AD from areas conquered from the [[Wends]], and later became the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], a major principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with [[Albert the Bear]] as [[prince-elector]]. In the 15th century Brandenburg came under the rule of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], who later also became the rulers of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], who established [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] to become the core of the later [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Brandenburg became the [[Province of Brandenburg]] in 1815, a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] within the kingdom and later within the [[Free State of Prussia]]. Brandenburg was established as a state in 1945 after [[World War II]] by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet army administration]] in [[Allied-occupied Germany]], and became part of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] in 1947. Brandenburg was dissolved in 1952 during [[Administrative divisions of East Germany|administrative reforms]] and its territory divided into the districts of [[Bezirk Potsdam|Potsdam]], [[Bezirk Cottbus|Cottbus]], [[Bezirk Frankfurt|Frankfurt]], [[Bezirk Neubrandenburg|Neubrandenburg]], and [[Bezirk Schwerin|Schwerin]], but was re-established in 1990 following [[German reunification]], and became one of the Federal Republic of Germany's [[New states of Germany|new states]].

==History==
{{History of Brandenburg and Prussia}}
{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}

In late medieval and early modern times, Brandenburg was one of seven [[prince-elector|electoral states]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and, along with [[Prussia]], formed the original core of the [[German Empire]], the first unified German state. Governed by the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]] from 1415, it contained the future German capital Berlin. After 1618 the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] and the [[Duchy of Prussia]] were combined to form [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], which was ruled by the same branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. In 1701 the state was elevated as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Franconian [[Nuremberg]] and [[Ansbach]], Swabian [[Burg Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], the eastern European connections of Berlin, and the status of Brandenburg's ruler as [[prince-elector]] together were instrumental in the rise of that state.

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main|Northern March}}
Brandenburg is situated in territory known in antiquity as [[Magna Germania]], which reached to the Vistula river. By the 7th century, [[Slavic peoples]] are believed to have settled in the Brandenburg area. The Slavs expanded from the east, possibly driven from their homelands in present-day Ukraine and perhaps Belarus by the invasions of the [[Huns]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. They relied heavily on river transport. The two principal Slavic groups in the present-day area of Brandenburg were the [[Hevelli]] in the west and the [[Sprevane]] in the east.

Beginning in the early 10th century, [[Henry the Fowler]] and his successors conquered territory up to the [[Oder River]]. Slavic settlements such as Brenna&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barford|first=Paul M.|title=The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|year=2001|pages=421|isbn=0-8014-3977-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Brandenburg an der Havel]]), Budusin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Institut für Sorbische Volksforschung in Bautzen|title=Lětopis Instituta za serbski ludospyt|publisher=Domowina|location=Bautzen|year=1962|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Bautzen]]), and Chośebuz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Placenames of the World|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson|year=2006|pages=433|isbn=0-7864-2248-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Cottbus]]) came under [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] control through the installation of margraves. Their main function was to defend and protect the eastern [[marches]]. In 948 Emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] established margraves to exert imperial control over the pagan Slavs west of the Oder River. Otto founded the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[Bishopric of Havelberg|Havelberg]]. The [[Northern March]] was founded as a northeastern border territory of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. However, a great uprising of [[Wends]] drove imperial forces from the territory of present-day Brandenburg in 983. The region returned to the control of Slavic leaders.

===Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|Margraviate of Brandenburg}}

During the 12th century, the German kings and emperors re-established control over the mixed Slav-inhabited lands of present-day Brandenburg, although some Slavs like the [[Sorbs]] in [[Lusatia]] adapted to [[Germanization]] while retaining their distinctiveness. The Roman Catholic Church brought [[bishoprics]] which, with their walled towns, afforded protection from attacks for the townspeople. With the monks and bishops, the history of the town of [[Brandenburg (town)|Brandenburg an der Havel]], which was the first center of the state of Brandenburg, began.

[[File:Burg eisenhardt torhaus und burgfried.JPG|thumb|left|Eisenhardt Castle in [[Bad Belzig]]]]

In 1134, in the wake of a German [[Northern Crusade|crusade]] against the [[Wends]], the German magnate, [[Albert the Bear]], was granted the [[Northern March]] by the Emperor [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar III]]. He formally inherited the town of Brandenburg and the lands of the Hevelli from their last Wendish ruler, [[Pribislav of Brandenburg|Pribislav]], in 1150. After crushing a force of Sprevane who occupied the town of Brandenburg in the 1150s, Albert proclaimed himself ruler of the new [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. Albert, and his descendants the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], then made considerable progress in conquering, colonizing, Christianizing, and cultivating lands as far east as the Oder. Within this region, Slavic and German residents intermarried. During the 13th century, the Ascanians began acquiring territory east of the Oder, later known as the [[Neumark]] (see also [[Altmark]]).

In 1320, the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end, and from 1323 up until 1415 Brandenburg was under the control of the [[Wittelsbach]]s of [[Bavaria]], followed by the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] Dynasties. Under the Luxembourgs, the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] gained the status of a [[prince-elector]] of the Holy Roman Empire. In the period 1373-1415, Brandenburg was a part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]]. In 1415, the Electorate of Brandenburg was granted by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] to the [[House of Hohenzollern]], which would rule until the end of World War I. The Hohenzollerns established their capital in Berlin, by then the economic center of Brandenburg.

===16th and 17th centuries===
{{Main|Brandenburg-Prussia}}
[[File:Schlacht bei Fehrbellin2.JPG|thumb|Brandenburg's victory over Swedish forces at the [[Battle of Fehrbellin]] in 1675]]
Brandenburg converted to Protestantism in 1539 in the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation]], and generally did quite well in the 16th century, with the expansion of trade along the [[Elbe]], [[Havel]], and [[Spree]] Rivers. The Hohenzollerns expanded their territory by co-rulership since 1577 and acquiring the [[Duchy of Prussia]] in 1618, the [[Duchy of Cleves]] (1614) in the [[Rhineland]], and territories in [[Westphalia]]. The result was a sprawling, disconnected country known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] that was in poor shape to defend itself during the [[Thirty Years' War]].

Beginning near the end of that devastating conflict, however, Brandenburg enjoyed a string of talented rulers who expanded their territory and power in Europe. The first of these was [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], the so-called &quot;Great Elector&quot;, who worked tirelessly to rebuild and consolidate the nation. He moved the royal residence to [[Potsdam]]. At the [[Treaty of Westphalia]], his envoy [[Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal]] negotiated the acquisition of several important territories such as [[Halberstadt]]. Under the [[Treaty of Oliva]] Christoph Caspar [[von Blumenthal]](son of the above) negotiated the incorporation of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] into the Hohenzollern inheritance.

===Kingdom of Prussia and German Empire===
{{Main|Kingdom of Prussia|Province of Brandenburg}}
[[File:Potsdam Sanssouci Palace.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sanssouci|Sanssouci Palace]] in Potsdam, the former summer palace of [[Frederick the Great]], is today a [[World Heritage site]].]]
[[File:Brandenburg superimposed on modern borders.svg|thumb|200px|The [[Province of Brandenburg]], as superimposed on modern borders]]
When Frederick William died in 1688, he was followed by his son [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick]], third of that name in Brandenburg. As the lands that had been acquired in Prussia were outside the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick assumed (as Frederick I) the title of &quot;[[King in Prussia]]&quot; (1701). Although his self-promotion from margrave to king relied on his title to the Duchy of Prussia, Brandenburg was still the most important portion of the kingdom. However, this combined state is known as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

Brandenburg remained the core of the Kingdom of Prussia, and it was the site of the kingdom's capitals, Berlin and Potsdam. When Prussia was subdivided into provinces in 1815, the territory of the Margraviate of Brandenburg became the [[Province of Brandenburg]], again subdivided into the [[Regierungsbezirk Frankfurt|government regions of Frankfurt]] and [[Potsdam]]. In 1881, the City of Berlin was separated from the Province of Brandenburg. However, industrial towns ringing Berlin lay within Brandenburg, and the growth of the region's industrial economy brought an increase in the population of the province. The Province of Brandenburg had an area of {{convert|39039|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and a population of 2.6 million (1925). After Germany's defeat in World War II, the [[Neumark]], the part of Brandenburg east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]], became part of [[Poland]]. The remainder of the province became a state in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany]].

===East Germany ===
[[File:Glienicke Bridge GB23840.jpg|thumb|[[Glienicke Bridge]], which connected East Germany to the American sector of West Berlin, became known for the exchange of captured spies.]]
After the foundation of [[East Germany]] in 1949, Brandenburg formed one of its component states. The State of Brandenburg was completely dissolved in 1952 by the [[Council of Ministers of the GDR|Socialist government of East Germany]], doing away with all component states. The East German government then divided Brandenburg among several ''Bezirke'' or districts. (See [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic]]). Most of Brandenburg lay within the [[Cottbus (Bezirk)|Bezirke of Cottbus]], [[Frankfurt (Bezirk)|Frankfurt]], or [[Potsdam (Bezirk)|Potsdam]], but parts of the former province passed to the [[Schwerin (Bezirk)|Schwerin]], [[Neubrandenburg (Bezirk)|Neubrandenburg]] and [[Magdeburg (Bezirk)|Magdeburg districts]] (town [[Havelberg]]). East Germany relied heavily on [[lignite]] (the lowest grade of coal) as an energy source, and lignite strip mines marred areas of south-eastern Brandenburg. The industrial towns surrounding Berlin were important to the East German economy, while rural Brandenburg remained mainly agricultural.

===Federal Republic of Germany===
[[File:LandtagSchuschkeSeptember2012.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of Potsdam's historic center, 2012]]
The present State of Brandenburg was re-established on 3 October 1990 upon [[German reunification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/ddr/ddr90-laeeinf.htm|title=Ländereinführungsgesetz (1990)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly elected Landtag of Brandenburg first met on 26 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brandenburg-geburtstag.de/aktuell/historischer-kalender/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411062741/http://www.brandenburg-geburtstag.de/aktuell/historischer-kalender/ |archivedate=11 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other former parts of East Germany, the lack of modern infrastructure and exposure to West Germany's competitive market economy brought widespread unemployment and economic difficulty. In the recent years, however, Brandenburg's infrastructure has been modernized and unemployment has slowly declined.

In 1995, the governments of Berlin and Brandenburg proposed to merge the states in order to form a new state with the name of &quot;Berlin-Brandenburg&quot;, though some suggested calling the proposed new state &quot;Prussia&quot;. The merger was rejected in a [[plebiscite]] in 1996 – while West Berliners voted for a merger, East Berliners and Brandenburgers voted against it.

==Geography==
{{See also|Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|List of places in Brandenburg}}
Brandenburg is bordered by [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] in the north, [[Poland]] in the east, the [[Free State of Saxony|Freistaat Sachsen]] in the south, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the west, and [[Lower Saxony]] in the northwest.

The [[Oder River]] forms a part of the eastern border, the [[Elbe|Elbe River]] a portion of the western border. The main rivers in the state itself are the [[Spree]] and the [[Havel]]. In the southeast, there is a wetlands region called the [[Spreewald]]; it is the northernmost part of [[Lusatia]], where the [[Sorbs]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] people, still live. These areas are bilingual, i.e., German and [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]] are both used.

===Protected areas===
Brandenburg is known for its well-preserved natural environment and its ambitious natural protection policies which began in the 1990s. 15 large protected areas were designated following [[German reunification|Germany's reunification]]. Each of them is provided with state-financed administration and a park ranger staff, who guide visitors and work to ensure nature conservation. Most protected areas have visitor centers.
