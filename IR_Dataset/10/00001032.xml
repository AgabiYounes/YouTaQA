&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
An '''abscess''' is a collection of [[pus]] that has built up within the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] of the body.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; Signs and symptoms of abscesses include redness, pain, warmth, and swelling.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; The swelling may feel fluid-filled when pressed.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; The area of redness often extends beyond the swelling.&lt;ref name=El2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Elston|first=Dirk M.|title=Infectious Diseases of the Skin.|date=2009|publisher=Manson Pub.|location=London|isbn=9781840765144|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esPkuOxZajYC&amp;pg=PA12|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906120647/https://books.google.com/books?id=esPkuOxZajYC&amp;pg=PA12|archivedate=2017-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbuncle]]s and [[boil]]s are types of abscess that often involve [[hair follicle]]s, with carbuncles being larger.&lt;ref name=Rosen2014Chp120&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=John A.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Abszess.jpg|thumb|An abscess]]
Abscesses may occur in any kind of tissue but most frequently on skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules ([[boil]]s) or deep skin abscesses), in the [[Lung abscess|lungs]], [[brain abscess|brain]], [[Dental abscess|teeth]], kidneys, and tonsils.  Major complications are spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues, and extensive regional tissue death ([[gangrene]]).

The main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are [[erythema|redness]], heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function. There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS_abscess&quot;/&gt; If superficial, abscesses may be fluctuant when [[palpation|palpated]]; this wave-like motion is caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Churchill Livingstone medical dictionary.|year=2008|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh|isbn=9780080982458|edition=16th}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An internal abscess is more difficult to identify, but signs include pain in the affected area, a high temperature, and generally feeling unwell.
Internal abscesses rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated if such an abscess is suspected. An abscess can potentially be fatal depending on where it is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2015 E-Book: 5 Books in 1|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323084307|page=20|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=icTsAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Josef E.|last2=Bland|first2=Kirby I.|last3=Callery|first3=Mark P.|title=Mastery of Surgery|date=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781771658|page=1033|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=PgUFJg_-f4YC&amp;pg=PA1033|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Risk factors for abscess formation include [[intravenous drug use]].&lt;ref name=Kha2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khalil|first=PN|author2=Huber-Wagner, S |author3=Altheim, S |author4=Bürklein, D |author5=Siebeck, M |author6=Hallfeldt, K |author7=Mutschler, W |author8= Kanz, GG |title=Diagnostic and treatment options for skin and soft tissue abscesses in injecting drug users with consideration of the natural history and concomitant risk factors.|journal=European Journal of Medical Research|date=Sep 22, 2008|volume=13|issue=9|pages=415–24|pmid=18948233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible risk factor is a prior history of disc herniation or other spinal abnormality,&lt;ref name=Kraeutler2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraeutler|first=MJ|author2=Bozzay, JD|author3=Walker, MP|author4=John, K|title=Spinal subdural abscess following epidural steroid injection.|journal=J Neurosurg Spine|date=Oct 24, 2014|pmid=25343407|doi=10.3171/2014.9.SPINE14159|volume=22|issue=1|pages=90–3|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this has not been proven.

Abscesses are caused by [[bacterial infection]], parasites, or foreign substances.
Bacterial infection is the most common cause.&lt;ref name=Cox2007/&gt; Often many different types of bacteria are involved in a single infection.&lt;ref name=El2009/&gt; In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is ''[[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; Among spinal subdural abscesses, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism involved.&lt;ref name=Kraeutler2014/&gt;

Rarely [[parasites]] can cause abscesses and this is more common in the developing world.&lt;ref name=Rosen2014Chp137/&gt; Specific parasites known to do this include [[dracunculiasis]] and [[myiasis]].&lt;ref name=Rosen2014Chp137/&gt;

===Perianal abscess===
{{see also|Anorectal abscess}}
Surgery of the [[anal fistula]] to drain an abscess treats the fistula and reduces likelihood of its recurrence and the need for repeated surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalikNelson2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malik|first1=Ali Irqam|last2=Nelson|first2=Richard L|last3=Tou|first3=Samson|last4=Malik|first4=Ali Irqam|title=Incision and drainage of perianal abscess with or without treatment of anal fistula|year=2010|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006827.pub2|journal=Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that [[fecal incontinence]] is a consequence of this surgery for abscess drainage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalikNelson2010&quot;/&gt;

[[Perianal abscess]]es can be seen in patients with for example [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (such as [[Crohn's disease]]) or [[diabetes]].  Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].

{{Anchor|Incisional abscess}}

===Incisional abscess===
An ''incisional abscess'' is one that develops as a complication secondary to a [[surgical incision]]. It presents as redness and warmth at the margins of the incision with purulent drainage from it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duff2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duff|first1=Patrick|title=Diagnosis and Management of Postoperative Infection|journal=The Global Library of Women's Medicine|year=2009|issn=1756-2228|doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10032|url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Diagnosis%20and%20Management%20of%20Postoperative%20Infection/item/32|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714154331/http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Diagnosis%20and%20Management%20of%20Postoperative%20Infection/item/32|archivedate=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the diagnosis is uncertain, the wound should be aspirated with a needle, with aspiration of pus confirming the diagnosis and availing for [[Gram stain]] and [[bacterial culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duff2009&quot;/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
An abscess is a [[immune system|defensive reaction]] of the tissue to prevent the spread of infectious materials to other parts of the body.

The organisms or foreign materials kill the local [[cell (biology)|cells]], resulting in the release of [[cytokine]]s.  The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional blood flow.

The final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.

An abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by pyogenic membrane.&lt;ref&gt;Robins/8th/68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ultrasound]] imaging in the emergency department can help in diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbic|first1=D|last2=Chenkin|first2=J|last3=Cho|first3=DD|last4=Jelic|first4=T|last5=Scheuermeyer|first5=FX|title=In patients presenting to the emergency department with skin and soft tissue infections what is the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of abscess compared to the current standard of care?

===Classification===
Abscesses may be classified as either ''skin abscesses'' or ''internal abscesses''. Skin abscesses are common; internal abscesses tend to be harder to diagnose, and more serious.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS_abscess&quot;&gt;United Kingdom National Health Service [http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abscess/Pages/Introduction.aspx 'Abscess'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030070952/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Abscess/Pages/Introduction.aspx |date=2014-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Skin abscesses are also called cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medline_abscess&quot;&gt;Medline Plus [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001353.htm 'Abscess'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407011259/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001353.htm |date=2016-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IV drug use===
For those with a history of intravenous drug use, an [[X-ray]] is recommended before treatment to verify that no needle fragments are present.&lt;ref name=Kha2008/&gt; In this population if there is also a fever present [[infectious endocarditis]] should be considered.&lt;ref name=Kha2008/&gt;

===Differential===
Abscesses should be differentiated from [[empyema]]s, which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting rather than a newly formed anatomical cavity.

Other conditions that can cause similar symptoms include: [[cellulitis]], a [[sebaceous cyst]] and [[necrotising fasciitis]].&lt;ref name=Rosen2014Chp137/&gt; Cellulitis typically also has an erythematous reaction, but does not confer any purulent drainage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duff2009&quot;/&gt;

==Treatment==
The standard treatment for an uncomplicated skin or soft tissue abscess is opening and draining.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACEPfive&quot;/&gt; There does not appear to be any benefit from also using [[antibiotic]]s in most cases.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; A small amount of evidence did not find benefit from packing the abscess with gauze.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt;

===Incision and drainage===
{{See also|Incision and drainage}}
[[Image:Cleaned abscess day 5.jpg|thumb|right|Abscess five days after incision and drainage]]
[[File:HumeralAbscess.jpg|thumb|Abscess following [[curettage]]]]
The abscess should be inspected to identify if foreign objects are a cause, which may require their removal. If foreign objects are not the cause, incising and draining the abscess is standard treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACEPfive&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Surgery: Facts and Figures |last=Green |first=James |author2=Saj Wajed |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 1-900151-96-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort.  The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.

=== Antibiotics ===
Most people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACEPfive&quot;/&gt; Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt;

In those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACEPfive&quot;/&gt; If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.

[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACEPfive&quot;/&gt; Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACEPfive&quot;/&gt;

===Packing===
In North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews. Less may be more for MRSA: the latest on antibiotics, the utility of packing an abscess, and decolonization strategies.|journal=Journal of Drugs in Dermatology|date=Jan 2014|volume=13|issue=1|pages=89–92|pmid=24385125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loop drainage===
More recently, several North American hospitals have opted for less-invasive loop drainage over standard drainage and wound packing. In one study of 143 pediatric outcomes, a failure rate of 1.4% was reported in the loop group versus 10.5% in the packing group (P&lt;.030),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ladde JG, Baker S, Rodgers CN, Papa L |title=The LOOP technique: a novel incision and drainage technique in the treatment of skin abscesses in a pediatric ED |journal=The American Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=271–76 |year=2015 |pmid=25435407 |doi=10.1016/j.ajem.2014.10.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while a separate study reported a 5.5% failure rate among loop patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsoraides SS, Pearl RH, Stanfill AB, Wallace LJ, Vegunta RK |title=Incision and loop drainage: a minimally invasive technique for subcutaneous abscess management in children |journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=606–09 |year=2010 |pmid=20223328 |doi=10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2009.06.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary closure===
Closing an abscess immediately after draining it appears to speed healing without increasing the risk of recurrence.&lt;ref name=Singer2011/&gt; This may not apply to anorectal abscesses. While they heal faster, there may be a higher rate of recurrence than those left open.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6397949&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kronborg O, Olsen H |title=Incision and drainage v. incision, curettage and suture under antibiotic cover in anorectal abscess. A randomized study with 4-year follow-up |journal=Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica |volume=150 |issue=8 |pages=689–92 |year=1984 |pmid=6397949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Even without treatment, skin abscesses rarely result in death, as they will naturally break through the skin.&lt;ref name=Rosen2014Chp137/&gt; Other types of abscess are more dangerous. Brain abscesses are fatal if untreated. When treated, the mortality rate reduces to 5-10%, but is higher when the abscess ruptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bokhari|first=Maria R.|title=Brain Abscess|date=2019|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441841/|work=StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=28722871|access-date=2019-07-28|last2=Mesfin|first2=Fassil B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Epidemiology==
Skin abscesses are common and have become more common in recent years.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt; Risk factors include [[intravenous drug use]], with rates reported as high as 65% among users.&lt;ref name=Langrod2007/&gt; In 2005 in the United States 3.2 million people went to the emergency department for an abscess.&lt;ref name=Taira2009/&gt; In Australia around 13,000 people were hospitalized in 2008 for the disease.&lt;ref name=Vas2012/&gt;

==Society and culture==
The [[Latin]] medical [[aphorism]] &quot;''[[ubi pus, ibi evacua]]''&quot; expresses &quot;where there is pus, there evacuate it&quot; and is classical advice in the culture of Western medicine.

[[Needle exchange programmes]] often administer or provide referrals for abscess treatment to [[injection drug users]] as part of a [[harm reduction]] public health strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tomolillo|first=CM|author2=Crothers, LJ|author3=Aberson, CL|title=The damage done: a study of injection drug use, injection related abscesses and needle exchange regulation.|journal=Substance Use &amp; Misuse|date=2007|volume=42|issue=10|pages=1603–11|pmid=17918030|doi=10.1080/10826080701204763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fink|first=DS|author2=Lindsay, SP |author3=Slymen, DJ |author4=Kral, AH |author5= Bluthenthal, RN |title=Abscess and self-treatment among injection drug users at four California syringe exchanges and their surrounding communities.|journal=Substance Use &amp; Misuse|date=May 2013|volume=48|issue=7|pages=523–31|pmid=23581506 |doi=10.3109/10826084.2013.787094|pmc=4334130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
An abscess is so called because there is an ''abscessus'' (a going away or departure) of portions of the animal tissue from each other to make room for the suppurated matter lodged between them.&lt;ref&gt;Collier's New Encyclopedia, 'Abscess'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word carbuncle is believed to have originated from the Latin: ''carbunculus'', originally a small coal; diminutive of ''carbon-'', ''carbo'': charcoal or ember, but also a [[carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncle stone]], &quot;precious stones of a red or fiery colour&quot;, usually [[garnet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], &quot;Carbuncle&quot;: 1 stone, 3 medical&lt;/ref&gt;
