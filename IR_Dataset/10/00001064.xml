The '''almond''' (''Prunus dulcis'', [[Synonym (taxonomy)#Botany|syn.]] ''Prunus amygdalus'') is a species of tree native to [[Iran]] and surrounding countries&lt;ref name=&quot;BĀDĀM – Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/badam-almond|title=BĀDĀM – Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=iranicaonline.org|access-date=2019-05-25|quote=The Amygdalus communis (or Prunus amygdalus), though undoubtedly native to the Iranian land-mass, is seldom found in natural stands there today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt; but widely cultivated elsewhere. The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated [[seed]] of this tree. Within the genus ''[[Prunus]]'', it is classified with the [[peach]] in the subgenus ''Amygdalus'', distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell ([[Fruit anatomy#Endocarp|endocarp]]) surrounding the seed.

The fruit of the almond is a [[drupe]], consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a [[nut (fruit)|true nut]], inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. [[Blanching (cooking)|Blanched]] almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the [[seed]]coat, which is then removed to reveal the white [[embryo]].

== Description ==

=== Tree ===
The almond is a [[deciduous]] tree, growing {{convert|4|-|10|m|0|abbr=on}} in height, with a trunk of up to {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. The young [[twig]]s are green at first, becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The [[leaf|leaves]] are {{convert|3|-|5|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} long,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, L.H.; Bailey, E.Z.; the staff of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium. 1976. ''Hortus third: A concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada''. Macmillan, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; with a serrated margin and a {{convert|2.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The [[flower]]s are white to pale pink, {{convert|3|-|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs and appearing before the leaves in early spring.&lt;ref name=rushforth&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushforth |first=Keith |title=Collins wildlife trust guide trees: a photographic guide to the trees of Britain and Europe |publisher=Harper Collins |location=London |year=1999 |isbn=0-00-220013-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;{{cite book |last=Griffiths |first=Mark D. |author2=Anthony Julian Huxley |title=The New Royal Horticultural Society dictionary of gardening |publisher=Macmillan Press |location=London |year=1992 |isbn=0-333-47494-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almond grows best in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The optimal temperature for their growth is between {{convert|15|and|30|C|F}} and the tree buds have a chilling requirement of 300 to 600 hours below {{convert|7.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to break dormancy.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Almonds begin bearing an economic crop in the third year after planting. Trees reach full bearing five to six years after planting. The fruit matures in the autumn, 7–8 months after flowering.&lt;ref name=rhs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coststudies.ucdavis.edu/files/almondvs08sprink.pdf |title=University of California Sample Cost Study to Produce Almonds |accessdate=17 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326084336/http://coststudies.ucdavis.edu/files/almondvs08sprink.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drupe ===
[[File:Almonds from Le petit jardin (3).jpg|thumb|Almonds arranged on a plate]]
The almond fruit is {{cvt|3.5|-|6|cm|in|frac=8}} long. In botanical terms, it is not a [[nut (fruit)|nut]] but a [[drupe]]. The outer covering or [[exocarp]], fleshy in other members of ''Prunus'' such as the [[plum]] and [[cherry]], is instead a thick, leathery, grey-green coat (with a downy exterior), called the hull. Inside the hull is a reticulated, hard, woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) called the [[endocarp]]. Inside the shell is the edible seed, commonly called a nut. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally two occur. After the fruit matures, the hull splits and separates from the shell, and an [[abscission layer]] forms between the stem and the fruit so that the fruit can fall from the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Doll |date=22 June 2009 |title=The Seasonal Patterns of Almond Production |url=https://thealmonddoctor.com/2009/06/22/the-seasonal-patterns-of-almond-production/ |website=The Almond Doctor |publisher=University of California Cooperative Extension |access-date=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and history ==
[[File:Baburnama illustration.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Persian miniature]] depiction of the almond harvest at [[Konibodom|Qand-i Badam]], [[Fergana Valley]] (16th century)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhawani |url=http://warfare.atspace.eu/Moghul/Baburnama/Harvesting_of_the_almond_crop_at_Qand-i_Badam.htm |title=Harvesting of the almond crop at Qand-i Badam |date=1590s |work=Baburnama}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The almond is native to [[Iran]] and surrounding countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;BĀDĀM – Encyclopaedia Iranica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rieger&gt;[https://archive.is/20141030160630/http://www.uga.edu/fruit/almond-prunus-dulcis/ Introduction to Fruit Crops (Published Online)], Mark Rieger, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the Mediterranean into northern Africa and southern Europe, and more recently transported to other parts of the world, notably California, United States.&lt;ref name=Rieger/&gt; The wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name=zohary&gt;{{cite book |last=Zohary |first=Daniel |author2=Maria Hopf |title=Domestication of plants in the old world: the origin and spread of cultivated plants in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |page=186 |isbn=0-19-850356-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selection of the sweet type from the many bitter types in the wild marked the beginning of almond domestication.&lt;ref name=ladizinsky99&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the origin of almond|author=G. Ladizinsky|journal=Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution|volume= 46|year=1999|pages= 143–147|doi=10.1023/A:1008690409554|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear as to which wild ancestor of the almond created the domesticated species. The species ''[[Prunus fenzliana]]'' may be the most likely wild ancestor of the almond, in part because it is native of Armenia and western Azerbaijan, where it was apparently domesticated. Wild almond species were grown by early farmers, &quot;at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps, and later intentionally in their orchards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |authorlink=Jared Diamond |title=Guns, germs, and steel: the fates of human societies |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1997 |page=118 |isbn=0-393-03891-2|title-link=Guns, Germs, and Steel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almonds were one of the earliest domesticated [[fruit trees]], due to &quot;the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed. Thus, in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings, it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of [[grafting]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=zohary/&gt; Domesticated almonds appear in the [[Early Bronze Age]] (3000–2000 BC), such as the archaeological sites of [[Numeira]] (Jordan),&lt;ref name=ladizinsky99/&gt; or possibly earlier. Another well-known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in [[Tutankhamun]]'s tomb in Egypt (c. 1325 BC), probably imported from the Levant.&lt;ref name=zohary/&gt; Of the European countries that the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds, Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://193.62.154.38/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Prunus&amp;SPECIES_XREF=dulcis&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK= |title=''Flora Europaea'' Search Results |accessdate=17 July 2008 |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the northernmost, though the domesticated form can be found as far north as Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pfaf/cgi-bin/arr_html?Prunus+dulcis |title=''Prunus dulcis'' |accessdate=17 July 2008 |publisher=[[Plants for a Future]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819002033/http://www.ibiblio.org/pfaf/cgi-bin/arr_html?Prunus+dulcis |archivedate=19 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology and names ===

The word &quot;almond&quot; comes from Old French ''almande'' or ''alemande'', [[Late Latin]] *''amandula'', derived through a form ''amygdala'' from the Greek ἀμυγδάλη (''amygdálē'') (cf. [[amygdala]]), an almond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Almond |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/almond |dictionary=Dictionary.com |accessdate=16 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427091114/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/almond |archivedate=27 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''al-'' in English, for the ''a-'' used in other languages may be due a confusion with the [[Arabic]] article ''al'', the word having first dropped the ''a-'' as in the Italian form ''mandorla''; the British pronunciation ''ah-mond'' and the modern [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''ametlla'' and modern French ''amande'' show a form of the word closer to the original. Other related names of almond include ''Mandel'' or ''Knackmandel'' (German), ''mandorlo'' (Italian for the tree), ''mandorla'' (Italian for the fruit), ''amêndoa'' (Portuguese), and ''almendra'' (Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gernot-katzers-spice-pages.com/engl/Prun_dul.html |title= Almond (Prunus dulcis [Mill.] D.

The adjective &quot;amygdaloid&quot; (literally &quot;like an almond&quot;) is used to describe objects which are roughly almond-shaped, particularly a shape which is part way between a [[triangle]] and an [[ellipse]]. See, for example, the [[neuroanatomy|brain structure]] [[amygdala]], which uses a direct borrowing of the Greek term ''amygdalē''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Amygdaloid Complex: Anatomy and Physiology |vauthors=Sah P, Faber ES, Lopez De Armentia M, Power J |doi=10.1152/physrev.00002.2003 |journal=Physiological Reviews |date=1 July 2003 |volume=83 |pages=803–834 |issue=3 |pmid=12843409 |df=dmy-all|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6d2eb952ea00c016029f1d41c16080c17cc886e6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
{{worldview|section|date=January 2020}}
=== Pollination ===
The [[pollination]] of California's almonds is the largest annual [[Pollination management|managed pollination]] event in the world, with 1.4 million hives (nearly half of all [[beehive (beekeeping)|beehives]] in the US) being trucked in February to the almond groves.&lt;ref name=bloom/&gt; Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory [[beekeeper]]s from at least 49 states for the event. This business has been heavily affected by [[colony collapse disorder]], causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of [[insect pollination]]. To partially protect almond growers from the rising cost of insect pollination, researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] (ARS) have developed a new line of [[self-pollinating]] almond trees.&lt;ref name=ARS&gt;{{cite web |author=Alfredo Flores |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100406.htm |title=ARS Scientists Develop Self-pollinating Almond Trees |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017050714/http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100406.htm |archive-date=17 October 2010 |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[Agricultural Research Service]] |date=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-pollinating almond trees, such as the 'Tuono', have been around for a while, but their harvest is not as desirable as the insect-pollinated California 'Nonpareil' almond tree. The 'Nonpareil' tree produces large, smooth almonds and offers 60–65% edible kernel per nut. The Tuono has thicker, hairier shells and offers only 32% of edible kernel per nut, but having a thick shell has advantages. The Tuono's shell protects the nut from threatening pests such as the [[Amyelois transitella|navel orangeworm]]. ARS researchers have managed to crossbreed the pest-resistant Tuono tree with the 'Nonpareil, resulting in [[hybrid (biology)|hybridized]] cultivars of almond trees that are self-pollinated and maintain a high nut quality.&lt;ref name=ARS/&gt; The new, self-pollinating hybrids possess quality skin color, flavor, and oil content, and reduce almond growers' dependency on insect pollination.&lt;ref name=ARS/&gt;

=== Amygdalin and cyanide ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Hydrogen cyanide]] --&gt;

The bitter almond is slightly broader and shorter than the sweet almond and contains about 50% of the fixed oil that occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme [[emulsin]] which, in the presence of water, acts on the two [[Solubility|soluble]] [[glucoside]]s [[amygdalin]] and [[prunasin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sánchez-Pérez R, Belmonte FS, Borch J, Dicenta F, Møller BL, Jørgensen K |title=Prunasin hydrolases during fruit development in sweet and bitter almonds |journal=Plant Physiology |volume=158 |issue=4 |pages=1916–32 |date=April 2012  |pmid=22353576 |pmc=3320195 |doi=10.1104/pp.111.192021}}&lt;/ref&gt; yielding [[glucose]], [[cyanide]] and the [[essential oil]] of bitter almonds, which is nearly pure [[benzaldehyde]], the chemical causing the bitter flavor.

Extract of bitter almond was once used medicinally but even in small doses, effects are severe or lethal, especially in children; the cyanide must be removed before consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;isrn&quot;/&gt; The acute oral lethal dose of cyanide for adult humans is reported to be {{cvt|0.5|–|3.5|mg/kg|mg/lb|1}} of body weight (approximately 50 bitter almonds), whereas for children, consuming 5–10 bitter almonds may be fatal.&lt;ref name=&quot;isrn&quot;/&gt;

All commercially grown almonds sold as food in the United States are sweet cultivars. The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] reported in 2010 that some fractions of imported sweet almonds were contaminated with bitter almonds. Eating such almonds could result in [[vertigo]] and other typical bitter almond (cyanide) poisoning effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Toomey VM, Nickum EA, Flurer CL |title=Cyanide and amygdalin as indicators of the presence of bitter almonds in imported raw almonds |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1313–7 |date=September 2012  |pmid=22564183 |doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2012.02138.x|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes. Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, sliced (flaked, slivered), and as flour. Almond pieces around 2–3&amp;nbsp;mm in size, called &quot;nibs&quot;, are used for special purposes such as decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mdwm7jI9J10C&amp;pg=PT45|title=Dictionary of Food: International Food and Cooking Terms from A to Z|last=Sinclair|first=Charles|date=2009-01-01|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=9781408102183|location=|pages=45|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almonds yield almond oil and can also be made into [[almond butter]] or [[almond milk]]. These products can be used in both sweet and savoury dishes.

Along with other nuts, almonds can be sprinkled over breakfasts and desserts, particularly [[muesli]] or ice cream-based dishes. Almonds are used in [[marzipan]], [[nougat]], many pastries (including ''[[Jésuite]]s''), cookies (including [[macaron|'' macarons'']], French macaroons), and cakes (including [[Financier (pastry)|financiers]]), ''[[noghl]]'', and other sweets and desserts. They are also used to make [[almond butter]], a spread similar to [[peanut butter]], popular with [[peanut allergy]] sufferers and for its naturally sweeter taste. The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (green almonds) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.

[[Almond cookie]]s, Chinese [[almond biscuit]]s, and Italian ''[[ricciarelli]]'' are made with almonds.

*In Greece, ground blanched almonds are used as the base material in a great variety of desserts, usually called ''amygdalota'' (αμυγδαλωτά). Because of their white color, most are traditionally considered wedding sweets and are served at wedding banquets. In addition, a soft drink known as ''[[soumada]]'' is made from almonds in various regions.
*In [[Hejaz]], a region of [[Saudi Arabia]], ground almonds are used by adding them with cold milk to a hot coffee cup in addition to cinnamon powder and corn starch to make Almond Coffee ''Gahwat Al-lōz'' (قهوة اللوز).
*In Iran, green almonds are dipped in [[sea salt]] and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called ''chaqale bâdam''. Also sweet almonds are used to prepare a special food for babies, named ''harire badam''. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year ([[Nowruz]]) parties.
*In Italy, bitter almonds are the traditional base for ''[[Amaretti di Saronno|amaretti]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Amaretto Macaroon|title=Fine Italian Pastries &amp; Biscotti|url=http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|accessdate=10 April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512173724/http://www.olivetreetrading.com/product-vicenzi.html|archivedate=12 May 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vicenzi Amaretto s'Italia (Macaroona)|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7K5PQ|accessdate=10 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713181311/http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H7K5PQ|archivedate=13 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of bitter almonds (10–20%) is added to the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, [[apricot kernel]]s are used as a substitute for bitter almonds). Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in ''[[torrone]]''. In [[Sicily]] ''pasta di mandorle'' (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, [[pistachio]], or chocolate. Also in Sicily, [[almond milk]] is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.
*In Morocco, almonds in the form of sweet [[almond paste]] are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other [[List of Moroccan dishes#Desserts|desserts]]. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet ''[[tajine]]s'' such as lamb with prunes. A drink made from almonds mixed with milk is served in important ceremonies such as weddings and can also be ordered in some cafes. Southwestern Berber regions of [[Essaouira]] and Souss are also known for ''amlou'', a spread made of almond paste, [[argan oil]], and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make ''sellou'' (also called ''zamita'' in [[Meknes]] or ''slilou'' in [[Marrakech]]), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.
*In [[Indian cuisine]], almonds are the base ingredients of ''[[pasanda]]''-style and [[Mughlai]] [[curry|curries]]. ''Badam halva'' is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as ''sohan barfi''), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or ''sherbet-e-badaam'', is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.
*In Israel almonds are topping [[tahini cookie]] or eaten as a snack.

The 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds and is marketed by name.&lt;ref name=Gradziel&gt;{{cite book |author=Gradziel, T.M. |year=2011 |title=Horticultural Reviews, Volume 38 |chapter=Origin and Dissemination of Almonds |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |editor=J.

Certain natural food stores sell &quot;bitter almonds&quot; or &quot;apricot kernels&quot; labeled as such, requiring significant caution by consumers for how to prepare and eat these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Cyanogenic_Glycosides-Toxin_Which.pdf |title=Cyanogenic glycosides – Information Sheet |publisher=New Zealand Food Safety Authority |date=2006 |accessdate=4 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319012137/http://www.foodsafety.govt.nz/elibrary/industry/Cyanogenic_Glycosides-Toxin_Which.pdf |archivedate=19 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Almond milk ===
{{main|Almond milk}}

Almonds can be processed into a [[milk substitute]] called [[almond milk]]; the nut's soft texture, mild flavor, and light coloring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice for [[Lactose intolerance|lactose intolerant]] people and [[Veganism|vegans]]. Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds work well for different production techniques, some of which are similar to that of [[soymilk]] and some of which use no heat, resulting in &quot;raw milk&quot; (see [[raw foodism]]).

=== Almond flour and skins ===

[[Almond flour]] or ground [[almond meal]] combined with sugar or honey as [[marzipan]] is often used as a [[gluten-free]] alternative to wheat flour in cooking and baking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Amsterdam |first=Elana |title=The Gluten-Free Almond Flour Cookbook: Breakfasts, Entrees, and More |publisher=Random House of Canada |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-58761-345-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almonds contain polyphenols in their [[seed coat|skins]] consisting of [[flavonol]]s, [[flavan-3-ol]]s, [[hydroxybenzoic acid]]s and [[flavanone]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;skins&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2009.08.015 |title=Characterization of polyphenols, lipids and dietary fibre from almond skins (Amygdalus communis L.)|year=2010 |last1=Mandalari |first1=G. |last2=Tomaino |first2=A. |last3=Arcoraci |first3=T. |last4=Martorana |first4=M. |last5=Turco |first5=V.

=== Almond syrup ===
Historically, almond syrup was an [[emulsion]] of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with [[barley syrup]] ([[orgeat syrup]]) or in a syrup of [[orange flower water]] and sugar, often flavored with a synthetic aroma of almonds.&lt;ref name=&quot;isrn&quot;/&gt; Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the [[Mai Tai]] and many other [[Tiki bar|Tiki drinks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=In honor of orgeat |url=https://www.alcoholprofessor.com/blog-posts/blog/2017/10/18/in-honor-of-orgeat |website=alcoholprofessor.com |accessdate=11 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Upgrade your orgeat |url=https://nationalpost.com/life/food/cocktails-upgrade-your-orgeat-and-youll-find-not-all-tiki-drinks-%EF%AC%81t-under-the-same-umbrella |website=nationalpost.com |accessdate=11 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tiki cocktail history basics |url=https://drinks.seriouseats.com/2014/03/tiki-cocktail-history-basics-of-tiki-drinks-essential-ingredients.html |website=drinks.seriouseats.com |accessdate=11 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[cyanide]] found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of [[hydrocyanic acid]], so are generally considered safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;isrn&quot;/&gt;

Almonds are 4% water, 22% [[carbohydrate]]s, 21% [[protein]], and 50% [[fat]] (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, almonds supply 579 [[calorie]]s. The almond is a nutritionally dense food (table), providing a rich source (20% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of the [[B vitamin]]s [[riboflavin]] and [[niacin]], [[vitamin E]], and the [[essential mineral]]s [[calcium]], [[copper]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[manganese]], [[phosphorus]], and [[zinc]]. Almonds are a moderate source (10–19% DV) of the B vitamins [[thiamine]], [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[folate]], choline, and the essential mineral [[potassium]]. They also contain substantial [[dietary fiber]], the [[monounsaturated fat]], [[oleic acid]], and the [[polyunsaturated fat]], [[linoleic acid]]. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds are a source of [[phytosterol]]s such as [[beta-sitosterol]], [[stigmasterol]], [[campesterol]], [[sitostanol]], and [[campestanol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berryman2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Berryman CE, Preston AG, Karmally W, Deckelbaum RJ, Kris-Etherton PM |title=Effects of almond consumption on the reduction of LDL-cholesterol: a discussion of potential mechanisms and future research directions |journal=Nutrition Reviews |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=171–85 |date=April 2011  |pmid=21457263 |doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2011.00383.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential allergy===

Almonds may cause [[food allergy|allergy]] or [[food intolerance|intolerance]]. Cross-reactivity is common with [[peach]] [[allergen]]s ([[lipid transfer proteins]]) and tree [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] allergens. Symptoms range from local signs and symptoms (e.g., [[oral allergy syndrome]], [[contact urticaria]]) to systemic signs and symptoms including [[anaphylaxis]] (e.g., [[urticaria]], [[angioedema]], gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food-info.net/uk/intol/almond.htm |title=Almond allergy |publisher=Food-info.net |date=26 July 2001 |accessdate=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almonds are a rich source of oil, with 50% of kernel dry mass as fat (whole almond nutrition table). In relation to total dry mass of the kernel, almond oil contains 32% [[monounsaturated]] [[oleic acid]] (an [[omega-9 fatty acid]]), 13% [[linoleic acid]] (a [[polyunsaturated]] [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] [[essential fatty acid]]), and 10% [[saturated fatty acid]] (mainly as [[palmitic acid]], USDA link in table). [[Linolenic acid]], a polyunsaturated [[omega-3]] fat, is not present (table). Almond oil is a rich source of [[vitamin E]], providing 261% of the Daily Value per 100 ml (table).

When almond oil is analyzed separately and expressed per 100 grams as a reference mass, the oil provides 884 [[calorie]]s, 8 grams of saturated fat (81% of which is palmitic acid), 70 grams of oleic acid, and 17 grams of linoleic acid (oil table).

''Oleum amygdalae'', the fixed oil, is prepared from either sweet or bitter almonds, and is a glyceryl oleate with a slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in [[ethanol|alcohol]] but readily soluble in [[chloroform]] or [[diethyl ether|ether]]. Almond oil is obtained from the dried [[seed|kernel]] of almonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Oil content and fatty acid composition of developing almond seeds |vauthors=Soler L, Canellas J, Saura-Calixto F |journal=J Agric Food Chem |year=1988 |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=695–697 |doi=10.1021/jf00082a007 |url= |df=|hdl=10261/90477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aflatoxins ==
Almonds are susceptible to [[aflatoxin]]-producing molds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The high cost of aflatoxins|publisher=Almond Board of California|year=2009|url=http://www.almondboard.com/Handlers/Documents/The-High-Cost-of-Aflatoxins.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607090652/http://www.almondboard.com/Handlers/Documents/The-High-Cost-of-Aflatoxins.pdf|archivedate=7 June 2013|df=dmy-all|access-date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aflatoxins are potent [[carcinogen]]ic chemicals produced by molds such as ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus parasiticus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rushing&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rushing | first=Blake R. | last2=Selim | first2=Mustafa I. | title=Aflatoxin B1: A review on metabolism, toxicity, occurrence in food, occupational exposure, and detoxification methods | journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology | volume=124 | year=2019 | issn=0278-6915 | doi=10.1016/j.fct.2018.11.047 | pages=81–100|pmid=30468841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mold contamination may occur from soil, previously infested almonds, and almond pests such as navel-orange worm. High levels of mold growth typically appear as gray to black filament like growth. It is unsafe to eat mold-infected tree nuts.

Some countries have strict limits on allowable levels of aflatoxin contamination of almonds and require adequate testing before the nuts can be marketed to their citizens. The [[European Union]], for example, introduced a requirement since 2007 that all almond shipments to EU be tested for aflatoxin. If aflatoxin does not meet the strict safety regulations, the entire consignment may be reprocessed to eliminate the aflatoxin or it must be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aflatoxins in food|publisher=European Food Safety Authority|year=2010|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/aflatoxins-food}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New EU Aflatoxin Levels and Sampling Plan|publisher=USDA Foreign Agricultural Service|year=2010|url=http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/New%20EU%20Aflatoxin%20Levels%20and%20Sampling%20Plan_Brussels%20USEU_EU-27_3-9-2010.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125111951/http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/New%20EU%20Aflatoxin%20Levels%20and%20Sampling%20Plan_Brussels%20USEU_EU-27_3-9-2010.pdf|archivedate=25 November 2011|df=dmy-all|access-date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mandatory pasteurization in California ==
The [[USDA]] approved a proposal by the Almond Board of California to pasteurize almonds sold to the public, after tracing cases of [[salmonellosis]] to almonds. The almond pasteurization program became mandatory for California companies in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  | title = The Food Safety Program &amp; Almond Pasteurization  | publisher = Almond Board of California  | date = 17 September 2010  | url = http://www.almondboard.com/Handlers/FoodQualitySafety/Pasteurization/Pages/Default.aspx  | accessdate = 17 September 2010  | url-status = dead  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100125013631/http://www.almondboard.com/Handlers/FoodQualitySafety/Pasteurization/Pages/Default.aspx  | archivedate = 25 January 2010  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raw, untreated California almonds have not been available in the U.S. since then.

California almonds labeled &quot;raw&quot; must be steam-pasteurized or chemically treated with [[propylene oxide]] (PPO). This does not apply to imported almonds&lt;ref&gt;[[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (8 November 2006) &quot;Almonds Grown in California: Changes to Incoming Quality Control Requirements&quot; ({{Federal Register |71 |65373}}, {{Federal Register |71 |65374}}, {{Federal Register |71 |65375}} and {{Federal Register |71 |65376}})&lt;/ref&gt; or almonds sold from the grower directly to the consumer in small quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |first= Garance  |last= Burke  |title= Almond pasteurization rubs some feelings raw  |url= http://www.insidebayarea.com/business/ci_6260038  |agency= Associated Press  |date= 29 June 2007  |accessdate= 8 November 2014  |url-status= live  |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141223060711/http://www.insidebayarea.com/business/ci_6260038  |archivedate= 23 December 2014  |df= dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment also is not required for raw almonds sold for export outside of North America.

The Almond Board of California states: “PPO residue dissipates after treatment.” The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. EPA]] has reported: “Propylene oxide has been detected in fumigated food products; consumption of contaminated food is another possible route of exposure.” PPO is classified as [[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]] (&quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=wlpEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=ppo+epa+carcinogen#v=onepage&amp;q=ppo%20epa%20carcinogen&amp;f=false |title=Improving the Safety and Quality of Nuts |editor=Harris LJ |year=2013 |publisher=Elsevier, Woodhead Publishing Series in Food Science, Technology and Nutrition |isbn=978-0857097484 |pages=36–37 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203215931/https://books.google.com/books?id=wlpEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=ppo+epa+carcinogen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MJzekIfOrk&amp;sig=gzxNTI-8lC28-t7cY2eUGr1BhlI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBWoVChMIx9KT27HZxwIVBpWICh1qqQEd#v=onepage&amp;q=ppo%20epa%20carcinogen&amp;f=false |archivedate=3 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDA-approved marketing order was challenged in court by organic farmers organized by the [[Cornucopia Institute]], a Wisconsin-based farm policy research group. According to the Cornucopia Institute, this almond marketing order has imposed significant financial burdens on small-scale and organic growers and damaged domestic almond markets. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in the spring of 2009 on procedural grounds. In August 2010, a federal appeals court ruled that the farmers have a right to appeal the USDA regulation. In March 2013, the court vacated the suit on the basis that the objections should have been raised in 2007 when the regulation was first proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Cultural aspects ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aaron's rod]] --&gt;

The almond is highly revered in some cultures. The tree originated in the Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Tubeileh A, Bruggeman A, Turkelboom F |title=Growing Olives and Other Tree Species in Marginal Arid Environments |publisher=[[ICARDA]] |year=2004 |url=http://www.icarda.org/docrep/Books/Growing_Olives/Olive.pdf }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mentioned numerous times in the Bible.

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the almond was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In the Bible the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with [[Book of Genesis]] 43:11, where it is described as &quot;among the best of fruits&quot;. In [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 17 [[Levi]] is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by [[Aaron's rod]], which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The almond blossom supplied a model for the [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] which stood in the [[Holy Temple]], &quot;Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers&quot;  ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 25:33–34; 37:19–20).

Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]]; paintings and [[icon]]s often include [[mandorla|almond-shaped haloes]] encircling the [[Christ Child]] and as a symbol of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]. The word &quot;[[Luz]]&quot;, which appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 30:37, sometimes translated as &quot;[[hazel]]&quot;, may actually be derived from the Aramaic name for almond (Luz), and is translated as such in some Bible versions such as the [[NIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g8YSB2K9d1oC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The meaning of trees: botany, history, healing, lore |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518081242/https://books.google.com/books?id=g8YSB2K9d1oC&amp;pg=PA37 |archive-date=18 May 2016 |author=Fred Hageneder |page=37|isbn=9780811848985 |date=September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic name for almond is لوز &quot;lauz&quot; or &quot;lūz&quot;. In some parts of the Levant and North Africa it is pronounced &quot;loz&quot;, which is very close to its Aramaic origin.

[[La entrada de la flor]] is an event celebrated on 1 February in [[Torrent, Valencia|Torrent]], Spain, in which the clavarios and members of the Confrerie of the Mother of God deliver a branch of the first-blooming almond-tree to the Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sena |first1=Laura |title=Fuego y flor de almendro en l'Entrà de Torrent |url=http://www.levante-emv.com/horta/2016/02/02/fuego-flor-almendro-lentra-torrent/1373887.html |date=2 February 2016 |website=levante-emv.com |publisher=Levante |accessdate=11 May 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525161925/http://www.levante-emv.com/horta/2016/02/02/fuego-flor-almendro-lentra-torrent/1373887.html |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
