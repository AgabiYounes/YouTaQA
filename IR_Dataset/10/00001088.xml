The '''Armed Forces of Azerbaijan''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Silahlı Qüvvələri}}) were re-established according to the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Armed Forces from 9 October 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.president.az/|title=Official web-site of President of Azerbaijan Republic|website=en.president.az|access-date=2018-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530133038/http://en.president.az/|archive-date=30 May 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (ADR) had originally formed its own armed forces from 26 June 1918. However these were dissolved after Azerbaijan was absorbed into the Soviet Union as the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]] from 28 April 1920. After the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991–92 the armed forces were reformed based on Soviet bases and equipment left on Azeri soil.

The armed forces have three branches: the [[Azerbaijani Land Forces]], the [[Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force]], and the [[Azerbaijani Navy]].&lt;ref name=JSSA-MT /&gt; Associated forces include the [[Azerbaijani National Guard]], the [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]], and the [[State Border Service (Azerbaijan)|State Border Service]], which can be involved in state defense under certain circumstances.

According to the Azerbaijani media sources the military expenditures of Azerbaijan for 2009 were set at $2.46 billion [[United States dollar|USD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gov't allots over $2bn for 2009 defense spending |url= http://www.azernews.az/site/shownews.php?news_id=8601 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110706130859/http://www.azernews.az/site/shownews.php?news_id=8601 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 6 July 2011 |publisher= AzerNEWS |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate= 12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however according to [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]], only $1.473 billion was spent in that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIPRI&quot;&gt;[[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] [http://milexdata.sipri.org/ The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725213004/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |date=25 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IISS]] also suggests that the defence budget in 2009 was $1.5 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;IISS 2015&quot; /&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan]] supervises the design, manufacturing, regulation and maintenance of military equipment.

==Overview==
Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan has been trying to further develop its armed forces into a professional, well trained, and mobile military. Azerbaijan has been undergoing extensive modernization and capacity expanding programs, with the military budget increasing from around $300 million in 2005 to $2.46 billion in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL1597375 | work=Reuters | title=Azerbaijan announces 53 pct rise in army spending | date=15 April 2008 | access-date=30 June 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726120651/http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL1597375 | archive-date=26 July 2009 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total armed forces number 56,840 men in the land forces, 7,900 men in the air force and air defence force, and 2,200 men in the navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;IISS 2015&quot; /&gt; There are also 19,500 personnel in the National Guard, State Border Service, and Internal Troops.&lt;ref name=Blandy12&gt;C.

===Azerbaijan Democratic Republic===
[[File:Two Azerbaijani soldiers 1919.png|thumb|175px|left|Two Azerbaijani soldiers, members of the Guba military unit of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] (1919)]]
The history of the modern Azerbaijan army dates back to [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918, when the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan Republic were created on 26 June 1918. First ''de facto'' Minister of Defense of ADR was Dr. [[Khosrov bey Sultanov]]. When the Ministry was formally established Gen. [[Samedbey Mehmandarov]] became the minister, and then Lt-Gen. [[Ali-Agha Shikhlinski]] his deputy. Chiefs of Staff of ADR Army were Lt-Gen. [[Maciej Sulkiewicz]] (March 1919 – 10 December 1919) and Maj-Gen. Abdulhamid bey Gaitabashi (10 December 1919 – April 1920).&lt;ref name=&quot;Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/print.php?id=104326 Azerbaijani Army marks 91 years] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225202625/http://en.apa.az/print.php?id=104326 |date=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.az/news/politics/53397.html|title=Azerbaijan marks Day of Armed Forces|access-date=27 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629185253/http://www.today.az/news/politics/53397.html|archive-date=29 June 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Red Army]] invaded Azerbaijan on 28 April 1920. Although the bulk of the newly formed Azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an Armenian revolt that had just broken out in [[Karabakh]], the Azeris did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily. As many as 20,000 of the total 30,000 soldiers died resisting what was effectively a Russian reconquest.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Army of Azerbaijan in 1918.jpg|thumb|Officers of the army of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] in 1918.]]

===World War II===
[[File:Парад 1960 г. 6 рота.jpg|thumb|Cadets of the [[Baku Higher All-Arms Command School]] during a parade in Baku in 1960.]]
During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of Soviet Union. Much of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] was supplied by Baku. By a decree of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in February 1942, the commitment of more than 500 workers and employees of the oil industry of Azerbaijan was recognised with orders and medals.
[[Operation Edelweiss]] carried out by the German [[Wehrmacht]] targeted [[Baku]] because of the importance of its oil fields to the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[[Swietochowski, Tadeusz]](1995) ''Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition, Columbia University'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 800,000 Azerbaijanis fought within the ranks of the Soviet Army of which 400,000 died. Azeri national formations of the [[Red Army]] included the [[223rd Rifle Division|223rd]], [[227th Rifle Division|227th]], [[396th Rifle Division|396th]], [[402nd Rifle Division|402nd]], and [[416th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|416th Rifle Division]]s. Azeri Major-General [[Hazi Aslanov]] was awarded a second [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] after a long post-war fight for recognition of his accomplishments.

===Dissolution of the Soviet armed forces===
During the Cold War, Azerbaijan had been the deployment area of units of the Soviet [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]] whose principle formations in 1988 included four motor rifle divisions ([[23rd Guards Motor Rifle Division|23rd Guards]], [[60th Motor Rifle Division|60th]], 75th, and [[295th Motor Rifle Division|295th]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/armies/4oa.htm|title=4th Combined Arms Army|website=www.ww2.dk|access-date=2016-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211115719/http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/armies/4oa.htm|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[75th Motor Rifle Division]] was isolated in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]]. The 4th Army also included missile and air defense brigades and artillery and rocket regiments. The 75th Division's stores and equipment were apparently transferred to the Nakhichevan authorities.&lt;ref&gt;See reference at [[7th Guards Army]] article.&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan also hosted the 49th Arsenal of the Soviet [[Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation|Main Agency of Missiles and Artillery]], which contained over 7,000 train-car loads of ammunition to the excess of one billion units.

The first president of Azerbaijan, [[Ayaz Mutallibov]], did not wish to build an independent army, wanting to rely instead largely on Soviet troops. Even when the Parliament decided that an army should be formed in September 1991, disagreements between the government and the opposition [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]] impeded creation of a unified force.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group, Azerbaijan: Defence Sector Management and Reform Crisis Group Europe Briefing N°50, 29 October 2008, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, the first unit of the new army was formed on the basis of the 18–110 military unit of [[mechanized infantry]] of the [[Soviet Ground Forces]] (probably part of the [[4th Army (Soviet Union)|4th Army]]) located in [[Bibiheybət|Shikhov]], south of Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.az/index.php/cra-hakimiyyti/70-nazirliklr/99-azrbaycan-respublikas-muedafi-nazirliyi |title=Azərbaycan Respublikası Müdafiə Nazirliyi. 1991-dən sonra |trans-title=Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan Republic.

[[File:Рота почетного караула на параде, 1966 г.jpg|thumb|A Guard of Honor during a parade in Baku in 1966.]]
In summer 1992, the nascent Defense Ministry received a resolution by the Azerbaijani president on the takeover of units and formations in Azerbaijani territory. It then forwarded an ultimatum to Moscow demanding control over vehicles and armaments of the 135th and 139th Motor Rifle Regiments of the [[295th Motor Rifle Division]].&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Petrov, [http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/4-2002/dp/hscwa/?form=print How South Caucasus was armed] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024014020/http://mdb.cast.ru/mdb/4-2002/dp/hscwa/?form=print |date=24 October 2007 }}, Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (Moscow, Russia)&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1992, Azerbaijan ratified the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] (CFE), which establishes comprehensive limits on key categories of conventional military equipment. Azerbaijan approved the CFE flank agreement in May 1997.

The transfer of the property of the 4th Army (except for part of the property of the 366th Motor Rifle Regiment of the [[23rd Guards Motor Rifle Division]] captured by Armenian armed formations in 1992 during the regiment's withdrawal from Stepanakert) and the 49th arsenal was completed in 1992. Thus, by the end of 1992, Azerbaijan received arms and military hardware sufficient for approximately four motor rifle divisions with prescribed army units. It also inherited naval ships. There are also reports that 50 combat aircraft from the disbanded [[Baku Air Defence Army|19th Army]] of the [[Soviet Air Defence Forces]] came under Azeri control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Azerbaijani sources insist that Armenian victory was largely due to military help from Russia and the wealthy [[Armenian diaspora]]. Armenians partially deny the allegation, claiming that Russian side was equally supplying Armenian and Azerbaijani sides with weapons and mercenaries. During the war, the Azeri armed forces were also aided by Turkish military advisers, and Russian, Ukrainian, Chechen and Afghan mercenaries.

===Non-combat deaths===
A number of Azerbaijani human rights groups have been tracking non-combat deaths and have noted an upward trend. Based on Defense Ministry statistics that had not been released to the public, the Group of Monitoring Compliance with Human Rights in the Army (GMCHRA) has recorded the deaths of 76 soldiers to date in non-combat incidents for 2011, and the injury of 91 others. In comparison, there were 62 non-combat deaths and 71 cases of injury in 2010. The string of non-combat deaths raises questions about the reform progress of the military. Factors behind the deaths include bullying, hazing, and the systemic corruption within the Azeri military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Azerbaijan: Non-Combat Deaths Put Military Reforms in Spotlight | url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/64508 | publisher=EurasiaNet | date=14 November 2011 | accessdate=2 February 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128182004/http://www.eurasianet.org/node/64508 | archive-date=28 January 2012 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Azerbaijani Land Forces]] number 85,000 strong, according to UK [[Advanced Research and Assessment Group]] estimates.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt; The 2,500 men of the National Guard are also part of the ground forces. In addition, there are 300,000 former service personnel who have had military service in the last 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;IISS157&quot;/&gt; Other paramilitary agencies consist of Interior Ministry [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]], 12,000 strong, and the land component of the [[State Border Service (Azerbaijan)|State Border Service]], 5,000 strong.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;

Azerbaijan has signed numerous contracts to strengthen its armed forces and to train its military with Turkey's assistance. Over the last 15 years, Azerbaijan has been preparing its military for possible action against Armenian forces in [[Nagorno-Karabakh]].

===Organization===
[[File:Azerbaijan Army 2007 OrBat.png|thumb|[[Azerbaijani Army]] Order of Battle]]
The Land Forces consist of five army corps:&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;
*1st Army Corps also known as Evlax Army Corps (concentrated near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]])
*2nd Army Corps also known as Pirekeshkul Army Corps (concentrated against Armenian controlled territories and part is deployed on the Azerbaijan-Iranian border)
*3rd Army Corps also known as Shamkir Army Corps (concentrated against Armenian controlled territories)
*4th Army Corps also known as Baku Army Corps (covers [[Absheron Peninsula]] and the coast)
*5th Army Corps also known as Nakhchivan Army Corps (deployed in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]])

The Land Forces include 23 motor rifle brigades, an artillery brigade, a multiple rocket launcher brigade, and an anti-tank regiment.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt; The IISS Military Balance reported in 2007 that the Land Forces had an estimated 40 SA-13 Gopher, SA-4 Ganef, and SA-8 Gecko air defence missile systems, with '80–240 eff.' to support the army in the battlefield. (IISS 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;157)

The [[Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan]] are mostly supplied from the Land Forces, though the [[Internal Troops of Azerbaijan]] do also supply some. As of March 2011, 94 peacekeepers were deployed with the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaf.nato.int/images/stories/File/Placemats/PLACEMAT.MARCH%2004..pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406003726/http://www.isaf.nato.int/images/stories/File/Placemats/PLACEMAT.MARCH%2004..pdf |archivedate=6 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, it also actively supported the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo and Iraq.

The Azeri [[Peacekeeping forces of Azerbaijan|peacekeeping unit]] deployed in Iraq consisted of 14 officers, 16 sergeants and 120 privates, a total of 150 troops. The unit secured the [[hydroelectric power station]] and reservoir in [[Haditha, Iraq|Al Haditha]] from August 2003. In December 2008, Azerbaijan withdrew the unit from Iraq.

Reportedly in December 2014 Azerbaijan created the 6th Army Corps in Nakhchivan. Karam Mustafayev became commander of the Special 6th Army Corps. The Special 6th Army Corps has been created based on the Nakhchivan 5th Army Corps to strengthen defense capability of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, increase of combat capability of military units and formations of the Armed Forces, improve central control, reports quoting the Defence Ministry said.

==Air forces==
The [[Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force]] is a single unified service branch.&lt;ref name=JSSA-MT&gt;Jane's Sentinel Security Assessments – Russia and the CIS: Air Force, dated 18 June 2009, and {{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |author2= |year=2008 |month= |title=World Defence Almanac  |journal=Military Technology |volume= XXXII |issue= 1 |pages=244–245|publisher=Monch Publishing Group |location=Bonn, Germany |issn=0722-3226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 8,000 men serve in the air force and air defence force.&lt;ref name=Blandy12 /&gt;

The Azerbaijani Air and Air Defence Force has around 106 aircraft and 35 helicopters.&lt;ref name=IISS158 /&gt; The country has four major airbases. [[Nasosnaya (air base)]] has fighters, [[Kyurdamir Air Base]] a bomber regiment, [[Ganja Air Base]] transports, and [[Baku Kala Air Base]] the helicopter unit. There are also four other airbases which do not appear to have aircraft based there. These are [[Dollyar Air Base]], [[Nakhichevan Airport]], [[Sanqacal]] Air Base, and [[Sitalcay]] Air Base.

The Azeri Air Force uses [[MiG-21]], [[MiG-23]], [[Su-24]] and [[Su-25]] aircraft, as well as the [[MiG-29]] purchased from Ukraine in 2006 and [[Il-76]] transport aircraft.

Also in Azerbaijan there was a former Soviet early warning radar. The [[Gabala Radar Station]] was a bistatic phased-array installation, operated by the [[Russian Space Forces]]. The contract was signed in 2002 and was due to expire in 2012 where it was to be given back to the Azerbaijani government. The contract costed Russia $7 million per year. The radar station had a range of up to {{convert|6000|km|mi|abbr=off}}, and was designed to detect [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] launches as far as from the Indian Ocean. In December 2012 Russia announced that negotiations had been unsuccessful and that they had stopped using the radar station.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIA-Nov7&quot;&gt;

===Training and education===
Azerbaijani pilots are trained in the Azerbaijan Air Force School and then develop their skills in operational units. Azerbaijan has an experience exchange with Turkey, Ukraine, the United States and a number of NATO countries. The Turkish Air Force School has a great role in the training of Azeri military pilots. Azerbaijani pilots are also trained in Ukraine's Pilot Training School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=97127 Azerbaijan’s military aviation opportunities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319233114/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=97127 |date=19 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s consisting of 2 [[Sonya class minesweeper]] and 2 [[Yevgenya class minesweeper]]s. (Jane's Fighting Ships 2010)

The Navy is also attributed with 5 [[landing craft]], 3 Polnochny and 2 Vydra,(IISS 2007) plus three research ships, 1 Project 10470, A 671, ex Svyaga, 1 Balerian Uryvayev class survey vessel (AG) and one Vadim Popov class survey vessel (AG).

The U.S. Navy has helped train the Azeri Navy. There is also an agreement to provide US support to refurbish Azeri warships in the [[Caspian Sea]]. In 2006, the US Government donated 3 motorboats to the Azerbaijani navy. In 2007 an agreement between Azeri Navy and a US military company was concluded, which stated that a part of the Azeri Navy would be equipped with advanced laser marksmanship systems. The US company specialists were also to give training on the use of the new equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.az/news/politics/40483.html|title=Azerbaijan Navy to be equipped with laser devices|access-date=4 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111534/http://www.today.az/news/politics/40483.html|archive-date=29 September 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of separate U.S. programmes are underway under the [[Caspian Guard Initiative]], focused mostly on enhancing Azerbaijani and Kazakh maritime border security.

The [[Ministry of Defence Industry of Azerbaijan]] directs domestic military supplies for Azerbaijan. It was established in 2005. The Defence Industries Ministry subsumed the State Department for Military Industry and for Armaments and the Military Science Center, each of which was formerly a separate agency within the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry.

The defense industry has emerged as an autonomous entity with a growing defense production capability. The ministry is cooperating with the defense sectors of Ukraine, Belarus and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1074435.html|title=Azerbaijan: Baku Signals New Determination For Defense Reform|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|access-date=10 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410202302/https://www.rferl.org/a/1074435.html|archive-date=10 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other contracts, Azerbaijani defence industries and Turkish companies, Azerbaijan will produce 40mm revolver grenade launchers, 107mm and 122mm MLRS systems, Cobra 4×4 vehicles and joint modernization of BTR vehicles in Baku.&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.az/articles/politics/26065|title=News.Az -   Azerbaijan, Turkey to produce revolver grenade launchers|website=www.news.az|access-date=29 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107195656/http://news.az/articles/politics/26065|archive-date=7 November 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership2&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136785 Azerbaijan’s Ministry of Defense Industry plans to assume several projects on technical modernization of Armed Forces] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402090426/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136785 |date=2 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.az/articles/politics/25988|title=News.Az -   Azerbaijan, Turkey sign contract on joint rocket production|website=www.news.az|access-date=29 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108063414/http://www.news.az/articles/politics/25988|archive-date=8 November 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brothership4&quot;&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136603 Azerbaijani Defense Industry Ministry conducts negotiations with Turkish &quot;Otokar&quot; Company on production of armored vehicles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325182937/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=136603 |date=25 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A protocol of intent was signed the same day with the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation [[MKEK]] on the joint production of 120-mm mortar launchers. This project will come into force in a few months time. Agreement has also been reached with Turkish company Aselsan on the production of some types of defence output in Azerbaijan, specifically the latest types of weapons' sights. These projects will probably happen in the near future too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan to buy long-range rockets|url=http://www.news.az/articles/politics/36243|accessdate=9 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515072316/http://news.az/articles/politics/36243|archive-date=15 May 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Turkish defense industries secretariat told that an export version of the T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitser is almost done and could start production. T-155 has been powered by a German MTU power pack, which restricts the sale to some countries like Azerbaijan.

[[Section 907]] of the United States [[Freedom Support Act]] bans any kind of direct United States [[aid]] to the Azerbaijani government. Since a waiver was made in 2001 there has been extensive U.S. military cooperation with Azerbaijan. This has included Special Forces and naval aid, consultations with [[United States European Command]], and linkages through the U.S. National Guard [[State Partnership Program]].

On 19 May 2006, Azerbaijani Defense Minister [[Safar Abiyev]] and the then commander of [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] General [[Tom Hobbins]] met in [[Baku]] to discuss military cooperation. He said the objective of his visit was to become familiar with the state of Azerbaijani armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azernews.net/eng/gizli/view.php?d=14940 NATO &amp; Azerbaijan relations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601083626/http://www.azernews.net/eng/gizli/view.php?d=14940 |date=1 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbins pointed to the progress made in the NATO-Azerbaijan relations, saying that the successful implementation of the NATO [[Partnership for Peace]] program in Azerbaijan has brought the country even closer to the alliance.

===Russia===

Russia is Azerbaijan's main arms supplier. &quot;As of today, military and technical cooperation with Russia is measured at $4 billion and it tends to grow further,&quot; President [[Ilham Aliyev]] said after meeting with Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] in Baku in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-13/azeri-russian-arms-trade-4-billion-amid-tension-with-armenia.html Azeri-Russian Arms Trade $4 Billion Amid Tension With Armenia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119232310/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-13/azeri-russian-arms-trade-4-billion-amid-tension-with-armenia.html |date=19 January 2015 }} By Zulfugar Agayev 13 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
Azerbaijan and Israel cooperate on numerous areas of the defense industry. Azerbaijan has shown great interest in Israeli technology over the years. In particular, an agreement was reached over the construction of the factory of intelligence and combat drones in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=&quot;panarmenian.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/33537|title=Israel rearms Azerbaijani army|access-date=7 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728070342/http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/33537|archive-date=28 July 2010|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenianreporter.am/go/article/2009-07-03-israel-azerbaijan-to-step-up-military-cooperation Washington briefing: Israel, Azerbaijan to step up military cooperation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624025123/http://www.armenianreporter.am/go/article/2009-07-03-israel-azerbaijan-to-step-up-military-cooperation |date=24 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli defense company [[Elta]] Systems Ltd has had cooperation from Azerbaijan in building the [[TecSAR]] reconnaissance satellite system, which can take high-definition photos of ground surfaces in all weather conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;EurAsiaNet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav081709a.shtml|title=Eurasianet|website=www.eurasianet.org|access-date=30 November 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505082450/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav081709a.shtml|archive-date=5 May 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ninan Koshy, &quot;[http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4959 India and Israel Eye Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012235242/http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/4959 |date=12 October 2009 }}&quot;, ''Foreign Policy in Focus'', 13 February 2008. &lt;/ref&gt; According to Azerbaijani military experts, the TecSAR system will be indispensable for military operations in the mountainous terrains of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name=&quot;panarmenian.net&quot; /&gt;

As of June 2009, Israel and Azerbaijan had been negotiating on the production of [[Namer (vehicle)|Namer]] armoured [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;Panarmenian.net [http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/33537 panarmenian – Israel rearms Azerbaijani army] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728070342/http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/world/news/33537 |date=28 July 2010 }}, 30 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There is no further information as to whether any agreement has been made.

Both countries treat a nuclear [[I.R. Iran]] as security threat.

===NATO===
[[File:Azerbaijani soldiers in Iraq 11.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijan deployed 150 peacekeepers during the [[Iraq War]]]]
The [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and Azerbaijan actively cooperate on defence institutional reforms and have developed practical cooperation in many other areas. Azerbaijan's [[Individual Partnership Action Plan]] (IPAP) and its [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP) linkages lay out the programme of cooperation between Azerbaijan and NATO.

The Azerbaijani government has however delayed implementing IPAP-recommended reforms, however, in part at least because no decision had been taken to seek NATO membership. This is because Azerbaijan's foreign policy 'seeks to balance interests with the U.S., EU, Russia and Iran.'&lt;ref&gt;[[International Crisis Group]], Azerbaijan: Defence Sector Reform and Management, Europe Briefing No.50, Baku/Tblisi/Brussels, 29 October 2008, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a NATO diplomatic source some key officials at NATO headquarters in [[Brussel]]s were pushing hard for engaging Azerbaijan on the membership question. &quot;Turkey, Romania, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom and the [[Baltic states]],&quot; are among the member-states also backing a fast track for Azerbaijan's NATO membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav060409.shtml|title=Eurasianet|website=www.eurasianet.org|access-date=9 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606053322/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav060409.shtml|archive-date=6 June 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Azerbaijan made its policy of [[non-belligerent|not being aligned]] with a geopolitical/military structure official when it became a full member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 2011.

There is also a limited amount of military cooperation with the other countries of [[GUAM]]: Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perspektivy.info/rus/konturi/vojennoje_sotrudnichestvo_mezhdu_postsovetskimi_gosudarstvami_2008-09-25.htm Военное сотрудничество между постсоветскими государствами] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721230818/http://www.perspektivy.info/rus/konturi/vojennoje_sotrudnichestvo_mezhdu_postsovetskimi_gosudarstvami_2008-09-25.htm |date=21 July 2011 }} {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
