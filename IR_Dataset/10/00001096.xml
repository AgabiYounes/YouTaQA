Most of the cross-border lines are currently closed due to political problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| title=Armenia looks to the private sector | magazine = [[Railway Gazette International]] |date = January 2008| url = http://www.railwaygazette.com/news_view/article/2008/01/8075/armenia_looks_to_the_private_sector.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are daily inbound and outbound trains connecting Tbilisi and Yerevan. Departing from [[Yerevan railway station]] trains connect to both Tbilisi and [[Batumi]]. From neighboring Georgia, trains depart to Yerevan from [[Tbilisi railway station]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wander-lush.org/train-from-tbilisi-to-yerevan/]&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Armenia]], new electric trains connect passengers from Yerevan to Armenia's second largest city of [[Gyumri]]. The new trains run four times a day and the journey takes approximately two hours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.evnreport.com/economy/revitalizing-armenia-s-transport-system]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also discussion to establish a rail link between Yerevan and Tehran. Armenia is pursuing funding from the Asian Development Bank to launch construction of this infrastructure project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/01/c_138027336.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The completion of the project could establish a major commodities transit corridor and would serve as the shortest transportation route between [[Europe]] and the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rasia-announces-achievement-of-key-milestone-for-southern-armenia-railway-in-meeting-with-armenian-prime-minister-223792861.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2019, Iranian president [[Hassan Rouhani]] backed this project and stated that “we want the Persian Gulf and the [[Gulf of Oman]] to be connected to the Black Sea, and one of the ways to make this happen is through Iran, Armenia and Georgia.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/980682.html|title=Tehran determined in deepening relations with Yerevan|website=armenpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metros===
The capital city of Armenia, [[Yerevan]], is serviced by the [[Yerevan Metro]]. The system was launched in 1981 and like most former Soviet Metros, its stations are very deep (20–70 meters underground) and intricately decorated with national motifs. The metro runs on a 13.4 kilometres (8.3&amp;nbsp;mi) line and currently serves 10 active stations. Trains run every five minutes from 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. until 11 p.m. local [[Armenia Time|AMT]] time. As of 2017, the annual ridership of the metro is 16.2 million passengers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asmetro.ru/upload/docs/2017.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Free wi-fi is available at all stations and some trains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rentyerevan.com/f-a-q-for-tourists/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buses ==

===International connections===
Land borders are open with both Georgia and Iran. Yerevan Central Bus Station, also known as Kilikia Bus Station is the main bus terminal in Yerevan with buses connecting to both internal and international destinations. There are daily bus connections between Yerevan and [[Tbilisi]] and Yerevan and [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lonelyplanet.com/armenia/practical-information/transport/flights-and-getting-there/a/nar/058ca5e0-00f0-4400-a579-d38c37d8d9c2/1313894]&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately three times daily, buses depart from Yerevan Central Bus Station to [[Stepanakert]], the capital of the partially recognized state of [[Republic of Artsakh|Artsakh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dontstopliving.net/world-borders-get-armenia-nagorno-karabakh-tegh-berdadzor/]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also scheduled bus routes which connect Yerevan with [[Kiev]], [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]] as well as several other cities across [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://getbybus.com/en/bus-from-yerevan]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to connect to [[Chișinău]] Moldova, [[Minsk]] Belarus and other cities in [[Eastern Europe]] from Yerevan through connecting bus routes via Georgia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rome2rio.com/s/Yerevan/Minsk]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is a once a week bus service to [[Istanbul]] via Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tripfinger.com/Armenia/r/Yerevan/l/Yerevan-Central-Bus-Station]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2019, a new bus route from [[Baghdad]] to Yerevan via Iran began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/iraq/09062019]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local connections===
{{See also|Trolleybuses in Yerevan}}
The Armenian bus network connects all major cities and towns and many villages throughout the country. In larger cities and towns such as [[Yerevan]], [[Gyumri]], [[Vanadzor]] and [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], bus stations are equipped with a waiting room and a ticket office, in other towns bus stations may not have shelters. Most of the routes are operated by [[GAZelle]] minivans with a capacity of 15 passengers, some routes are operated by soviet bus producer [[LiAZ (Russia)]]. Yerevan itself has a large integrated bus network, with a newly acquired bus fleet, passengers are able to connect from one end of the city to the other. [[Wi-fi]] is available on most city buses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rentyerevan.com/f-a-q-for-tourists/]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, buses often have difficulty meeting the demand for capacity, mainly in Yerevan, where vehicles are typically overcrowded. There are no night services between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. There is no ticket system in the country, passengers pay in cash to drivers.  Passengers on the national bus network pay before boarding, passengers on the Yerevan bus network pay after the ride, while leaving the vehicle. Timetables and fares are published on [https://t-armenia.com/ Transport for Armenia].

From [[Yeritasardakan (Yerevan Metro)|Yeritasardakan]] metro station in downtown Yerevan, travelers can take the 201 airport shuttle which goes directly to Zvartnots International Airport, which takes approximately 20 minutes from the city center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://t-armenia.com/en/yerevan-airport-shuttle-bus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roadways==
[[File:E-roads-Caucasus-countries.png|thumb|right|275px|The E-road network in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]]. However, the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan is closed due to strained [[Armenia–Azerbaijan relations|relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan]].]]
{{Main|Roads in Armenia}}
Since independence, Armenia has been developing its internal highway network. The &quot;North-South Road Corridor Investment Program&quot; is a major infrastructure project which aims at connecting the southern border of Armenia with its northern by means of a 556&amp;nbsp;km-long Meghri-Yerevan-Bavra highway. It is a major US$1.5 billion infrastructure project funded by the [[Asian Development Bank]], [[European Investment Bank]] and the [[Eurasian Development Bank]]. When completed, the highway will provide access to European countries via the [[Black Sea]]. It could also eventually interconnect the Black Sea ports of Georgia with the major ports of Iran, thus positioning Armenia in a strategic transport corridor between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.evnreport.com/economy/revitalizing-armenia-s-transport-system]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://northsouth.am/en]&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia is pursuing further loans from [[China]] as part of the [[Belt and Road Initiative]] to complete the north–south highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-05/01/c_138027336.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia connects to European road networks via the [[International E-road network]] through various routes such as; [[European route E117]], [[European route E691]], [[European route E001]] and [[European route E60]]. Armenia also connects to the [[Asian Highway Network]] through routes [[AH81]], [[AH82]] and [[AH83]].

The number of insured registered cars in Armenia has grown from 390,457 in 2011 to 457,878 in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armbanks.am/en/2016/02/03/94938/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2019, the creation of a Free Route Airspace (FRA) between Armenia and Georgia was announced.

The Free Route Airspace between the two [[South Caucasus]] countries will increase flights to around 40,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.armradio.am/2019/11/08/armenia-georgia-launch-free-route-airspace/]&lt;/ref&gt;
