The '''economy of Azerbaijan''' has completed its post-Soviet transition into a major oil based economy (with the completion of the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline]]), from one where the state played the major role. The transition to oil production led to remarkable growth figures as projects came online; reaching 26.4% in 2005 (second highest [[GDP]] growth in the world in 2005 only to [[Equatorial Guinea]]) and 34.6% in 2006 (world highest) before subsiding to 10.8% and 9.3% in 2008 and 2009 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.az/news/business/51114.html|title=Today.Az - GDP growth makes 3.4% in Azerbaijan in 2009|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The real GDP growth rate for 2011 was expected at 3.7% but had dropped to 0.1%.&lt;ref name=State&gt;{{cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2909.htm|title=Background Note: Azerbaijan|publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Large [[Petroleum|oil]] reserves are a major contributor to [[Azerbaijan]]'s economy. The national currency, the [[Azerbaijani manat]], was stable in 2000, depreciating 3.8% against the dollar. The budget deficit equaled 1.3% of GDP in 2000.

Progress on economic reform has generally lagged behind [[macroeconomic]] stabilization. The government has undertaken regulatory reforms in some areas, including substantial opening of trade policy, but inefficient public administration in which commercial and regulatory interests are co-mingled limit the impact of these reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan on CIA's Worldfactbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has largely completed [[privatization]] of agricultural lands and small and medium-sized enterprises. In August 2000, the government launched a second-stage privatization program, in which many large state enterprises will be privatized. Since 2001, the economic activity in the country is regulated by the [[Ministry of Economic Development (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Economic Development of Azerbaijan Republic]].

==Economic history of Azerbaijan==

===Modern era===
Through the Soviet period, Azerbaijan had always been less developed industrially than Armenia and Georgia, two neighboring Transcaucasia countries - but also less diversified, as a result of slow investment in non-oil sector. With a history of industrial development of more than 100 years, Azerbaijan proved to be a leading nation in Southern Caucasus throughout the turmoil of Soviet Union collapse in early 1990s until nowadays.

===Republic era===
Oil remains the most prominent product of Azerbaijan's economy with cotton, natural gas and agriculture products contributing to its economic growth over the last five years. More than $60 billion was invested into Azerbaijan's oil by major international oil companies in AIOC consortium operated by [[BP]]. Oil production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November 1997 and now is about 500,000 b/d. People visit petroleum spas (or &quot;oil spas&quot;) to bathe in the local crude in [[Naftalan, Azerbaijan|Naftalan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/28/news/journal.php Azerbaijani answer to oil glut: Bathe in it - Asia - Pacific - International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128193000/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/28/news/journal.php |date=28 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A leading [[caviar]] producer and exporter in the past, Azerbaijan's [[fishing industry]] today is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of [[sturgeon]] and [[beluga (sturgeon)|beluga]] in the [[Caspian Sea]].

Azerbaijan shares all the problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a [[command economy|command]] to a [[market economy]], but its energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Azerbaijan has begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhalko-Tytarenko|first1=Andrew|title=Iran’s other side: the South Caucasus|url=http://diplomatonline.com/mag/2014/04/irans-other-side-the-south-caucasus/|website=diplomatonline.com|accessdate=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Azerbaijan became member of the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief Introduction of ECO's history|url=http://www.ecosecretariat.org/detail_info/about_eco_d.htm|website=www.ecosecretariat.org|accessdate=14 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022070355/http://www.ecosecretariat.org/Detail_info/About_ECO_D.htm|archive-date=22 October 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Azerbaijani [[merchant marine]] had 54 ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan Transportation | publisher = NationsEncyclopedia.com| url = http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Azerbaijan-TRANSPORTATION.html| accessdate = 24 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2001, Azerbaijan concluded a [[gas]] agreement with Turkey, providing a future export market for Azerbaijan.

[[File:Tree map export 2009 Azerbaijan.jpeg|thumb|left|Graphical depiction of Azerbaijan Product's product exports (2009).]]
Azerbaijan has concluded 21 production-sharing agreements with various oil companies. An export pipeline that transports Caspian oil to the Mediterranean from [[Baku]] through [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to [[Ceyhan]], [[Turkey]] (the [[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline|Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline]]) became operational in 2006. The pipeline is expected to generate as much as $160 billion in revenues for the country over the next 30 years. The recent high price of oil is highly beneficial to Azerbaijan's economy as the nation is in the midst of an oil boom. Eastern Caspian producers in Kazakhstan also have expressed interest in accessing this pipeline to transport a portion of their production.

In 2010, Azerbaijan entered into the top eight biggest oil suppliers to EU countries with €9.46 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.az/news/business/82397.html|title=Today.Az - Azerbaijan among top 8 biggest oil suppliers to EU countries|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the amount of foreign investments in Azerbaijan was $20 billion, a 61% increase from 2010. According to [[Ministry of Economic Development (Azerbaijan)|Minister of Economic Development of Azerbaijan]], [[Shahin Mustafayev]], in 2011, &quot;$15.7 billion was invested in the non-oil sector, while the rest - in the oil sector.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/17/azerbaijan-investment-idUSL6E8CH3QF20120117 |title=Azerbaijan investment up 61 pct to $20 bln in 2011 |work=Reuters |author=Lada Yevgrashina |date=17 January 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Turkey and Azerbaijan agreed to boost mutual trade to US$15 billion by 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey, Azerbaijan intend to boost mutual trade to $15 billion by 2023|url=http://itar-tass.com/en/economy/771401|archive-url=https://archive.today/20150118152136/http://itar-tass.com/en/economy/771401|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 January 2015|accessdate=16 January 2015|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For more than a century the backbone of the Azerbaijani economy has been [[petroleum]], which represented 50 percent of Azerbaijan's GDP in 2005, and is projected to double to almost 125 percent of GDP in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=13024 Azerbaijan: Energy profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004122202/http://www.energypublisher.com/article.asp?id=13024 |date=4 October 2008 }}'' (Enerpub, 13 December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Now that Western oil companies are able to tap deepwater oilfields untouched by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] because of poor technology, Azerbaijan is considered one of the most important areas in the world for oil exploration and development. Proven [[oil reserves]] in the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian Basin]], which Azerbaijan shares with [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Iran]], and [[Turkmenistan]], are comparable in size to the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]], although exploration is still in the early stages.

==Sectors of the economy==

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Azerbaijan}}
Azerbaijan has the largest agricultural basin in the region. About 54,9 percent of Azerbaijan is agricultural lands. At the beginning of 2007 there were 4,755,100&amp;nbsp;hectares of utilized agricultural area.&lt;ref name=&quot;AG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural resources |publisher=The State Statistical Committee of the Republic of Azerbaijan |url=http://www.azstat.org/publications/azfigures/2007/en/003.shtml |accessdate=2007-05-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610085820/http://www.azstat.org/publications/azfigures/2007/en/003.shtml |archivedate=10 June 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the total wood resources counted 136 million m³.&lt;ref name=&quot;AG&quot;/&gt; Azerbaijan's agricultural scientific research institutes are focused on meadows and pastures, horticulture and [[subtropical]] crops, [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[viticulture]] and [[Azerbaijani wine|wine-making]], cotton growing and [[medicinal plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Status of Database |publisher=Central Asia and Caucasus Institute |url=http://www.cac-biodiversity.org/aze/aze_database.htm |accessdate=28 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320100930/http://www.cac-biodiversity.org/aze/aze_database.htm |archivedate=20 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some lands it is profitable to grow grain, potatoes, [[sugar beet]]s, cotton and tobacco. Livestock, [[dairy product]]s, and wine and [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] are also important farm products. The Caspian [[fishing industry]] is concentrated on the dwindling stocks of [[sturgeon]] and [[Beluga (sturgeon)|beluga]].

Some portions of most products that were previously imported from abroad have begun to be produced locally (among them are Coca-Cola by Coca-Cola Bottlers LTD, beer by Baki-Kastel, parquet by Nehir and oil pipes by EUPEC Pipe Coating Azerbaijan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry |publisher=Statistical Yearbook of Azerbaijan 2004 |url=http://www.azstat.org/publications/yearbook/SYA2004/Pdf/18en.pdf |accessdate=2007-05-26 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202100114/http://www.azstat.org/publications/yearbook/SYA2004/Pdf/18en.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New program which is prepared by the Europe Union is aimed to support economic diversification of Azerbaijan. Program is considered for southern region Lankaran which has the lowest economic indicator and the lowest income per capita, as well as, the lowest level of investment, but at the same time, high potential for the production of garden products in high quality.

===Manufacturing===
[[File:Parad 878.jpg|thumb|[[Marauder (vehicle)|Marauder (Mine Protected Vehicle)]] is manufactured in Azerbaijan.]]
In 2007, mining and hydrocarbon industries accounted for well over 95 per cent of the Azerbaijani economy.

===Services===

====Financial and business services====
{{Main|Banking in Azerbaijan}}
The [[Economic growth|GDP growth rates]] observed in Azerbaijan during last years made the country one of the fastest growing economies in the world. But the banking sector of Azerbaijan has yet to tap the vast growth potential that should be achievable due to the continuation of the high economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ bank report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-best-of-both-worlds.com/support-files/azerbaijan-banking-sector-2007.pdf |archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20111208101741/http://www.the-best-of-both-worlds.com/support-files/azerbaijan-banking-sector-2007.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 December 2011 |title=Azerbaijan Banking System: An Overview July 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason the banking sector remains small in relation to the size of the Azerbaijani economy. Since 2002, important stages of [[restructuring]] of the banking system have started to be carried out. Taking into consideration entry of big oil revenues in the country, as a logical result of successful oil strategy, and in this base, as the banks were ready to an effective transfer of their financial resources to the strategic goals, development strategy was made for 2002–2005.

By 1 April 2010, 47 banks, 631 bank branches function in Azerbaijan. One of banks was founded with participation of state capital, 23 of foreign capital. To the same date, 98 non-bank credit organizations operate in the republic along with banks. Growth of real money incomes of population, development of trust in bank system, improving the legal bases of protection of interests of creditors and depositors, in particular launch of ‘Deposits Insurance Fund’ were the criteria characterizing rapid growth of deposits of population. As of 1 April 2010, [[bank deposit]]s of population were equal to 2,4 billion AZN. 33,3% of them were long-term deposits (higher than a year). As of 1 April 2010, bank credits to customers is 8.5 bn AZN, which makes 70.5% of bank assets. Special weight of private sector in structure of credit investments is higher than 82% (7 bn AZN).&lt;ref name=&quot;AZ bank&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Azerbaijan – General Information| publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Economy/_BankSystem/_bankSystem_e.html| accessdate = 22 May 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129101306/http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Economy/_BankSystem/_bankSystem_e.html| archive-date = 29 January 2017| url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Telecommunications====
{{Main|Communications in Azerbaijan}}

In the 21st century, a new oil and gas boom helped to improve the situation in the Azerbaijan's science and technology sectors, and the government launched a campaign aimed at modernization and [[List of Azerbaijani inventions and discoveries|innovation]]. The government estimates that profits from the information technology and communication industry will grow and become comparable with those from oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan aims for hi-tech state|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/11/26/azerbaijan-aims-for-hi-tech-state/|publisher=[[Euronews]]|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azerbaijan has a large and steadily growing [[Internet]] sector, mostly uninfluenced by the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]]; rapid growth is forecast for at least five more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan is in TOP 10 of countries showing dynamic growth in Internet and mobile communications penetration|url=http://www.bakutel.az/2012/?p=news__read&amp;t=top&amp;q=55&amp;l=en|work=bakutel.az|accessdate=15 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507054828/http://www.bakutel.az/2012/?p=news__read&amp;t=top&amp;q=55&amp;l=en|archivedate=7 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has also been making progress in developing its telecoms sector. The Ministry of Communications &amp; Information Technologies (MCIT), as well as being an operator through its role in Aztelekom, is both a policy-maker and regulator. Public pay phones are available for local calls and require the purchase of a token from the telephone exchange or some shops and kiosks. Tokens allow a call of indefinite duration. As of 2009, there were 1,397,000 main [[telephone line]]s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2150rank.html CIA.gov], CIA World Factbook Telephones – main lines in use, Azerbaijan 1,397,000 main lines&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,485,000 internet users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2153rank.html CIA.gov], CIA World Factbook Internet users, Azerbaijan Internet users: 1,485,000.&lt;/ref&gt; There are five [[GSM]] providers: [[Azercell]], [[Bakcell]], Azerfon ([[Nar Mobile]]), [[Aztrank]], [[Catel]] [[mobile network operator]]s and one [[CDMA]].

Tourism is an important part of the economy of Azerbaijan. The country was a well-known tourist spot in the 1980s. However, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] during the 1988-1994 period, damaged the tourist industry and the image of Azerbaijan as a tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/baku/27857 |title=Rapid Tourism Assessment for the Azerbaijan Tourism Sector Development Program - Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 2000s that the tourism industry began to recover, and the country has since experienced a high rate of growth in the number of tourist visits and overnight stays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azadliq.org/content/article/388501.html Azərbaycan Qarabağın turizm imkanlarını təbliğ edir] {{in lang|az}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the recent years, Azerbaijan has also becoming a popular destination for religious, spa, and health care tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baku Boom Has Yet to Hit Regions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ismayilov |first=Rovshan |title=Azerbaijan: Baku Boom Has Yet to Hit Regions |publisher=EurasiaNet |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav081307.shtml |accessdate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819211953/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav081307.shtml |archivedate=19 August 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; During winter, the [[Shahdag Winter Complex]] offers skiing.

The [[List of Formula One Grands Prix|Formula One Grand Prix]] is held in [[Baku]], the capital city and has been held here for years.

==Currency system==
{{See also|Azerbaijani manat}}
The [[Azerbaijani manat]] is the currency of Azerbaijani, denominated as the [[Azerbaijani manat|manat]], subdivided into 100 [[Azerbaijani manat|qapik]]. The manat is issued by the [[Central Bank of Azerbaijan]], the monetary authority of Azerbaijan. The [[ISO 4217]] abbreviation is AZN. The Latinised symbol is ([[File:Azeri manat symbol.svg|13px]]).

The manat is held in a floating [[exchange-rate]] system managed primarily against the [[US dollar]]. The [[Exchange rate|rate of exchange]] (Azerbaijani manat per US$1) for 28 January 2016, was AZN 1.60.

There is a complex relationship between Azerbaijan's [[balance of trade]], inflation, measured by the [[consumer price index]] and the value of its currency. Despite allowing the value of the manat to &quot;float&quot;, Azerbaijan's [[central bank]] has decisive ability to control its value with relationship to other currencies.

The president appointed the [[State Customs Committee (Azerbaijan)|State Customs Committee]] as the leading body of controlling goods and transportation passing through the borders of the country in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

A &quot;single authority principle&quot; requires customs officials to be more responsible in dealing with all types of border control operations for other authorities. [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] and [[Sweden]] were the countries of which practice studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; A &quot;single system&quot; works on and then shares standardized information accumulated from traders to all entities taking part in international trade. The practice of [[United States|US]] was explored in this phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; An &quot;automated system&quot; provides a single electronic statement to responsible agencies submitted by traders to be worked on and confirmed, and after that, these authorities send electronic confirmations and announcements. In this case, practice of [[Mauritius]] and [[Singapore]] was studied.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

[[State Customs Committee (Azerbaijan)|The Customs Committee]] formed a commission to realize the new system. [[Ministry of Agriculture (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Agriculture]], [[Ministry of Healthcare (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Healthcare]], [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]], [[Ministry of Taxes (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Taxes]], [[Ministry of Transportation (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Transportation]], [[Central Bank of Azerbaijan|Central Bank]], State Road Police, State Committee for Standardization, Metrology and Patents, State Maritime Administration were selected as important agencies to implement single window system along with the State Customs Committee. The government supported Customs Committee in preparing its staff to deal with the new system by improving recruitment of local customs offices, providing with software and hardware upgrades for the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

Azerbaijani government supports financially single window system. In the first phase, the government realized customs clearance system on the process of border crossing to country beginning from January 1, 2009. This system was free to all users. Then it was expanded to Baku and Sumgayit in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Customs code of the Republic of Azerbaijan was amended based on the inclusion of the article on single window system which became operative on January 1, 2012. After this amendment, all of Azerbaijan's 29 customs checkpoints started to implement new single window system.

According to the Presidential Decree (11 November 2008), “single window” principle started to be applied from 1 January 2009 on the inspection of goods and transportation at the border checkpoints.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://customs.gov.az/az/faydali/innovativ-layiheler/bir-pencere/|title=Single-window: Decree of the President of Azerbaijan (11 November 2008)|last=|first=|date=|website=customs.gov.az|language=Azerbaijani|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customs Committee established a commission working on the implementation of “single window” principle in customs agencies on 18 November 2008 based on the Presidential Decree of 11 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://customs.gov.az/az/faydali/innovativ-layiheler/bir-pencere/|title=Single-window: About the establishment of the commission|website=customs.gov.az|language=Azerbaijani|archive-url=http://customs.gov.az/en/faydali/innovativ-layiheler/bir-pencere/|archive-date=2017-10-04|url-status=|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technological scheme determining the sequence of issuance of “permit” certificates was approved by the Customs Committee on 22 December 2009.

==Business environment==
