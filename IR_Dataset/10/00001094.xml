Until independence, [[Armenia]]'s economy was based largely on [[industry]]—[[Chemical substance|chemicals]], [[electronics|electronic products]], [[machinery]], [[processed food]], [[synthetic rubber]] and [[textiles]]; it was highly dependent on outside resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html|title=Middle East :: Armenia — The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2019-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenian mines produce [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[gold]] and [[lead]]. The vast majority of energy is produced with imported fuel from Russia, including gas and nuclear fuel for Armenia's [[Armenian Nuclear Power Plant|Metsamor nuclear power plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=Armenia-energy-sector|title=Armenia - Energy Sector {{!}} export.gov|website=www.export.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small amounts of coal, gas and petroleum have not yet been developed.

Armenia's severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international aid, [[remittances]] from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct investment. Economic ties with Russia remain close, especially in the energy sector.

The former government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been more difficult to implement in the period when [[Republican Party of Armenia]] was in power. This is expected to change after the [[2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution|2018 Armenian revolution]].

==Overview==
Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a modern industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. The agricultural sector has long-term needs for more investment and updated technology. Armenia is a food importer, and its [[mineral]] deposits ([[gold]] and [[bauxite]]) are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (which was part of Soviet Azerbaijan) and the breakup of the centrally directed [[economic system]] of the former Soviet Union contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s.

==History of the modern Armenian economy==
At the beginning of the 20th century, the territory of present-day Armenia was a backward agricultural region with some [[copper]] mining and [[cognac]] production. From 1914 through 1921, Caucasian Armenia suffered from war, revolution, the influx of refugees from Turkish Armenia, disease, hunger and economic misery. About 200,000 people died in 1919 alone. At that point, only American relief efforts saved Armenia from total collapse.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}

[[File:Trans-100millones-rev.jpg|thumbnail|100 million rubles banknote]]

The first Soviet Armenian government regulated economic activity stringently, nationalising all economic enterprises, requisitioning [[grain]] from peasants, and suppressing most private market activity. This first experiment of state control ended with the advent of Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) of 1921&amp;ndash;27. This policy continued state control of the large enterprises and banks, but peasants could market much of their grain, and small businesses could function. In Armenia, the NEP years brought partial recovery from the economic disaster of the post-World War I period. By 1926 agricultural production in Armenia had reached nearly three-quarters of its prewar level.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}

By the end of the 1920s, Stalin's regime had revoked the NEP and reestablished the state monopoly on all economic activity. Once this occurred, the main goal of the Soviet economic policy in Armenia was to turn a predominantly agrarian and rural republic into an industrial and urban one. Among other restrictions, peasants now were forced to sell nearly all of their output to state procurement agencies rather than at the market. From the 1930s through the 1960s, an industrial infrastructure has been constructed. Besides hydroelectric plants and canals, roads were built and gas pipelines were laid to bring fuel and food from Azerbaijan and Russia.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42}}

The Stalinist command economy, in which market forces were suppressed and all orders for production and distribution came from the state authorities, survived in all its essential features until the fall of the Soviet regime in 1991. In the early stages of the communist economic revolution, Armenia underwent a fundamental transformation into a &quot;proletarian&quot; society. Between 1929 and 1939, the percentage of Armenia's work force categorised as industrial workers grew from 13% to 31%. By 1935 industry supplied 62% of Armenia's economic production. Highly integrated and sheltered within artificial barter economy of the Soviet system from the 1930s until the end of the communist era, the Armenian economy showed few signs of self-sufficiency at any time during that period. In 1988 Armenia produced only 0.9% of the [[net material product]] of the Soviet Union (1.2% of industry, 0.7% of agriculture). The republic retained 1.4% of total state budget revenue, delivered 63.7% of its NMP to other republics, and exported only 1.4% of what it produced to markets outside the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=42&amp;ndash;43}}

[[Agriculture]] accounted for only 20% of net material product and 10% of employment before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Armenia's industry was especially dependent on the Soviet military-industrial complex. About 40% of all enterprises in the republic were devoted to defense, and some factories lost 60% to 80% of their business in the last years of the Soviet Union, when massive cuts were made in the national defense expenditures. As the republic's economy faced the prospects of competing in world markets in the mid 1990s, the great liabilities of Armenia's industry were its outdated equipment and infrastructure and the pollution emitted by many of the country's heavy industrial plants.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=43}}

In 1991, Armenia's last year as a Soviet republic, national income fell 12% from the previous year, while per capita gross national product was 4,920 rubles, only 68% of the Soviet average. In large part due to the earthquake of 1988, the Azerbaijani blockade that began in 1989 and the collapse of the international trading system of the Soviet Union, the Armenian economy of the early 1990s remained far below its 1980 production levels. In the first years of independence (1992&amp;ndash;93), inflation was extremely high, productivity and national income dropped dramatically, and the national budget ran large deficits.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=41}}

===Post-communist economic reform===
Armenia introduced elements of the free market and privatisation into their economic system in the late 1980s, when [[Mikhail Gorbachov]] began advocating economic reform. Cooperatives were set up in the service sector, particularly in restaurants, although substantial resistance came from the [[Communist Party of Armenia (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Armenia]] (CPA) and other groups that had enjoyed privileged position in the old economy. In the late 1980s, much of Armenia's economy already was opening either semi-officially or illegally, with widespread [[corruption]] and [[bribery]]. The so-called mafia, made up of interconnected groups of powerful officials and their relatives and friends, sabotaged the efforts of reformers to create a lawful market system. When the December 1988 earthquake brought millions of dollars of foreign aid to the devastated regions of Armenia, much of the money went to corrupt and criminal elements.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=48&amp;ndash;50}}

Beginning in 1991, the democratically elected government pushed vigorously for privatisation and market relations, although its efforts were frustrated by the old ways of doing business in Armenia, the Azerbaijani blockade, and the costs of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. In 1992, the Law on the Programme of Privatisation and Decentralisation of Incompletely Constructed Facilities established a state privatisation committee, with members from all political parties. In middle 1993, the committee announced a two-year privatisation programme, whose first stage would be privatisation of 30% of state enterprises, mostly services and light industries. The remaining 70%, including many bankrupt, nonfunctional enterprises, were to be privatised in a later stage with a minimum of government restriction, to encourage private initiative. For all enterprises, the workers would receive 20% of their firm's property free of charge; 30% would be distributed to all citizens by means of vouchers; and the remaining 50% was to be distributed by the government, with preference given to members of the labour organisations. A major problem of this system, however, was the lack of supporting legislation covering foreign investment protection, bankruptcy, monopoly policy, and consumer protection.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}

In the first post-communist years, efforts to interest foreign investors in joint enterprises were only moderately successful because of the blockade and the energy shortage. Only in late 1993 was a department of foreign investment established in the [[Ministry of Economy (Armenia)|Ministry of Economy]], to spread information about Armenia's investment opportunities and improve the legal infrastructure for investment activity. A specific goal of this agency was creating a market for scientific and technical intellectual property.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}

A few Armenians living abroad made large-scale investments. Besides a toy factory and construction projects, diaspora Armenians built a cold storage plant (which in its first years had little produce to store) and established the [[American University of Armenia]] in Yerevan to teach the techniques necessary to run a market economy.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50}}

Armenia was admitted to the [[International Monetary Fund]] in May 1992 and to the [[World Bank]] in September. A year later, the government complained that those organisations were holding back financial assistance and announced its intention to move toward fuller price liberalisation, and the removal of all [[tariff]]s, quotas, and restrictions of foreign trade. Although privatisation had slowed because of catastrophic collapse of the economy, Prime Minister [[Hrant Bagratyan]] informed the United States officials in the fall of 1993 that plans had been made to embark on a renewed privatisation programme by the end of the year.{{sfn|Curtis|1995|p=50&amp;ndash;51}}

Like other former states, Armenia's economy suffers from the legacy of a centrally [[planned economy]] and the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Spitak earthquake|1988 earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. Although a cease-fire has held since 1994, the conflict with [[Azerbaijan]] over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] has not been resolved. The consequent blockade along both the Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because of Armenia's dependence on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Azerbaijan and Turkey are closed; routes through Georgia and Iran are adequate and reliable. In 1992-93, the GDP had fallen nearly 60% from its 1989 level. The national currency, the [[Armenian dram|dram]], suffered [[hyperinflation]] for the first few years after its introduction in 1993.

Armenia has registered strong economic growth since 1995 and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious stone processing and jewelry making and communication technology (primarily [[Armenia Telephone Company|Armentel]], which is left from the USSR era and is owned by external investors). This steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], EBRD, as well as other international financial institutions (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Total loans extended to Armenia since 1993 exceed [[USD|$]]800 million. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the local currency; developing private businesses; energy; the agriculture, food processing, transportation, and health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation work in the [[earthquake zone]].

By 1994, however, the Armenian government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic liberalization program that resulted in positive growth rates in 1995-2005. Armenia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in January 2003. Armenia also has managed to slash inflation, stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Armenia's unemployment rate, however, remains high, despite strong economic growth.

The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in the early and mid-1990s have been offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at [[Metsamor]]. Armenia is now a net energy exporter, although it does not have sufficient generating capacity to replace [[Armenian Nuclear Power Plant|Metsamor]], which is under international pressure to close. The electricity distribution system was [[privatized]] in 2002.

===Mining===
{{main|Mining in Armenia}}
In 2017 mining industry output with grew by 14.2% to 172 billion AMD at current prices and run at 3.1% of Armenia's GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/article/sv_01_18a_112.pdf|title=Armenian 2017 GDP breakdown by sector - Armstat (am)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 mineral product (without precious metals and stones) exports grew by 46.9% and run at US$692 million, which comprised 30.1% of all exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;2017trade&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/article/sv_12_17r_411.pdf|title=Armenian 2017 foreign trade summary - Armstat (ru)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction sector===
Real estate transactions count grew by 36% in September 2019 compared to September 2018. Also, the average market value of one square meter of housing in apartment buildings in Yerevan in September 2019 grew by 10.8% from September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/business/some_15_572_real_estate_transactions_effected_in_armenia_in_2019_september_by_36_1_more_than_in_sept/|title=Some 15,572 real estate transactions effected in Armenia in 2019 September, by 36.1% more than in September 2018|website=arka.am|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 construction output increased by 2.2% reaching 416 billion AMD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstat-2018.01.25-en&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/doc/99506853.pdf|title=PRELIMINARY MAIN MACRO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS of Armenian Economy in 2017 by Armstat|accessdate=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia experienced a construction boom during the latter part of the 2000s.  According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's booming construction sector generated about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP during the first eight months of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Sept-20-2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2007/09/ac00c04d-a570-479a-8d0c-9554e4acb7b6.asp &quot;Armenian Growth Still In Double Digits&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), September 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a World Bank official, 30 percent of Armenia's economy in 2009 came from the construction sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Nov-27-2009&quot; /&gt;

However, during the January to September 2010 period, the sector experienced a 5.2 percent year-on-year decrease, which according to the [[Civilitas Foundation]] is an indication of the unsustainability of a sector based on an elite market, with few products for the median or low budgets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;&gt;{{Armenia in 2010. A Year of Uncertainty}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decrease comes despite the fact that an important component of the government stimulus package was to support the completion of ongoing construction projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

===Energy===
{{main|Energy in Armenia|Electricity sector in Armenia}}
In 2017 electricity generation increased by 6.1% reaching 7.8 billion [[Kilowatt hour|KWh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstat-2018.01.25-en&quot; /&gt;

===Industrial sector===
In 2017 industrial output increased by 12.6% annually reaching 1661 billion AMD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/article/sv_12_17r_03.pdf|title=Armenian economy macro statistics for 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial output was relatively positive throughout 2010, with year-on-year average growth of 10.9 percent in the period January to September 2010, due largely to the mining sector where higher global demand for commodities led to higher prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot; /&gt; According to the National Statistical Service, during the January–August 2007 period, Armenia's [[industrial sector]] was the single largest contributor to the country's GDP, but remained largely stagnant with industrial output increasing only by 1.7 percent per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Sept-20-2007&quot; /&gt; In 2005, Armenia's industrial output (including electricity) made up about 30 percent of GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Feb-10-2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/02/7a425352-3ed4-4b17-a352-e11d38026faa.asp &quot;Government Downplays Economic Cost Of Russian Gas Price Hike&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), February 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Services sector===
In the 2000s, along with the construction sector, the [[services sector]] was the driving force behind Armenia's recent high economic growth rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Sept-20-2007&quot;/&gt;

====Retail trade====
In 2010, retail trade turnover was largely unaltered compared to 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot; /&gt;  The existing monopolies throughout the retail sector have made the sector non-responsive to the crisis and resulted in near zero growth. The aftermath of the crisis has started to shift the structure in the retail sector in favor of food products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot; /&gt;

Nowadays(2019), Armenia has improved standards of living and growing income, which  brought to the improvement of retail sector in Armenia. retail sector has the highest employment level. While the sector improves, currently the major sector is still in Yerevan, and not in the other cities of Armenia.  The development that happened in this sector was the opening of Dalma Garden Mall, and later Yerevan mall and Rio mall, which dramatically increased the quality of retail in Yerevan. Currently there is a new development, as in [[Gyumri]] there is a new mall opened called Shirak Mall. Another reason for the development of the retail is the development that happened in the banking industry. Today people can easily get financial assistance from the banks right to their credit cards, without visiting the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evconsulting.com/sites/default/files/ArmInvestMap_2018new_1.pdf|title=Armenia Investment Map, Oct. 2018|website=EV Consulting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Information and Communication Technologies====
{{see also|Science and technology in Armenia}}As of February 2019 nearly 23 thousand employees were counted in ICT sector.  With 404 thousand AMD they enjoyed highest pay rate among surveyed sectors of economy.  Average salaries in pure IT sector (excluding communications sub-sector) stood at 582 thousand AMD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armstat.am/file/article/sv_03_19r_142.pdf|title=Armstat - Оплата труда и численность работников|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tourism====
{{main|Tourism in Armenia}}
Tourism in Armenia has been a key sector to the [[Armenian economy]] since the 1990s when tourist numbers exceeded half a million people visiting the country every year (mostly ethnic [[Armenians]] from the [[Armenian diaspora|Diaspora]]). The Armenian Ministry of Economy reports that most international tourists come from [[Russia]], [[European Union|EU]] states, the [[United States]] and [[Iran]]. Though relatively small in size, Armenia has four [[List of World Heritage Sites in Armenia|UNESCO world heritage]] sites.

Despite internal and external problems, the number of incoming tourists has been continually increasing. 2018 saw a record high of over 1.6 million inbound tourists.

In 2018 receipts from international tourism amounted to $1.2 billion, nearly twice the value for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152|title=International Tourism Highlights, 2019 Edition|website=www.e-unwto.org|doi=10.18111/9789284421152|access-date=2019-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In per capita terms these stood at $413, ahead of Turkey and Azerbaijan, but behind Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://i.redd.it/i8xqp7h4hix31.jpg|title=Map of international tourism receipts per capita in Europe in 2018.|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019 the largest growth at 27.2% was shown by accommodation and catering sector, which came as a result of the growth of tourist flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/economy/armenian_premier_largest_growth_in_2019_shown_by_accommodation_and_catering_27_2/|title=Armenian premier: Largest growth in 2019 shown by accommodation and catering - 27.2%|website=arka.am|access-date=2020-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural sector===
{{main|Agriculture in Armenia}}
As of 2010, the [[agricultural sector|agricultural production]] comprises on average 25 percent of Armenia's GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; In 2006, the agricultural sector accounted for about 20 percent of Armenia's GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug-8-2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/08/218f6eeb-de6f-47e4-970e-dba7583d7d39.asp &quot;Kocharian Orders Tax Exemption For Armenian Farmers&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia's agricultural output dropped by 17.9 percent in the period of January–September 2010.  This was owing to bad weather, a lack of a government stimulus package, and the continuing effects of decreased [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] by the Armenian government (per WTO requirements).&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt; In addition, the share of agriculture in Armenia's GDP hovered around 17.9% until 2012 according to the World Bank. Then already in 2013 the share of it was a bit higher comprising 18.43%. Afterwards a declining trend was registered in the period of 2013-2017 reaching to around 14.90% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Armenia/Share_of_agriculture/&lt;/ref&gt; By comparing the share of agriculture as a component of GDP with the neighboring countries (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Iran) one can notice that the percentage is highest for Armenia. As of 2017 the contribution of agriculture to the GDP for the neighboring countries was 6.88, 5.63, 6.08 and 9.05 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/Share_of_agriculture/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2019, the Armenian government planned to obtain about $490 million in fresh loans rising public debt to about $7.5 billion. Just over $6.9 billion of that would be the government's debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azatutyun.am/a/29677662.html|title=Armenia's Public Debt To Rise Further In 2019|website=«Ազատ Եվրոպա/Ազատություն» ռադիոկայան|language=hy|access-date=2019-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reaching nearly 60.0 per cent of GDP, the public debt to GDP ratio decreased by approximately three percentage points in 2018 compared with a year before and stood at 55.7 per cent at the end of 2018.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://2019.tr-ebrd.com/countries/|title=Countries {{!}} Transition Report 2019|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's public debt at the end of 2019 stood at $6.94 billion, making 50.3% of its GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/economy/in_2019_armenia_s_public_debt_to_make_50_3_of_its_gdp_/|title=In 2019 Armenia's public debt to make 50.3% of its GDP|website=arka.am|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2019, sovereign debt comprised $5488 million, $86.5 million (about 2%) less than a year ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://factor.am/150275.html|title=ՀՀ պետական պարտքը նվազել է 86.5 մլն դոլարով|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources quote Armenia's debt at $10.8 billion in September 2018, possibly including non-public debt too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/armenia/external-debt|title=Armenia External Debt [2002 - 2019] [Data &amp; Charts]|website=www.ceicdata.com|access-date=2019-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 55.7% down from 58.7% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/armenia/government-debt--of-nominal-gdp|title=Armenia Government Debt: % of GDP [2002 - 2019] [Data &amp; Charts]|website=www.ceicdata.com|access-date=2019-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia revised the country's fiscal rules in 2018, setting a permissible threshold for public debt in the amount of 40, 50 and 60% of GDP. At the same time, it established that in case of force majeure situations such as natural disasters, wars, the government will be allowed to exceed this threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.finport.am/full_news.php?id=37976&amp;lang=3|title=Vardan Aramyan: It will be unreasonable if the government goes to revise the allowable national debt ceiling in GDP {{!}} Finport.am|website=www.finport.am|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The debt rose by $863.5 million in 2016 and by another $832.5 million in 2017. It totalled just $1.9 billion before the 2008-2009 (13.5% of GDP) global financial crisis that plunged the county into a severe recession.&lt;ref name=&quot;:8&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot; /&gt;

=== Inflation ===
For 2019, IMF forecasts inflation at 1.7%, which is below all neighbouring countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PCPIPCH@WEO/MECA/ARM|title=Inflation rate, average consumer prices - Annual percent change|last=|first=|date=|website=www.imf.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian government projects inflation at 2.7% in 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;:12&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/economy/armenia_s_economy_is_expected_to_see_7_1_growth_in_2019_central_bank_official_says/|title=Armenia's economy is expected to see 7.1% growth in 2019, central bank official says|website=arka.am|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cash remittances===
Cash [[remittances]] sent back home from Armenians working abroad — mostly in Russia and the United States — contribute significantly to Armenia's Gross Domestic Product making up 14% of GDP in 2018. They help Armenia sustain double-digit economic growth and finance its massive trade deficit.

In 2008 transfers reached record high of $2.3 billion. In 2015 they reached 10-year low at $1.6 billion. In 2018 they run at round $1.8 billion.  $0.8 billion were transferred in first half of 2019. According to [[Central Bank of Armenia|CBA]] their impact on economy is decreasing, as GDP grows at outperforming rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ru.armeniasputnik.am/economy/20191105/20994033/Dengi-poluchaemye-perevodami-iz-za-granitsy-ne-vliyayut-na-ekonomiku-strany---TsB-Armenii.html|title=Деньги, получаемые переводами из-за границы, не влияют на экономику страны - ЦБ Армении|website=Sputnik Армения|language=ru|access-date=2019-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Net private transfers decreased in 2009, but saw a continuous increase during the first six months of 2010. Since private transfers from the Diaspora tend to be mostly injected into consumption of imports and not in high value-added sectors, the transfers have not resulted in sizeable increases in productivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot; /&gt;

According to the [[Central Bank of Armenia]], during the first half of 2008, cash remittances sent back to Armenia by Armenians working abroad rose by 57.5 percent and totaled US$668.6 million, equivalent to 15 percent of the country's first-half Gross Domestic Product.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug5-08&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/08/4CC57703-F346-4E3C-8CA4-CD1E571BEC5A.ASP &quot;Cash Transfers To Armenia Jump To New High&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the latter figures only represent cash remittances processed through Armenian commercial banks. According to [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL]], comparable sums are believed to be transferred through non-bank systems, implying that cash remittances make up approximately 30 percent of Armenia's GDP in the first half of 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug5-08&quot; /&gt;

In 2007, cash remittances through bank transfers rose by 37 percent to a record-high level of US$1.32 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaLib-Aug5-08&quot;/&gt; According to the Central Bank of Armenia, in 2005, cash remittances from Armenians working abroad reached a record-high level of $1 billion, which is worth more than one fifth of the country's 2005 GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-9-2006&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/02/70759614-25c5-449b-8ed9-91ac340adc17.asp &quot;Survey Highlights Armenia’s Lingering Unemployment&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), February 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banking ===
{{main|List of banks in Armenia}}
The central bank has set additional capital buffers in the banking sector. In force since April 2019, the regulator set three buffers exceeding the current capital adequacy requirement compliant with the Basel III regulation: a capital conservation buffer, a counter-cyclical capital buffer and a systemic risk buffer. Full implementation of the buffers over the course of the next few years will strengthen the financial sector's resistance to economic shocks and help increase the efficiency of macroprudential policies.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;

Armenian banks' lending grew by 10 percent in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arka.am/en/news/business/armenian_banks_lending_in_2019_grows_by_10_percent_to_3_572_trillion_drams/|title=Armenian banks' lending in 2019 grows by 10 percent to 3.572 trillion. drams|website=arka.am|access-date=2020-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government revenues and taxation==
===Government revenues===
In August 2019 [[Moody's Investors Service]] upgraded Armenia to Ba3 rating with stable outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-upgrades-Armenias-rating-to-Ba3-changes-outlook-to-stable--PR_404870|title=Moody's upgrades Armenia's rating to Ba3; changes outlook to stable from positive|date=2019-08-27|website=Moodys.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the National Statistical Service, Armenia's government debt stood at AMD 3.1 trillion (about $6,4 billion, including $5,1 billion of external debt) as of November 30, 2017. Armenia's debt-to-GDP ratio will drop by 1% in 2018 according to finance minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/250628/|title=Armenia debt-to-GDP ratio to drop 1% in 2018, minister says|work=PanARMENIAN.Net|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Armenia's external debt ($5.5 billion as of January 1, 2018), the arrears for multi-country credit programs dominate - 66.2% or $3.6 billion, followed by debt on bilateral loan programs - 17.5% or $958.9  million and investments of non-residents in Armenian Eurobonds -  15,4% or $844.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://finport.am/full_news.php?id=33971&amp;lang=3|title=Armenia's external debt is mainly concentrated on loans of international financial organizations {{!}} Finport.am|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===

==== Employee income tax ====
From January 1, 2020, Armenia will switch to a flat income taxation system, which, regardless of the amount will tax wages at 23%. Moreover, until 2023 the taxation rate will gradually decrease from 23% to 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://finport.am/full_news.php?id=38733&amp;lang=3|title=Armenian parliament adopted amendments to Tax Code: changes are aimed at improving the competitiveness of the national economy {{!}} Finport.am|website=finport.am|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Corporate income tax ====
The reform adopted in June 2019, aims to boost medium-term economic activity and to increase tax compliance. Among other measures, the corporate income tax was reduced by two percentage points to 18.0 per cent and the tax on dividends for non-resident organisations halved to 5.0 per cent.&lt;ref name=&quot;:13&quot; /&gt;

====Special taxation for small business====
From January 1, 2020, the republic will abandon two alternative tax systems - self-employed and family entrepreneurship. They will be replaced by micro-entrepreneurship with a non-taxable threshold of up to 24 million drams. Business entities that carry out specialized activities, in particular, accounting, advocacy, and consulting will not be considered as micro-business entities. Micro business will be exempted from all types of taxes other than income tax, which will be 5 thousand drams per employee.&lt;ref name=&quot;:11&quot; /&gt;

====Value-added tax====
Over half of the tax revenues in the January–August 2008 time period were generated from [[value-added tax]]es (VAT) of 20%. By comparison, corporate profit tax generated less than 16 percent of the revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008-Tax&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/10/A7925A64-775F-40AF-99A4-8B22C65C89C8.ASP &quot;Government Keeps Up Strong Growth In Tax Revenues&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), October 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that tax collection in Armenia is improving at the expense of ordinary citizens, rather than wealthy citizens (who have been the main beneficiaries of Armenia's double-digit economic growth in recent years).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008-Tax&quot; /&gt;

Geographical location of the country and relatively low electricity costs are comparative advantages supporting to boost the production of the textile and leather products in Armenia. Proximity to Europe in comparison with manufacturers in East Asia creates opportunity to strengthen Armenia's position as contract manufacturing destination for European brands. Foreign companies that put orders to Armenian companies are mainly famous European brands, particularly, from Italy (La Perla, SARTIS, VERSACE etc.) and Germany (LEBEK International Fashion, KUBLER Bekliedungswerk). With the Armenia's entry into Eurasian Economic Commission, the opportunity to increase its presence with textile and leather production raised also in the countries of Eurasian Economic Commission as no customs duty applies to Armenian products in the export markets within the customs union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://evconsulting.com/sites/default/files/ArmInvestMap_2018new_1.pdf|title=Armenia Investment Map|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the study [http://www.aea.am/files/papers/w1103.pdf REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF ARMENIA: PERSPECTIVES AND POTENTIALS] authors investigated the trade potential of [[Armenia]] for different product groups by employing a [[Gravity model of trade|gravity model]] of trade approach. The study explored Armenia's trade flows to 139 countries for the period of 2003 to 2007. According to the results of the paper, the authors concluded that &quot;Armenia has exceeded its export potential almost with all the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS countries]]&quot;. In addition, the authors concluded that the most perspective product groups of Armenian export tend to be &quot;Industrial products&quot;, &quot;Food and beverages&quot; and &quot;Consumer goods&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aea.am/files/papers/w1103.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the paper “The effects of exchange rate volatility on exports: evidence from Armenia” analyzes the effect of Armenian floating exchange rate regime and exchange rate volatility on Armenian exports to Russia. According to the paper exchange rate volatility has long-run and short-run negative effects on exports.

Meanwhile, exports to Russia, Germany, USA and UAE dropped.

====Imports====
In 2017 Armenia imported $3.96B, making it the 133rd largest importer in the world. During the last five years the imports of Armenia have decreased at an annualized rate of -1.2%, from $3.82B in 2012 to $3.96B in 2017. The most recent imports are led by Petroleum Gas which represent 8.21% of the total imports of Armenia, followed by Refined Petroleum, which account for 5.46%. Armenia's main imports are oil, natural gas, cereals, rubber manufactures, cork and wood, and electrical machinery. Armenia's main imports partners are Russia, China, Ukraine, Iran, Germany, Italy, Turkey, France and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/arm/#Imports&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign aid===
====United States====
The [[Armenian government]] receives [[foreign aid]] from the government of the United States through the [[United States Agency for International Development]] and the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]].

On March 27, 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $235.65 million compact with the Government of Armenia. The single stated goal of the &quot;Armenian Compact&quot; is &quot;the reduction of rural poverty through a sustainable increase in the economic performance of the agricultural sector.&quot; The compact includes a $67 million to rehabilitate up to 943 kilometers of rural roads, more than a third of Armenia's proposed &quot;Lifeline road network&quot;. The Compact also includes a $146 million project to increase the productivity of approximately 250,000 farm households through improved water supply, higher yields, higher-value crops, and a more competitive agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;MCC-AM-FactSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.mcc.gov/documents/factsheet-032706-armenia.pdf &quot;Armenia and Millennium Challenge Corporation: Building a Dynamic Partnership for Poverty Reduction through Economic Growth&quot;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514221214/http://www.mcc.gov/documents/factsheet-032706-armenia.pdf |date=May 14, 2009 }}, Millennium Challenge Corporation, March 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the volume of US assistance to Armenia remained near 2009 levels; however, longer-term decline continued. The original Millennium Challenge Account commitment for $235 million had been reduced to about $175 million due to Armenia's poor governance record. Thus, the MCC would not complete road construction. Instead, the irrigated agriculture project was headed for completion with apparently no prospects for extension beyond 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

On May 8, 2019, conditioned with the political events in Armenia since April 2018, United States Agency for International Development signed an extension of U.S.-Armenia bilateral agreement in the area of governance and public administration, which would add additional US$8.5 million to the agreement. By signing another document on the same day, USAID increased the aid by additional US$7.5 million in support for more competitive and diversified private sector in Armenia. The financial allocations will be directed to the financing of the USAID-funded project in infrastructures, agriculture, tourism․ After the signing of the new bilateral agreements, the total amount of the U.S. grants to Armenia amounted to around US$81 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Deputy Prime Minister Mher Grigoryan receives USAID Deputy Assistant Administrator |url=http://www.gov.am/en/news/item/9483/ |website=The Government of the Republic of Armenia |accessdate=12 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Հայաստանն ԱՄՆ-ից լրացուցիչ կտրամադրի 7,449,000 ԱՄՆ դոլարի չափով ֆինանսական հատկացում |url=http://mineconomy.am/hy/1243 |website=MINISTRY OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF ARMENIA |accessdate=12 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====
According to the agreement signed in 2020 EU will provide Armenia with 65 million euros for implementation of three programs in such areas as energy efficiency, environment and community development and formation of tools for implementation of the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement.

With curtailment of the MCC funding, the European Union may replace the US as Armenia's chief source of foreign aid for the first time since independence. From 2011 to 2013, the European Union is expected to advance at least €157.3 million ($208 million) in aid to Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot; /&gt;

Following the advice of economic advisers who cautioned Armenia's leadership against the consolidation of economic power in the hands of a few, in January 2001, the Government of Armenia established the [http://www.competition.am/?lng=2 State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition]. Its members cannot be dismissed by the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Jan-4-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=2724 ''Competitive Edge: The pitfalls of monopolies, and the challenges of a business-influenced parliament''], ArmeniaNow.com, January 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign trade facilitation===
In June 2011, Armenia adopted a Law on Free Economic Zones (FEZ), and developed several key regulations at the end of 2011 to attract foreign investments into FEZs: exemptions from VAT (value added tax), profit tax, customs duties, and property tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Dept&quot;/&gt;

The “Alliance” FEZ was opened in August 2013, and currently has nine businesses taking advantage of its facilities. The focus of “Alliance” FEZ is on high-tech industries which include information and communication technologies, electronics, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, architecture and engineering, industrial design and alternative energy. In 2014 the government expanded operations in the Alliance FEZ to include industrial production as long as there is no similar production already occurring in Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Dept&quot;/&gt;

In 2015, another “Meridian” FEZ, focused on jewelry production, watch-making, and diamond-cutting opened in Yerevan, with six businesses operating in it. The investment programs for these companies must still be approved by government.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Dept&quot;/&gt;

The Armenian Government approved the program to construct the Meghri free economic zone at the border with Iran, which is expected to open in 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;State Dept&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/investmentclimatestatements/index.htm?year=2017&amp;dlid=269872|title=Investment Climate Statements for 2017|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-17}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one analyst, Armenia's economic system in 2008 was [[anticompetitive]] due to the structure of the economy being a type of &quot;[[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]]&quot;. &quot;The result is the prices with us do not drop even if they do on international market, or they do quite belated and not to the size of the international market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Nov-14-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=3382&amp;CID=3245&amp;IID=1209&amp;lng=eng ''Price Predictions: With present inflation at nearly triple expectation, economists challenge 2009 forecast''], ArmeniaNow.com, November 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2008 estimate of a former [[Prime Minister of Armenia|prime minister]], [[Hrant Bagratian]], 55 percent of Armenia's [[GDP]] is controlled by 44 families.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Jan-4-2008&quot; /&gt;

In early 2008, the State Commission for the Protection of Economic Competition named 60 companies having &quot;dominant positions&quot; in Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmeniaNow-Jan-4-2008&quot;/&gt;

In October 2009, when visiting [[Yerevan]], the [[World Bank]]’s managing director, [[Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala]], warned that Armenia will not reach a higher level of development unless its leadership changes the &quot;oligopolistic&quot; structure of the national economy, bolsters the rule of law and shows &quot;zero tolerance&quot; towards corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct-10-2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/content/article/1855547.html Armenia Warned To End ‘Oligopoly’], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]])October 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I think you can only go so far with this economic model,&quot; Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told a news conference in Yerevan. &quot;Armenia is a lower middle-income country. If it wants to become a high-income or upper middle-income country, it can not do so with this kind of economic structure. That is clear.&quot; She also called for a sweeping reform of tax and customs administration, the creation of a &quot;strong and independent judicial system&quot; as well as a tough fight against government corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct-10-2009&quot;/&gt; The warning was echoed by the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Nov-27-2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/content/article/1889521.html &quot;Armenia Learning From Crisis, Says World Bank &quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), November 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Takeover of Armenian industrial property by the Russian state and Russian companies====
Since 2000, the Russian state has acquired several key assets in the energy sector and Soviet-era industrial plants. Property-for-debt or equity-for-debt swaps (acquiring ownership by simply writing off the Armenian government's debts to Russia) are usually the method of acquiring assets. The failure of market reforms, clan-based economics, and official [[corruption in Armenia]] have allowed the success of this process.&lt;ref name=&quot;IASPS-Nov13-02&quot;&gt;Socor, Vladimir. [http://www.iasps.org/strategic/socor12.htm &quot;Armenia's Energy Sector, Other Industrial Assets Passing Under Russia's Control&quot;], ''IASPS Policy Briefings: Oil in Geostrategic Perspective'', November 13, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2002, the Armenian government sold an 80 percent stake in the [[Armenian Electricity Network]] (AEN) to Midland Resources, a British offshore-registered firm which is said to have close Russian connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;IASPS-Nov13-02&quot;/&gt;

In September 2002, the Armenian government handed over Armenia's largest cement factory to the Russian [[ITERA]] gas exporter in payment for its $10 million debt for past gas deliveries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet-May-7-03&quot;&gt;Danielyan, Emil. [http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/business/articles/eav050703.shtml RUSSIA TIGHTENS GRIP ON ARMENIA WITH DEBT AGREEMENTS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813030604/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/business/articles/eav050703.shtml |date=2008-08-13 }}, ''Eurasianet'', May 7, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2002, Armenia transferred control of 5 state enterprises to Russia in an assets-for-debts transaction which settled $100 million of Armenian state debts to Russia. The document was signed for Russia by Prime Minister [[Mikhail Kasyanov]] and Industry Minister [[Ilya Klebanov]], while Prime Minister [[Andranik Markarian]] and National Security Council Secretary [[Serge Sarkisian]] signed for Armenia.&lt;ref name=&quot;IASPS-Nov13-02&quot;/&gt; The five enterprises which passed to 100 percent Russian state ownership are:
* Armenia's largest thermal gas-burning power plant, which is in the town of [[Hrazdan]]
* &quot;Mars&quot; — electronics and robotics plant in Yerevan, a Soviet-era flagship for both civilian and military production
* three research-and-production enterprises — for mathematical machines, for the study of materials, and for automated control equipment — these being Soviet-era military-industrial plants

In January 2003, the Armenian government and [[United Company RUSAL]] signed an investment cooperation agreement, under which United Company RUSAL (which already owned a 76% stake) acquired the Armenian government's remaining 26% share of [[RUSAL ARMENAL]] aluminum foil mill, giving RUSAL 100% ownership of RUSAL ARMENAL.&lt;ref name=&quot;IASPS-Nov13-02&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusal.ru/en/armenal.aspx RUSAL ARMENAL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231191738/http://www.rusal.ru/en/armenal.aspx |date=2015-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2006, the Armenian government handed de facto control of the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline to Russian company [[Gazprom]] and increased Gazprom's stake in the Russian-Armenian company [[ArmRosGazprom]] from 45% to 58% by approving an additional issue of shares worth $119 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;EURA-Nov-3-06&quot;&gt;Socor, Vladimir. [http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2371612 &quot;RUSSIA CEMENTS CONTROL OF ARMENIA’S ENERGY SYSTEM&quot;], ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'', November 3, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913115602/http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2371612 |date=September 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This left the Armenian government with a 32% stake in ArmRosGazprom. The transaction will also help finance ArmRosGazprom's acquisition of the [[Hrazdan Thermal Power Plant|Hrazdan electricity generating plant]]’s fifth power bloc (Hrazdan-5), the leading unit in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;EURA-Nov-3-06&quot;/&gt;

In October 2008 the Russian bank [[Gazprombank]], the banking arm of Gazprom, acquired 100 percent of Armenian bank [[Areximbank]] after previously buying 80 percent of said bank in November 2007 and 94.15 percent in July of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.armenews.com/article.php3?id_article=44934 Gazprombank acquiert entièrement la banque arménienne Areximbank] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005215742/http://www.armenews.com/article.php3?id_article=44934 |date=2008-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017 government transferred natural gas distribution networks in cities [[Meghri]] and [[Agarak, Meghri|Agarak]] to [[Gazprom Armenia]] for cost-free use. Construction of these was funded by foreign aid and costed about 1.3 billion AMD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hetq.am/rus/news/84327/|title=Сеть газоснабжения в Мегри и Агараке безвозмездно передана ЗАО &quot;Газпром-Армения&quot;: предложение о продаже отклонено - Hetq - Новости, статьи и расследования|access-date=2017-12-19|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-transparent deals====
Critics of the [[Robert Kocharyan]] government (in office until 2008) say that the Armenian administration never considered alternative ways of settling the Russian debts. According to economist Eduard Aghajanov, Armenia could have repaid them with low-interest loans from other, presumably Western sources, or with some of its hard currency reserves which then totaled about $450 million. Furthermore, Aghajanov points to the Armenian government's failure to eliminate widespread corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector – abuses that cost Armenia at least $50 million in losses each year, according to one estimate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet-May-7-03&quot;/&gt;

Political observers say that Armenia's economic cooperation with Russia has been one of the least transparent areas of the Armenian government's work. The debt arrangements have been personally negotiated by (then) Defense Minister (and later President) [[Serge Sarkisian]], initially Kocharyan's closest political associate. Other top government officials, including former Prime Minister [[Andranik Markarian]], had little say on the issue. Furthermore, all of the controversial agreements have been announced after Sarkisian's frequent trips to Moscow, without prior public discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet-May-7-03&quot;/&gt;

Finally, while Armenia is not the only ex-Soviet state that has incurred multi-million-dollar debts to Russia over the past decades, it is the only state to have so far given up such a large share of its economic infrastructure to Russia. For example, pro-Western [[Ukraine]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (both of which owe Russia more than Armenia) have managed to reschedule repayment of their debts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eurasianet-May-7-03&quot;/&gt;

==Transportation routes and energy lines==
{{see also|Transport in Armenia}}

===Internal===
Since early 2008, Armenia's entire rail network is managed by the Russian state railway under brand [[South Caucasus Railway]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/10/6B68C3F8-5DCC-4B9B-81E5-C638FEDE172D.ASP &quot;Armenia ‘Pressing Ahead’ With Iran Rail Link&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]], October 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Aug13-2008&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/08/F3509195-D04E-4187-AA45-23B61ACF430F.asp &quot;Armenia Scrambles To Restore Vital Supplies Via Georgia&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Through Georgia===
Russian natural gas reaches Armenia via a pipeline through Georgia.

The only operational rail link into Armenia is from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. During Soviet times, Armenia's rail network connected to Russia's via Georgia through [[Abkhazia]] along the [[Black Sea]]. However, the rail link between Abkhazia and other Georgian regions has been closed for a number of years, forcing Armenia to receive rail cars laden with cargo only through the relatively expensive rail-ferry services operating between Georgian and other Black Sea ports.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008&quot;/&gt;

The Georgian Black Sea ports of [[Batumi]] and [[Poti]] process more than 90 percent of freight shipped to and from landlocked Armenia. The Georgian railway, which runs through the town of Gori in central Georgia, is the main transport link between Armenia and the aforementioned Georgian seaports. Fuel, wheat and other basic commodities are transported to Armenia by rail.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Aug13-2008&quot;/&gt;

Armenia's main rail and road border-crossing with Georgia (at {{coord|41|13|41.97|N|44|50|9.12|E|type:landmark_region:AM|display=inline}}) is at the [[Debed river]] near the Armenian town of [[Bagratashen]] and the Georgian town of [[Sadakhlo]].

The Upper Lars border crossing (at [[Darial Gorge]]) between Georgia and Russia across the [[Caucasus Mountains]] serves as Armenia's sole overland route to the former Soviet Union and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Dec24-2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/content/article/1913022.html &quot;Russia, Georgia Agree To Reopen Border Gate&quot;], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), December 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was controversially shut down by the Russian authorities in June 2006, at the height of a Russian-Georgian spy scandal.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Dec24-2009&quot;/&gt; Upper Lars is the only land border crossing that does not go through Georgia's Russian-backed breakaway regions of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Abkhazia]]. The other two roads linking Georgia and Russia run through South Ossetia and Abkhazia, effectively barring them to international traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Dec24-2009&quot;/&gt;

===Through Iran===
A [[Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline|new gas pipeline to Iran]] has been completed, and a road to Iran through the southern city of [[Meghri]] allows trade with that country.  An oil pipeline to pump Iranian oil products is also in the planning stages.

As of October 2008, the Armenian government was considering implementing an ambitious project to build a railway to Iran.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008&quot; /&gt; The 400 kilometer railway would pass through Armenia's mountainous southern [[Syunik Province|province of Syunik]], which borders Iran. Economic analysts say that the project would cost at least $1 billion (equivalent to about 40 percent of Armenia's 2008 state budget).&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Oct14-2008&quot; /&gt;  As of 2010, the project has been continuously delayed, with the rail link estimated to cost as much as $4 billion and stretch {{convert|313|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot; /&gt;  In June 2010, Transport Minister Manuk Vartanian revealed that Yerevan is seeking as much as $1 billion in loans from China to finance the railway's construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-17-2011&quot; /&gt;

=== Through Turkey and Azerbaijan ===
The closing of the border by Turkey has cut Armenia's [[Kars Gyumri Akhalkalaki railway line|rail link between Gyumri and Kars]] to Turkey; the rail link with Iran through the Azeri exclave of Nakhichevan; and a natural gas and oil pipeline line with Azerbaijan. Also non-functioning are roads with Turkey and Azerbaijan. Despite the economic blockade of Turkey on Armenia, every day dozens of Turkish trucks laden with goods enter Armenia through Georgia.

In 2010, it was confirmed that Turkey will keep the border closed for the foreseeable future after the Turkey-Armenia normalization process collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armenia_in_2010&quot;/&gt;

==Labor Market==

=== Labor Occupation ===
According to 2018 [[Human Development Index|HDI]] statistical update compared to its transcaucasian neighbouring countries Armenia had highest share of employed in services (49.7% of all employed) and lowest share of employed in agriculture (34.4% of all employed) . &lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2018_human_development_statistical_update.pdf|title=HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICES AND INDICATORS: 2018 STATISTICAL UPDATE|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unionization ===
In 2018 about 30% of wage workers were organized in unions.  At the same time rate of unionization was dropping at average rate of 1% since 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf|title=WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monthly wages===
According to preliminary figures from [[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|ArmStat]] monthly wages averaged to 172 thousand AMD in February 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armstat.am/en/?nid=12&amp;id=08001|title=Time series / Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia|website=www.armstat.am|access-date=2019-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that wages rise at 0.8% for each additional year of experience and &quot;the ability to solve problems and learn new skills yields a wage premium of nearly 20 percent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

===Unemployment===
According to prime minister [[Nikol Pashinyan]] in January 2019 562,043 payroll jobs were recorded, against of 511,902 in January 2018, an increase of 9.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;arka.am&quot;/&gt;  [[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|ArmStat]] publication based on data retrieved from employers and national income service cites 560,586 payroll positions in January 2019, an increase of 9.9% against previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armstat.am/file/article/sv_02_19r_142.pdf|title=Оплата труда и количество работников|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armstat.am/en/?nid=82&amp;id=2144|title=Socio- Economic Situation of RA, January-February 2019 (Armenian, Russian) / Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia|website=www.armstat.am|access-date=2019-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however does not match survey data published by [[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia|ArmStat]], according to which in 4th quarter of 2018 there were 870.1 thousand persons employed against 896.7 thousand employed persons in 4th quarter of 2017.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.armstat.am/file/article/sv_02_19a_141.pdf|title=Աշխատանքի շուկայի ցուցանիշներ|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mismatch was highlighted by former PM [[Hrant Bagratyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.1in.am/2551431.html|title=50141 աշխատատեղ ստեղծվել է, բայց 76741 աշխատատեղ էլ՝ փակվե՞լ.

In the same period unemployment rate of economically active population dropped from 20.8% to 20.4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;:6&quot; /&gt;

According to World Bank data unemployment ratio in 2017 reached 18.19%, and was nearly unchanged since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:ARM:AZE:GEO&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=c&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=s&amp;met_y=unemployment&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;idim=country:ARM&amp;ifdim=country:region:ECS&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer|website=www.google.com|access-date=2019-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time it estimates in 2019 that 60% of workers are employed in informal economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

World Bank research also reveals that employment rate fell in years 2000-2015 in middle- and low-skill occupations, while it grew high-skill occupations.&lt;ref name=&quot;:7&quot; /&gt;

===Migrant workers===
Since gaining independence in 1991, hundreds of thousands of Armenia's residents have gone abroad, mainly to Russia, in search of work. Unemployment has been the major cause of this massive labor emigration. OSCE experts estimate that between 116,000 and 147,000 people left Armenia for economic reasons between 2002 and 2004, with two-thirds of them returning home by February 2005. According to estimates by the National Statistical Survey, the rate of labor emigration was twice as higher in 2001 and 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-9-2006&quot;/&gt;

According to an OSCE survey, a typical Armenian [[migrant worker]] is a married man aged between 41 and 50 years who &quot;began looking for work abroad at the age of 32-33.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmLib-Feb-9-2006&quot;/&gt;

==Natural environment protection==
{{See also|Waste management in Armenia}}
In Armenia carbon dioxide emissions amounted to 1.9 tonnes per capita in 2014, less than in its neighbouring countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;:15&quot; /&gt;

Armenia's greenhouse gas emissions decreased 62% from 1990 to 2013, averaging -1.3% annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatelinks.org/sites/default/files/asset/document/2017_USAID_GHG%20Emissions%20Factsheet_Armenia.pdf|title=Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Armenia (by USAID)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnp.am/en/pages/44|title=mnp|website=www.mnp.am|language=en|access-date=2019-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia is working on addressing its environmental problems. [[Ministry of Environment (Armenia)|Ministry of Environment]] has introduced a pollution fee system by which taxes are levied on air and water emissions and solid waste disposal.
