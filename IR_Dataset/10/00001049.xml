An '''amateur''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ə|tj|ər|_|-|tj|ʊər}}; {{IPA-fr|amatœʁ|lang}}; {{literal translation|&quot;lover of&quot;}}) is generally considered a person who pursues a particular activity or field of study independently from their source of income. Amateurs and their pursuits are also described as popular, informal, [[autodidacticism|self-taught]], [[user-generated]], [[do it yourself|DIY]], and [[hobby]]ist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.berkeley.edu/amateurism-across-the-arts-march-9/ |title=Amateurism Across the Arts |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |website=arts.berkeley.edu |access-date=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historically, the amateur was considered to be the ideal balance between pure intent, open mind, and the interest or passion for a subject. That ideology spanned many different fields of interest. It may have its roots in the ancient [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] of [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]] competing in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]]. The ancient Greek citizens spent most of their time in other pursuits, but competed according to their natural talents and abilities.

The &quot;gentleman amateur&quot; was a phenomenon among the [[gentry]] of [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] from the 17th century until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Duncan|title=Deconstructing the Gentleman Amateur (article version)|url=https://www.academia.edu/34556804/Deconstructing_the_Gentleman_Amateur_article_version_|website=www.academia.edu|accessdate=May 16, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the start of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], with people thinking more about how the world works around them, (see [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment]]), things like the [[Cabinet of Curiosities]], and the writing of the book ''[[The Christian Virtuoso]]'', started to shape the idea of the gentleman amateur. He was vastly interested in a particular topic, and studied, observed, and collected things and information on his topic of choice. The [[Royal Society]] in Great Britain was generally composed of these &quot;gentleman amateurs&quot;, and is one the reasons science today exists the way it does. A few examples of these gentleman amateurs are [[Francis Bacon]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington]].

Amateurism can be seen in both a negative and positive light. Since amateurs often lack formal training, some amateur work may be considered sub-par. For example, amateur athletes in sports such as [[basketball]], [[baseball]], or [[Football games|football]] are regarded as possessing a lower level of ability than professional athletes. On the other hand, an amateur may be in a position to approach a subject with an open mind (as a result of the lack of formal training) and in a financially disinterested manner.  An amateur dabbles in a field out of interest rather than as a profession, or possesses a general but superficial interest in any art or a branch of knowledge, is often referred to as a [[wiktionary:dilettante|dilettante]].

== Amateur athletics ==
{{main|Amateur sports}}
The line between ''amateur'' and ''professional'' has always been blurred in athletics with the central idea being that amateurs should not receive material reward for taking part in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taonga|first1=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|title=Amateurism and professionalism – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/amateurism-and-professionalism/page-1|website=teara.govt.nz|accessdate=May 15, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is amateurism?|url=https://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/eligibility-center/what-amateurism|website=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|accessdate=May 15, 2018|language=en|date=3 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180517085526/http://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes/future/eligibility-center/what-amateurism|archive-date=17 May 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of financial benefit can be seen as a sign of [[Personal commitment|commitment]] to a sport; until the 1970s the Olympic rules required that competitors be amateurs. Receiving payment to participate in an event disqualified an athlete from that event, as in the case of [[Jim Thorpe]] (he got payment in a different sport, but was banned in all Olympic sports).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Thorpe Biography - life, children, name, death, history, school, mother, young, son|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/St-Tr/Thorpe-Jim.html|website=www.notablebiographies.com|accessdate=May 16, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Olympic events that still require participants to be amateurs are [[boxing]], [[wrestling]] and [[figure skating]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sk8stuff.com/f_basic_ref/amateur_or_pro.htm Amateur or Professional?]&lt;/ref&gt; but amateurism in these cases is defined in terms of rules, mainly participation in &quot;professional events&quot;, rather than whether the athlete receives any money for his sport.

== Contribution of amateurs ==
Many amateurs make valuable contributions in the field of [[computer programming]] through the [[Open-source software movement|open source]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2487084/it-careers/the-rise-of-hobbyist-programmers.html|title=The rise of hobbyist programmers|last=Jackson|first=Joab|work=Computerworld|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amateur dramatics]] is the performance of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] or [[musical theater]], often to high standards, but lacking the budgets of professional [[West End theatre|West End]] or [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/class-act-the-amateur-dramatics-societies-that-could-give-the-pros-a-run-for-their-money-8294817.html|title=Class act: The amateur-dramatics societies that could give the pros a|date=2012-11-11|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Astronomy]], chemistry, history, linguistics, and the natural sciences are among the fields that have benefited from the activities of amateurs. [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]] were amateur scientists who never held a position in their field of study. [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were considered amateur artists and autodidacts in their fields of study. Radio astronomy was founded by [[Grote Reber]], an [[amateur radio operator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Invisible Universe: The Story of Radio Astronomy|last=Verschuur|first=Gerrit|date=20 March 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-68360-7|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio itself was greatly advanced by [[Guglielmo Marconi]], a young Italian gentleman who started out by tinkering with a [[coherer]] and a [[spark coil]] as an amateur electrician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/guglielmo-marconi-birth/|title=This week in tech|date=2017-04-28|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre de Fermat]] was a highly influential mathematician whose primary vocation was law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Scientific Revolution: An Encyclopedia|last=Burns|first=William E.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2001|isbn=978-0-87436-875-8|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s and 2010s, the distinction between amateur and professional has become increasingly blurred, especially in areas such as computer programming, music and astronomy. The term [[amateur professionalism]], or pro-am, is used to describe these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leadbetter|first1=Charles|title=Amateur Revolution|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/51040/amateur-revolution|website=Fast Company|accessdate=May 16, 2018|date=1 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
