The '''aspect ratio''' of a [[geometry|geometric]] [[shape]] is the [[ratio]] of its sizes in different dimensions. For example, the aspect ratio of a [[rectangle]] is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter side{{snds}}the ratio of width to height,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/aspect-ratio |title=What is aspect ratio? |first=Margaret |last=Rouse |date=September 2005 |accessdate=3 February 2013 |work=WhatIs? |publisher=TechTarget}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the rectangle is oriented as a &quot;landscape&quot;.

The aspect ratio is most often expressed as two integer numbers separated by a colon (x:y), less commonly as a simple or decimal [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. The values x and y do not represent actual widths and heights but, rather, the proportion between width and height. As an example, 8:5, 16:10, 1.6:1, {{Frac|8|5}} and 1.6 are all ways of representing the same aspect ratio.

In objects of more than two dimensions, such as [[hyperrectangle]]s, the aspect ratio can still be defined as the ratio of the longest side to the shortest side.

==Applications and uses==
The term is most commonly used with reference to:
* Graphic / image
** [[Aspect ratio (image)|Image aspect ratio]]
** [[Display aspect ratio]]
** [[Paper size]]
** [[Standard photographic print sizes]]
** [[List of film formats|Motion picture film formats]]
** [[Standard ad size]]
** [[Pixel aspect ratio]]
** [[Photolithography]]: the aspect ratio of an etched, or deposited structure is the ratio of the height of its vertical side wall to its width.

==Aspect ratios of simple shapes==

===Rectangles===
{{Main|Aspect ratio (image)}}
For a rectangle, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the width to the height of the rectangle. A [[square]] has the smallest possible aspect ratio of 1:1.

Examples:
* 4:3 = 1.{{overline|3}}: Some (not all) 20th century computer monitors ([[VGA]], [[XGA]], etc.), [[standard-definition television]]
* {{radic|2}}:1 = 1.414...: international paper sizes ([[ISO 216]])
* 3:2 = 1.5: [[135 film|35mm still camera film]], [[iPhone#Model comparison|iPhone]] (until [[iPhone 5]]) displays
* [[16:10]] = 1.6 (not shown above): commonly used [[widescreen]] [[computer display]]s ([[WXGA (graphics)|WXGA]])
* Î¦:1 = 1.618...: [[golden ratio]], close to 16:10
* 5:3 = 1.{{overline|6}}: [[super 16 mm]],  a standard [[film gauge]] in many European countries
* 16:9 = 1.{{overline|7}}: [[widescreen]] TV
* 2:1 = 2: [[Domino (mathematics)|dominoes]]
* 64:27 = 2.{{overline|370}}:1 (ultra-widescreen, [[21:9 aspect ratio|21:9]])
* 32:9 = 3.{{overline|5}}:1 (super ultra-widescreen)

===Ellipses===
For an ellipse, the aspect ratio denotes the ratio of the [[major axis]] to the [[minor axis]]. An ellipse with an aspect ratio of 1:1 is a circle.

==Aspect ratios of general shapes==

In [[geometry]], there are several alternative definitions to aspect ratios of general [[compact set]]s in a d-dimensional space:&lt;ref name=SmithWormald1998&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The diameter-width aspect ratio (DWAR) of a compact set is the ratio of its diameter to its width. A circle has the minimal DWAR which is 1. A square has a DWAR of sqrt(2).
* The cube-volume aspect ratio (CVAR) of a compact set is the d-th root of the ratio of the d-volume of the smallest enclosing axes-parallel d-cube, to the set's own d-volume. A square has the minimal CVAR which is 1. A circle has a CVAR of sqrt(2). An axis-parallel rectangle of width W and height H, where W&gt;H, has a CVAR of sqrt(W^2/WH) = sqrt(W/H).

If the dimension d is fixed, then all reasonable definitions of aspect ratio are equivalent to within constant factors.

==Notations==
Aspect ratios are mathematically expressed as ''x'':''y'' (pronounced &quot;x-to-y&quot;).

Cinematographic aspect ratios are usually denoted as a (rounded) decimal multiple of width vs unit height, while photographic and videographic aspect ratios are usually defined and denoted by whole number ratios of width to height. In [[digital image]]s there is a subtle distinction between the ''display'' aspect ratio (the image as displayed) and the [[Storage aspect ratio|''storage'' aspect ratio]] (the ratio of pixel dimensions); see [[Aspect ratio (image)#Distinctions|Distinctions]].
