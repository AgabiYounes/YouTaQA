In [[chemistry]], '''alcohol''' is an [[organic compound]] that carries at least one [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group]] (−OH) bound to a [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] [[carbon]] atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title = Alcohols | file = A00204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term alcohol originally referred to the primary alcohol [[ethanol]] (ethyl alcohol), which is [[alcohol (drug)|used as a drug]] and is the main alcohol present in [[alcoholic beverage]]s. An important class of alcohols, of which [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]] are the simplest members, includes all compounds for which the general formula is C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+1&lt;/sub&gt;OH. Simple monoalcohols that are the subject of this article include primary (RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH), secondary (R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHOH) and tertiary (R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH) alcohols.

The suffix ''-ol'' appears in the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC chemical name]] of all substances where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority. When a higher priority group is present in the compound, the prefix ''hydroxy-'' is used in its [[IUPAC]] name. The suffix ''-ol'' in non-IUPAC names (such as [[paracetamol]] or [[cholesterol]]) also typically indicates that the substance is an alcohol. However, many substances that contain hydroxyl functional groups (particularly sugars, such as [[glucose]] and [[sucrose]]) have names which include neither the suffix ''-ol'', nor the prefix ''hydroxy-''.

==History==
[[Alcohol distillation]] possibly originated in the Indus valley civilization as early as 2000 BCE. The people of India used an alcoholic drink called ''[[Sura (alcoholic beverage)|Sura]]'' made from fermented rice, barley, [[jaggery]], and flowers of the madhyaka tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Genomics and Health in the Developing World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74toAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1128|page=1128|author=Dhawendra Kumar|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn = 9780199705474|date = 11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol distillation was known to Islamic chemists as early as the eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/advent-scientific-chemistry |title=The Advent of Scientific Chemistry |last=Al-Hassani |first=Salim |author-link=Salim Al-Hassani |last2=Abattouy |first2=Mohammed |access-date=17 May 2018 |work=Muslim Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cominganarchy.com/2010/07/07/the-history-of-alcohol-in-islam/ |title=The History of Alcohol in Islam |last=Curzon |first=George Nathaniel |author-link=George Nathaniel Curzon |date=7 July 2010 |access-date=17 May 2018 |work=[[Coming Anarchy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
===Etymology===
The word &quot;alcohol&quot; is from the Arabic ''[[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]]'' ({{lang-ar|الكحل|al-kuḥl}}), a powder used as an eyeliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=alcohol |title=Alcohol |access-date=17 May 2018 |dictionary=[[Etymonline]] |last=Harper |first=Douglas |author-link=Douglas Harper |publisher=MaoningTech}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-]] is the Arabic [[Article (grammar)|definite article]], equivalent to ''the'' in English. ''Alcohol'' was originally used for the very fine powder produced by the [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] of the natural mineral [[stibnite]] to form [[antimony trisulfide]] {{chem|Sb|2|S|3}}. It was considered to be the essence or &quot;spirit&quot; of this mineral. It was used as an [[antiseptic]], eyeliner, and [[kohl (cosmetics)|cosmetic]]. The meaning of alcohol was extended to distilled substances in general, and then narrowed to ethanol, when &quot;spirits&quot; was a synonym for [[Distilled beverage|hard liquor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vias.org/encyclopedia/Alcohol_004.html |encyclopedia=VIAS Encyclopedia |title=Etymology of the Word &quot;Alcohol&quot; |first=H. |last=Lohninger |date=21 December 2004 |access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bartholomew Traheron]], in his 1543 translation of [[John of Vigo]], introduces the word as a term used by &quot;barbarous&quot; ([[Moorish]]) authors for &quot;fine powder.&quot; Vigo wrote: &quot;the barbarous auctours use alcohol, or (as I fynde it sometymes wryten) alcofoll, for moost fine poudre.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=alcohol, n. |dictionary=[[OED Online]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1657 ''Lexicon Chymicum'', by William Johnson glosses the word as &quot;antimonium sive stibium.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com?id=d645AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Lexicon Chymicum |last=Johnson |first=William |year=1652}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, the word came to refer to any fluid obtained by distillation, including &quot;alcohol of wine,&quot; the distilled essence of wine. [[Libavius]] in ''Alchymia'' (1594) refers to &quot;vini alcohol vel vinum alcalisatum&quot;. Johnson (1657) glosses ''alcohol vini'' as &quot;quando omnis superfluitas vini a vino separatur, ita ut accensum ardeat donec totum consumatur, nihilque fæcum aut phlegmatis in fundo remaneat.&quot; The word's meaning became restricted to &quot;spirit of wine&quot; (the chemical known today as [[ethanol]]) in the 18th century and was extended to the class of substances so-called as &quot;alcohols&quot; in modern chemistry after 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;oed&quot;/&gt;

The term ''ethanol'' was invented in 1892, combining the word [[ethane]] with the &quot;-ol&quot; ending of &quot;alcohol&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Proc. Chem. Soc.]] |date=8 July 1892 |page=128 |title=Contributions to an international system of nomenclature. The nomenclature of cycloids |first=Henry E. |last=Armstrong |quote=As ol is indicative of an OH derivative, there seems no reason why the simple word acid should not connote carboxyl, and why al should not connote COH; the names ethanol ethanal and ethanoic acid or simply ethane acid would then stand for the OH, COH and COOH derivatives of ethane. |doi=10.1039/PL8920800127 |volume=8 |issue=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ax1LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic names===
[[Chemical nomenclature|IUPAC nomenclature]] is used in scientific publications and where precise identification of the substance is important, especially in cases where the relative complexity of the molecule does not make such a systematic name unwieldy. In naming simple alcohols, the name of the alkane chain loses the terminal ''e'' and adds the suffix ''-ol'', ''e.g.'', as in &quot;ethanol&quot; from the alkane chain name &quot;ethane&quot;.&lt;ref name=reusch-alcohols&gt;{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = VirtualText of Organic Chemistry | title = Alcohols | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/alcohol1.htm#alcnom | accessdate = 14 September 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070919162404/http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/alcohol1.htm#alcnom | archivedate = 19 September 2007 | url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; When necessary, the position of the hydroxyl group is indicated by a number between the alkane name and the ''-ol'': [[propan-1-ol]] for {{chem|CH|3|CH|2|CH|2|OH}}, [[Isopropyl alcohol|propan-2-ol]] for {{chem|CH|3|CH(OH)|CH|3}}. If a higher priority group is present (such as an [[aldehyde]], [[ketone]], or [[carboxylic acid]]), then the prefix ''hydroxy-''is used,&lt;ref name = reusch-alcohols/&gt; e.g., as in 1-hydroxy-2-propanone ({{chem|CH|3|C(O)|CH|2|OH}}).&lt;ref&gt;Organic chemistry IUPAC nomenclature.

===Common names===
In other less formal contexts, an alcohol is often called with the name of the corresponding alkyl group followed by the word &quot;alcohol&quot;, e.g., [[methyl group|methyl]] alcohol, [[ethyl group|ethyl]] alcohol. [[Propyl]] alcohol may be [[propanol|''n''-propyl alcohol]] or [[isopropyl alcohol]], depending on whether the hydroxyl group is bonded to the end or middle carbon on the straight [[propane]] chain. As described under systematic naming, if another group on the molecule takes priority, the alcohol moiety is often indicated using the &quot;hydroxy-&quot; prefix.&lt;ref name=&quot;NamingRules&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=How to name organic compounds using the IUPAC rules|url=http://www.chem.uiuc.edu/GenChemReferences/nomenclature_rules.html|website=www.chem.uiuc.edu|publisher=THE DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|secondary|tertiary}}
Alcohols are then classified into primary, secondary (''sec-'', ''s-''), and tertiary (''tert-'', ''t-''), based upon the number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the [[hydroxyl]] [[functional group]]. (The respective numeric shorthands 1°, 2°, and 3° are also sometimes used in informal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Nomenclature of Alcohols|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Organic_Chemistry/Alcohols/Nomenclature_of_Alcohols|website=chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The primary alcohols have general formulas RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH. The simplest primary alcohol is methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH), for which R=H, and the next is ethanol, for which R=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[methyl group]]. Secondary alcohols are those of the form RR'CHOH, the simplest of which is 2-propanol (R=R'=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). For the tertiary alcohols the general form is RR'R&quot;COH. The simplest example is [[tert-butanol]] (2-methylpropan-2-ol), for which each of R, R', and R&quot; is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In these shorthands, R, R', and R&quot; represent [[substituents]], alkyl or other attached, generally organic groups.

In archaic nomenclature, alcohols can be named as derivatives of methanol using &quot;-carbinol&quot; as the ending.  For instance, (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COH can be named trimethylcarbinol.

Alcohols have a long history of myriad uses. For simple mono-alcohols, which is the focus on this article, the following are most important industrial alcohols:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann1&quot;&gt;{{Ullmann | first1 = Jürgen | last1 = Falbe | first2 = Helmut | last2 = Bahrmann | first3 = Wolfgang | last3 = Lipps | first4 = Dieter | last4 = Mayer | title = Alcohols, Aliphatic | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a01_279}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*methanol, mainly for the production of [[formaldehyde]] and as a [[fuel additive]]
*ethanol, mainly for alcoholic beverages, fuel additive, solvent
*1-propanol, 1-butanol, and isobutyl alcohol for use as a solvent and precursor to solvents
*C6–C11 alcohols used for [[plasticizer]]s, e.g. in [[polyvinylchloride]]
*fatty alcohol (C12–C18), precursors to [[detergent]]s
Methanol is the most common industrial alcohol, with about 12 million tons/y produced in 1980. The combined capacity of the other alcohols is about the same, distributed roughly equally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann1&quot;/&gt;

==Toxicity==
{{main|Ethanol|Methanol}}
With respect to acute toxicity, simple alcohols have low acute toxicities.  Doses of several milliliters are tolerated.  For [[pentanol]]s, [[hexanol]]s, [[octanol]]s and longer alcohols, [[LD50]] range from 2–5 g/kg (rats, oral).  Methanol and ethanol are less acutely toxic.  All alcohols are mild skin irritants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann1&quot;/&gt;

The metabolism of methanol (and ethylene glycol) is affected by the presence of ethanol, which has a higher affinity for [[liver alcohol dehydrogenase]].  In this way methanol will be excreted intact in urine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schep&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Beasley DM |title=A seaman with blindness and confusion |journal=[[BMJ]]|volume=339 |pages=b3929 |date=30 September 2009|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/339/sep30_1/b3929|doi=10.1136/bmj.b3929|pmid=19793790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = HE | last2 = Burkhart | first2 = KK | last3 = Donovan | first3 = JW | title = Ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning: diagnosis and treatment | journal = Journal of Emergency Nursing | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–20 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10097201 | name-list-format=vanc | doi = 10.1016/S0099-1767(99)70156-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lobert | first1 = S | title = Ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and ethylene glycol poisoning | journal = Critical Care Nurse | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 41–7 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11878258 | name-list-format=vanc| doi = 10.4037/ccn2000.20.6.41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
In general, the [[hydroxyl group]] makes alcohols [[polar molecule|polar]]. Those groups can form [[hydrogen bond]]s to one another and to most other compounds.  Owing to the presence of the polar OH alcohols are more water-soluble than simple hydrocarbons.  Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are [[miscible]] in water. [[n-Butanol|Butanol]], with a four-carbon chain, is moderately soluble.

Because of [[hydrogen bonding]], alcohols tend to have higher boiling points than comparable [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[ether]]s. The boiling point of the alcohol ethanol is 78.29&amp;nbsp;°C, compared to 69&amp;nbsp;°C for the hydrocarbon [[hexane]], and 34.6&amp;nbsp;°C for [[diethyl ether]].

==Occurrence in nature==
Simple alcohols are found widely in nature.  Ethanol is most prominent because it is the product of fermentation, a major energy-producing pathway.  The other simple alcohols are formed in only trace amounts.  More complex alcohols are pervasive, as manifested in sugars, some amino acids, and fatty acids.

In the [[Ziegler process]], linear alcohols are produced from ethylene and [[triethylaluminium]] followed by oxidation and hydrolysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann1&quot;/&gt; An idealized synthesis of [[1-octanol]] is shown:

:Al(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  9 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →  Al(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:Al(C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  3 O  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  3 HOC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The process generates a range of alcohols that are separated by [[distillation]].

Many higher alcohols are produced by [[hydroformylation]] of alkenes followed by hydrogenation. When applied to a terminal alkene, as is common, one typically obtains a linear alcohol:&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann1&quot;/&gt;

:RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  CO   →  RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHO
:RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHO +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH

Such processes give [[fatty alcohol]]s, which are useful for detergents.

===Hydration reactions===
Some low molecular weight alcohols of industrial importance are produced by the addition of water to alkenes. Ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanol, and tert-butanol are produced by this general method. Two implementations are employed, the direct and indirect methods. The direct method avoids the formation of stable intermediates, typically using acid catalysts. In the indirect method, the alkene is converted to the [[sulfate ester]], which is subsequently hydrolyzed. The direct [[hydration reaction|hydration]] using [[ethylene]] ([[Ethanol#Ethylene hydration|ethylene hydration]])&lt;ref name=&quot;ECT4 820&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author =Lodgsdon J.E. |year=1994 |chapter=Ethanol |editor=Kroschwitz J.I. |title=Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology| edition=4th |volume=9 |page=820 |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-52677-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other alkenes from [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] of fractions of distilled [[crude oil]].

Hydration is also used industrially to produce the diol [[ethylene glycol]] from [[ethylene oxide]].

===Biological routes===
Ethanol is obtained by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] using [[glucose]] produced from sugar from the [[hydrolysis]] of [[starch]], in the presence of yeast and temperature of less than 37&amp;nbsp;°C to produce ethanol. For instance, such a process might proceed by the conversion of [[sucrose]] by the enzyme [[invertase]] into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], then the conversion of [[glucose]] by the enzyme complex [[zymase]] into [[ethanol]] (and carbon dioxide).

Several species of the benign bacteria in the intestine use [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] as a form of [[anaerobic metabolism]]. This [[metabolism|metabolic]] reaction produces [[ethanol]] as a waste product. Thus, human bodies contain some quantity of alcohol endogenously produced by these bacteria. In rare cases, this can be sufficient to cause &quot;[[auto-brewery syndrome]]&quot; in which intoxicating quantities of alcohol are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01873798 |pmid=6760604 |title=Endogenous alcohol production by intestinal fermentation in sudden infant death |author1=P.

Like ethanol, [[n-Butanol|butanol]] can be produced by fermentation processes. Saccharomyces yeast are known to produce these higher alcohols at temperatures above {{convert|75|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. The bacterium ''[[Clostridium acetobutylicum]]'' can feed on [[cellulose]] to produce butanol on an industrial scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zverlov et al&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zverlov|first1=W|last2=Berezina|first2=O|last3=Velikodvorskaya|first3=GA|last4=Schwarz|first4=WH|title=Bacterial acetone and butanol production by industrial fermentation in the Soviet Union: use of hydrolyzed agricultural waste for biorefinery.|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|date=August 2006|volume=71|issue=5|pages=587–97|doi=10.1007/s00253-006-0445-z|pmid=16685494|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55eb10cabcb22806701b7bd864e3cbf5a3a214c5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Substitution====
Primary [[alkyl halide]]s react with aqueous [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] or [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] mainly to primary alcohols in [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]]. (Secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides will give the elimination (alkene) product instead). [[Grignard reagent]]s react with [[carbonyl]] groups to secondary and tertiary alcohols. Related reactions are the [[Barbier reaction]] and the [[Nozaki-Hiyama reaction]].

====Reduction====
[[Aldehydes]] or [[ketone]]s are [[redox|reduced]] with [[sodium borohydride]] or [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (after an acidic workup). Another reduction by aluminiumisopropylates is the [[Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction]]. [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]] is the asymmetric reduction of β-keto-esters.

====Hydrolysis====
[[Alkenes]] engage in an acid catalysed [[hydration reaction]] using concentrated sulfuric acid as a catalyst that gives usually secondary or tertiary alcohols. The [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and [[oxymercuration-reduction]] of alkenes are more reliable in organic synthesis. Alkenes react with NBS and water in [[halohydrin formation reaction]]. [[Amine]]s can be converted to [[diazonium salt]]s, which are then hydrolyzed.

The formation of a secondary alcohol via reduction and hydration is shown:

===Deprotonation===
With a [[pKa|pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of around 16–19, they are, in general, slightly weaker [[acid]]s than [[water (molecule)|water]].  With strong bases such as [[sodium hydride]] or [[sodium]] they form [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]]s called '''[[alkoxide]]s''', with the general formula [[Alkyl|R]]O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; [[Metal|M]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
: 2 R-OH + 2 NaH  → 2 R-O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: 2 R-OH + 2 Na   →   2 R-O&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The acidity of alcohols is strongly affected by [[solvation]].  In the gas phase, alcohols are more acidic than in water.&lt;ref&gt;{{March6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nucleophilic substitution===
The OH group is not a good [[leaving group]] in [[nucleophilic substitution]] reactions, so neutral alcohols do not react in such reactions. However, if the oxygen is first protonated to give R−OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the leaving group ([[water (molecule)|water]]) is much more stable, and the nucleophilic substitution can take place. For instance, tertiary alcohols react with [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce tertiary [[alkyl halide]]s, where the [[hydroxyl group]] is replaced by a [[chlorine]] atom by [[unimolecular nucleophilic substitution]]. If primary or secondary alcohols are to be reacted with [[hydrochloric acid]], an activator such as [[zinc chloride]] is needed. In alternative fashion, the conversion may be performed directly using [[thionyl chloride]].&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[File:Alcohol reaction examples.svg|frameless|upright=3.2|Some simple conversions of alcohols to alkyl chlorides]]

Alcohols may, likewise, be converted to alkyl bromides using [[hydrobromic acid]] or [[phosphorus tribromide]], for example:

: 3 R-OH + PBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 RBr + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In the [[Barton-McCombie deoxygenation]] an alcohol is deoxygenated to an [[alkane]] with [[organotin|tributyltin hydride]] or a [[organoborane|trimethylborane]]-water complex in a [[radical substitution]] reaction.

===Dehydration===
Meanwhile, the oxygen atom has [[lone pair]]s of nonbonded electrons that render it weakly [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] in the presence of strong acids such as [[sulfuric acid]]. For example, with methanol:

[[File:Methanol acid base.svg|frameless|upright=2.25|Acidity &amp; basicity of methanol]]

Upon treatment with strong acids, alcohols undergo the E1 [[elimination reaction]] to produce [[alkene]]s. The reaction, in general, obeys [[Zaitsev's Rule]], which states that the most stable (usually the most substituted) alkene is formed. Tertiary alcohols eliminate easily at just above room temperature, but primary alcohols require a higher temperature.

This is a diagram of acid catalysed dehydration of ethanol to produce [[ethylene]]:

[[File:DehydrationOfAlcoholWithH-.png|frameless|upright=2.5]]

A more controlled elimination reaction requires the formation of the [[xanthate ester]].

===Protonolysis===
Tertiary alcohols react with strong acids to generate carbocations.  The reaction is related to their dehydration, e.g. isobutylene from tert-butyl alcohol. A special kind of dehydration reaction involves [[triphenylmethanol]] and especially its amine-substituted derivatives.  When treated with acid, these alcohols lose water to give stable carbocations, which are commercial dyes.&lt;ref name=Ull&gt;{{Ullmann's | last1 = Gessner | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Mayer | first2 = Udo | title = Triarylmethane and Diarylmethane Dyes | year = 2000 | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a27_179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Kristallviolett Darstellung.svg|thumb|right|322px|Preparation of [[crystal violet]] by protonolysis of the tertiary alcohol.]]

===Esterification===
Alcohol and [[carboxylic acid]]s react in the so-called [[Fischer esterification]].  The reaction usually requires a [[catalyst]], such as concentrated sulfuric acid:
: R-OH + R'-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H → R'-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Other types of ester are prepared in a similar manner{{snd}} for example, [[tosyl]] (tosylate) esters are made by reaction of the alcohol with p-[[toluenesulfonyl]] chloride in pyridine.

===Oxidation===
{{Main|Alcohol oxidation}}
Primary alcohols (R-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) can be oxidized either to [[aldehyde]]s (R-CHO) or to [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H).  The oxidation of secondary alcohols (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CH-OH) normally terminates at the [[ketone]] (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C=O) stage. Tertiary alcohols (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;C-OH) are resistant to oxidation.

The direct [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] normally proceeds via the corresponding aldehyde, which is transformed via an ''aldehyde hydrate'' (R-CH(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by reaction with water before it can be further oxidized to the carboxylic acid.

[[File:Alcohol to aldehyde to acid.png|upright=2.25|thumb|center|Mechanism of [[oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids]] via aldehydes and aldehyde hydrates]]

Reagents useful for the transformation of primary alcohols to aldehydes are normally also suitable for the [[oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones]]. These include [[Collins reagent]] and [[Dess-Martin periodinane]]. The direct oxidation of primary alcohols to carboxylic acids can be carried out using [[potassium permanganate]] or the [[Jones reagent]].
