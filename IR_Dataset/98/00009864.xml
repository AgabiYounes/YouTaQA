The '''European Free Alliance''' ('''EFA''') is a [[European political party]] that consists of various [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalist]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanley2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hanley|chapter=Parties, Identity and Europeanisation: An Asymmetrical Relationship?|editor=Marion Demossier|title=The European Puzzle: The Political Structuring of Cultural Identities at a Time of Transition|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NDA--EGAr40C&amp;pg=PA152|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-863-6|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbett2012&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Corbett |chapter=Democracy in the European Union|editor1=Elizabeth Bomberg|editor2=John Peterson|editor3=Richard Corbett|title=The European Union: How Does it Work?|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXFgGVC9b98C&amp;pg=PA155|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957080-5|pages=155–}}&lt;/ref&gt; political parties in Europe. Member parties advocate either for full political independence and [[sovereignty]], or some form of [[devolution]] or [[self-governance]] for their country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-f-a.org/about-us/whats-efa-and-history/|title=What's EFA and history|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance has generally limited its membership to [[Progressivism|progressive]] parties;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gupta|first=Devashree | title = Nationalism across borders: transnational nationalist advocacy in the European Union | journal = [[Comparative European Politics]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–80 | doi = 10.1057/palgrave.cep.6110127 | date = April 2008 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, only a fraction of European regionalist parties are members of the EFA.

Since 1999 the EFA and the [[European Green Party]] (EGP) have joined forces within [[Greens–European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA) [[Political groups of the European Parliament|group]] in the [[European Parliament]], although some EFA members have joined other groups from time to time.

The EFA's youth wing is the [[European Free Alliance Youth]] (EFAY), founded in 2000.

As of 2019, three European regions are led by EFA politicians: [[Corsica]] with [[Gilles Simeoni]] of [[Pè a Corsica|Together for Corsica]], Flanders with [[Jan Jambon]] of the [[New Flemish Alliance]] and [[Scotland]] with [[Nicola Sturgeon]] of the [[Scottish National Party]].

==History==
Regionalists have long been represented in the [[European Parliament]]. In the [[1979 European Parliament election|1979 election]] four regionalist parties obtained seats: the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP), the Flemish [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] (VU), the Brussels-based [[DéFI|Democratic Front of Francophones]] (FDF) and the [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] (SVP). The SNP, although being predominantly [[social democracy|social-democratic]], joined the [[European Progressive Democrats]], a conservative group led by the French [[Rally for the Republic]]. The VU and the FDF joined the heterogeneous [[Technical Group of Independents (1979–84)|Technical Group of Independents]], while the SVP joined the [[European People's Party group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups1979.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |accessdate=10 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512230243/http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups1979.html |archive-date=12 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 six parties (VU, the [[Frisian National Party]], [[Independent Fianna Fáil]], the [[Party of German-speaking Belgians]], the [[Party for the Organization of a Free Brittany]] and the [[Alsace-Lorraine National Association]]), plus three observers (the [[Union of the Corsican People]], UPC, the [[Occitan Party]] and the [[Democratic Convergence of Catalonia]], CDC), joined forces to form the '''European Free Alliance'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-f-a.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/3.4.4.3_EFA-THE-INTERNATIONALISM.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194830/http://www.e-f-a.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/3.4.4.3_EFA-THE-INTERNATIONALISM.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GouldMessina2014&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew C.

Only after the [[1989 European Parliament election]] did EFA members form a united group, called [[Rainbow Group (1989–94)|Rainbow]] like its green predecessor. It consisted of three Italian MEPs (two for [[Lega Lombarda]] and one for the PSd'Az), two Spanish MEPs (one each for the PNV and the [[Andalusian Party]], PA), one Belgian MEP (for VU), one French MEP (UPC), one British MEP (SNP) and one independent MEP from Ireland. They were joined by 4 MEPs from the Danish left-wing Eurosceptic [[People's Movement against the EU]], while the other regionalist parties, including the SVP, Batasuna and the [[Convergence and Union]] of Catalonia (CiU) declined to join.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups1989.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |accessdate=20 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512230355/http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups1989.html |archive-date=12 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1994 European Parliament election]] the regionalists lost many seats. Moreover, the EFA had suspended its major affiliate, [[Lega Nord]], for having joined forces in government with the post-fascist [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]. Also, the PNV chose to switch to the [[European People's Party]] (EPP). The three remaining EFA MEPs (representing the SNP, the VU and the [[Canarian Coalition]]) formed a group with the French ''[[Radical Party of the Left|Énergie Radicale]]'' list and the Italian [[Pannella List]]: the [[European Radical Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups1994.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |accessdate=20 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512230251/http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups1994.html |archive-date=12 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[1999 European Parliament election]], in which EFA parties did quite well, EFA elected MEPs formed a joint group with the [[European Green Party]], under the name [[Greens–European Free Alliance]] (Greens/EFA). In the event the EFA supplied ten members: two each from the Scottish SNP, the Welsh [[Plaid Cymru]], and the Flemish VU, and one each from the Basque PNV and EA, the Andalusian PA and the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups1999.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |accessdate=20 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512225101/http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups1999.html |archive-date=12 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2004 European Parliament election]], the EFA, which had formally become a [[European political party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups2004.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |accessdate=20 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064901/http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups2004.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; was reduced to four MEPs: two from the SNP ([[Ian Hudghton]] and [[Alyn Smith]]), one from [[Plaid Cymru]] ([[Jill Evans]]) and one from the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC; [[Bernat Joan i Marí]], replaced at the mid-term by MEP [[Mikel Irujo]] of the Basque EA). They were joined by two associate members: [[Tatjana Ždanoka]] of [[Latvian Russian Union|For Human Rights in United Latvia]] (PCTVL) and [[László Tőkés]], an independent MEP and former member of the [[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]] (UMDR). Co-operation between the EFA and the Greens continued.

Following the 2008 revision of the EU Regulation that governs European political parties allowing the creation of [[Political foundation at European level|European foundations]] affiliated to European political parties, the EFA established its official foundation/[[think tank]], the [[Coppieters Foundation]] (CF), in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideasforeurope.eu |title=Centre Maurits Coppieters (CMC) – Ideas for Europe |publisher=Ideasforeurope.eu |accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2009 European Parliament election]], six MEPs were returned for the EFA: two from the SNP (Ian Hudghton and Alyn Smith), one from Plaid Cymru (Jill Evans), one from the [[Party of the Corsican Nation]] (PNC; [[François Alfonsi]]), one from the ERC ([[Oriol Junqueras]]), and Tatjana Ždanoka, an individual member of the EFA from Latvia. After the election, the [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) also joined the EFA. The EFA subgroup thus counted seven MEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wolfram Nordsieck |url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups2009.html |title=Parties and Elections in Europe |publisher=Parties-and-elections.eu |accessdate=10 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512230142/http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/eu-groups2009.html |archive-date=12 May 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2014 European Parliament election]], EFA-affiliated parties returned twelve seats to the Parliament: four for the N-VA, two for the SNP, two for &quot;[[Left for the Right to Decide]]&quot; (an electoral list primarily composed of the ERC), one for &quot;[[The Peoples Decide]]&quot; (an electoral list maily comprising [[EH Bildu]], a Basque coalition including EA), one for &quot;[[European Spring (Spanish electoral alliance)|European Spring]]&quot; (an electoral list comprising the [[Valencian Nationalist Bloc]], BNV, and the [[Chunta Aragonesista|Aragonese Union]], ChA), one from Plaid Cymru, and one from the [[Latvian Russian Union]] (LKS). Due to ideological divergences with the Flemish [[Groen (political party)|Greens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/will-flemish-separatists-save-tories-europe-302068|title=Will Flemish separatists save the Tories in Europe?|work=EurActiv – EU News &amp; policy debates, across languages|accessdate=26 August 2015|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the N-VA defected to the [[European Conservatives and Reformists]] (ECR) group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20140618_01146790|title= N-VA kiest voor ECR-fractie in Europees Parlement|first= Johan|last= Van Overtveldt|date= 18 June 2014|work= standaard.be|language= Dutch|trans-title= N-VA chooses ECR Group in the European Parliament|accessdate= 18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/politics/n-va-joins-ecr-group-european-parliament|title=N-VA joins ECR group in European Parliament|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the EH Bildu MEP joined the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]] (GUE/NGL) group. Thus, EFA had seven members in the Greens/EFA group and four within ECR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens-efa.eu/up-to-date-list-of-the-meps-for-the-new-legislative-period-12490.html|title=Up-to-date list of the MEPs for the new legislative period|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2019 European Parliament election]] the EFA gained a fourth seat in the United Kingdom, due to the SNP gaining a third seat to add to Plaid Cymru's one. However, the EFA suffered the loss of these seats later in 2019 due to [[Brexit]], which meant SNP and PC MEPs had to leave.

==Ideology==
In the Brussels declaration of 2000 the EFA codified its political principles. The EFA stands for &quot;a Europe of Free Peoples based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]], which believe in solidarity with each other and the peoples of the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;STAT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-f-a.org/efaactive.php?id=12 |title=European Free Alliance |publisher=E-f-a.org |accessdate=10 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021070229/http://www.e-f-a.org/efaactive.php?id=12 |archivedate=21 October 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFA sees itself as an alliance of [[Statelessness|stateless]] peoples, striving towards recognition, autonomy, independence or wanting a proper voice in Europe. It supports European integration on basis of the subsidiarity-principle. It believes also that Europe should move away from further centralisation and works towards the formation of a &quot;Europe of regions&quot;. It believes that regions should have more power in Europe, for instance participating in the [[Council of the European Union]], when matters within their [[Jurisdiction|competence]] are discussed. It also wants to protect the [[languages of the European Union|linguistic]] and cultural diversity within the EU.

The EFA broadly stands on the left-wing of the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y33BAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=efa+%22left-wing%22#v=onepage&amp;q=efa%20%22left-wing%22&amp;f=false | title=Europe's Contending Identities: Supranationalism, Ethnoregionalism, Religion, and New Nationalism| isbn=9781139867757| last1=Gould| first1=Andrew C.| last2=Messina| first2=Anthony M.| date=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-34574041 | title=European Parliament: Guide to the political groups| publisher=BBC News| date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brussels declaration emphasises the protection of human rights, [[sustainable development]] and [[social justice]]. In 2007 the EFA congress in [[Bilbao]] added several progressive principles to the declaration, including a commitment to fight against racism, [[antisemitism]], discrimination, [[xenophobia]] and [[Islamophobia]], and a commitment to get full [[citizenship]] for immigrants, including [[suffrage|voting rights]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

EFA members are generally [[progressivism|progressive]], although there are some notable exceptions as the conservative [[New Flemish Alliance]], [[Bavaria Party]], [[Schleswig Party]] and [[Future of Åland]], the Christian-democratic [[Slovene Union]], the centre-right [[Liga Veneta Repubblica]] and the far-right&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/editoriali/09_maggio_08/editoriale_alto_adige_ernesto_galli_della_loggia_fb5d76a4-3b8e-11de-a872-00144f02aabc.shtml |title=I separati dell'Alto Adige&amp;nbsp;|work=Corriere della Sera |accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.gelocal.it/altoadige/archivio/altoadige/2010/10/14/AZBPO_AZB03.html |title=Digos e carabinieri nella sede del partito&amp;nbsp;— Alto Adige dal 2004.it &quot; Ricerca |publisher=Ricerca.gelocal.it |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://altoadige.gelocal.it/cronaca/2011/10/03/news/frattini-denuncia-il-diario-della-klotz-1.4288768 |title=Frattini denuncia il &quot;diario&quot; della Klotz&amp;nbsp;— Cronaca&amp;nbsp;— Alto Adige |publisher=Altoadige.gelocal.it |date=24 July 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130813120537/http://altoadige.gelocal.it/cronaca/2011/10/03/news/frattini-denuncia-il-diario-della-klotz-1.4288768 |archive-date=13 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2011/10/04/italia/cronache/nel-diario-scolastico-sudtirolesei-terroristi-si-scoprono-eroi-39Rsc1svaFlvWfi53OBIBJ/pagina.html |title=La Stampa&amp;nbsp;— Nel diario scolastico sudtirolesei terroristi si scoprono eroi |work=La Stampa |accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Tyrolean Freedom]].

==Organisation==
The main organs of the EFA organisation are the General Assembly, the Bureau and the Secretariat.

===General Assembly===
In the General Assembly, the supreme council of the EFA, every member party has one vote.

===Bureau and Secretariat===
The Bureau takes care of daily affairs. It is chaired by [[Lorena Lopez de Lacalle]] ([[Eusko Alkartasuna|Basque Solidarity]]), president of the EFA, while [[Jordi Solé i Ferrando|Jordi Solé]] ([[Republican Left of Catalonia]]) is secretary-general and [[Anke Spoorendonk]] ([[South Schleswig Voters' Association]]) treasurer.

The Bureau is completed by ten vice-presidents: [[Marta Bainka]] ([[Silesian Autonomy Movement]]), [[Olrik Bouma]] ([[Frisian National Party]]), {{ill|Anders Eriksson (politician)|lt=Anders Eriksson|sv|Anders Eriksson (åländsk politiker)}} ([[Future of Åland]]), [[Jill Evans]] ([[Plaid Cymru]]), [[Fernando Fuente Cortina]] ([[Valencian Nationalist Bloc]]), [[Victor Gallou]] ([[Unvaniezh Demokratel Breizh|Breton Democratic Union]]), [[David Grosclaude]] ([[Occitan Party]]), [[Wouter Patho]] ([[New Flemish Alliance]]), [[Nelida Pogagcic]] ([[List for Rijeka]]) and [[Anne Tomasi]] ([[Party of the Corsican Nation]]).

===Member parties===
{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2014}}
Before becoming a member party, an organisation needs to have been an observer of the EFA for at least one year. Only one member party per region is allowed. If a second party from a region wants to join the EFA, the first party needs to agree, at which point these two parties will then form a common delegation with one vote. The EFA also recognises friends of the EFA, a special status for regionalist parties outside of the European Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;STAT&quot;/&gt;

The following is the list of EFA members and former members.&lt;ref name=&quot;members&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-f-a.org/whos-who/member-parties |title=Member Parties |website=e-f-a.org |publisher=European Free Alliance |access-date=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
