In [[computer engineering]], an '''execution unit''' (also called a '''functional unit''') is a part of the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) that performs the operations and calculations as instructed by the [[computer program]]. It may have its own internal control sequence unit, which is not to be confused with the CPU's main [[control unit]], some [[Processor register|register]]s, and other internal units such as an [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), [[address generation unit]] (AGU), [[floating-point unit]] (FPU), [[load-store unit (computing)|load-store unit]] (LSU), [[branch execution unit]] (BEU)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.realworldtech.com/haswell-cpu/4/&lt;/ref&gt; or some smaller and more specific components.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131231145405/http://people.cs.umass.edu/~weems/CmpSci535/Discussion10.html &quot;Execution Unit&quot; discussion from the University of Massachusetts Amherst], archived on the [[Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for modern CPUs to have multiple parallel execution units, which is referred to as [[superscalar]] design. The simplest arrangement is to use one, the bus manager, to manage the memory interface, and the others to perform calculations. Additionally, modern CPUs' execution units are usually [[Instruction pipelining|pipelined]].
