{{Short description|Widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth}}
{{Annotated image/Extinction}}
An '''extinction event''' (also known as a '''mass extinction''' or '''biotic crisis''') is a widespread and rapid decrease in the [[biodiversity]] on [[Earth]]. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of [[multicellular organism]]s. It occurs when the rate of [[extinction]] increases with respect to the rate of [[speciation]]. Estimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540 million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from the threshold chosen for describing an extinction event as &quot;major&quot;, and the data chosen to measure past diversity.

Because most diversity and [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] on Earth is [[microbial]], and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the [[biosphere]] rather than the total diversity and abundance of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020272| pmid = 15314670| year = 2004| last1 = Nee | first1 = S.| title = Extinction, slime, and bottoms| volume = 2| issue = 8| pages = E272| pmc = 509315| journal = PLoS Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extinction]] occurs at an uneven rate. Based on the [[fossil record]], the [[background extinction rate|background rate of extinctions]] on Earth is about two to five [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomic]] [[family (biology)|families]] of [[marine animal]]s every million years. Marine fossils are mostly used to measure extinction rates because of their superior fossil record and stratigraphic range compared to [[land animal]]s.

The [[Great Oxygenation Event]], which occurred around 2.45 billion years ago, was probably the first major extinction event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Plait |first1=Phil |title=Poisoned Planet |url=https://slate.com/technology/2014/07/the-great-oxygenation-event-the-earths-first-mass-extinction.html |accessdate=8 July 2019 |work=Slate |date=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Cambrian explosion]], five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent and arguably best-known, the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]], which occurred approximately {{period start|Paleogene}} million years ago (Ma), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Impact from the Deep|last = Ward|first = Peter D|date = 2006|journal = Scientific American|volume = 295|issue = 4|pages = 64–71|doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1006-64|pmid = 16989482|access-date = |bibcode = 2006SciAm.295d..64W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the five major mass extinctions, there are numerous minor ones as well, and the ongoing mass extinction caused by human activity is sometimes called the [[sixth extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;

In a landmark paper published in 1982, [[Jack Sepkoski]] and [[David M. Raup]] identified five mass extinctions. They were originally identified as outliers to a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the Phanerozoic,&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data, it has been established that multicellular animal life has experienced five major and many minor mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Gould, S.J. |date= March 1, 2004|title=The Evolution of Life on Earth|journal=Scientific American  |volume= 271|issue= 4|pages= 84–91|url = |access-date = |pmid= 7939569|doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican1094-84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Big Five&quot; cannot be so clearly defined, but rather appear to represent the largest (or some of the largest) of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction events.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt;

# [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]] (End Ordovician or O–S): 450–440&amp;nbsp;Ma (million years ago) at the [[Ordovician]]–[[Silurian]] transition.

# [[Late Devonian extinction]]: 375–360&amp;nbsp;Ma near the [[Devonian]]–[[Carboniferous]] transition.

Older fossil records are more difficult to interpret. This is because:
* Older fossils are harder to find as they are usually buried at a considerable depth.
* Dating older fossils is more difficult.
* Productive fossil beds are researched more than unproductive ones, therefore leaving certain periods unresearched.
* Prehistoric environmental events can disturb the [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] process.
* The preservation of fossils varies on land, but marine fossils tend to be better preserved than their sought after land-based counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;sole&quot;&gt;Sole, R.V., and Newman, M., 2002. &quot;Extinctions and Biodiversity in the Fossil Record – Volume Two, ''The Earth system: biological and ecological dimensions of global environment change''&quot; pp. 297–391, ''Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change'' John Wilely &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research has indicated that the [[End-Capitanian extinction event]] likely constitutes a separate extinction event from the Permian–Triassic extinction event; if so, it would be larger than many of the &quot;Big Five&quot; extinction events.

Mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the [[evolution]] of [[life|life on Earth]]. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is &quot;superior&quot; to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Benton | first =M.J. |authorlink = Michael Benton| title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher=Blackwell | year=2004 | chapter=6.

For example, [[mammaliformes]] (&quot;almost mammals&quot;) and then [[mammal]]s existed throughout the reign of the [[dinosaur]]s, but could not compete for the large terrestrial vertebrate niches which dinosaurs monopolized. The [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end-Cretaceous]] mass extinction removed the non-avian dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches. Ironically, the dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction, the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|end-Triassic]], which eliminated most of their chief rivals, the [[crurotarsans]].

Another point of view put forward in the [[Escalation hypothesis]] predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions. This is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event.

Furthermore, many groups which survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity, and many of these go into long-term decline, and these are often referred to as &quot;[[Dead Clade Walking|Dead Clades Walking]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jablonski| first= D.| year=2002| doi= 10.1073/pnas.102163299| title=Survival without recovery after mass extinctions| journal=PNAS| volume= 99| issue=12| pages= 8139–44| pmid=12060760| pmc=123034|bibcode = 2002PNAS...99.8139J }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, clades that survive for a considerable period of time after a mass extinction, and which were reduced to only a few species, are likely to have experienced a rebound effect called the &quot;[[push of the past]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;POTPa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Budd |first1=G.E. |last2=Mann |first2=R.P. |title=History is written by the victors: the effect of the push of the past on the fossil record. |journal=Evolution |volume=72 |issue=11 |pages=2276–91 |date=2018 |doi=10.1111/evo.13593 |pmid=30257040 |pmc=6282550 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions, such as competition for food and space—the ‘struggle for existence’—were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment. He expressed this in ''The Origin of Species'': &quot;Species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes…and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered…physical conditions, namely the mutual relation of organism to organism-the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hallam, Anthony]], &amp; Wignall, P.B.

{{Phanerozoic biodiversity}}
Mass extinctions are thought to result when a long-term stress is compounded by a short-term shock.&lt;ref name=Arens2008&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Arens | first1 = N.C.| last2 = West | first2 = I.D.| title = Press-pulse: a general theory of mass extinction?| journal = Paleobiology| volume = 34| issue = 4| pages = 456–71| year = 2008| doi = 10.1666/07034.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the [[Phanerozoic]], individual taxa appear to be less likely to become extinct at any time,&lt;ref name=Wang2008&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Wang | first1 = S.C.| last2 = Bush | first2 = A.M.| title = Adjusting global extinction rates to account for taxonomic susceptibility| journal = Paleobiology| volume = 34| issue = 4| pages = 434–55| year = 2008| doi = 10.1666/07060.1| url = http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/swang1/Publications/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may reflect more robust food webs as well as less extinction-prone species and other factors such as continental distribution.&lt;ref name=Wang2008/&gt;
However, even after accounting for sampling bias, there does appear to be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; This may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance; or it may be an artefact of taxonomy: families tend to become more speciose, therefore less prone to extinction, over time;&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt; and larger taxonomic groups (by definition) appear earlier in geological time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budd2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Budd | first1 = G.E. | doi = 10.1093/icb/43.1.157 | title = The Cambrian Fossil Record and the Origin of the Phyla | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 1 | pages = 157–65 | year = 2003 | pmid =  21680420| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500 million years, and thus less vulnerable to mass extinctions,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Dissolved oxygen]] became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and [[anoxic event]]s; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that [[food chain]]s were less likely to be disrupted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Martin| first= R.E.| year=1995| title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans| journal=Global and Planetary Change| volume =11| issue= 1| doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2| pages=1–23|bibcode = 1995GPC....11....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Martin| first1 = R.E.| year = 1996| title = Secular increase in nutrient levels through the Phanerozoic: Implications for productivity, biomass, and diversity of the marine biosphere| journal = PALAIOS| volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = 209–19| doi = 10.2307/3515230| jstor = 3515230| bibcode = 1996Palai..11..209M}}&lt;/ref&gt; but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level does not appear to make mass extinctions more or less probable.&lt;ref name=Wang2008/&gt;

==Causes==
There is still debate about the causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arens2008&quot;/&gt; An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity. High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate; low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.&lt;ref name=Alroy2008/&gt;

===Identifying causes of specific mass extinctions===
A good theory for a particular mass extinction should: (i) explain all of the losses, not just focus on a few groups (such as dinosaurs); (ii) explain why particular groups of organisms died out and why others survived; (iii) provide mechanisms which are strong enough to cause a mass extinction but not a total extinction; (iv) be based on events or processes that can be shown to have happened, not just inferred from the extinction.

It may be necessary to consider combinations of causes. For example, the marine aspect of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end-Cretaceous]] extinction appears to have been caused by several processes which partially overlapped in time and may have had different levels of significance in different parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marshall | first=C.R. | last2=Ward | first2=P.D. | title=Sudden and Gradual Molluscan Extinctions in the Latest Cretaceous of Western European Tethys | journal=Science | volume=274 | pages=1360–63 | year=1996 | doi = 10.1126/science.274.5291.1360 | pmid=8910273 | issue=5291|bibcode = 1996Sci...274.1360M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arens and West (2006) proposed a &quot;press / pulse&quot; model in which mass extinctions generally require two types of cause: long-term pressure on the eco-system (&quot;press&quot;) and a sudden catastrophe (&quot;pulse&quot;) towards the end of the period of pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Arens, N.C. and West, I.D. (2006). &quot;Press/Pulse: A General Theory of Mass Extinction?&quot; 'GSA Conference paper' [http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006AM/finalprogram/abstract_111772.htm Abstract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118164705/https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2006AM/finalprogram/abstract_111772.htm |date=2017-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their statistical analysis of marine extinction rates throughout the [[Phanerozoic]] suggested that neither long-term pressure alone nor a catastrophe alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the extinction rate.

The most commonly suggested causes of mass extinctions are listed below.

====Flood basalt events====
The formation of [[large igneous province]]s by flood basalt events could have:
* produced dust and [[particulates|particulate]] aerosols which inhibited photosynthesis and thus caused [[food chain]]s to collapse both on land and at sea&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v263/n4/pdf/scientificamerican1090-85.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* emitted sulfur oxides which were precipitated as [[acid rain]] and poisoned many organisms, contributing further to the collapse of food chains
* emitted [[carbon dioxide]] and thus possibly causing [[greenhouse effect|sustained global warming]] once the dust and particulate aerosols dissipated.
Flood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods. As a result, they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming, but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.

It is speculated that massive volcanism caused or contributed to the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]], [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|End-Triassic]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|End-Cretaceous]] extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/cretcause.html|title=Causes of the Cretaceous Extinction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between gigantic volcanic events expressed in the large igneous provinces and mass extinctions was shown for the last 260 Myr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Courtillot | first1 = V. | year = 1994 | title = Mass extinctions in the last 300 million years: one impact and seven flood basalts? | url = | journal = Israel Journal of Earth Sciences | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 255–266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courtillot, V.E., Renne, P.R., 2003. On the ages of flood basalt events. Comptes Rendus Geosciences 335 (1), 113–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently such possible correlation was extended for the whole Phanerozoic Eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kravchinsky | first1 = V.

====Sea-level falls====
These are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments which show all or part of a transition from sea-bed to tidal zone to beach to dry land – and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as [[orogeny]]. Sea-level falls could reduce the continental shelf area (the most productive part of the oceans) sufficiently to cause a marine mass extinction, and could disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land. But sea-level falls are very probably the result of other events, such as sustained global cooling or the sinking of the [[plate tectonics|mid-ocean ridges]].

Sea-level falls are associated with most of the mass extinctions, including all of the &quot;Big Five&quot;—[[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]], [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]], [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|End-Triassic]], and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|End-Cretaceous]].

A study, published in the journal Nature (online June 15, 2008) established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment.&lt;ref name=Peters2008&gt;{{cite journal

 | pages = 626–29
 | pmid = 18552839
 | issue = 7204
|bibcode = 2008Natur.454..626P }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The study suggests changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction, and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/541743/ Newswise: Ebb and Flow of the Sea Drives World's Big Extinction Events] Retrieved on June 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact events====
The impact of a sufficiently large asteroid or comet could have caused [[food chain]]s to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Impact theory of mass extinctions and the invertebrate fossil record|first = Walter|date = Mar 16, 1984|journal = Science|doi = 10.1126/science.223.4641.1135|pmid = 17742919|last = Alvarez|last2 = Kauffman|first2 = Erle|issue = 4641|volume = 223|pages = 1135–41|last3 = Surlyk|first3 = Finn|last4 = Alvarez|first4 = Luis|last5 = Asaro|first5 = Frank|last6 = Michel|first6 = Helen|jstor=1692570|bibcode = 1984Sci...223.1135A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impacts on [[sulfur]]-rich rocks could have emitted sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous [[acid rain]], contributing further to the collapse of food chains. Such impacts could also have caused [[megatsunami]]s and/or global [[forest fire]]s.

Most paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth about 66&amp;nbsp;Ma ago, but there is an ongoing dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keller_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keller G, Abramovich S, Berner Z, Adatte T | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology| volume=271| issue=1–2| date=1 January 2009| pages=52–68| title=Biotic effects of the Chicxulub impact, K–T catastrophe and sea level change in Texas| doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.09.007| bibcode=2009PPP...271...52K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Analyses of shocked quartz at the global K-P boundary indicate an origin from a single, high-angle, oblique impact at Chicxulub |vauthors=Morgan J, Lana C, Kersley A, Coles B, Belcher C, Montanari S, Diaz-Martinez E, Barbosa A, Neumann V |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=251 |issue=3–4 |year=2006 |pages=264–79 |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.009 |bibcode=2006E&amp;PSL.251..264M|url=http://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/1208/1/EPSL-D-05-00905%5b1%5d.pdf |hdl=10044/1/1208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, in October 2019, researchers reported that the [[Chicxulub impactor|Cretaceous Chicxulub asteroid impact]] that resulted in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction]] of non-avian [[dinosaurs]] 66 Ma ago, also rapidly [[Ocean acidification|acidified the oceans]] producing [[ecological collapse]] and long-lasting effects on the climate, and was a key reason for end-Cretaceous mass extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20191021&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Joel |first=Lucas |title=The Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Acidified the Ocean in a Flash - The Chicxulub event was as damaging to life in the oceans as it was to creatures on land, a study shows. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/science/chicxulub-asteroid-ocean-acid.html |date=21 October 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=22 October 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNAS-20191021&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Henehan, Michael J. |display-authors=et al. |title=Rapid ocean acidification and protracted Earth system recovery followed the end-Cretaceous Chicxulub impact |date=21 October 2019 |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=116 |issue=45 |pages=22500–22504 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1905989116  |pmid=31636204 |pmc=6842625 |bibcode=2019PNAS..11622500H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global cooling====
Sustained and significant global cooling could kill many [[Polar circle|polar]] and [[temperate]] species and force others to migrate towards the [[equator]]; reduce the area available for [[Tropics|tropical]] species; often make the Earth's climate more arid on average, mainly by locking up more of the planet's water in ice and snow. The [[glaciation]] cycles of the [[current ice age]] are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity, so the mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction.

It has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]], [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] extinctions, and possibly others. Sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts.

====Global warming====
{{Main|Extinction risk from global warming}}
This would have the opposite effects: expand the area available for [[Tropics|tropical]] species; kill [[temperate]] species or force them to migrate towards the [[Polar circle|poles]]; possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species; often make the Earth's climate wetter on average, mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the [[water cycle]]. It might also cause anoxic events in the oceans (see below).

Global warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayhew|first=Peter J. |author2=Gareth B. Jenkins|author3=Timothy G. Benton|date=January 7, 2008|title=A long-term association between global temperature and biodiversity, origination and extinction in the fossil record|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=275|issue=1630|pages=47–53|doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1302|pmid=17956842|pmc=2562410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most dramatic example of sustained warming is the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions. It has also been suggested to have caused the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]], during which 20% of all marine families became extinct. Furthermore, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] has been suggested to have been caused by warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knoll|first1=A.H.|last2=Bambach|first2=R.K.|last3=Canfield|first3=D.E.|last4=Grotzinger|first4=J.P.|date=26 July 1996|title=Fossil record supports evidence of impending mass extinction|journal=Science|volume=273|pages=452–457|pmid=8662528|doi=10.1126/science.273.5274.452|issue=5274|bibcode = 1996Sci...273..452K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ward|first=Peter D.|author2=Jennifer Botha|author3=Roger Buick|author4=Michiel O.

====Clathrate gun hypothesis====
{{Main|Clathrate gun hypothesis}}
[[Clathrates]] are composites in which a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another. [[Methane clathrate]]s (in which water molecules are the cage) form on [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. These clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly—for example in response to sudden [[global warming]] or a sudden drop in sea level or even [[earthquake]]s. Methane is a much more powerful [[greenhouse effect|greenhouse]] gas than carbon dioxide, so a methane eruption (&quot;clathrate gun&quot;) could cause rapid global warming or make it much more severe if the eruption was itself caused by global warming.

The most likely signature of such a methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the [[Isotope analysis|ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12]] in sediments, since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13; but the change would have to be very large, as other events can also reduce the percentage of carbon-13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last=Hecht | first=J | title=Methane prime suspect for greatest mass extinction | magazine=New Scientist | date=2002-03-26 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that &quot;clathrate gun&quot; methane eruptions were involved in the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|end-Permian extinction]] (&quot;the Great Dying&quot;) and in the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions.

====Anoxic events====
[[Anoxic event]]s are situations in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen. Their causes are complex and controversial, but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming, mostly caused by sustained massive volcanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Geochemistry of oceanic anoxic events|journal = Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems|date = 2010-03-01|issn = 1525-2027|pages = Q03004|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1029/2009GC002788|first = Hugh C.|last = Jenkyns|bibcode=2010GGG....11.3004J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that anoxic events caused or contributed to the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|Ordovician–Silurian]], [[Late Devonian extinction|late Devonian]], [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] and [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event|Triassic–Jurassic]] extinctions, as well as a number of lesser extinctions (such as the [[Ireviken event|Ireviken]], [[Mulde event|Mulde]], [[Lau event|Lau]], [[Toarcian turnover|Toarcian]] and [[Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event|Cenomanian–Turonian]] events). On the other hand, there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-Cretaceous which indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass extinctions.

The [[bio-availability]] of [[Essential trace element|essential]] [[trace element]]s (in particular [[selenium]]) to potentially lethal lows has been shown to coincide with, and likely have contributed to, at least three mass extinction events in the oceans, i.e. at the end of the Ordovician, during the Middle and Late Devonian, and at the end of the Triassic. During periods of low oxygen concentrations very soluble [[selenate]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;) is converted into much less soluble [[selenide]] (Se&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), elemental Se and organo-selenium complexes. Bio-availability of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1% of the current oceanic concentration, a level that has been proven lethal to many [[Extant taxon|extant]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Long|first1= J.|last2= Large|first2= R.R.|last3= Lee|first3= M.S.Y.|last4= Benton|first4= M.

British [[oceanologist]] and [[atmospheric scientist]], [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]], explained that, while the [[Holocene|Holocene epoch]] exhibits many processes reminiscent of those that have contributed to past anoxic events, full-scale ocean anoxia would take &quot;thousands of years to develop&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Andrew J.|date=2016-12-23|title=Oceans on the edge of anoxia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=354|issue=6319|pages=1529–1530|doi=10.1126/science.aaj2321|issn=0036-8075|pmid=28008026|bibcode=2016Sci...354.1529W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hydrogen sulfide emissions from the seas====
Kump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005) have proposed that during the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] the warming also upset the oceanic balance between [[photosynthesis]]ing plankton and deep-water [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]], causing massive emissions of [[hydrogen sulfide]] which poisoned life on both land and sea and severely weakened the [[ozone layer]], exposing much of the life that still remained to fatal levels of [[UV radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Berner, R.A., and Ward, P.D. (2004). &quot;[http://www.gsajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-static&amp;name=i0091-7613-31-6-e100 Positive Reinforcement, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, and the Permo-Triassic Extinction: Comment and Reply]&quot; describes possible [[positive feedback]] loops in the catastrophic release of [[hydrogen sulfide]] proposed by Kump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kump | first1 = L.R. | last2 = Pavlov | first2 = A. | last3 = Arthur | first3 = M.A. | year = 2005 | title = Massive release of hydrogen sulfide to the surface ocean and atmosphere during intervals of oceanic anoxia | journal = Geology | volume = 33 | issue = 5| pages = 397–400 | doi=10.1130/g21295.1| bibcode = 2005Geo....33..397K }} Summarised by Ward (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ward | first1 = P.D. | year = 2006 | title = Impact from the Deep | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00037A5D-A938-150E-A93883414B7F0000&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;catID=2 | journal = Scientific American | volume =  295| issue = 4| pages = 64–71 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1006-64 | pmid = 16989482 | bibcode = 2006SciAm.295d..64W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oceanic overturn====
Oceanic overturn is a disruption of [[thermo-haline circulation]] which lets surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing anoxic deep water to the surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning or the end of a [[glaciation]], although an overturn at the start of a glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wilde | first=P | last2=Berry | first2=W.B.N. | title=Destabilization of the oceanic density structure and its significance to marine &quot;extinction&quot; events | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume=48 | issue=2–4 | pages=143–62 | year=1984 | url=http://www.marscigrp.org/ppp84.html | doi=10.1016/0031-0182(84)90041-5 | bibcode=1984PPP....48..143W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other oceanic catastrophes such as regressions (sea-level falls) and anoxic events, overturns do not leave easily identified &quot;signatures&quot; in rocks and are theoretical consequences of researchers' conclusions about other climatic and marine events.

It has been suggested that oceanic overturn caused or contributed to the [[Late Devonian extinction|late Devonian]] and [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic]] extinctions.

====A nearby nova, supernova or gamma ray burst====
A nearby [[gamma-ray burst]] (less than 6000 [[light-year]]s away) would be powerful enough to destroy the Earth's [[ozone layer]], leaving organisms vulnerable to [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]] from the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;20 ways&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=20 Ways the World Could End| publisher=Discover Magazine| author=Corey S. Powell| date=2001-10-01| accessdate=2011-03-29| url=http://discovermagazine.com/2000/oct/featworld/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;-C=| author-link=Corey S.

It has been suggested that a supernova or gamma ray burst caused the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]] extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melott &amp; Thomas 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Melott, A.L. |author2=Thomas, B.C. | year = 2009 | title = Late Ordovician geographic patterns of extinction compared with simulations of astrophysical ionizing radiation damage | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 35 | pages = 311–20 | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373-35.3.311 | issue = 3|arxiv=0809.0899 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geomagnetic reversal====
One theory is that periods of increased [[geomagnetic reversal]]s will weaken [[Earth's magnetic field]] long enough to expose the atmosphere to the [[solar wind]]s, causing oxygen ions to escape the atmosphere in a rate increased by 3–4 orders, resulting in a disastrous decrease in oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Oxygen escape from the Earth during geomagnetic reversals: Implications to mass extinction|first1=Yong|last1=Wei|first2=Zuyin|last2=Pu|first3=Qiugang|last3=Zong|first4=Weixing|last4=Wan|first5=Zhipeng|last5=Ren|first6=Markus|last6=Fraenz|first7=Eduard|last7=Dubinin|first8=Feng|last8=Tian|first9=Quanqi|last9=Shi|first10=Suiyan|last10=Fu|first11=Minghua|last11=Hong|date=1 May 2014|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=394|pages=94–98|via=NASA ADS|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2014.03.018|bibcode=2014E&amp;PSL.394...94W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plate tectonics====
Movement of the continents into some configurations can cause or contribute to extinctions in several ways: by initiating or ending [[ice age]]s; by changing ocean and wind currents and thus altering climate; by opening seaways or land bridges which expose previously isolated species to competition for which they are poorly adapted (for example, the extinction of most of South America's [[Meridiungulata|native ungulates]] and all of its [[Sparassodonta|large metatherians]] after the [[Great American Interchange|creation of a land bridge between North and South America]]). Occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent which includes the vast majority of Earth's land area, which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of [[continental shelf]] (the most species-rich part of the ocean) and produce a vast, arid continental interior which may have extreme seasonal variations.

Another theory is that the creation of the super-continent [[Pangaea]] contributed to the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|End-Permian]] mass extinction. Pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-Permian to late-Permian, and the &quot;Marine genus diversity&quot; diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time which might have qualified for inclusion in the &quot;Big Five&quot; if it were not overshadowed by the &quot;Great Dying&quot; at the end of the Permian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Speculated Causes of the Permian Extinction |publisher=Hooper Virtual Paleontological Museum |url=http://park.org/Canada/Museum/extinction/permcause.html |accessdate=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other hypotheses====
Many other hypotheses have been proposed, such as the spread of a new disease, or simple out-competition following an especially successful biological innovation. But all have been rejected, usually for one of the following reasons: they require events or processes for which there is no evidence; they assume mechanisms which are contrary to the available evidence; they are based on other theories which have been rejected or superseded.

Scientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past. Along with human-made changes in climate (see above), some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting, overfishing, invasive species, or habitat loss. A study published in May 2017 in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' argued that a “biological annihilation” akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway as a result of anthropogenic causes, such as [[Human overpopulation|over-population]] and [[Overconsumption|over-consumption]]. The study suggested that as much as 50% of the number of animal individuals that once lived on Earth were already extinct, threatening the basis for human existence too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ceballos|first=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R.|last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=2017-07-10|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|issn=0027-8424|pmc=5544311|pmid=28696295|volume=114|issue=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sutter&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Sutter|first=John D.|date=July 11, 2017|title=Sixth mass extinction: The era of 'biological annihilation'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/11/world/sutter-mass-extinction-ceballos-study/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|location= |access-date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future biosphere extinction/sterilization====
{{See also|Future of Earth| Medea hypothesis|Fermi paradox}}
The eventual warming and expanding of the Sun, combined with the eventual decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide could actually cause an even greater mass extinction, having the potential to wipe out even microbes (in other words, the Earth is completely sterilized), where rising global temperatures caused by the expanding Sun will gradually increase the rate of weathering, which in turn removes more and more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When carbon dioxide levels get too low (perhaps at 50 ppm), all plant life will die out, although simpler plants like grasses and mosses can survive much longer, until {{CO2}} levels drop to 10 ppm.&lt;ref name= Franck2005&gt;{{cite journal

With all photosynthetic organisms gone, atmospheric oxygen can no longer be replenished, and is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, perhaps from volcanic eruptions. Eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining aerobic life to die out via asphyxiation, leaving behind only simple anaerobic prokaryotes. When the Sun becomes 10% brighter in about a billion years,&lt;ref name= Franck2005/&gt; Earth will suffer a moist greenhouse effect resulting in its oceans boiling away, while the Earth's liquid outer core cools due to the inner core's expansion and causes the Earth's magnetic field to shut down. In the absence of a magnetic field, charged particles from the Sun will deplete the atmosphere and further increase the Earth's temperature to an average of ~420 K (147&amp;nbsp;°C, 296&amp;nbsp;°F) in 2.8 billion years, causing the last remaining life on Earth to die out. This is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused extinction event. Since this will only happen late in the Sun's life, such will cause the final mass extinction in Earth's history (albeit a very long extinction event).&lt;ref name= Franck2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ward2003/&gt;

==Effects and recovery==
The impact of mass extinction events varied widely. After a major extinction event, usually only [[weed#Weeds as adaptable species|weedy species]] survive due to their ability to live in diverse habitats.&lt;ref name=Quammen&gt;{{cite web |title=Planet of Weeds |author=David Quammen |work=Harper's Magazine |date=October 1998 |url= http://sep.csumb.edu/class/ESSP645/readings/Quammen%201998.pdf |accessdate=November 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, species diversify and occupy empty niches. Generally, it takes millions of years for [[biodiversity]] to recover after extinction events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190408114252.htm|title=Evolution imposes 'speed limit' on recovery after mass extinctions|website=ScienceDaily|language=en|access-date=2019-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the most severe mass extinctions it may take 15 to 30 million years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quammen&quot; /&gt;

The worst event, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic extinction]], devastated life on earth, killing over 90% of species. Life seemed to recover quickly after the P-T extinction, but this was mostly in the form of [[pioneer organism|disaster taxa]], such as the hardy ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems, with high biodiversity, complex food webs and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. It is thought that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction which inhibited recovery, as well as prolonged environmental stress which continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction;&lt;ref name=&quot;LehrmannRamezanBowring2006TimingOfRecovery&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Timing of recovery from the end-Permian extinction: Geochronologic and biostratigraphic constraints from south China | author=Lehrmann | journal=Geology |date=December 2006 | volume=34 | pages=1053–1056 | doi=10.1130/G22827A.1 | issue=12 |bibcode = 2006Geo....34.1053L | author2=D.J. | author3=Ramezan | author4=J. | author5=Bowring | author6=S.A. | display-authors=6 | last7=Payne | first7=Jonathan L. | last8=Orchard | first8=Michael J. | last9=Hongmei | first9=Wang }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30M years after the P-T extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.&lt;ref name=&quot;SahneyBenton2008RecoveryFromProfoundExtinction&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Sahney, S.|author2= Benton, M.J. |authorlink2= Michael Benton| year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65 | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent to the P-T extinction, there was an increase in provincialization, with species occupying smaller ranges – perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual rediversification.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sidor2013&quot;&gt;{{cite journal  | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1302323110  | title = Provincialization of terrestrial faunas following the end-Permian mass extinction  | year = 2013  | last1 = Sidor | first1 = C.

The effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify, given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record. Some mass extinctions (such as the end-Permian) were equally catastrophic for plants, whereas others, such as the end-Devonian, did not affect the flora.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cascales-Miñana2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cascales-Miñana | first1 = B. | last2 = Cleal | first2 = C.
