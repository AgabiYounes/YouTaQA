'''''Escape from New York'''''  (stylized on-screen as '''''John Carpenter's Escape from New York''''') is a 1981 American [[science fiction action film]] co-written, co-scored and directed by [[John Carpenter]]. It stars [[Kurt Russell]], [[Lee Van Cleef]], [[Donald Pleasence]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Adrienne Barbeau]], and [[Harry Dean Stanton]].

The film's storyline, set in the near-future world of 1997, concerns a crime-ridden [[United States]], which has converted [[Manhattan Island]] in [[New York City]] into the country's [[Types of US federal prisons|maximum-security prison]]. &quot;Once you go in you don't come out&quot;. [[Air Force One]] is hijacked by terrorists and is purposely crashed in New York City. Ex-soldier and current federal prisoner [[Snake Plissken]] (Russell) is given just 24 hours to go in and rescue the [[President of the United States]], after which, if successful, Snake will be pardoned.

Carpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on an estimated budget of $6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenumbers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phantom&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Phantom of the Movies | title=''Escape From New York'' rushes into a DVD world | work=Washington Weekend | pages=M24 | publisher=[[Washington Times]] | date=December 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Debra Hill]] and [[Larry J. Franco]] served as the producers. The film was co-written by [[Nick Castle]], who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] in ''Halloween''.

''Escape from New York'' was released in the United States on July 10, 1981. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing more than $25 million at the [[box office]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thenumbers&quot;/&gt; The film was nominated for four [[Saturn Awards]], including [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]]. The film became a [[cult classic]] and was followed by a [[sequel]], ''[[Escape from L.A.]]'' (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell, but was much less favorably received.

==Plot==
In 1988, following a 400% increase in crime, the United States has turned Manhattan into a giant maximum-security prison. A {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} wall surrounds the island, bridges have been [[Land mine|mined]], and all prisoners are sentenced to life terms.

In 1997, [[NATO]] is engaged in an escalating war with the [[Soviet Union]] across much of Europe, which threatens to become a [[nuclear holocaust]]. While traveling to a peace summit, Air Force One is hijacked by a domestic terrorist posing as a flight attendant. The president is given a tracking bracelet and is handcuffed to his briefcase, containing a [[cassette tape]] describing the secret to using nuclear [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] for electricity generation, intended to be a peace offering. He ejects in an [[escape pod]], landing in Manhattan just before the plane crashes.

Police are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the overall [[crime boss]], warns that the Duke has the president, who will be killed if any further rescue attempts are made. Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake Plissken, a former [[United States Special Operations Forces|Special Forces]] soldier convicted of attempting to rob the [[Federal Reserve]]. If Snake rescues the president and the cassette tape, Hauk will arrange a [[presidential pardon]]. To ensure his compliance, Hauk has Plissken injected with micro-explosives that will rupture his arteries within 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.

Snake uses a stealth glider to land atop the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. He follows the tracking bracelet to a [[vaudeville]] theater, only to find it on the wrist of an insane old man. Convinced the president is dead, Snake radios Hauk but is told that he will be shot down if he comes out empty-handed.

Snake meets &quot;Cabbie,&quot; who remained in Manhattan after it became a prison and now drives an armored taxi. Cabbie takes Snake to Harold &quot;Brain&quot; Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake. Brain is a brilliant engineer and has established an oil well and a small refinery, fueling the city's remaining cars. Brain tells Snake that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the [[Queensboro Bridge]] by using the president as a human shield and following a landmine map that Brain has drawn up. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's compound at [[Grand Central Terminal]]. Snake finds the president but is captured.

While Snake is forced to fight in a [[deathmatch]] against &quot;Slag,&quot; Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the president. Snake kills Slag, and takes Brain, Maggie, and the president to the top of the World Trade Center to escape in the glider. After a band of crazies destroys it, the group returns to street level and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge. When Cabbie reveals that he bartered with Romero for the cassette tape, the president demands it, but Snake takes it.

The Duke pursues them onto the bridge in his customized Cadillac, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Cabbie, but they hit a mine, and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain is killed by another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, shooting at Duke's car until she is run down. Snake and the president reach the wall, and guards raise up the president via a rope. The Duke opens fire, killing the guards, but the president kills the Duke with a dead guard's assault rifle. Snake is lifted to safety, and the micro-explosives are neutralized after he hands over the cassette tape to Hauk.

As the president prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake and tells him that he can have anything he wants. All Snake wants to know is how the president feels about the people who died saving him. The president offers only half-hearted regret and lip service for their sacrifice. As Snake walks away in disgust, Hauk offers him a job as his deputy, but Snake just keeps walking. The president's live speech commences, and he plays the cassette tape. To his embarrassment, it only plays Cabbie's song, &quot;[[Bandstand Boogie]].&quot; As Snake continues to walk away, he unravels the real cassette tape, containing the president's intended message and deliberately shredding it.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
Carpenter originally wrote the screenplay for ''Escape from New York'' in 1976, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, &quot;The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President. I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it because, according to Carpenter, &quot;it was too dark, too violent, too scary, and too weird.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yakir |first=Dan |title='Escape' Gives Us Liberty |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 4, 1980 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/nypost801014.html |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317210916/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/nypost801014.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been inspired by the film ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]'', which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy, but liked how it conveyed &quot;the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science-fiction film along these lines&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maronie |first=Samuel J. |title=On the Set with ''Escape from New York'' |pages= |magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=45 |date=April 1981 |url=&lt;!-- Keeping dead link for ref, no archive version: http://www.sphosting.com/theefnypage/pressontheset.htm --&gt;| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFI agreed to provide 50% of the budget. Goldcrest Films signed a deal with them. They ended up providing £720,000 of the budget and making a profit of £672,000 from their investment after earning £1,392,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pages=59, 655|title=My indecision is final|first1=Jake|last1= Eberts |first2=Terry|last2=Illott|year=1990 |publisher=Faber and Faber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]], the film's financial backer, preferred either [[Charles Bronson]] or [[Tommy Lee Jones]] to play the role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the &quot;lightweight&quot; screen image conveyed by his roles in several [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as &quot;a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of [[Bruce Lee]], [[The Exterminator]], and [[Darth Vader]], with [[Clint Eastwood|Eastwood]]'s vocal-ness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan |first=Richard |title=Kurt Russell Rides a New Wave in ''Escape'' Film |magazine=[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]] |year=1980 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317172535/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/circus1980.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is &quot;the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is.&quot; Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the [[eyepatch]] between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his [[depth perception]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldberg, Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldberg |first=Lee |title=Kurt Russell&amp;nbsp;— Two-Fisted Hero |pages= |magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=108 |date=July 1986 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-production===
Carpenter had just made ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'', but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making ''Escape'' later. After the success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', Avco-Embassy signed  producer Debra Hill and him  to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was ''[[The Fog]]''. Initially, the second film  he was going to make to finish the contract was ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment (movie)|The Philadelphia Experiment]]'', but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt something was missing and recalls, &quot;This was basically a straight [[action film]]. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swires, Steve&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swires |first=Steve |title=John Carpenter |pages=  |magazine=[[Starlog]] |date=July 1981 |number=48 |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film-school days at [[University of Southern California]], who played &quot;[[Michael Myers (Halloween)|The Shape]]&quot; in ''Halloween''. Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Launch of a giddy fantasy a director reaches for the stars with computer aid |last=Ryan |first=Desmond |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=July 14, 1984 |page=D01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semidestroyed version of New York City on a shoe-string budget. The film's production designer [[Joe Alves]] and he rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot, but Alves nixed that idea &quot;because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beeler, Michael&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Beeler

Bernardi suggested [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], because it was filled with old buildings &quot;that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality&quot; that the team was looking for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maronie |first=Samuel J. |title=From ''Forbidden Planet'' to ''Escape from New York'': A candid conversation with SFX &amp; production designer Joe Alves |magazine=[[Starlog]] |number=46 |date=May 1981 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/starlog8105.html |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317172834/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/starlog8105.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous [[St. Louis, Missouri]], had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, &quot;block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places, there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beeler, Michael&quot;/&gt; Also, Alves found an old bridge to double for the &quot;69th St. Bridge&quot;. The filmmaker purchased the [[Chain of Rocks Bridge|Old Chain of Rocks Bridge]] for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, &quot;so that they wouldn't have any liability,&quot; Hill remembers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beeler, Michael&quot;/&gt; Locations across the river in St. Louis were used, including [[Union Station (St. Louis)|Union Station]] and the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]], both of which have since been renovated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Show Me the movies|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=April 17, 2005|author=Williams, Joe|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the building that would eventually become the [[Saint Louis Brewery#Downtown|Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery]].

===Filming===
Carpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to 10 blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. &quot;We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swires, Steve&quot;/&gt; The [[gladiatorial]] fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, &quot;That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [spiked] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Naha | first = Ed | title = Escape From New York | publisher = Future Life (#30) | date = November 1981 | url = http://www.theefnylapage.com/articles/Future%20Life%201981.pdf }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in [[Los Angeles]]. Various interior scenes were shot on a [[sound stage]]; the final scenes were shot at the [[Sepulveda Dam]], in [[Sherman Oaks]]. New York served as a location, as did [[Atlanta]], to use their [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|futuristic-looking rapid-transit system]] (the latter scenes were cut from the final film).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=St. Louis Q&amp;A|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|author=Berger, Jerry|date=February 5, 1995|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to [[Liberty Island]]. &quot;We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the [[Statue of Liberty]] at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborne, Robert&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Osborne |first=Robert |title=On Location |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 24, 1980 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/reporter801024.html |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317172451/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/reporter801024.html |archivedate=March 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Escape From New York Wireframe.jpg|thumb|The simulated wire-frame effect]]
Carpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. &quot;One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences, which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborne, Robert&quot;/&gt; Certain [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte paintings]] were rendered by [[James Cameron]], who was at the time a special-effects artist with [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]]. Cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, three screens on his control panel display [[wire-frame model|wireframe]] animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under [[black light]], with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a three-dimensional [[Wire frame model|wireframe animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Escape from New York (Special Edition)|date=2003|people=Atkins, Tom; Barbeau, Adrienne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/article_19140_8-movie-special-effects-you-wont-believe-arent-cgi.html|title=8 Movie Special Effects You Didn't Know Weren't CGI: Classic|website=Cracked.com|access-date=July 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Escape from New York'' opened in New York and Los Angeles July 10, 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;afi&quot; /&gt; The film grossed $25.2 million in American theaters in summer 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenumbers&quot;/&gt; The film received generally positive reviews. As of October 4, 2019, it had an 85% positive rating at the film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 62 reviews, with the critical consensus: &quot;Featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis, ''Escape from New York'' is a strange, entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness&quot;. ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine wrote of Carpenter: &quot;[He has a] deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility&amp;nbsp;- which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=A Helluva Town |magazine=[[Newsweek]] |date=July 27, 1981 |url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/newsweek810727.html |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319005440/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/newsweek810727.html |archivedate=March 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, [[Richard Corliss]] wrote, &quot;John Carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity: to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia.

[[Cyberpunk]] pioneer [[William Gibson]] credits the film as an influence on his 1984 science fiction novel ''[[Neuromancer]]''. &quot;I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didn't you?'

Abrams]], producer of the 2008 film ''[[Cloverfield]]'', mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the [[Statue of Liberty]] crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for ''Escape from New York''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Commentary: Filmmakers enjoy laying waste to New York|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|author=Eberson, Sharon|date=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked Snake Plissken #29 in their &quot;The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot; poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The 100 Greatest Movie Characters | magazine = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=71 | accessdate = December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DVD releases===
''Escape from New York'' was released on DVD twice by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK). One MGM release is a barebones edition containing just the theatrical trailer. Another version is the Collector's Edition, a two-disc set featuring a high definition remastered transfer with a 5.1 Stereo audio track, two commentaries (one by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, another by producer Debra Hill and Joe Alves), a making-of featurette, the first issue of a comic book series titled ''John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles'', and the 10-minute Colorado bank robbery deleted opening sequence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Netherby&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Netherby| first = Jennifer| title = Escape to a special edition| journal = Video Business| volume = 23| issue = 34| page = 8| date = August 25, 2003| publisher = Reed Business Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MGM's special edition of the 1981 film was not released until 2003 because the original negative had gone missing. The workprint containing deleted scenes finally turned up in the [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], salt-mine film depository.  The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a [[backstory]]. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: &quot;After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hulse&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hulse| first = Ed| title = A newfound ''Escape''| journal = Video Business| volume = 23| issue = 47| page = 33| date = November 24, 2003| publisher = Reed Business Information| issn=0279-571X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=August 28, 2008|url=http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4592016|title= Escape From New York (UMD Video For PSP)  |publisher=Wal-Mart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
===Novelization===
In 1981, [[Bantam Books]] published a movie tie-in [[novelization]] written by [[Mike McQuay]] that adopts a lean, humorous style reminiscent of the film. The novel is significant because it includes scenes that were cut out of the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides motivation and backstory to Snake and Hauk&amp;nbsp;— both disillusioned war veterans&amp;nbsp;— deepening their relationship that was only hinted at it in the film. The novel explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for [[Leningrad]] in [[World War III]], how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazy son, who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel fleshes out the world in which these characters exist, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. The book explains that the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] is a no-man's land, and the country's population is gradually being driven crazy by nerve gas as a result of World War III.&lt;ref name=&quot;McQuay&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McQuay |first=Mike |title=Escape from New York |publisher=Bantam Books |date=May 1981 |location= |pages= |isbn=0-553-25375-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic books===
[[Marvel Comics]] released the one-shot ''The Adventures of Snake Plissken'' in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between ''Escape from New York'' and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in ''Escape from L.A.'' Snake has robbed [[Atlanta]]'s [[Centers for Disease Control]] of some engineered [[Metavirus|metaviruses]] and is looking for buyers in [[Chicago]]. Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As ATACS shuts down, it can only ask him, &quot;Why?&quot; Snake just walks off, answering, &quot;I don't need the competition&quot;.

In 2003, [[CrossGen]] published ''[[John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles (comics)|John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles]]'', a four-part [[comic book]] miniseries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=2168 |title=Snake Strikes Early! 'John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles' #1 Hits The Streets One Month Early! |website=Comic Book Resources |date=May 22, 2003 |accessdate=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story takes place a day or so after the events of ''Escape from New York''. Snake has been given a military [[Humvee]] after his presidential pardon and makes his way to [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]. Although the director's cut of ''Escape from New York'' shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, ''[[Captain Ron]]''). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob, who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed [[shootout]]. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying [[Jackie Kennedy]], leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.

In 2014, [[BOOM!
