'''Ellis Island''' is a [[Federal government of the United States|federally]] owned [[island]] in [[New York Harbor]] that contains a museum and former [[immigration]] inspection station. As the [[United States]]' busiest immigrant inspection station from 1892 to 1954, it processed approximately 12 million [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the country]] through the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]]. Today, it is part of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], accessible to the public only by ferry. The north side of the island hosts the museum of immigration while the south side, including the [[Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital]], is only open to the public through guided tours.

In the 19th century, Ellis Island was the site of Fort Gibson, a component of the fortifications of New York Harbor. It later became a [[Magazine (artillery)#Naval magazines|naval magazine]] for storing artillery. The first inspection station opened in 1892 and was destroyed by fire in 1897. The second station opened in 1900 and housed facilities for medical quarantines as well as processing immigrants. After 1924, Ellis Island was used primarily as a detention center. During both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] its facilities were also used by the United States military to detain prisoners of war. Following the immigration station's closure, the buildings languished for several years until they partially reopened in 1976. The main building and adjacent structures were completely renovated in 1990.

The {{convert|27.5|acre|ha|abbr=|adj=on}} island was greatly expanded by [[land reclamation]] between the late 1890s and the 1930s. Jurisdictional disputes between [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] persisted until 1998, when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[New Jersey v. New York]]'' that the {{convert|3.3|acre}} that comprise the original island and its environs are part of New York and that almost all of the reclaimed land is part of New Jersey.

==Geography and access==
Ellis Island is in [[Upper New York Bay]] within [[New York Harbor]], east of [[Liberty State Park]] and north of [[Liberty Island]]. While most of the island is in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], a small section is an [[exclave]] of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Hagstrom Map Company, Inc|isbn=978-0-88097-763-0|title=Hudson County New Jersey Street Map|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ERIS&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Richard G.|last=Castagna|first2=Lawrence L.|last2=Thornton|first3=John M.|last3=Tyrawski|title=GIS and Coastal Boundary Disputes: Where is Ellis Island?|publisher=ESRI|url=http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap138/p138.htm|accessdate=November 17, 2013|quote=The New York portion of Ellis Island is landlocked, enclaved within New Jersey's territory.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018003341/http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc99/proceed/papers/pap138/p138.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;The island has a land area of {{convert|27.5|acre|ha}}, much of which is from [[land reclamation]].

=== Land expansion ===
Initially, much of the Upper New York Bay's western shore consisted of large [[Mudflat|tidal flats]] with vast [[Oyster|oyster beds]], which were a major source of food for the Lenape. Ellis Island was one of three &quot;Oyster Islands,&quot; the other two being [[Liberty Island]] and the now-destroyed [[Black Tom explosion#Black Tom Island|Black Tom Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=New Jersey.

The fill was acquired from the ballast of ships, as well as material excavated from the [[Early history of the IRT subway|first line]] of the [[New York City Subway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Statue of Liberty NM -- Ellis Island|website=National Parks of New York Harbor (U.S. National Park Service)|date=May 11, 1965|url=https://www.nps.gov/npnh/learn/news/fact-sheet-elis.htm | access-date=May 1, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also came from the [[Rail yard|railyards]] of the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] and the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]]. It eventually obliterated the oyster beds, engulfed one of the Oyster Islands, and brought the shoreline much closer to the others.&lt;ref name=&quot;supreme.justia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite court|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/209/473/case.html|litigants=Central R.

The current island is shaped like a &quot;C&quot;, with two landmasses of equal size on the northeastern and southwestern sides, separated by what was formerly a ferry pier.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI-EIS p. 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt; It was originally three separate islands. The current north side, formerly called island 1, contains the original island and the fill around it. The current south side was composed of island 2, created in 1899, and island 3, created in 1906. Two eastward-facing ferry docks separated the three numbered landmasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI-EIS p. 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/elis/learn/education/upload/9-12-Ellis-Island-Map.pdf|title=Structural Development of Ellis Island, 1890-1935|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=June 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fill was retained with a system of wood piles and cribbing, and later encased with more than 7,700 linear feet of concrete and granite sea wall. It was placed atop either wood piles, cribbing, or submerged bags of concrete. In the 1920s, the second ferry basin between islands 2 and 3 was infilled to create the great lawn, forming the current south side of Ellis Island. As part of the project, a concrete and granite seawall was built to connect the tip of these landmasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Stakely|2003|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State sovereignty dispute===
[[File:EllisIslandMapOSM.png|thumb|left|A map showing the territorial division of acreage]]

The circumstances which led to an exclave of New York being located within New Jersey began in the colonial era, after the British takeover of [[New Netherland]] in 1664. A clause in the colonial land grant outlined the territory that the proprietors of [[New Jersey]] would receive as being &quot;westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See:

As early as 1804, attempts were made to resolve the status of the state line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ellis Island Its Legal Status|publisher=General Services Administration Office of General Counsel|date=February 28, 1963|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/stli/ellis_island_legal.pdf|accessdate=September 25, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831182303/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/stli/ellis_island_legal.pdf|archivedate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[City of New York]] claimed the right to regulate trade on all waters. This was contested in ''[[Gibbons v.

New Jersey contended that the artificial portions of the island were part of New Jersey, since they were outside New York's border. In 1956, after the closure of the U.S. immigration station two years prior, the then-[[Mayor of Jersey City]], [[Bernard J. Berry]], commandeered a U.S. Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Logan|first=Andy|author2=McCarten, John|title=Invasion from Jersey|magazine=The New Yorker|date=January 14, 1956|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1956/01/14/1956_01_14_019_TNY_CARDS_000252353|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the island remained in federal ownership after the lawsuit, New Jersey and New York agreed to share jurisdiction over the land itself. Neither state would take any fiscal or physical responsibility for the maintenance, preservation, or improvement of any of the historic properties, and each state would have jurisdiction over its respective land areas.

The present-day Ellis Island was created by retreating glaciers at the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] about 15,000 years ago.

Immediately after the end of the War of 1812, Fort Gibson was largely used as a recruiting depot. The fort went into decline due to under-utilization, and it was being jointly administered by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] by the mid-1830s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 18&quot; /&gt; Around this time, in 1834, the extant portions of Ellis Island was declared to be an exclave of New York within the waters of New Jersey.&lt;ref name=&quot;:16&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 18&quot; /&gt; The era of joint administration was short-lived: the Army took over the fort's administration in 1841, demoted the fort to an artillery battery, and stopped [[garrison]]ing the fort, leaving a small Navy guard outside the magazine. By 1854, Battery Gibson contained an 11-gun battery, three naval magazines, a short railroad line, and several auxiliary structures such as a cookhouse, gun carriage house, and officers' quarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 19&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Stakely|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army continued to maintain the fort until 1860, when it abandoned the weapons at Battery Gibson.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:14&quot; /&gt; The artillery magazine was expanded in 1861, during the [[American Civil War]], and part of the parapet was removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 19&quot; /&gt;

It is made of a steel [[Framing (construction)|frame]], with a [[facade]] of red brick in [[Brickwork|Flemish bond]] ornamented with [[limestone]] trim.&lt;ref name=&quot;:18&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 1082&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Historic Structure Report: The Main Building|1988|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure is located {{Convert|8|ft|m|abbr=}} above the mean waterline to prevent flooding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely pp. 38-39&quot; /&gt; The building was initially composed of a three-story center section with two-story east and west wings, though the third stories of each wing were completed in the early 1910s. Atop the corners of the building's central section are four towers capped by [[cupola]]s of copper cladding.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Historic Structure Report: The Main Building|1988|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 35&quot;/&gt; Some 160 rooms were included within the original design to separate the different functions of the building. Namely, the first floor was initially designed to handle baggage, detention, offices, storage and waiting rooms; the second floor, primary inspection; and the third floor, dormitories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau pp. 1219-1220&quot; /&gt; However, in practice, these spaces generally served multiple functions throughout the immigration station's operating history. At opening, it was estimated that the main building could inspect 5,000 immigrants per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 142&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Historic Structure Report: The Main Building|1988|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1900/12/03/archives/new-immigrant-station-will-be-ready-for-use-by-december-15-striking.html|title=New Immigrant Station; Will Be Ready for Use by December 15|date=December 3, 1900|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 6, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main building's design was highly acclaimed; at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Exposition]], it received a gold medal, and other architectural publications such as the ''Architectural Record'' lauded the design.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI Main Designation p. 6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Ellis Island Main Building Interior Designation Report|1993|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entrance canopy can be seen in the foreground, and the three arches of the south facade, as well as two of the ornamental towers, can be seen in the background.]]

The first floor contained detention rooms, social service offices, and waiting rooms on its west wing, a use that remained relatively unchanged.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 31&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Historic Structure Report: The Main Building|1988|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central space was initially a baggage room until 1907, but was subsequently subdivided and later re-combined into a single records room.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 31&quot; /&gt; The first floor's east wing also contained a railroad waiting room and medical offices, though much of the wing was later converted to record rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 34&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Historic Structure Report: The Main Building|1988|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; A railroad ticket office annex was added to the north side of the first floor in 1905-1906.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 35&quot; /&gt; The south elevation of the first floor contains the current immigration museum's main entrance, approached by a slightly sloped passageway covered by a glass canopy. Though the canopy was added in the 1980s, it evokes the design of an earlier glass canopy on the site that existed from 1902 to 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 362&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 1082&quot;/&gt;

A {{Convert|200|by|100|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} registry room, with a {{Convert|56|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} ceiling, is located on the central section of the second floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 142&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EI Main Designation p. 7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Ellis Island Main Building Interior Designation Report|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The room was used for primary inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/14/arts/review-architecture-gateway-to-america-is-once-again-ready-to-greet-the-masses.html|title=Review/Architecture; Gateway to America Is Once Again Ready To Greet the Masses|last=Goldberger|first=Paul|date=August 14, 1990|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 11, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 34&quot; /&gt; Initially, there were handrails within the registry room that separated the primary inspection into several queues, but {{Circa|}} 1911 these were replaced with benches. A staircase from the first floor formerly rose into the middle of the registry room, but this was also removed around 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI Main Designation p. 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 162&quot;/&gt; When the room's roof collapsed during the Black Tom explosion of 1916, the current [[Guastavino tile|Guastavino-tiled]] arched ceiling was installed, and the asphalt floor was replaced with red Ludowici tile.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 17&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EI Main Designation p. 7&quot; /&gt; There are three large arched openings each on the northern and southern walls, filled-in with grilles of metal-and-glass. The southern elevation retains its original double-height arches, while the lower sections of the arches on the northern elevations were modified to make way for the railroad ticket office.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 111&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 35&quot; /&gt; On all four sides of the room, above the level of the third floor, is a [[clerestory]] of semicircular windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI Main Designation p. 7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 111&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 35&quot; /&gt; The east wing of the second floor was used for administrative offices,&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 35&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Historic Structure Report: The Main Building|1988|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the west wing housed the special inquiry and deportation divisions, as well as dormitories.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 34&quot; /&gt;

On the third floor is a balcony surrounding the entire registry room.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI Main Designation p. 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau pp. 1219-1220&quot; /&gt; There were also dormitories for 600 people on the third floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 142&quot; /&gt; Between 1914 and 1918, several rooms were added to the third floor. These rooms included offices as well as an assembly room that were later converted to detention.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 35&quot; /&gt;

The remnants of Fort Gibson still exist outside the main building. Two portions are visible to the public, including the remnants of the lower walls around the fort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 362&quot; /&gt;

==== Kitchen and laundry ====
[[File:Ellis Island National Monument ELIS8314.jpg|thumb|Undated photo of southern facade of kitchen and laundry]]
The kitchen and laundry structure is a two-and-a-half-story structure located west of the main building.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 2&quot; /&gt; It is made of a steel frame and terracotta blocks, with a [[granite]] base and a facade of brick in Flemish bond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 37&quot; /&gt; Originally designed as two separate structures, it was redesigned in 1899 as a single structure with kitchen-restaurant and laundry-bathhouse components,&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau pp. 1221-1222&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Unrau|1984|pp=1221–1222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently completed in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 40&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 37&quot; /&gt; A one-and-a-half-story ice plant on the northern elevation was built between 1903 and 1908, and was converted into a ticket office in 1935. It has a facade of brick in English and stretcher bond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 37&quot; /&gt; Today, the kitchen and laundry contains NPS offices&lt;ref name=&quot;EI-EIS p. 80&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island EIS|2005|ps=.|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the museum's ''Peopling of America'' exhibit.&lt;ref name=&quot;:40&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/05/20/408157318/recent-immigrants-find-ellis-island-still-relevant|title=For New Immigrants To The U.S., Ellis Island Still Means A Lot|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=June 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building has a central portion with a narrow [[gable roof]], as well as pavilions on the western and eastern sides with [[hip roof]]s; the roof tiling was formerly of slate and currently of terracotta. The larger eastern pavilion, which contained the laundry-bathhouse, had hipped [[dormer]]s. The exterior-facing window and door openings contain limestone features on the facade, while the top of the building has a [[modillion]]ed copper [[cornice]]. Formerly, there was also a two-story porch on the southern elevation. Multiple enclosed passageways connect the kitchen and laundry to adjacent structures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 37&quot; /&gt;

==== Bakery and carpentry shop ====
The bakery and carpentry shop is a two-story structure located west of the kitchen and laundry building. It is roughly rectangular and oriented north-south.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 2&quot; /&gt; It is made of a steel frame with a granite base, a flat roof, and a facade of brick in Flemish bond. The building was constructed in 1914-1915 to replace the separate wooden bakery and carpentry shop buildings, as well as two sheds and a frame waiting room. There are no exterior entrances, and the only access is via the kitchen and laundry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 40&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau p. 1247&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Unrau|1984|p=1247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first floor generally contained oven rooms, baking areas and storage while the second floor contained the carpentry shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau p. 1247&quot; /&gt;

==== Baggage and dormitory ====
[[File:New York City Ellis Island 04.jpg|thumb|View from the north; the baggage and dormitory (right) is west of the main building (left)]]
The baggage and dormitory structure is a three-story structure located north of the main building.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 2&quot; /&gt; It is made of a steel frame and terracotta blocks, with a limestone base and a facade of brick in Flemish bond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 38&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completed as a two-story structure {{Circa|1908–1909}},&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 15&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 25&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 57&quot; /&gt; the baggage and dormitory building replaced a 700-bed wooden barracks nearby that operated between 1903 and 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 38&quot; /&gt; The baggage and dormitory initially had baggage collection on its first floor, dormitories and detention rooms on its second floor, and a tiled garden on its roof.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 38&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau pp. 1244-1245&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Unrau|1984|pp=1244–1245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building received a third story, and a two-story annex to the north side, in 1913-1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 38&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau pp. 1244-1245&quot; /&gt; Initially, the third floor included additional dormitory space while the annex provided detainees with outdoor porch space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau pp. 1244-1245&quot; /&gt; A detainee dining room on the first floor was expanded in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau p. 1247&quot; /&gt;

The building is mostly rectangular except for its northern annex and contains an interior [[courtyard]], [[skylight]]ed at the second floor. On its facade the first story has rectangular windows in arched window openings while the second and third stories have rectangular windows and window openings. There are cornices below the second and third stories. The annex contains wide window openings with narrow brick [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] outside them. The roof's northwest corner contains a one-story extension. Multiple wings connect the baggage and laundry to its adjacent buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 38&quot; /&gt;

==== Powerhouse ====
The powerhouse of Ellis Island is a two-story structure located north of the kitchen and laundry building and west of the baggage and dormitory building. It is roughly rectangular and oriented north-south.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 2&quot; /&gt; Like the kitchen and laundry, it was completed in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 40&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 39&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau p. 1223&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Unrau|1984|p=1223}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of a steel frame with a granite base, a facade of brick in Flemish bond, and decorative bluestone and limestone elements. The hip roof contains dormers and is covered with terracotta tiling. A brick smokestack rises {{Convert|111|ft|m|abbr=}} from ground level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 38&quot; /&gt;

Formerly, the powerhouse provided almost all power for Ellis Island. A [[coal trestle]] at the northwest end was used to transport [[coal]] for power generation from 1901 to 1932, when the powerhouse started using fuel oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 38&quot; /&gt; The powerhouse also generated steam for the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 232&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Historic Structure Report: The Main Building|1988|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the immigration station closed, the powerhouse deteriorated&lt;ref name=&quot;:28&quot; /&gt; and was left unrepaired until the 1980s renovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 111&quot; /&gt; The powerhouse is no longer operational; instead, the island receives power from 13,200-[[volt]] cables that lead from a [[Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Company|Public Service Electric &amp; Gas]] [[Electrical substation|substation]] in Liberty State Park. The powerhouse contains sewage pumps that can dispose of up to {{Convert|480|gal/min|L/min|abbr=|sp=us}} to the Jersey City Sewage Authority sewage system. A central heating plant was installed during the 1980s renovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI-EIS p. 87&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island EIS|2005|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South side ===
{{see also|Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital}}

The southern side of Ellis Island, located across the ferry basin from the northern side, is composed of island 2 (created in 1899) and island 3 (created in 1906).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 51&quot; /&gt; The entire southern side of the island is in New Jersey, and the majority of the site is occupied by the hospital buildings. A central corridor runs southward from the ferry building on the west side of the island. Two additional corridors split eastward down the centers of islands 2 and 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI-EIS p. 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt;

==== Island 2 ====
Island 2 comprises the northern part of Ellis Island's southern portion. The structures share the same design: a brick facade in Flemish bond, [[quoin]]s, and limestone ornamentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 502&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 51&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli pp. 52-54&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|pp=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; All structures were internally connected via covered passageways.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI-EIS p. 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt;[[File:Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital - Smith Drum.jpg|thumb|A Smith Drum laundry machine in the outbuilding]]The laundry-hospital outbuilding is south of the ferry terminal, and was constructed in 1900-1901 along with the now-demolished surgeon's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 43&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 502&quot; /&gt; The structure is one and a half stories tall with a hip roof and skylights facing to the north and south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 502&quot; /&gt; Repaired repeatedly throughout its history,&lt;ref name=&quot;:44&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.ny2078.sheet/?sp=4|title=4.

To the east is the psychopathic ward, a two-story building erected 1906–1907.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 44&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau p. 1249&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Unrau|1984|p=1249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:45&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ny2378/|title=Ellis Island, Psychopathic Ward, New York Harbor, New York County, NY|last=Historic American Buildings Survey|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|access-date=June 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is the only structure in the hospital complex to have a flat roof, and formerly also had a porch to its south.&lt;ref name=&quot;:45&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 51&quot; /&gt; It housed 25 to 30 beds and was intended for the temporary treatment of immigrants suspected of being insane or having mental disorders, pending their deportation, hospitalization, or commitment to sanatoria. Male and female patients were segregated, and there were also a dayroom, veranda, nurse's office, and small pantry on each floor. In 1952 the psychopathic ward was converted into a Coast Guard [[brig]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Forgotten Ellis Island2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/program/forgotten-ellis-island/|title=Forgotten Ellis Island|last1=Conway|first1=Lorie|publisher=PBS Films|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 51&quot; /&gt;

The main building is directly east of the psychopathic ward. It is composed of three similarly designed structures: from west to east, they are Hospital Building No. 1 (built 1900-1901), the Administration Building (1905-1907), and Hospital Building No. 2 (1908-1909).&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 43&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli pp. 52-54&quot; /&gt; The 3.5-story building no. 1 is shaped like an inverted &quot;C&quot; with two 2.5-story rectangular wings facing southward; the wings contain two-story-tall porches. The administration building is smaller but also 3.5 stories. The 3.5-story building no. 2 is similar to building no. 1, but also has a three-story porch at the south elevation of the central pavilion. All three buildings have stone-stoop entrances on their north facades and courtyards on their south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli pp. 52-54&quot; /&gt;

==== Recreation hall ====
The recreation hall and one of the island's two recreation shelters are located between islands 2 and 3 on the western side of Ellis Island, at the head of the former ferry basin between the two landmasses.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI-EIS p. 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt; Built in 1937 in the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] style, the structures replaced an earlier recreation building at the northeast corner of island 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 84&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Stakely|2003|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:46&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ny2379/|title=Ellis Island, Recreation Building, New York Harbor, New York County, NY|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=June 14, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 55&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recreation hall is a two-story building with a limestone base, a facade of brick in Flemish bond, a gable roof, and terracotta ornamentation. The first floor contained recreational facilities, while the second floor was used mostly for offices. It contains wings on the north, south, and west. The recreation shelter, a one-story brick pavilion, is located directly to the east.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 55&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau p. 1259&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Unrau|1984|p=1259}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second shelter of similar design was located adjacent to the power plant on the island's north side.&lt;ref name=&quot;:46&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau p. 1259&quot; /&gt;

==== Island 3 ====
[[File:Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital - Isolation Ward.jpg|thumb|Isolation ward on island 3]]
The contagious disease hospital comprised 17 pavilions, connected with a central connecting corridor. Each pavilion contained separate hospital functions that could be sealed off from each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;EI-EIS p. 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPS-Map&quot; /&gt; Most of the structures were completed in 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stakely p. 65&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 162&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 58&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pavilions included eight measles wards, three isolation wards, a power house/sterilizer/autopsy theater, mortuary, laboratory, administration building, kitchen, and staff house. All structures were designed by James Knox Taylor in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style and are distinguished by red-tiled hip roofs, [[roughcast]] walls of [[stucco]], and ornamentation of brick and limestone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 58&quot; /&gt;

The office building and laboratory is a 2.5-story structure located at the west end of island 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 59&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Robins|Urbanelli|1993|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; It housed doctors' offices and a [[dispensary]] on the first floor, along with a laboratory and pharmacists' quarters on the second floor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robins Urbanelli p. 59&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau p. 1254&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Unrau|1984|p=1254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the first floor offices were converted into male nurses' quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/hhh.ny2080.sheet/?sp=7|title=7.

====Interviews====
According to a reconstruction of immigration processes in 1907, immigrants who passed the initial inspections spent two to five hours at Ellis Island.

Anti-immigrant sentiments developed in the U.S. during and after World War I, especially toward Southern and Eastern Europeans who were entering the country in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/closing-the-door-on-immigration.htm|title=Closing the Door on Immigration (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov|language=en|access-date=June 10, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Unrau pp. 110-113&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ps=.|Unrau|1984|pp=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Immigration Act of 1924, primary inspection was moved to New York Harbor, and Ellis Island only hosted immigrants that were to be detained or deported.&lt;ref name=&quot;HSR Main p. 19&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:23&quot; /&gt; After the passage of the 1924 act, the Immigration Service established multiple classes of people who were said to be &quot;deportable&quot;.

===Eugenic influence===

When immigration through Ellis Island peaked, [[Eugenics|eugenic]] ideals gained broad popularity and made heavy impact on [[immigration to the United States]] by way of exclusion of [[Disability|disabled]] and &quot;morally defective&quot; people. Eugenicists of the late 19th and early 20th century believed human [[Selective breeding|reproductive selection]] should be carried out by the state as a collective decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defectives in the Land : Disability and Immigration in the Age of Eugenics|last=Baynton|first=Douglas C.|date=August 12, 2016|publisher=Chicago; London: The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-36433-9|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many eugenicists, this was considered a patriotic duty as they held an interest in creating a greater national race. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]]'s opening words to the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York Evening Journal]]'' in 1911 were, &quot;As a biologist as well as a patriot...,&quot; on the subject on advocating for tighter inspections of immigrants of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goddard 1911&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_x_TAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=feeblemindedness#v=onepage&amp;q=feeblemindedness&amp;f=false|title=Heredity of Feeble-mindedness|last=Goddard|first=Henry Herbert|date=1911|publisher=Eugenics Record Office|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugenic selection occurred on two distinguishable levels:
* State/Local levels which handles [[Institutionalisation|institutionalization]] and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of those considered defective as well as the education of the public; marriage laws; and social pressures such as fitter-family and better-baby contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/science/haunted-files-the-eugenics-record-office-recreates-a-dark-time-in-a-laboratorys-past.html|title=When Racism Was a Science|last=Krisch|first=Joshua A.|date=October 13, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 11, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Immigration control, the screening of immigrants for defects, was notably supported by [[Harry H. Laughlin|Harry Laughlin]], superintendent of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] from 1910 to 1939, who stated that this was where the &quot;federal government must cooperate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vQui2N4VxDkC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22federal+government+must+cooperate.%22+laughlin#v=onepage&amp;q=%22federal%20government%20must%20cooperate.%22%20laughlin&amp;f=false|title=Biology and Ideology from Descartes to Dawkins|last=Alexander|first=Denis R.|last2=Numbers|first2=Ronald L.|date=May 15, 2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226608426|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it was a broadly popular idea that immigration policies had ought to be based on eugenics principles in order to help create a &quot;superior race&quot; in America. To do this, defective persons needed to be screened by immigration officials and denied entry on the basis of their disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bateman-House|first1=A.|last2=Fairchild|first2=A.|date=April 1, 2008|others=Bateman-House, Alison, Fairchild, Amy|title=Medical Examination of Immigrants at Ellis Island|journal=Virtual Mentor|volume=10|issue=4|pages=235–241|doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2008.10.4.mhst1-0804|pmid=23206915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Physical&amp;nbsp;– people who had hereditary or acquired physical disability. These included sickness and [[disease]], [[deformity]], lack of limbs, being abnormally tall or short, [[Feminization (biology)|feminization]], and so forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairchild 235–241&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fairchild|first=Amy|last2=Bateman-House|first2=Alison|date=April 1, 2008|title=Medical Examination of Immigrants at Ellis Island|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics|volume=10|issue=4|pages=235–241|doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2008.10.4.mhst1-0804|issn=2376-6980|pmid=23206915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goddard 1911&quot; /&gt; This was covered by most of the chalk indications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moreno (2004) pp. 33-34&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mullan 1917 p. 733&quot; /&gt;
* Mental&amp;nbsp;– people who showed signs or history of [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and [[intellectual disability]]. These included &quot;[[feeble-minded]]ness&quot;, &quot;imbecility&quot;, [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]], and other illnesses that stemmed from the brain such as [[epilepsy]] and [[cerebral palsy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairchild 235–241&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/october-15-1965-remembering-ellis-island|title=Before Ebola, Ellis Island's terrifying medical inspections|date=October 15, 2014|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-us|access-date=January 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moral&amp;nbsp;– people who had &quot;moral defects&quot; at the time were (but not limited to) [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and those of [[paraphilia|illicit sexuality]], criminals, [[Poverty|impoverished]], and other groups associated with &quot;degeneracy&quot; that deviated from the considered norm or [[Society of the United States|American society]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;statesofincarceration.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://statesofincarceration.org/story/ellis-island|title=Ellis Island {{!}} States of Incarceration|website=statesofincarceration.org|access-date=January 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people with moral or mental disability, who were of higher concern to officials and under the law, were required to be excluded from entry to the United States. Persons with physical disability were under higher inspection and could be turned away on the basis of their disability. Much of this came in part of the eugenicist belief that defects are hereditary, especially those of the moral and mental nature those these are often outwardly signified by physical deformity as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;:02&quot; /&gt; As Chicago surgeon [[Eugene S. Talbot]] wrote in 1898, &quot;[[crime]] is hereditary, a tendency which is, in most cases, associated with bodily defects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degeneracy: Its Causes, Signs, and Results|last=Talbot|first=Eugene S.|publisher=London: Scott|year=1898|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[George Lydston]], a medicine and [[Anthropological criminology|criminal anthropology]] professor, wrote in 1906 that people with &quot;defective physique&quot; were not just criminally associated but that defectiveness was a primary factor &quot;in the causation of crime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Diseases of Society: The Vice and Crime Problem|last=Lydston|first=G.

=== Name-change myth ===

According to a myth, immigrants were unwillingly forced to take new names, though there are no historical records of this.&lt;ref name=&quot;:49&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:50&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ask-smithsonian-did-ellis-island-officials-really-change-names-immigrants-180961544/|title=Did Ellis Island Officials Really Change the Names of Immigrants?|last=Ault|first=Alicia|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=June 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, immigration officials simply used the names from the manifests of [[steamship]] companies, which served as the only immigration records for those entering the United States. Records show that immigration officials often actually corrected mistakes in immigrants' names, since inspectors knew three languages on average and each worker was usually assigned to process immigrants who spoke the same languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;:49&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Your Family Name Was Not Changed at Ellis Island (and One That Was)|website=The New York Public Library|date=July 2, 2013|url=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/07/02/name-changes-ellis-island | access-date=June 11, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:50&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:51&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/history-and-genealogy/genealogy/genealogy-notebook/immigrant-name-changes|title=Immigrant Name Changes|date=February 11, 2016|website=USCIS|language=en|access-date=June 15, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many immigrant families Americanized their surnames afterward, either immediately following the immigration process or gradually after assimilating into [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:50&quot; /&gt; Because the average family changed their surname five years after immigration, the [[Naturalization Act of 1906]] required documentation of name changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;:50&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;:51&quot; /&gt; The myth of name changes at Ellis Island still persists likely because of the perception of the immigration center as a formidable port of arrival.&lt;ref name=&quot;:50&quot; /&gt;
