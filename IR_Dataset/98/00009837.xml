'''Ethylene''' ([[IUPAC]] name: '''ethene''') is a [[hydrocarbon]] which has the formula {{chem|C|2|H|4}} or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a colorless flammable gas with a faint &quot;sweet and [[musk]]y&quot; odour when pure.&lt;ref name=UllmannEthylene/&gt; It is the simplest [[alkene]] (a hydrocarbon with [[carbon-carbon]] [[double bond]]s).

Ethylene is widely used in the chemical industry, and its worldwide production (over 150 million [[tonne]]s in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Research and Markets|title=The Ethylene Technology Report 2016 - Research and Markets|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/2xl4dr/the_ethylene|website=www.researchandmarkets.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) exceeds that of any other [[organic compound]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cenews&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Production: Growth is the Norm |journal=Chemical and Engineering News |volume=84 |issue=28 |pages=59–236 |date=July 10, 2006 |doi=10.1021/cen-v084n034.p059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Technology Economics Program&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.slideshare.net/intratec/propylene-production-from-methanol|title= Propylene Production from Methanol|publisher=Intratec|isbn=978-0-615-64811-8|date= 2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this production goes toward [[polyethylene]], a widely used [[plastic]] containing [[polymer]] chains of ethylene units in various chain lengths. Ethylene is also an important natural [[plant hormone]] and is used in agriculture to force the ripening of fruits.&lt;ref name=Wang_2002&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang K, Li H, Ecker J| title = Ethylene Biosynthesis and Signaling Networks | journal = Plant Cell | volume = 14  | issue =Suppl | pages = S131–51 | year = 2002| pmid = 12045274 | pmc = 151252 | doi = 10.1105/tpc.001768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethylene's [[hydrate]] is [[ethanol]].

==Structure and properties==
[[Image:Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model.png|thumb|260 px|left|Orbital description of bonding between ethylene and a transition metal.]]
This [[hydrocarbon]] has four [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s bound to a pair of [[carbon]] atoms that are connected by a [[double bond]]. All six atoms that comprise ethylene are [[coplanar]]. The H-C-H [[angle]] is 117.4°, close to the 120° for ideal sp² [[hybridization (chemistry)|hybridized]] carbon. The molecule is also relatively rigid: rotation about the C-C bond is a high energy process that requires breaking the π-bond.

The π-bond in the ethylene molecule is responsible for its useful reactivity. The double bond is a region of high [[electron density]], thus it is susceptible to attack by [[electrophiles]]. Many reactions of ethylene are catalyzed by transition metals, which bind transiently to the ethylene using both the π and π* orbitals.

Being a simple molecule, ethylene is spectroscopically simple. Its UV-vis [[Spectroscopy|spectrum]] is still used as a test of theoretical methods.&lt;ref name=NIST_Webbook&gt;{{cite web | title=Ethylene:UV/Visible Spectrum | work=NIST Webbook | url=http://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C74851&amp;Units=SI&amp;Mask=400#UV-Vis-Spec | accessdate=2006-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Major industrial reactions of ethylene include in order of scale: 1) [[polymerization]], 2) [[oxidation]], 3) [[halogenation]] and [[hydrohalogenation]], 4) [[alkylation]], 5) [[Hydration reaction|hydration]], 6) [[oligomerization]], and 7) [[hydroformylation]].  In the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], approximately 90% of ethylene is used to produce [[ethylene oxide]], [[ethylene dichloride]], [[ethylbenzene]] and [[polyethylene]].&lt;ref name=&quot;inchem&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/74851.pdf|title=OECD SIDS Initial Assessment Profile — Ethylene|publisher=inchem.org|accessdate=2008-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051942/http://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/74851.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-24|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the reactions with ethylene are [[electrophilic addition]].

{{clear|left}}

===Polymerization===
{{See also|Ziegler–Natta catalyst|Polyethylene}}
Polyethylene consumes more than half of the world's ethylene supply. Polyethylene, also called ''polyethene'', is the world's most widely used plastic. It is primarily used to make films in [[packaging]], [[carrier bags]] and trash [[bin bag|liners]]. Linear [[alpha-olefins]], produced by [[oligomerization]] (formation of short polymers) are used as [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]], [[detergents]], [[plasticisers]], [[synthetic lubricants]], additives, and also as co-monomers in the production of polyethylenes.&lt;ref name=&quot;inchem&quot; /&gt;

===Oxidation===
Ethylene is [[oxidation|oxidized]] to produce [[ethylene oxide]], a key raw material in the production of [[surfactant]]s and [[detergent]]s by [[ethoxylation]]. Ethylene oxide is also hydrolyzed to produce [[ethylene glycol]], widely used as an automotive antifreeze as well as higher molecular weight glycols, [[glycol ethers]] and [[polyethylene terephthalate]].

{{Main|Wacker process}}
Ethylene undergoes oxidation by palladium to give [[acetaldehyde]]. This conversion remains a major industrial process (10M kg/y).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elschenbroich|first=C.|author2=Salzer, A.|title=Organometallics : A Concises Introduction|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|year=2006|isbn=978-3-527-28165-7|series=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process proceeds via the initial complexation of ethylene to a Pd(II) center.

===Halogenation and hydrohalogenation===
Major intermediates from the [[halogenation]] and [[hydrohalogenation]] of ethylene include [[ethylene dichloride]], [[ethyl chloride]] and [[ethylene dibromide]]. The addition of chlorine entails &quot;oxychlorination,&quot; i.e. chlorine itself is not used. Some products derived from this group are [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[trichloroethylene]], [[perchloroethylene]], [[methyl chloroform]], [[polyvinylidene chloride]] and [[copolymer]]s, and [[ethyl bromide]].&lt;ref name=Keystone/&gt;

===Alkylation===
Major chemical intermediates from the [[alkylation]] with ethylene is [[ethylbenzene]], precursor to [[styrene]]. Styrene is used principally in [[polystyrene]] for packaging and insulation, as well as in [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber for tires and footwear. On a smaller scale, [[ethyltoluene]], ethylanilines, 1,4-hexadiene, and [[aluminium]] alkyls. Products of these intermediates include [[polystyrene]], [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] [[polyester]]s and ethylene-propylene [[copolymer|terpolymers]].&lt;ref name=Keystone/&gt;

===Oxo reaction===
The [[hydroformylation]] (oxo reaction) of ethylene results in [[propionaldehyde]], a precursor to [[propionic acid]] and [[n-propyl alcohol]].&lt;ref name=Keystone/&gt;

===Hydration===
Ethylene has long represented the major nonfermentative precursor to [[ethanol]].  The original method entailed its conversion to [[diethyl sulfate]], followed by hydrolysis.  The main method practiced since the mid-1990s is the direct hydration of ethylene catalyzed by [[solid acid catalyst]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Naim Kosaric, Zdravko Duvnjak, Adalbert Farkas, Hermann Sahm, Stephanie Bringer-Meyer, Otto Goebel and Dieter Mayer in &quot;Ethanol&quot; Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a09_587.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →    CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH

===Dimerization to butenes===
Ethylene is [[dimer (chemistry)|dimerized]] by [[hydrovinylation]] to give ''n''-butenes using processes licensed by Lummus or [[French Institute of Petroleum|IFP]]. The Lummus process produces mixed ''n''-butenes (primarily [[2-butene]]s) while the IFP process produces [[1-butene]].  1-Butene is used as a [[comonomer]] in the production of certain kinds of [[polyethylene]].

===Niche uses===
An example of a niche use is as an [[anesthesiology|anesthetic agent]] (in an 85% ethylene/15% oxygen ratio).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Ethylene can be used in production of [[Sulfur mustard|sulfur mustard gas]], a [[chemical weapon]].

==Production==
Global ethylene production was 107 million tonnes in 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;cenews&quot;/&gt; 109 million tonnes in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Nattrass, L and Higson, A (22 July 2010) [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/publications/nnfcc-renewable-chemicals-factsheet-ethanol NNFCC Renewable Chemicals Factsheet: Ethanol].

To meet the ever-increasing demand for ethylene, sharp increases in production facilities are added globally, particularly in the [[Mideast]] and in [[China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ceresana&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/ethylene/|title=Market Study: Ethylene (2nd edition), Ceresana, November 2014|publisher=ceresana.com|accessdate=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial process===
Ethylene is produced by several methods in the [[petrochemical industry]].  A primary method is [[steam cracking]] (SC) where hydrocarbons and steam are heated to 750–950&amp;nbsp;°C.This process converts large hydrocarbons into smaller ones and introduces unsaturation. When [[ethane]] is the feedstock, ethylene is the product. Ethylene is separated from the resulting mixture by repeated [[compression (physical)|compression]] and [[distillation]].&lt;ref name=Keystone&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kniel | first=Ludwig |author2=Winter, Olaf |author3=Stork, Karl  | title=Ethylene, keystone to the petrochemical industry | year=1980 | publisher=M.

===Laboratory synthesis===
Although of great value industrially, ethylene is rarely synthesized in the laboratory and is ordinarily purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Crimmins, M.T. |author2=Kim-Meade, A.S. |chapter=Ethylene |editor=Paquette, L. |title=Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2001 |doi=10.1002/047084289X.re066|isbn=0471936235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
It can be produced via dehydration of [[ethanol]] with [[sulfuric acid]] or in the gas phase with [[aluminium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Practical Organic Chemistry (preparation 4)|author=Cohen, Julius B. |publisher=Macmillan|year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethylene as a plant hormone==
[[File:Ethylene Signal Transduction.svg|thumb|An ethylene signal transduction pathway. Ethylene permeates the membrane and binds to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum.  The receptor releases the repressed EIN2.  This then activates a signal transduction pathway which activates regulatory genes that eventually trigger an Ethylene response. The activated DNA is transcribed into mRNA which is then translated into a functional enzyme that is used for ethylene biosynthesis.]]
Ethylene serves as a [[plant hormone|hormone]] in [[plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lin, Z. |author2=Zhong, S. |author3=Grierson, D. |title=Recent advances in ethylene research |journal=J.

Commercial ripening rooms use &quot;catalytic generators&quot; to make ethylene gas from a liquid supply of ethanol. Typically, a gassing level of 500 to 2,000 ppm is used, for 24 to 48 hours. Care must be taken to control carbon dioxide levels in ripening rooms when gassing, as high temperature ripening ({{convert|20|C|F|disp=x|; }}){{citation needed|date=February 2014}} has been seen to produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels of 10% in 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ne-postharvest.com/ripening.htm#controlledatmosphereripening External Link to More on Ethylene Gassing and Carbon Dioxide Control] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914000738/http://ne-postharvest.com/ripening.htm#controlledatmosphereripening |date=2010-09-14 }}. ne-postharvest.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of ethylene in plant biology===
Ethylene has been used since the ancient Egyptians, who would gash figs in order to stimulate ripening (wounding stimulates ethylene production by plant tissues). The ancient Chinese would burn [[incense]] in closed rooms to enhance the ripening of pears. In 1864, it was discovered that gas leaks from street lights led to stunting of growth, twisting of plants, and abnormal thickening of stems.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; In 1874 it was discovered that smoke caused pineapple fields to bloom. Smoke contains ethylene, and once this was realized the smoke was replaced with ethephon or naphthalene acetic acid, which induce ethylene production.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Plant Reviews, Plant Hormone Signaling. Peter Hedden, Stephen G. Thomas. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Apr 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, a Russian scientist named Dimitry Neljubow showed that the active component was ethylene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neljobov_1901&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neljubov D. | title = Uber die horizontale Nutation der Stengel von Pisum sativum und einiger anderen Pflanzen | journal = Beih Bot Zentralbl | volume = 10 | pages = 128–139 | year = 1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Doubt discovered that ethylene stimulated [[abscission]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doubt_1917&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Doubt, Sarah L.| title = The Response of Plants to Illuminating Gas | journal = Botanical Gazette | jstor= 2469142 | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 209–224 | year = 1917  | doi = 10.1086/332006 | hdl = 2027/mdp.39015068299380| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1431401 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers in Florida would commonly get their crops to ripen in sheds by lighting kerosene lamps, which was originally thought to induce ripening from the heat.

===Ethylene biosynthesis in plants===
[[File:Yang-cycle.png|thumb|left|The Yang cycle]]
Ethylene is produced from essentially all parts of higher plants, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, tubers, and seeds.
Ethylene production is regulated by a variety of developmental and environmental factors. During the life of the plant, ethylene production is induced during certain stages of growth such as [[germination]], [[ripening]] of fruits, [[abscission]] of leaves, and [[senescence]] of flowers. Ethylene production can also be induced by a variety of external aspects such as mechanical wounding, environmental stresses, and certain chemicals including auxin and other regulators.&lt;ref name=Yang_1984&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang, S. F.  |author2=Hoffman N. E. | title = Ethylene biosynthesis and its regulation in higher plants | journal = Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. | volume = 35 | pages = 155–89 | year = 1984 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.pp.35.060184.001103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathway for ethylene biosynthesis is named the [[Shang Fa Yang|Yang cycle]] after the scientist [[Shang Fa Yang]] who made key contributions to elucidating this pathway.

Ethylene is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from the amino acid [[methionine]] to [[S-adenosyl methionine|''S''-adenosyl-&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-methionine]] (SAM, also called Adomet) by the enzyme Met Adenosyltransferase. SAM is then converted to [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] (ACC) by the enzyme [[1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase|ACC synthase]] (ACS). The activity of ACS determines the rate of ethylene production, therefore regulation of this [[enzyme]] is key for the ethylene biosynthesis. The final step requires oxygen and involves the action of the enzyme [[Aminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase|ACC-oxidase]] (ACO), formerly known as the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE). Ethylene biosynthesis can be induced by endogenous or exogenous ethylene. ACC synthesis increases with high levels of [[auxin]]s, especially [[indole acetic acid]] (IAA) and [[cytokinin]]s.

===Ethylene perception in plants===
Ethylene is perceived by a family of five transmembrane [[protein dimer]]s such as the ETR1 protein in ''Arabidopsis''. The [[genes]] [[encoding]] ethylene receptors have been cloned in the reference plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and many other plants. Ethylene receptors are encoded by multiple genes in plant [[genome]]s. [[dominance (genetics)|Dominant]] [[missense mutation|missense]] mutations in any of the [[gene family]], which comprises five receptors in ''Arabidopsis'' and at least six in tomato, can confer insensitivity to ethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 9800203 | pmc = 1692356 | year = 1998 | author = Bleecker, A.

=== Ethylene response to salt stress ===
A large portion of the soil has been affected by over salinity and it has been known to limit the growth of many plants. Globally, the total area of saline soil was 397,000,000 ha and in continents like Africa, it makes up 2 percent of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/soils-portal/soil-management/management-of-some-problem-soils/salt-affected-soils/more-information-on-salt-affected-soils/en/|title=More information on Salt-affected soils {{!}} FAO {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of soil salinization has reached 19.5% of the irrigated land and 2.1% of the dry-land agriculture around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neto|first=Azevedo|last2=De|first2=André Dias|last3=Prisco|first3=José Tarquinio|last4=Enéas-Filho|first4=Joaquim|last5=Lacerda|first5=Claudivan Feitosa de|last6=Silva|first6=José Vieira|last7=Costa|first7=Paulo Henrique Alves da|last8=Gomes-Filho|first8=Enéas|date=2004-04-01|title=Effects of salt stress on plant growth, stomatal response and solute accumulation of different maize genotypes|journal=Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=31–38|doi=10.1590/S1677-04202004000100005|issn=1677-0420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil salinization affects the plants using osmotic potential by net solute accumulation. The osmotic pressure in the plant is what maintains water uptake and cell turgor to help with stomatal function and other cellular mechanisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; Over generations, many plant genes have adapted, allowing plants’ phenotypes to change and built different mechanisms to counter salinity effects.

The plant hormone ethylene is a combatant for salinity in most plants. Ethylene is known for regulating plant growth and development and adapted to stress conditions. Central membrane proteins in plants, such as ETO2, ERS1 and EIN2, are used for ethylene signaling in many plant growth processes. ETO2, Ethylene overproducer 2, is a protein that when mutated it will gain a function to continually produce ethylene even when there is no stress condition, causing the plant to grow short and stumpy. ERS1, Ethylene response sensor 1, is activated when ethylene is present in the signaling pathway and when mutated, it loses a function and cannot bind to ethylene. This means a response is never activated and the plant will not be able to cope with the abiotic stress. EIN2, Ethylene insensitive 2, is a protein that activates the pathway and when there is a mutation here the EIN2 will block ethylene stimulation and an ethylene response gene will not be activated. Mutations in these proteins can lead to heightened salt sensitivity and limit plant growth. The effects of salinity have been studied on ''Arabidopsis'' plants that have mutated ERS1 and EIN4 proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lei|first=Gang|last2=Shen|first2=Ming|last3=Li|first3=Zhi-Gang|last4=Zhang|first4=Bo|last5=Duan|first5=Kai-Xuan|last6=Wang|first6=Ning|last7=Cao|first7=Yang-Rong|last8=Zhang|first8=Wan-Ke|last9=Ma|first9=Biao|date=2011-10-01|title=EIN2 regulates salt stress response and interacts with a MA3 domain-containing protein ECIP1 in Arabidopsis|journal=Plant, Cell &amp; Environment|language=en|volume=34|issue=10|pages=1678–1692|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.2011.02363.x|pmid=21631530|issn=1365-3040}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are used for ethylene signaling again certain stress conditions, such as salt and the ethylene precursor ACC is allowing suppress of any sensitivity to the salt stress.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt; Mutations in these pathways can cause lack of ethylene signaling, causing stunt in plant growth and development.

===Environmental and biological triggers of ethylene===
Environmental cues such as flooding, drought, chilling, wounding, and pathogen attack can induce ethylene formation in plants. In flooding, roots suffer from lack of oxygen, or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxia]], which leads to the synthesis of [[1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid|1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid]] (ACC). ACC is transported upwards in the plant and then oxidized in leaves. The ethylene produced causes [[nastic movements]] (epinasty) of the leaves, perhaps helping the plant to lose water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planthormones.info/epinasty.htm Explaining Epinasty]. planthormones.inf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corolla senescence ===
The corolla of a plant refers to its set of petals. Corolla development in plants is broken into phases from [[anthesis]] to corolla wilting. The development of the corolla is directed in part by ethylene, though its concentration is highest when the plant is fertilized and no longer requires the production or maintenance of structures and compounds that attract pollinators.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Hong|title=Transcriptome profiling reveals regulatory mechanisms underlying corolla senescence in petunia|journal=Horticulture Research|date=2018|volume=5|issue=16|pages=16|pmc=5878830|pmid=29619227|doi=10.1038/s41438-018-0018-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Underwood|first1=Beverly|title=Ethylene-Regulated Floral Volatile Synthesis in Petunia Corollas|journal=Plant Physiology|date=May 2005|volume=138|issue=1|pages=255–266|doi=10.1104/pp.104.051144|pmid=15849311|pmc=1104180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of ethylene in the developmental cycle is as a hormonal director of [[Plant senescence|senescence]] in corolla tissue. This is evident as ethylene production and emission are maximized in developmental phases post-pollination, until corolla wilting.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;/&gt; Ethylene-directed senescence of corolla tissue can be observed as color change in the corolla or the wilting/ death of corolla tissue. At the chemical level, ethylene mediates the reduction in the amount of fragrance volatiles produced. Fragrance volatiles act mostly by attracting pollinators. Ethylene's role in this developmental scenario is to move the plant away from a state of attracting pollinators, so it also aids in decreasing the production of these volatiles.

Ethylene production in corolla tissue does not directly cause the senescence of corolla tissue, but acts by releasing secondary products that are consistent with tissue aging. While the mechanism of ethylene-mediated senescence are unclear, its role as a senescence-directing hormone can be confirmed by ethylene-sensitive petunia response to ethylene knockdown. Knockdown of ethylene biosynthesis genes was consistent with increased corolla longevity; inversely, up-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis gene transcription factors were consistent with a more rapid senescence of the corolla.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&quot;/&gt;

====Commercial issues====
Ethylene shortens the shelf life of many fruits by hastening [[fruit ripening]] and floral [[senescence]]. Ethylene will shorten the shelf life of [[cut flowers]] and potted plants by accelerating floral senescence and floral [[abscission]]. Flowers and plants which are subjected to stress during shipping, handling, or storage produce ethylene causing a significant reduction in floral display. Flowers affected by ethylene include [[carnation]], [[Pelargonium|geranium]], [[petunia]], [[rose]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Effect of ethylene on flower abscission: a survey |journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 689–693| year = 2002 | pmid = 12102524 |pmc = 4233834 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mcf124 |author1=Van Doorn |author2=W. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene can cause significant economic losses for florists, markets, suppliers, and growers. Researchers have developed several ways to inhibit ethylene, including inhibiting ethylene synthesis and inhibiting ethylene perception. Aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), [[Aminooxyacetic acid]] (AOA), and silver salts are ethylene inhibitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;dic_plant&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassells |first=A. C. |author2=Peter B. Gahan|title=Dictionary of plant tissue culture|publisher=Haworth Press|year= 2006|page=77|isbn= 978-1-56022-919-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cR5y5_vahAUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Constabel|first=Friedrich |author2=Jerry P. Shyluk|title=Plant Cell and Tissue Culture|publisher=Springer|year=1994|page=5|chapter=1: Initiation, Nutrition, and Maintenance of Plant Cell and Tissue Cultures |isbn=978-0-7923-2493-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhibiting ethylene synthesis is less effective for reducing post-harvest losses since ethylene from other sources can still have an effect. By inhibiting ethylene perception, fruits, plants and flowers don't respond to ethylene produced endogenously or from exogenous sources. Inhibitors of ethylene perception include compounds that have a similar shape to ethylene, but do not elicit the ethylene response. One example of an ethylene perception inhibitor is [[1-methylcyclopropene]] (1-MCP).

Commercial growers of [[bromeliads]], including [[pineapple]] plants, use ethylene to induce flowering. Plants can be induced to flower either by treatment with the gas in a chamber, or by placing a [[banana peel]] next to the plant in an enclosed area.

[[Chrysanthemum]] flowering is delayed by ethylene gas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Berkel, N. |title=Injurious effects of low ethylene concentrations on ''Chrysanthemum morifolium'' Ramat |journal=Acta Hort. (ISHS) |volume=197 |pages=43–52 |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and growers have found that carbon dioxide 'burners' and the exhaust fumes from inefficient glasshouse heaters can raise the ethylene concentration to 0.05 ppmv causing delay in flowering of commercial crops.

==Ligand==
Ethylene is a [[ligand]] in [[organometallic chemistry]].  One of the first organometallic compounds, [[Zeise's salt]] is a complex of ethylene.  Useful reagents containing ethylene include Pt(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  The Rh-catalysed [[hydroformylation]] of ethylene is conducted on industrial scale to provide [[propionaldehyde]].

==History==
Some geologists and scholars believe that the famous Greek Oracle at [[Delphi]] (the [[Pythia]]) went into her trance-like state as an effect of ethylene rising from ground faults.&lt;ref name=Roach&gt;{{cite magazine|title= Delphic Oracle's Lips May Have Been Loosened by Gas Vapors|author=John Roach|magazine=National Geographic|date=2001-08-14|url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/08/0814_delphioracle.html |accessdate=March 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethylene appears to have been discovered by [[Johann Joachim Becher]], who obtained it by heating [[ethanol]] with sulfuric acid;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Henry Enfield |last1=Roscoe |first2=Carl |last2=Schorlemmer |title=A treatise on chemistry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7gtAAAAYAAJ |year=1878 |publisher=D.

Johnson, 1779, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The properties of ethylene were studied in 1795 by four [[Netherlands|Dutch]] chemists, Johann Rudolph Deimann, Adrien Paets van Troostwyck, Anthoni Lauwerenburgh and Nicolas Bondt, who found that it differed from [[hydrogen]] gas and that it contained both carbon and hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roscoe|Schorlemmer|1878|p=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group also discovered that ethylene could be combined with [[chlorine]] to produce the ''oil of the Dutch chemists'', [[1,2-Dichloroethane|1,2-dichloroethane]]; this discovery gave ethylene the name used for it at that time, ''olefiant gas'' (oil-making gas.)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roscoe|Schorlemmer|1878|p=613}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Gregory |title=Handbook of organic chemistry |url=https://archive.org/details/handbookorganic00greggoog |year=1857 |publisher=A.S. Barnes &amp; Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/handbookorganic00greggoog/page/n167 157] |edition=4th American}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term olefiant gas is in turn the etymological origin of the modern word &quot;olefin&quot;, the class of hydrocarbons in which ethylene is the first member.

In the mid-19th century, the suffix ''-ene'' (an Ancient Greek root added to the end of female names meaning &quot;daughter of&quot;) was widely used to refer to a molecule or part thereof that contained one fewer hydrogen atoms than the molecule being modified. Thus, ''ethylene'' ({{chem|C|2|H|4}}) was the &quot;daughter of [[ethyl group|ethyl]]&quot; ({{chem|C|2|H|5}}). The name ethylene was used in this sense as early as 1852.{{Citation needed|date = March 2018}}

In 1866, the [[Germany|German]] chemist [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] proposed a system of hydrocarbon nomenclature in which the suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to denote the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogens than their parent [[alkane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/Hofmannaeiou.html|title=Hofmann's Proposal for Systematic Nomenclature of the Hydrocarbons|author=Hofmann, A.

Hofmann's system eventually became the basis for the Geneva nomenclature approved by the International Congress of Chemists in 1892, which remains at the core of the [[IUPAC]] nomenclature. However, by that time, the name ethylene was deeply entrenched, and it remains in wide use today, especially in the chemical industry.{{Citation needed|date = March 2018}}

===Nomenclature===
The 1979 IUPAC nomenclature rules made an exception for retaining the non-systematic name ethylene,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_53.htm#a_3__1 IUPAC nomenclature rule A-3.1 (1979)]. Acdlabs.com. Retrieved on 2016-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this decision was reversed in the 1993 rules&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_684.htm Footnote to IUPAC nomenclature rule R-9.1, table 19(b)]. Acdlabs.com. Retrieved on 2016-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and remains unchanged in the newest 2013 recommendations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry : IUPAC Recommendations and Preferred Names 2013|date=2014|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|editor=Favre, Henri A. |editor2=Powell, Warren H. |isbn=9781849733069|location=Cambridge, England|oclc=865143943}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the IUPAC name is now ''ethene''.  Note that in the IUPAC system, the name ''ethylene'' is reserved for the divalent group -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-.  Hence, names like ethylene oxide and ethylene dibromide are permitted, but the use of the name ethylene for the two-carbon alkene is not.  Nevertheless, use of the name ethylene for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is still prevalent among chemists in North America.

===Safety===
Like all hydrocarbons, ethylene is an [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] and combustible. It is listed as an [[International Agency for Research on Cancer|IARC]] [[List of IARC Group 3 carcinogens|class 3 carcinogen]] as there is no evidence at present that it causes cancer in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol60/m60-01.html|title=Ethylene (IARC Summary &amp; Evaluation, Volume 60, 1994)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2019-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
