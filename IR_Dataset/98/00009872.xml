      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[Electric bus]]''' is a bus powered by electric energy. &quot;Electric bus&quot; can also refer to:

* [[Bus (computing)]], used for connecting components of a computer or communication between computers
* [[Busbar]]s, thick conductors used in [[electrical substation]]s
** In [[power engineering]], a &quot;bus&quot; is any graph node of the [[One-line diagram|single-line diagram]] at which voltage, current, power flow, or other quantities are to be evaluated. This may correspond to the physical busbars in substation.
** A ground bus or earth bus is a conductor used as a zero voltage reference in a system, often connected to [[ground (electricity)|ground or earth]].
* In professional audio, ''bus'' refers to a place in the audio signal chain where one can hear a mix of different audio signalsâ€”usually at the output of a [[mixing console]].
