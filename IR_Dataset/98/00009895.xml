&lt;span lang=&quot;ps&quot;&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; '''economy of Afghanistan''' has improved significantly in the last decade due to the infusion of billions of dollars in international assistance and remittances from [[Afghan diaspora|Afghan expatriates]].

==Economic history==
{{see also|Democratic Republic of Afghanistan#Economy}}

In the early modern period under the rule of kings [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] (1880–1901) and [[Habibullah Khan]] (1901–1919), a great deal of Afghan commerce was centrally controlled by the Afghan government. The Afghan monarchs were eager to develop the stature of government and the country's military capability, and so attempted to raise money by the imposition of state monopolies on the sale of commodities and high taxes. This slowed the long-term development of Afghanistan during that period. Western technologies and manufacturing methods were slowly introduced during these eras at the command of the Afghan ruler, but in general only according to the logistical requirements of the growing army. An emphasis was placed on the manufacture of weapons and other military material. This process was in the hands of a small number of western experts invited to Kabul by the Afghan kings. Otherwise, it was not possible for outsiders, particularly westerners, to set up large-scale enterprises in Afghanistan during that period.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Affairs Journal, [http://www.bijanomrani.com/?p=Making_money_%20in_%20Afghanistan Making Money in Afghanistan: The First Western Entrepreneurs 1880-1919], Vol 3, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prominent plan to develop Afghanistan's economy in modern times was the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority|Helmand Valley Authority]] project of 1952, modeled on the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] in the [[United States]], which was expected to be of primary economic importance.&lt;ref name=tudor&gt;[https://archive.is/20121129092011/http://184.73.243.18:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/1803?show=full Report on Development of Helmand Valley, Afghanistan, 1956], Tudor Engineering Company&lt;/ref&gt; The country began facing severe economic hardships during the 1970s when neighboring Pakistan, under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], began closing the Pakistan-Afghanistan [[border crossing]]s. This move resulted in Afghanistan increasing political and economic ties with its northern neighbor, the powerful [[Soviet Union]] of that time.

The 1979 [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] and ensuing [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] destroyed much of the country's limited infrastructure, and disrupted normal patterns of economic activity. Eventually, Afghanistan went from a [[traditional economy]] to a [[centrally planned economy]] up until 2002 when it was replaced by a [[free market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unodc.org/pdf/publications/afg_opium_economy_www.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Gross domestic product has fallen substantially since the 1980s due to disruption of trade and transport as well as loss of labor and capital. Continuing internal strife severely hampered domestic efforts to rebuild the nation or provide ways for the international community to help.

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], the Afghan economy grew 20% in the [[fiscal year]] ending in March 2004, after expanding 30% in the previous 12 months. The growth is attributed to international aid and to the end of [[drought]]s. An estimated $100 billion of aid entered the nation from 2002 to 2017. A GDP of $4 billion in fiscal year 2003 was recalculated by the IMF to $6.1 billion, after adding proceeds from [[opium]] products. Mean graduate pay was $0.56 per [[man-hour]] in 2010.

[[Wheat]] and [[cereal]] production is Afghanistan's traditional agricultural mainstay. National wheat production in 2015 was 5 million tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;usda-2015&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=AFGHANISTAN: 2015/2016 Wheat Production above Average but Down from Last Year|url=https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/highlights/2015/07/Afghanistan/Index.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture|date=July 17, 2015|accessdate=2019-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415232741/https://ipad.fas.usda.gov/highlights/2015/07/Afghanistan/Index.htm|archive-date=April 15, 2019|url-status=dead}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan is nearing self-sufficiency in grain production.

[[Livestock]] in Afghanistan mainly include [[cattle]], [[sheep]], and [[goat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDbyb57xdrM|title=ښاري انځور خپرونه کندهار ملي راډیو ټلوېزیون|language=Pashto|publisher=[[Radio Television Afghanistan|Kandahar Mili Television]]|date=February 8, 2019|accessdate=2019-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building and using modern [[poultry farming|poultry farms]] is also a fast-growing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuyB7bODAmg|title=Poultry Value Chain in Afghanistan|publisher=Comprehensive Agriculture and Rural Development-Facility (CARD-F)|date=November 11, 2018|accessdate=2019-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of land suitable for grazing has traditionally made [[animal husbandry]] an important part of the economy. There are two main types of animal husbandry: sedentary, practiced by farmers who raise both animals and crops; and nomadic, practiced by animal herders known as [[Kochi people|Kochis]]. Natural pastures cover some {{convert|7500000|acre|km2}} but are being overgrazed. The northern regions around [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] and [[Maymana]] were the home range for about six million [[karakul (sheep)|karakul sheep]] in the late 1990s. Most flocks move to the highlands in the summer to pastures in the north. 

Arable land in Afghanistan is around 8 million hectares. Wheat production stands at about 5 million tonnes,&lt;ref name=&quot;usda-2015&quot;/&gt; nurseries hold 119,000 hectares of land, and grape production is at 615,000 tonnes. [[Almond]] production has jumped to 56,000 tons and cotton to 45,000 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/04/03/water-energy-sector-critical-situation |title=Water &amp; energy sector in critical situation |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=April 3, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported in 2019 that about 10,000 acres of land in Afghanistan is used to cultivate [[saffron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Illegal' Saffron Imports Affect Afghan Products Market|url=https://www.tolonews.com/business/%E2%80%98illegal%E2%80%99-saffron-imports-affect-afghan-products-market|publisher=TOLOnews|date=April 21, 2019|accessdate=2019-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420165201/https://www.tolonews.com/business/%E2%80%98illegal%E2%80%99-saffron-imports-affect-afghan-products-market|archive-date=April 20, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Bank]]’s report published in April 2019, Afghanistan’s economy suffered from the consequences of a severe drought that affected the agriculture production in 2018. While the wheat production declined by 24%, milk production declined by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://leadership.ng/2019/04/24/afghan-economy-suffers-from-drought-and-uncertainty-world-bank/|title= Afghan Economy Suffers From Drought And Uncertainty – World Bank|accessdate=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishing===
The country has plenty of [[List of dams and reservoirs in Afghanistan|reservoirs]], [[list of rivers of Afghanistan|rivers]] and streams, which make it a suitable climate for [[fish farming]]. Fishing takes place in the lakes and rivers, particularly in [[Nangarhar Province]] and in the [[Helmand River]] in southern Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Livestock and Fish Farming Bring Self-Sufficiency to Rural Afghans|publisher=The World Bank|url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2018/10/28/livestock-and-fish-farming-spur-rural-afghans-toward-self-sufficiency|date=October 28, 2018|accessdate=2019-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fish]] constitute a smaller part of the [[Afghan cuisine|Afghan diet]] today because fish farmers are unable to produce enough fish to keep up with the demands of customers. Most fish and [[seafood]] are imported from neighboring Pakistan, Iran, and the [[United Arab Emirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YESusNSPj-0|title=Fish boom in Jalalabad|publisher=AFP News Agency|date=March 17, 2014|accessdate=2019-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are hundreds of fish farms throughout the country and the largest one is at the [[Qargha Reservoir|Qargha]], which supplies fish eggs to the other fish farms. Fish farming has also been launched in the [[Salma Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.khaama.com/afghanistan-launches-fish-farming-in-mega-300m-salma-dam-built-by-india-02169 |title=Afghanistan launches fish farming in mega $300m Salma Dam built by India |editor=Ghanizada |publisher=www.khaama.com |date=October 29, 2016 |accessdate=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry===
[[File:The Lumber Yards of Asadabad-2.jpg|thumb|200px|Lumber yard in [[Asadabad, Afghanistan|Asadabad]], [[Kunar Province]]]]
Afghanistan's [[timber]] has been greatly depleted, and since the mid-1980s, only about 3% of the land area has been forested, mainly in the east. Significant stands of trees have been destroyed by the ravages of the war in the late 20th century. Exploitation has been hampered by insecurity and access roads. Moreover, the distribution of the forest is uneven, and most of the remaining woodland is only found in the [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]] and the [[Paktia Province|Paktia]] regions in the east of the country. Some steps have been taken in recent years in planting trees across Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Changing the Afghan landscape, one tree at a time|url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/changing-afghan-landscape-one-tree-time|publisher=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]|date=May 4, 2018|accessdate=2019-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421170936/https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/changing-afghan-landscape-one-tree-time|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the Taliban leaders have recently called for planting more trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban leader urges Afghans to plant more trees|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39094578|work=BBC News|date=February 26, 2017|accessdate=2019-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban Leaders Wants Afghans to Plant More Trees|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-urges-afghans-to-plant-trees/3740346.html|publisher=Voice of America|date=February 26, 2017|accessdate=2019-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural forests in Afghanistan are mainly of two types: dense forests of [[oak]] trees, [[walnut]] trees, and many other species of nuts that grow in the southeast, and on the northern and northeastern slopes of the [[Sulaiman range]]s; and sparsely distributed short trees and shrubs on all other slopes of the [[Hindu Kush]]. The dense forests of the southeast cover only 2.7% of the country. [[Roundwood]] production in 2003 was 3,148,000 cubic metres, with 44% used for [[fuel]].

The destruction of the forests to create agricultural land, [[logging]], [[forest fire]]s, plant diseases, and [[insect]] pests are all causes of the reduction in forest coverage. [[Illegal logging]] and clear-cutting by timber smugglers have exacerbated this destructive process. There is currently a ban on cutting new timber in Afghanistan. Prior to 2001 and under Taliban rule, massive deforestation of the country side was permitted and Afghans moved large quantities of logs into storage centers for profit, where the trees wait for processing on an individual tree by tree request.

Experts believe that the production of copper could begin within two to three years and the iron ore in five to seven years as of 2010. The country's other recently announced treasure is the Hajigak iron ore mine, located 130 miles west of Kabul and is believed to hold an estimated 1.8 billion to 2 billion metric tons of the mineral used to make steel. AFISCO, an Indian consortium of seven companies, led by the [[Steel Authority of India Limited]] (SAIL), and Canada's Kilo Goldmines Ltd are expected to jointly invest $14.6 billion in developing the Hajigak iron mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2012/03/31/indian-canadian-firms-invest-146b-hajigak-iron-mine |title=Indian, Canadian firms to invest $ 14.6b in Hajigak iron mine |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |editor=Abdul Qadir Siddiqui |date=March 31, 2012|accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country has several [[coal]] mines but need to be modernized.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcclatchydc.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/11/14/103393/afghan-business-model-connections.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715124259/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/11/14/103393/afghan-business-model-connections.html |archivedate=2012-07-15 }}, McClatchy News, Factory, coal mine show connections matter most in Afghan business, November 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan's important resource in the past has been natural gas, which was first tapped in 1967. During the 1980s, gas sales accounted for $300 million a year in export revenues (56% of the total). 90% of these exports went to the [[Soviet Union]] to pay for imports and debts. However, during the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, Afghanistan's natural gas fields were capped to prevent sabotage by the [[Mujahideen]]. Gas production has dropped from a high of 8.2 million cubic metres {{nowrap|(2.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cu ft)}} per day in the 1980s to a low of about 600,000 cubic meters {{nowrap|(2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cu ft)}} in 2001. After the formation of the [[Karzai administration]], production of natural gas was once again restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/11/08/gas-well-inaugurated-shiberghan |title=Gas well inaugurated in Shiberghan |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) |date=November 8, 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119080051/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/11/08/gas-well-inaugurated-shiberghan |archivedate=January 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade in goods smuggled into Pakistan once constituted a major source of revenue for Afghanistan. Many of the goods that were smuggled into Pakistan have originally entered Afghanistan from Pakistan, where they fell under the 1965 [[Afghanistan–Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement]]. This permitted goods bound for Afghanistan to transit through Pakistani seaports free of [[duty (economics)|duty]]. Once in Afghanistan, the goods were often immediately smuggled back into Pakistan over the porous border that the two countries share, often with the help of corrupt officials. Additionally, items declared as Afghanistan-bound were often prematurely offloaded from trucks and smuggled into Pakistani markets without paying requisite duty fees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Siddiqui&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/11/29/afghan-pakistan-chamber-commerce-set |title=Afghan-Pakistan chamber of commerce set up |first=Abdul Qadir |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=November 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051041/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/11/29/afghan-pakistan-chamber-commerce-set |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pajhwok.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/12/05/pakistan-resolve-afghan-traders-problems |title=Pakistan to resolve Afghan traders' problems |first=Abdul Qadir |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News |date=December 5, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051053/http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2010/12/05/pakistan-resolve-afghan-traders-problems |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the creation of a thriving [[black market]], with much of the illegal trading occurring openly, as was common in [[Peshawar]]'s bustling [[Karkhano Market]], which was widely regarded as a smuggler's bazaar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peshawar Smuggling Boom|url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/peshawar-smuggling-boom|accessdate=6 March 2016|agency=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|date=21 February 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105194352/https://iwpr.net/global-voices/peshawar-smuggling-boom|archive-date=5 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan embarked on a modest economic development program in the 1930s. The government founded banks; introduced paper money; established a university; expanded primary, secondary, and technical schools; and sent students abroad for education. In 1952 it created the [[Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority|Helmand Valley Authority]] to manage the economic development of the Helmand and Arghandab valleys through irrigation and land development,&lt;ref name=&quot;tudor&quot;/&gt; a scheme which remains one of the country's most important capital resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10106049809354643 | volume=13 | title=Remote sensing change detection of irrigated agriculture in Afghanistan | year=1998 | journal=Geocarto International | pages=65–75 | last1 = Haack | first1 = Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the government promulgated the first in a long series of ambitious development plans. By the late 1970s, these had achieved only mixed results due to flaws in the planning process as well as inadequate funding and a shortage of the skilled managers and technicians needed for implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicoutlook.org/asia---pasific/news-socio-economic-overview-of-afghanistan.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903222800/http://www.strategicoutlook.org/asia---pasific/news-socio-economic-overview-of-afghanistan.html |date=2015-09-03 }}, Socio-Economic Overview of Afghanistan, Strategic Outlook&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Da Afghanistan Bank]] serves as the central bank of the nation. The [[Afghan afghani|&quot;Afghani&quot;]] (AFN) is the national currency, which has an exchange rate of nearly 70 Afghanis to [[United States dollar|1 US dollar]]. There are over 16 different banks operating in the country, including [[Afghanistan International Bank]], [[Kabul Bank]], [[Azizi Bank]], [[Pashtany Bank]], [[Standard Chartered Bank]], and [[First MicroFinance Bank-Afghanistan|First Micro Finance Bank]]. Cash is still widely used for most transactions. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year [[tax holiday]]s to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports [[tariff]]s and duties. According to a UN report in 2007, Afghanistan has received over $3.3 billion from its expatriate community in 2006. UN officials familiar with the issue said remittances to Afghanistan could have been more if the banking regulations are more convenient.&lt;ref name=PAN5/&gt; Additionally, improvements to the business-enabling environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in [[Telecommunication|telecom]] investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/programs/economic_growth#Tab=Description |title=Economic Growth |publisher=USAID |accessdate=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929082351/http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/programs/economic_growth#Tab=Description |archive-date=29 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan is a member of [[World Trade Organization]], [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], [[Economic Cooperation Organization|ECO]], [[Economy of the OIC|OIC]], and has an observer status in the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]]. It seeks to complete the so-called ''[[Silk Road|New Silk Road]]'' trade project, which is aimed to connecting South Asia with Central Asia and the Middle East. This way Afghanistan will be able to collect large fees from trade passing through the country, including from the [[Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline]]. Foreign Minister [[Zalmai Rassoul]] has stated that the &quot;goal is to achieve an Afghan economy whose growth is based on trade, private enterprise and investment&quot;. Experts believe that this will revolutionize the economy of the region.

==Tourism==
{{Main|Tourism in Afghanistan}}
Tourism in Afghanistan was at its peak in 1977. Many tourists from around the world came to visit Afghanistan, including from as far away as [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. All of that ended with the start of the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]]. However, it is again gradually increasing despite the insecurity. Each year about 20,000 foreign tourists visit Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pajhwok.com/en/2016/09/27/20000-foreign-tourists-visit-afghanistan-annually |title=20,000 foreign tourists visit Afghanistan annually |publisher=Pajhwok Afghan News (PAN) |editor=Navid Ahmad Barakzai |date=September 27, 2016 |accessdate=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists should avoid areas where armed criminals operate in the name of Taliban. As a policy, the Taliban are known not to harm tourists. Distinguishing the two groups is very difficult.

The country has four international airports, including the [[Hamid Karzai International Airport]], [[Mazar-e Sharif International Airport]], [[Kandahar International Airport]] and [[Herat International Airport]]. It also has several smaller [[List of airports in Afghanistan|airports]] throughout the country. The city of Kabul has many [[guest house]]s and hotels, including the [[Serena Hotels|Serena Hotel]], the [[Hotel Inter-Continental Kabul]], and the [[Safi Landmark Hotel]].
