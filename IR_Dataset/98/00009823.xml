{{Greek myth (personified)}}

'''Eris''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪər|ɪ|s|,_|ˈ|ɛr|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἔρις}}, &quot;Strife&quot;) is the [[ancient Greek religion|Greek]] [[goddess]] of strife and discord. Her Roman equivalent is '''Discordia''', which means &quot;discord&quot;. Eris's Greek opposite is [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], whose Roman counterpart is [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ruoff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KaARAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA329 s.v. Eris, p. 329].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] equated her with the war-goddess [[Enyo]], whose Roman counterpart is [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]]. The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] is named after the goddess.

She had no temples in ancient Greece (Concordia had one in Rome){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, and functions essentially as a [[personification]], as which she appears in [[Homer]] and many later works.

==Etymology==
''Eris'' is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb ὀρίνειν ''orinein'', &quot;to raise, stir, excite,&quot; and the proper name Ἐρινύες ''[[Erinyes]]'' have been suggested. [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects these derivations and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 459).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics in Greek mythology==
[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|right|''[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|El Juicio de Paris]]'' by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1904]]
[[File:Golden Apple of Discord by Jacob Jordaens.jpg|thumb|''Golden [[apple of discord]]'' by [[Jakob Jordaens]], 1633]]

In [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' 11–24, two different goddesses named Eris are distinguished:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.

But the other is the elder daughter of dark Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), and the son of Cronus  [i.e. [[Zeus]]] who sits above and dwells in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' (226–232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:

:And hateful Eris bore painful [[Ponos]] (&quot;Hardship&quot;),
:[[Lethe]] (&quot;Forgetfulness&quot;) and [[Limos (mythology)|Limos]] (&quot;Starvation&quot;) and the tearful [[Algos|Algea]] (&quot;Pains&quot;),
:[[Hysminai]] (&quot;Battles&quot;), [[Makhai]] (&quot;Wars&quot;), [[Phonoi]] (&quot;Murders&quot;), and [[Androctasiai|Androktasiai]] (&quot;Manslaughters&quot;);
:[[Neikea]] (&quot;Quarrels&quot;), Pseudea (&quot;Lies&quot;), Logoi (&quot;Stories&quot;), [[Amphillogiai]] (&quot;Disputes&quot;)
:[[Dysnomia (mythology)|Dysnomia]] (&quot;Anarchy&quot;) and [[Atë|Ate]] (&quot;Ruin&quot;), near one another,
:and [[Horkos]] (&quot;Oath&quot;), who most afflicts men on earth,
:Then willing swears a false oath.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, p. 42 lines 226-232, with the meanings of the names (in parentheses), as given by Caldwell, p. 40 on lines 212&amp;ndash;232.&lt;/ref&gt;


The other Strife is presumably she who appears in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Book&amp;nbsp;IV; equated with [[Enyo]] as sister of [[Ares]] and so presumably daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Strife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has [[Enyalius|a son whom she named Strife]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Enyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in Book 11, of the same work.

The most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the [[Trojan War]] by causing the [[Judgement of Paris]]. The goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been invited along with the rest of [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]] to the forced wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], who would become the parents of [[Achilles]], but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.

She therefore (as mentioned at the ''[[Cypria|Kypria]]'' according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and [[Themis]]) tossed into the party the [[Apple of Discord]], a golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]] inscribed {{lang-grc|[[Kallisti|τῇ καλλίστῃ]]|translit=tē(i) kallistē(i)}} &amp;nbsp;– &quot;For the most beautiful one&quot;, or &quot;To the Fairest One&quot;&amp;nbsp;– provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of [[Troy]], was appointed to select the fairest by [[Zeus]]. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris's decision, and also attempted to bribe him. [[Hera]] offered political power; [[Athena]] promised infinite wisdom; and [[Aphrodite]] tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta]]. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.

In [[Nonnus]]'s ''Dionysiaca'', 2.356, when [[Typhon]] prepares to battle with Zeus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eris (&quot;Strife&quot;) was Typhon's escort in the melée, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (&quot;Victory&quot;) led Zeus to battle.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of [[Polytekhnos]] and [[Aedon]]. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, &quot;Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!&quot; Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos's son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.

==Cultural influences==
===Discordianism===
{{Main|Discordianism}}
Eris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Gregory Hill]] and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] under the [[pen name]]s of &quot;[[Malaclypse the Younger]]&quot; and &quot;Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst&quot;. The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation.

A quote from the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', the first holy book of Discordianism, attempts to clear up the matter:

{{quote|One day Mal-2 consulted his [[Pineal gland|Pineal Gland]] and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. &quot;They were,&quot; She added, &quot;victims of indigestion, you know.&quot;

Suffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But she is mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the ''Principia'', and is referred to as the [[Discordianism#The &quot;original snub&quot;|Original Snub]]. The ''Principia Discordia'' states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister [[Aneris]] (called the equivalent of [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]] by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/64.php |title=Page 57 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through. This is known as the Aneristic Illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/56.php|title=Principia Discordia - Page 49|website=www.principiadiscordia.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this telling, Eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation:

{{Quote|text=I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The concept of Eris as developed by the ''Principia Discordia'' is used and expanded upon in the [[science fiction]] work ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (in which characters from ''Principia Discordia'' appear). In this work, Eris is a major character.&lt;ref name=&quot;starship&quot;&gt;[http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm &quot;Robert Anton Wilson: Searching For Cosmic Intelligence&quot; by Jeffrey Elliot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614022635/http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm |date=June 14, 2006 }} Interview discussing novel (URL accessed 21 February 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
The classic [[fairy tale]] ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' is partly inspired by Eris's role in the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]]. Like Eris, a malevolent [[fairy]] curses a princess after not being invited to the princess's [[infant baptism|christening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=2007-11-06|title=A Handbook of Greek Mythology, Including Its Extension to Rome|author=H.
