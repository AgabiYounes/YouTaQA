'''NYSE American''', formerly known as the '''American Stock Exchange''' ('''AMEX'''), and more recently as '''NYSE MKT''', is an American [[stock exchange]] situated in [[New York City]]. AMEX was previously a [[mutual organization]], owned by its members.

==History==
===The Curb market===
{{see also|Curbstone broker}}
[[File:Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920.jpg|thumb|350px|Curb brokers in Wall Street, New York City, 1920, a year before the trading was moved indoors. That year, journalist Edwin C. Hill described the curb trading on lower Broad Street as &quot;a roaring, swirling whirlpool... like nothing else under the astonishing sky that is its only roof.&quot;&lt;ref name=nyt-stock-cold/&gt;]]
The exchange grew out of the loosely organized [[curb market]] of [[curbstone broker]]s on [[Broad Street (Manhattan)|Broad Street]] in [[Manhattan]]. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under [[Emanuel S. Mendels]] and [[Carl H. Pforzheimer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Sobel |url=https://books.google.com/?id=F92F1rvEt4UC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=carl+pforzheimer+curb+exchange#v=onepage&amp;q=carl%20pforzheimer%20curb%20exchange&amp;f=false |title=The Curbstone Brokers: The Origins of the American Stock Exchange |accessdate=January 6, 2018|isbn = 9781893122659|year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curb brokers had been kicked out of the Mills Building front by 1907, and had moved to the pavement outside the [[Blair Building]] where cabbies lined up. There they were given a &quot;little domain of asphalt&quot; fenced off by the police on Broad Street between Exchange Place and Beaver Street.&lt;ref name=nyt-complaints/&gt; As of 1907, the curb market operated starting at 10 AM, each day except [[Sunday]]s, until a gong at 3 PM. Orders for the purchase and sale of securities were shouted down from the windows of nearby brokerages, with the execution of the sale then shouted back up to the brokerage.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-complaints&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Asks Bingham to Oust Curb Brokers; Lawyer Allen Says Open-Air Exchange Is a Public Nuisance and Therefore Illegal.

===Organizing and 'Curb list'===
As of 1907, E. S. Mendels gave the brokers rules &quot;by right of seniority&quot;, but the curb brokers intentionally avoided organizing. According to the ''Times'', this came from a general belief that if a curb exchange was organized, the exchange authorities would force members to sell their other exchange memberships.&lt;ref name=nyt-complaints/&gt; However, in 1908 the '''New York Curb Market Agency''' was established, which developed appropriate trading rules for curbstone brokers, organized by Mendels.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;  The informal '''Curb Association''' formed in 1910 to weed out undesirables.&lt;ref name=nyt-stock-cold/&gt; The curb exchange was for years at odds with the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), or &quot;Big Board&quot;, operating several buildings away. Explained the ''New York Times'' in 1910, the Big Board looked at the curb as &quot;a trading place for 'cats and dogs.'&quot;&lt;ref name=nyt-curb-out/&gt; On April 1, 1910, however, when the NYSE abolished its unlisted department, the NYSE stocks &quot;made homeless by the abolition&quot; were &quot;refused domicile&quot; by the curb brokers on Broad Street until they had complied with the &quot;Curb list&quot; of requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-curb-out&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Curb Bars Stocks Big Board Dropped; Securities Shut Out by Abolition of Unlisted Department Are Homeless Now. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1910/04/02/archives/curb-bars-stocks-big-board-dropped-securities-shut-out-by-abolition.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 2, 1901 |page=1|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Mendels and his advisers drew up a constitution and formed the '''New York Curb Market Association''', which can be considered the first formal constitution of American Stock Exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;http://abcnewspapers.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11281 New York Curb Market Association&lt;/ref&gt;

===1920s-1940s: Move indoors===
[[File:American stock exchange NYC.jpg|thumb|right|240px|American Stock Exchange building, constructed in 1921.]]
In 1920, journalist Edwin C. Hill wrote that the curb exchange on lower Broad Street was a &quot;roaring, swirling whirlpool&quot; that &quot;tears control of a gold-mine from an unlucky operator, and pauses to auction a puppy-dog. It is like nothing else under the astonished sky that is its only roof.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Munseys Magazine 1920 p. 46&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BKPNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46|title=Munsey's Magazine|publisher=Frank A. Munsey Company|year=1920|page=46|access-date=February 21, 2020|issue=v. 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a group of Curb brokers formed a real estate company to design a building, [[Starrett &amp; Van Vleck]] designed the [[American Stock Exchange Building|new exchange building]] on [[Greenwich Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]] between Thames and Rector, at 86 Trinity Place. It opened in 1921,&lt;ref name=nyt-stock-cold/&gt; and the curbstone brokers moved indoors on June 27, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hth_hjJdUBAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=new+york+state+stock+exchange+%22June+27,+1921%22#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20york%20state%20stock%20exchange%20%22June%2027,%201921%22&amp;f=false|title=Financial Trading and Investing|last=Teall|first=John L.|date=2012|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123918802|page=29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/2515.pdf|title=New York Curb Exchange (Incorporating the New York Curb Market Building), Later known as the American Stock Exchange|last=|first=|date=June 26, 1912|website=Landmarks Preservation Commission|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Curb Exchange soon became the leading international stock market, and according to historian [[Robert Sobel]], &quot;had more individual foreign issues on its list than [...] all other American securities markets combined.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sobel|first=Robert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzJ39Bi9G6oC|title=Amex: A History of the American Stock Exchange, 1921-1971|publisher=Weybright and Talley|year=1972|isbn=|location=|page=48|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernization as the American Stock Exchange===
In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/amex/amex.html|title=History of the NASDAQ and American Stock Exchanges|last=|first=|date=|website=Business Reference Services, Library of Congress|language=en|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exchange was shaken by a scandal in 1961, and in 1962 began a reorganization.&lt;ref name=nyt-verylarge/&gt; Its reputation recently damaged by charges of mismanagement, in 1962 the American Stock Exchange named [[Edwin Etherington]] its president.
