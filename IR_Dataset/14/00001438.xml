'''Absalom''' ({{lang-he-n|אַבְשָׁלוֹם}}, ''Avshalom'', &quot;father of peace&quot;), according to the [[Hebrew Bible]], was the third son of [[David (biblical king)|David]], [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|King of Israel]] with [[Maacah]], daughter of [[Talmai]], King of [[Geshur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|3:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:25|NIV}} describes him as the most handsome man in the kingdom. Absalom eventually rebelled against his father and was killed during the [[Battle of Ephraim's Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:1–17|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical account==
===Background===
[[File:Convito di Ansalonne.jpg|thumb|right|''The Banquet of Absalom'' attributed to [[Niccolò de Simone]] around 1650]]
Absalom, David's third son, by Maacah, was born in [[Hebron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|3:3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved at an early age along with the transfer of the capital to [[Jerusalem]], where he spent most of his life. He was a great favorite of his father, and of the people. His charming manners, personal beauty, insinuating ways, love of pomp, and royal pretensions, captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot, and had fifty men run before him.

Little is known of Absalom's family life, but the biblical narrative states that he had three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar and is described as a beautiful woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;2 Samuel 14:27&quot;/&gt; From the language of {{bibleverse|2 Samuel|18:18|KJV}}, &quot;I have no son to keep my name in remembrance&quot;, it is implied that his sons died at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;A. F. Kirkpatrick (1896). ''2 Samuel''. [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/18.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on 2 Samuel 18, accessed 6 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had no sons  {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|11:20|KJV}} says that Absalom had another daughter or granddaughter named [[Maacah]], who later became the favorite wife of [[Rehoboam]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=2 Chronicles 11:20 cev : Then Rehoboam married Maacah, the daughter of Absalom; 2 Chronicles 11:21 cev : Rehoboam loved his wife Maacah the most |url=https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=rehoboam+maacah&amp;qs_version=CEV}}. A [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%2011:19-21&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-11435a footnote in the New King James Version] reads &quot;Literally ''daughter'', but in the broader sense of granddaughter&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Maacah was the mother of [[Abijah of Judah]], and grandmother of [[Asa of Judah]].  She served as Queen Mother for Asa, until he deposed her for idolatry.  ({{bibleverse|1 Kings|15:1-14|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|11:20-22|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|15:16|KJV}})

===Murder of Amnon===
[[File:Leaf from the Morgan Picture Bible - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Leaf from the [[Morgan Picture Bible]], ''Scenes from the Life of Absalom'', c. 1250]]
Absalom's sister, who was also called [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], was raped by [[Amnon]], who was their half-brother. Amnon was also David's eldest son. After the rape, Absalom waited two years, and then avenged Tamar by sending his servants to murder a drunken Amnon at a feast, to which Absalom had invited all the king's sons ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13|NIV}}).

After this murder Absalom fled to [[Talmai]], who was the king of [[Geshur]] and Absalom's maternal grandfather&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13:37|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also {{bibleverse||Joshua|12:5|NIV}} or {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|13:2|NIV}}). It was not until three years later that Absalom was fully reinstated in his father's favour and finally returned to Jerusalem&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|13–14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Joab]]).

===The revolt at Hebron===
While at Jerusalem, Absalom built support for himself by speaking to those who came to King David for justice, saying, “See, your claims are good and right; but there is no one deputed by the king to hear you&quot;, perhaps reflecting flaws in the judicial system of the United Monarchy. &quot;If only I were the judge of the land! Then all who had a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give them justice.&quot; He made gestures of flattery by kissing those who bowed before him instead of accepting supplication. He &quot;stole the hearts of the people of Israel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|15|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After four years he declared himself king, raised a revolt at [[Hebron]], the former capital, and slept with his father's concubines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk-Duggan2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirk-Duggan |first=Cheryl A.|year=2004 |title=Pregnant Passion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_gW1I90G4MC&amp;pg=PA59 |accessdate=10 March 2013 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9789004127319 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Israel and Judah flocked to him, and David, attended only by the [[Cherethites]] and [[Pelethites]] and his former bodyguard, which had followed him from Gath, found it expedient to flee. The priests Zadok and Abiathar remained in Jerusalem, and their sons Jonathan and Ahimaaz served as David's spies. Absalom reached the capital and consulted with the renowned [[Ahithophel]] (sometimes spelled Achitophel).

David took refuge from Absalom's forces beyond the [[Jordan River]]. However, he took the precaution of instructing a servant, [[Hushai]], to infiltrate Absalom's court and subvert it. Hushai convinced Absalom to ignore Ahithophel's advice to attack his father while he was on the run, and instead to prepare his forces for a major attack. This gave David critical time to prepare his own troops for the battle.

===The Battle of Ephraim's Wood===
[[File:Muerte de absalon en el CESEDEN.jpg|thumb|18th-century tapestry of the death of Absalom.]]
A fateful [[Battle of the Wood of Ephraim|battle]] was fought in the [[Wood of Ephraim]] (the name suggests a locality west of the Jordan) and Absalom's army was completely routed.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|16:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absalom's head was caught in the boughs of an oak tree as the mule he was riding ran beneath it. He was discovered there still alive by one of David's men, who reported this to [[Joab]], the king's commander. Joab, accustomed to avenging himself, took this opportunity to even the score with Absalom.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|14:30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absalom had once set Joab's field on fire&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|17:25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then made Amasa Captain of the Host instead of Joab. Killing Absalom was against David's explicit command, &quot;Beware that none touch the young man Absalom&quot;. Joab killed Absalom with three darts through the heart.

When David heard that Absalom was killed, although not how he was killed, he greatly sorrowed.
{{quote|O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:33}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

David withdrew to the city ([[Mahanaim]])&lt;ref&gt;See {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|19:32}}&lt;/ref&gt; in mourning, until Joab roused him from &quot;the extravagance of his grief&quot; &lt;ref&gt;A. F. Kirkpatrick (1908). ''[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/19.htm 2 Samuel]''. Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, on 2 Samuel 19, accessed 12 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and called on him to fulfil his duty to his people.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|19:1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial===
[[File:InsideAbsalom'sPillar.jpg|thumb|Two views of the burial chamber inside the so-called [[Tomb of Absalom]] in the [[Valley of Jehoshaphat]], [[Jerusalem]], which has no connection to biblical Absalom.]]
Absalom had erected a monument near [[Jerusalem]] to perpetuate his name:&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:18|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An ancient monument in the [[Kidron Valley]] near the Old City of Jerusalem, known as the [[Tomb of Absalom]] or Absalom's Pillar and traditionally identified as the monument of the biblical narrative, is now dated by modern archeologists to the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xDxCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT334&amp;dq=Tomb%20of%20Absalom%20first%20century&amp;pg=PT334#v=onepage&amp;q=Tomb%20of%20Absalom%20first%20century&amp;f=false|title=Zondervan Handbook of Biblical Archaeology: A Book by Book Guide to Archaeological Discoveries Related to the Bible|last=Price|first=J. Randall|last2=House|first2=H. Wayne|date=2017-11-28|publisher=Zondervan|isbn=9780310527640|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish Encyclopedia reports: &quot;A tomb twenty feet high and twenty-four feet square, which late tradition points out as the resting-place of Absalom. It is situated in the eastern part of the valley of Kidron, to the east of Jerusalem. In all probability it is the tomb of [[Alexander Jannæus]] (Conder, in Hastings' ''Dict. Bible'', article &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, p. 597). It existed in the days of Josephus (&quot;Antiquities&quot; vii. 10, § 3). See illustrations on pp. 133, 134.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/638-absalom-s-tomb Absalom Tomb]&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeologists have now dated the tomb to the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite news |author= Amiram Barkat |url= https://www.haaretz.com/1.5348158 |title= Jewish Yad Avshalom revealed as a Christian shrine from Byzantine era |newspaper= [[Haaretz]] |date=22 July 2003 |access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 conference, Professor [[Gabriel Barkay]] suggested that it could be the tomb of [[Herod Agrippa]], the grandson of [[Herod the Great]], based in part on the similarity to Herod's newly discovered tomb at [[Herodium]]. For centuries, it was the custom among passers-by—Jews, Christians and [[Islam|Muslims]]—to throw stones at the monument. Residents of Jerusalem would bring their unruly children to the site to teach them what became of a rebellious son.&lt;ref name=GTI&gt;{{cite book |title= The Guide to Israel |author= Zev Vilnay |publisher= Hamakor Press |location= Jerusalem |year= 1970 |chapter= Pillar of Absalom |pages= 157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinic literature==
The life and death of Absalom offered to the rabbis a welcome theme wherewith to warn the people against false ambition, vainglory, and unfilial conduct. The vanity with which he displayed his beautiful hair, the rabbis say, became his snare and his stumbling-block. &quot;By his long hair the [[Nazirite]] entangled the people to rebel against his father, and by it he himself became entangled, to fall a victim to his pursuers&quot; (Mishnah Soṭah, i. 8). And again, elsewhere: &quot;By his vile stratagem he deceived and stole three hearts, that of his father, of the elders, and finally of the whole nation of Israel, and for this reason three darts were thrust into his heart to end his treacherous life&quot; (Tosef., Soṭah, iii. 17). More striking is the following: &quot;Did one ever hear of an oak-tree having a heart? And yet in the oak-tree in whose branches Absalom was caught, we read that upon its heart he was held up still alive while the darts were thrust through him [Mek., Shirah, § 6]. This is to show that when a man becomes so heartless as to make war against his own father, nature itself takes on a heart to avenge the deed.&quot;

Popular legend states that the eye of Absalom was of immense size, signifying his insatiable greed (Niddah, 24b). Indeed, &quot;hell itself opened beneath him, and David, his father, cried seven times: 'My son! my son!' while bewailing his death, praying at the same time for his redemption from the seventh section of Gehenna, to which he was consigned&quot; (Soṭah, 10b). According to R. Meir (Sanh. 103b), &quot;he has no share in the life to come&quot;. And according to the description of Gehenna by Joshua ben Levi, who, like Dante, wandered through hell under the guidance of the angel Duma, Absalom still dwells there, having the rebellious heathen in charge; and when the angels with their fiery rods run also against Absalom to smite him like the rest, a heavenly voice says: &quot;Spare Absalom, the son of David, My servant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/637-absalom Absalom]&quot;.
