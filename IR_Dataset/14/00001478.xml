In [[Norse cosmology]], '''Alfheim''' ({{Lang-non|Álfheimr}}, &quot;Land Of The Elves&quot; or &quot;Elfland&quot;), also called '''Ljosalfheim''' (''Ljósálf[a]heimr'', &quot;home of the [[Ljósálfar|light-elves]]&quot;), is home of the [[Elf#Old_Norse_texts|Light Elves]].

==In Old Norse texts==
{{Also|Svartálfaheimr}}
Álfheim as an abode of the Elves is mentioned only twice in [[Old Norse]] texts.

The [[eddic poem]] ''[[Grímnismál]]'' describes twelve divine dwellings beginning in stanza&amp;nbsp;5 with:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Ýdalir]] call they &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; the place where [[Ullr|Ull]]&lt;br/&gt;
A hall for himself hath set;&lt;br/&gt;
And Álfheim the gods &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; to [[Freyr|Frey]] once gave&lt;br/&gt;
As a tooth-gift in ancient times.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A tooth-gift was a gift given to an [[infant]] on the cutting of the first tooth.

In the 12th century eddic prose ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[Snorri Sturluson]] relates it as the first of a series of abodes in heaven:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That which is called Álfheim is one, where dwell the peoples called ''[[ljósálfar]]'' [Light Elves]; but the ''[[dökkálfar]]'' [Dark Elves] dwell down in the earth, and they are unlike in appearance, but by far more unlike in nature. The Light-elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark-elves are blacker than pitch.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The account later, in speaking of a hall in the Highest Heaven called [[Gimlé]] that shall survive when heaven and earth have died, explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is said that another heaven is to the southward and upward of this one, and it is called [[Andlang]] [''Andlangr'' 'Endlong'] but the third heaven is yet above that, and it is called [[Vídbláin]] [''Vídbláinn'' 'Wide-blue'] and in that heaven we think this abode is. But we believe that none but Light-Elves inhabit these mansions now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is not indicated whether these heavens are identical to Álfheim or distinct. Some texts read Vindbláin (''Vindbláinn'' 'Wind-blue') instead of Vídbláin.

Modern commentators speculate (or sometimes state as fact) that Álfheim was one of the nine worlds (''heima'') mentioned in stanza&amp;nbsp;2 of the eddic poem ''[[Völuspá]]''.
