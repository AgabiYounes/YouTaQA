In [[organic chemistry]], an '''amide''', also known as an '''organic amide''' or a '''carboxamide''', is a [[chemical compound|compound]] with the general formula RC(=O)NR′R″, where R, R′, and R″ represent [[organic compound|organic]] [[functional group|groups]] or [[hydrogen]] atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{goldbookref|file=A00266|title=amides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Chapter 21: Amides and Imides | title = Nomenclature of Organic Compounds | pages = [https://archive.org/details/nomenclatureofor0000flet/page/166 166–173] | doi = 10.1021/ba-1974-0126.ch021 | work = Advances in Chemistry | volume = Volume 126 | isbn = 9780841201910 | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/nomenclatureofor0000flet/page/166 | publisher = Washington, American Chemical Society | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be viewed as a derivative of a [[carboxylic acid]] RC(=O)OH with the [[hydroxyl]] group –OH replaced by an [[amine]] group –NR′R″; or, equivalently, an [[acyl group|acyl (alkanoyl) group]] RC(=O)– joined to an amine group.  

Common examples of amides are [[acetamide]] H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C–CONH2, [[benzamide]] C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;–CONH2, and [[dimethylformamide]] HCON(–CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Amides are qualified as '''primary''', '''secondary''', and '''tertiary''' according to whether the amine subgroup has the form –NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, –NHR, or –NRR′, where R and R′ are groups other than hydrogen.{{not in body|date=January 2020}}

The core –C(=O)N= of amides is called the '''amide group''' (specifically, '''carboxamide group''').

Amides are pervasive in nature and technology.  [[Protein]]s and important [[plastic]]s like [[Nylon]]s,  [[Aramid]], [[Twaron]], and [[Kevlar]] are [[polymer]]s whose units are connected by amide groups ([[polyamide]]s);  these linkages are easily formed, confer structural rigidity, and resist [[hydrolysis]].  (In [[biochemistry]], the amide group is called a [[peptide bond]] when it is part of the main chain of a protein, and [[isopeptide bond]] when it occurs in a side chain, such as in the [[amino acids]] [[asparagine]] and [[glutamine]].)  Amides include many other important biological compounds, as well as many [[drug]]s like [[paracetamol]], [[penicillin]] and [[LSD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2012.05.038|title=Alkamid database: Chemistry, occurrence and functionality of plant ''N''-alkylamides|year=2012|last1=Boonen|first1=Jente|last2=Bronselaer|first2=Antoon|last3=Nielandt|first3=Joachim|last4=Veryser|first4=Lieselotte|last5=De Tré|first5=Guy|last6=De Spiegeleer|first6=Bart|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=142|issue=3|pages=563–90|pmid=22659196|hdl=1854/LU-2133714|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/2133714/file/2140565.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low molecular weight amides, such as dimethylformamide, are common solvents.

==Nomenclature==
{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Amines and amides}}
In the usual nomenclature, one adds the term &quot;amide&quot; to the stem of the parent acid's name. For instance, the amide derived from [[acetic acid]] is named [[acetamide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). IUPAC recommends [[ethanamide]], but this and related formal names are rarely encountered. When the amide is derived from a primary or secondary amine, the substituents on nitrogen are indicated first in the name. Thus, the amide formed from [[dimethylamine]] and [[acetic acid]] is ''N'',''N''-dimethylacetamide (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CONMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where Me = CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Usually even this name is simplified to [[dimethylacetamide]]. Cyclic amides are called [[lactam]]s; they are necessarily secondary or tertiary amides.&lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry IUPAC Nomenclature. Rules C-821. Amides http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_540.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121062927/http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/79/r79_540.htm |date=21 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronunciation===
The term &quot;amide&quot; is variously pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|aɪ|d}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ɪ|d}} or {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-amide.ogg|ˈ|eɪ|m|aɪ|d}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/amide|title=Amide definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|amide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/amide|title=amide - Definition of amide in English by Oxford Dictionaries|author=|date=|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some chemists use different pronunciations for the two main senses, saying {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|iː|d}} for the [[carbonyl]]–[[nitrogen]] compound and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|m|aɪ|d}} for the [[anion]].{{cn|date=January 2020}} Others replace one of these with {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|m|ᵻ|d}}.

==Properties==

===Bonding===
[[File:Formamide-MO-3D-balls.png|thumb|180px|Ball-and-stick model of the formamide molecule, showing the [[pi bond|π molecular orbitals]] (gray).]]
The lone pair of [[electron]]s on the nitrogen atom is delocalized into the carbonyl group, thus forming a partial [[double bond]] between nitrogen and carbon.  In fact the O, C and N atoms have [[molecular orbital]]s occupied by [[delocalized electron]]s, forming a [[conjugated system]].  Consequently, the three bonds of the nitrogen in amides is not pyramidal (as in the amines) but planar. 

The structure of an amide can be described also as a [[resonance structure|resonance]] between two alternative structures:
:[[File:AmideResonance.png|300px]]
It is estimated that acetamide has structure A for 62% of the time, and B for 28% of the time (which does not sum to 100% because there are additional resonance forms that are not depicted in the above Figure). There is also a hydrogen bond present between the active groups hydrogen and nitrogen atoms.&lt;ref name = Kemnitz&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja0663024|title=&quot;Amide Resonance&quot; Correlates with a Breadth of C−N Rotation Barriers|year=2007|last1=Kemnitz|first1=Carl R.|last2=Loewen|first2=Mark J.|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=129|issue=9|pages=2521–8|pmid=17295481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resonance is largely prevented in the very strained [[quinuclidone]].
&lt;!--needs:

comment on syn and anti secondary amides--&gt;
===Basicity===
Compared to [[amine]]s, amides are very weak [[base (chemistry)|base]]s. While the [[conjugate acid]] of an [[amine]] has a [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of about 9.5, the [[conjugate acid]] of an amide has a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; around −0.5. Therefore, amides don't have as clearly noticeable [[acid–base]] properties in [[water]]. This relative lack of basicity is explained by the withdrawing of electrons from the amine by the carbonyl. On the other hand, amides are much stronger [[Base (chemistry)|base]]s than [[carboxylic acid]]s, [[ester]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[ketone]]s (their conjugate acids' p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;s are between −6 and −10). 

The proton of a primary or secondary amide does not dissociate readily under normal conditions; its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is usually well above 15. Conversely, under extremely acidic conditions, the carbonyl [[oxygen]] can become protonated with a p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of roughly −1. It is not only because of the positive charge on the nitrogen, but also because of the negative charge on the oxygen gained through resonance.

===Hydrogen bonding and solubility===
Because of the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the carbonyl (C=O) is a stronger dipole than the N–C dipole. The presence of a C=O dipole and, to a lesser extent a N–C dipole, allows amides to act as H-bond acceptors. In primary and secondary amides, the presence of N–H dipoles allows amides to function as H-bond donors as well. Thus amides can participate in [[hydrogen bonding]] with water and other protic solvents; the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the N–H hydrogen atoms can donate H-bonds. As a result of interactions such as these, the water solubility of amides is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.  These hydrogen bonds are also have an important role in the [[secondary structure]] of proteins.

The [[Solubility|solubilities]] of amides and esters are roughly comparable. Typically amides are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. Tertiary amides, with the important exception of [[Dimethylformamide|''N'',''N''-dimethylformamide]], exhibit low solubility in water.

===Characterization===
The presence of the amide group –C(=O)N– is generally easily established, at least in small molecules. It can be distinguished from nitro and cyano groups in [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]]. Amides exhibit a moderately intense ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;/sub&gt; band near 1650&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. By &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H [[NMR spectroscopy]], CON'''H'''R signals occur at low fields. In X-ray crystallography, the C(=O)N center together with the three immediately adjacent atoms characteristically define a plane.

:[[File:Acid-CatAmideHydrolMarch.png|320 px|thumb|Mechanism for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide.&lt;ref&gt;{{March6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Amides undergo many chemical reactions, although they are less reactive than esters.  Amides hydrolyse in hot [[alkali]] as well as in strong [[acid]]ic conditions. Acidic conditions yield the carboxylic acid and the ammonium ion while basic hydrolysis yield the carboxylate ion and ammonia. Amides are also versatile precursors to many other [[functional group]]s. Electrophiles attack the [[carbonyl]] oxygen. This step often precedes hydrolysis, which is catalyzed by both [[Brønsted acid]]s and [[Lewis acid]]s.   Enzymes, e.g. [[peptidase]]s and artificial catalysts, are known to accelerate the hydrolysis reactions.

==Synthesis==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Organic reaction]] --&gt;
Many methods exist in amide synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amide bond formation and peptide coupling |first1=Christian A. G. N. |last1=Montalbetti |first2=Virginie |last2=Falque |journal=Tetrahedron |volume=61 |issue=46 |date=14 November 2005 |pages=10827–10852 |doi=10.1016/j.tet.2005.08.031}}&lt;/ref&gt; On paper, the simplest method for making amides is by coupling a [[carboxylic acid]] with an [[amine]]. In general this reaction is thermodynamically favorable, however it suffers from a high [[activation energy]], largely due to the amine first deprotonating the carboxylic acid, which reduces its reactivity. As such the direct reaction often requires high temperatures.

:RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H + R′R″NH {{eqm}} {{chem|RCO|2|−}} + {{chem|R′R″NH|2|+}} {{eqm}} RC(O)NR′R″ + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Many methods are known for driving the equilibrium to the right. For the most part these reactions involve &quot;activating&quot; the carboxylic acid by first converting it to a better [[electrophile]]; such as [[ester]]s, [[acid chloride]]s ([[Schotten-Baumann reaction]]) or [[anhydride]]s ([[Lumière–Barbier method]]). Conventional methods in [[peptide synthesis]] use coupling agents such as [[HATU]], [[Hydroxybenzotriazole|HOBt]], or  [[PyBOP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Amide bond formation: beyond the myth of coupling reagents |first1=Eric |last1=Valeur |first2=Mark |last2=Bradley |journal=Chem.

The reaction proceed by one dehydrogenation of the alcohol to the [[aldehyde]] followed by formation of a [[hemiaminal]], which undergoes a second dehydrogenation to the amide. Elimination of water in the hemiaminal to the imine is not observed.
