'''ALGOL''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|l|g|ɒ|l|,_|-|g|ɔː|l}}; short for &quot;'''Algorithmic Language'''&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;The name of this language family is sometimes given in mixed case ([http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm ''Algol 60''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625171638/http://www.masswerk.at/algol60/report.htm |date=25 June 2007}}), and sometimes in all uppercase ([http://www.cs.ru.nl/~hubbers/courses/sl1/rr.pdf ''ALGOL68''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913132128/http://www.cs.ru.nl/~hubbers/courses/sl1/rr.pdf |date=13 September 2014}}). For simplicity this article uses ''ALGOL''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a family of [[imperative programming|imperative]] computer [[programming language]]s, originally developed in the mid-1950s, which greatly influenced many other languages and was the standard method for [[algorithm]] description used by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) in textbooks and academic sources for more than thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calgo.acm.org/ ''Collected Algorithms of the ACM''] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111017235805/http://calgo.acm.org/ |date=17 October 2011}} Compressed archives of the algorithms.

In the sense that the [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of most modern languages is &quot;Algol-like&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ohearn/Algol/intro.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114122103/http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ohearn/Algol/intro.html |title=Algol-like languages, Introduction |last=O'Hearn |first=P.

ALGOL introduced [[Block (programming)|code blocks]] and the &lt;code&gt;begin&lt;/code&gt;...&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; pairs for delimiting them. It was also the first language implementing [[nested function]] definitions with [[lexical scope]]. Moreover, it was the first programming language which gave detailed attention to formal language definition and through the ''[[Algol 60#History|Algol 60 Report]]'' introduced [[Backus–Naur form]], a principal [[formal grammar]] notation for language design.

There were three major specifications, named after the years they were first published:
* [[ALGOL 58]] – originally proposed to be called ''IAL'', for ''International Algebraic Language''.
* [[ALGOL 60]] – first implemented as ''X1 ALGOL 60'' in mid-1960. Revised 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* [[ALGOL 68]] – introduced new elements including flexible arrays, slices, parallelism, operator identification. Revised 1973.&lt;ref name=a68&gt;{{cite web|title=Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 68|year=1973|url=http://www.cs.ru.nl/~hubbers/courses/sl1/rr.pdf|access-date=13 September 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913132128/http://www.cs.ru.nl/~hubbers/courses/sl1/rr.pdf|archive-date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALGOL 68 is substantially different from ALGOL 60 and was not well received, so that in general &quot;Algol&quot; means ALGOL 60 and dialects thereof.

==Important implementations==
The International Algebraic Language (IAL), renamed [[ALGOL 58]], was highly influential and generally considered the ancestor of most of the modern programming languages (the so-called Algol-like languages). Further, ''ALGOL object code'' was a simple, compact, and [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]]-based [[instruction set]] architecture commonly used in teaching [[compiler]] construction and other high order languages; of which Algol is generally considered the first.

==History==

ALGOL was developed jointly by a committee of European and American computer scientists in a meeting in 1958 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich ([[ETH Zurich]]; cf. [[ALGOL 58]]). It specified three different syntaxes: a reference syntax, a publication syntax, and an implementation syntax. The different syntaxes permitted it to use different keyword names and conventions for decimal points (commas vs periods) for different languages.

ALGOL was used mostly by research computer scientists in the United States and in Europe. Its use in commercial applications was hindered by the absence of standard [[input/output]] facilities in its description and the lack of interest in the language by large computer vendors other than [[Burroughs Corporation]]. ALGOL 60 did however become the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development.

[[File:Algol&amp;Fortran family-by-Borkowski.svg|thumb|alt=caption|Family tree of the Algol, [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]] programming language dynasty]]

[[John Backus]] developed the ''Backus normal form'' method of describing programming languages specifically for ALGOL 58. It was revised and expanded by [[Peter Naur]] for ALGOL 60, and at [[Donald Knuth]]'s suggestion renamed [[Backus–Naur form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knuth |first=Donald E. |year=1964 |title=Backus Normal Form vs Backus Naur Form |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=735–736 |doi=10.1145/355588.365140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Naur: &quot;As editor of the ALGOL Bulletin I was drawn into the international discussions of the language and was selected to be member of the European language design group in November 1959. In this capacity I was the editor of the ALGOL 60 report, produced as the result of the ALGOL 60 meeting in Paris in January 1960.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;naur_acm&quot;&gt;[http://awards.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1024454&amp;srt=all&amp;aw=140&amp;ao=AMTURING&amp;yr=2005 ACM Award Citation: Peter Naur] {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120402220529/http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/naur_1024454.cfm |date=2 April 2012}}, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The following people attended the meeting in Paris (from 1 to 16 January):
* [[Friedrich L. Bauer]], [[Peter Naur]], [[Heinz Rutishauser]], [[Klaus Samelson]], [[Bernard Vauquois]], [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]], and [[Michael Woodger]] (from Europe)
* [[John Backus|John W. Backus]], [[Julien Green (computer scientist)|Julien Green]], [[Charles Katz]], [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], [[Alan Perlis|Alan J. Perlis]], and [[Joseph Henry Wegstein]] (from the USA).
Alan Perlis gave a vivid description of the meeting: &quot;The meetings were exhausting, interminable, and exhilarating. One became aggravated when one's good ideas were discarded along with the bad ones of others. Nevertheless, diligence persisted during the entire period. The chemistry of the 13 was excellent.&quot;

ALGOL 60 inspired many languages that followed it. [[Tony Hoare]] remarked: &quot;Here is a language so far ahead of its time that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors but also on nearly all its successors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf &quot;Hints on Programming Language Design&quot;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915033339/http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/courses/papers/Hoare_Hints.pdf |date=15 September 2009}}, C.A.R. Hoare, December 1973. Page 27. (This statement is sometimes erroneously attributed to [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]], also involved in implementing the first ALGOL 60 [[compiler]].)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] programming language, a variant of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] that adopted the block structure and lexical scope of ALGOL, also adopted the wording &quot;Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme&quot; for its standards documents in homage to ALGOL.&lt;ref name=&quot;r3rs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor-last=Rees |editor-first=Jonathan |editor2-last=Clinger |editor2-first=William |editor3-last=Abelson |editor3-first=Hal |editor3-link=Hal Abelson |last=Dybvig |first=R.

===Algol and programming language research===
As [[Peter Landin]] noted, the language Algol was the first language to combine seamlessly imperative effects with the (call-by-name) [[lambda calculus]]. Perhaps the most elegant formulation of the language is due to [[John C. Reynolds]], and it best exhibits its syntactic and semantic purity. Reynolds's idealized Algol also made a convincing methodological argument regarding the suitability of local effects in the context of call-by-name languages, to be contrasted with the global effects used by call-by-value languages such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. The conceptual integrity of the language made it one of the main objects of semantic research, along with [[Programming Computable Functions]] (PCF) and ML.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter O'Hearn]] and Robert D. Tennent. 1996. Algol-Like Languages. Birkhauser Boston Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===IAL implementations timeline===
To date there have been at least 70 augmentations, extensions, derivations and sublanguages of Algol 60.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=1807 |title=The Encyclopedia of Computer Languages |access-date=20 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927014141/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage.prx?exp=1807 |archive-date=27 September 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burroughs dialects included special Bootstrapping dialects such as [[Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language|ESPOL]] and [[NEWP]].  The latter is still used for Unisys MCP system software.

==Properties==
ALGOL 60 as officially defined had no [[I/O]] facilities; implementations defined their own in ways that were rarely compatible with each other. In contrast, ALGOL 68 offered an extensive library of ''transput'' (input/output) facilities.

ALGOL 60 allowed for two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] for [[Parameter (computer science)|parameter]] passing: the common [[call-by-value]], and [[call-by-name]]. Call-by-name has certain effects in contrast to [[call-by-reference]]. For example, without specifying the parameters as ''value'' or ''reference'', it is impossible to develop a procedure that will swap the values of two parameters if the actual parameters that are passed in are an integer variable and an array that is indexed by that same integer variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aho |first=Alfred V. |author-link=Alfred V. Aho |last2=Sethi |first2=Ravi |author2-link=Ravi Sethi |last3=Ullman |first3=Jeffrey D. |author3-link=Jeffrey Ullman |title=[[Dragon Book (computer science)|Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools]] |year=1986 |edition=1st |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-201-10194-7}}, Section 7.5, and references therein&lt;/ref&gt; Think of passing a pointer to swap(i, A[i]) in to a function. Now that every time swap is referenced, it is reevaluated. Say i := 1 and A[i] := 2, so every time swap is referenced it will return the other combination of the values ([1,2], [2,1], [1,2] and so on). A similar situation occurs with a random function passed as actual argument.

Call-by-name is known by many compiler designers for the interesting &quot;[[thunk]]s&quot; that are used to implement it. [[Donald Knuth]] devised the &quot;[[man or boy test]]&quot; to separate compilers that correctly implemented &quot;[[recursion (computer science)|recursion]] and non-local references.&quot; This test contains an example of call-by-name.

ALGOL 68 was defined using a two-level grammar formalism invented by [[Adriaan van Wijngaarden]] and which bears his name. [[Van Wijngaarden grammar]]s use a [[context-free grammar]] to generate an infinite set of productions that will recognize a particular ALGOL 68 program; notably, they are able to express the kind of requirements that in many other programming language standards are labelled &quot;semantics&quot; and have to be expressed in ambiguity-prone natural language prose, and then implemented in compilers as ''ad hoc'' code attached to the formal language parser.

==Examples and portability issues==

  FLOATING POINT ALGOL TEST'
  BEGIN REAL A,B,C,D'
  &amp;nbsp;
  READ D'
  &amp;nbsp;
  FOR A:= 0.0 STEP D UNTIL 6.3 DO
  BEGIN
    PRINT PUNCH(3),££L??'
    B := SIN(A)'
    C := COS(A)'
    PRINT PUNCH(3),SAMELINE,ALIGNED(1,6),A,B,C'
  END'
  END'

PUNCH(3) sends output to the teleprinter rather than the tape punch.&lt;br&gt;
SAMELINE suppresses the carriage return + line feed normally printed between arguments.&lt;br&gt;
ALIGNED(1,6) controls the format of the output with 1 digit before and 6 after the decimal point.

====ALGOL 68====
The following code samples are ALGOL 68 versions of the above ALGOL 60 code samples.

ALGOL 68 implementations used ALGOL 60's approaches to [[stropping (programming)|stropping]]. In ALGOL 68's case tokens with the '''bold''' typeface are reserved words, types ('''mode'''s) or operators.

 '''proc''' abs max = ([,]'''real''' a, '''ref''' '''real''' y, '''ref''' '''int''' i, k)'''real''':
 '''comment''' The absolute greatest element of the matrix a, of size ⌈a by 2⌈a
 is transferred to y, and the subscripts of this element to i and k; '''comment'''
 '''begin'''
    '''real''' y := 0; i := ⌊a; k := 2⌊a;
    '''for''' p '''from''' ⌊a '''to''' ⌈a '''do'''
      '''for''' q '''from''' 2⌊a '''to''' 2⌈a '''do'''
        '''if''' '''abs''' a[p, q] &gt; y '''then'''
            y := '''abs''' a[p, q];
            i := p; k := q
        '''fi'''
      '''od'''
    '''od''';
    y
 '''end''' # abs max #
Note: lower (⌊) and upper (⌈) bounds of an array, and array slicing, are directly available to the programmer.

 floating point algol68 test:
 (
   '''real''' a,b,c,d;
   &amp;nbsp;
   # ''printf'' - sends output to the '''file''' ''stand out''. #
   # ''printf($p$);'' – selects a ''new page'' #
   printf(($pg$,&quot;Enter d:&quot;));  
   read(d);
   &amp;nbsp;
   '''for''' step '''from''' 0 '''while''' a:=step*d; a &lt;= 2*pi '''do'''
     printf($l$);  # ''$l$'' - selects a ''new line''. #
     b := sin(a);
     c := cos(a);
     printf(($z-d.6d$,a,b,c))  # formats output with 1 digit before and 6 after the decimal point. #
   '''od'''
 )

===Timeline: Hello world===
The variations and lack of portability of the programs from one implementation to another is easily demonstrated by the classic [[hello world program]].

====ALGOL 58 (IAL)====
{{main|ALGOL 58}}
ALGOL 58 had no I/O facilities.

====ALGOL 60 family====
{{main|ALGOL 60}}
Since ALGOL 60 had no I/O facilities, there is no portable [[hello world program]] in ALGOL.
The next three examples are in Burroughs Extended Algol. The first two direct output at the interactive terminal they are run on. The first uses a character array, similar to C. The language allows the array identifier to be used as a pointer to the array, and hence in a REPLACE statement.

 BEGIN
   FILE F(KIND=REMOTE);
   EBCDIC ARRAY E[0:11];
   REPLACE E BY &quot;HELLO WORLD!&quot;;
   WRITE(F, *, E);
 END.

A simpler program using an inline format:

 BEGIN
   FILE F(KIND=REMOTE);
   WRITE(F, &lt;&quot;HELLO WORLD!&quot;&gt;);
 END.

An even simpler program using the Display statement. Note that its output would end up at the system console ('SPO'):

 BEGIN DISPLAY(&quot;HELLO WORLD!&quot;) END.

An alternative example, using Elliott Algol I/O is as follows.  Elliott Algol used different characters for &quot;open-string-quote&quot; and &quot;close-string-quote&quot;:

  '''program''' HiFolks;
  '''begin'''
     '''print''' 'Hello world';
  '''end''';

Here is a version for the Elliott 803 Algol (A104) The standard Elliott 803 used 5 hole paper tape and thus only had upper case.  The code lacked any quote characters so £ (UK Pound Sign) was used for open quote and ? (Question Mark) for close quote.  Special sequences were placed in double quotes (e.g. ££L?? produced a new line on the teleprinter).

   HIFOLKS'
   BEGIN
      PRINT £HELLO WORLD£L??'
   END'

The [[ICT 1900 series]] Algol I/O version allowed input from paper tape or punched card.  Paper tape 'full' mode allowed lower case.  Output was to a line printer. The open and close quote characters were represented using '(' and ')' and spaces by %.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icl1900.co.uk/techpub/tp3340.djvu|title=ICL 1900 series: Algol Language|publisher=ICL Technical Publication 3340|year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   'BEGIN'
      WRITE TEXT('('HELLO%WORLD')');
   'END'

====ALGOL 68====
{{main|ALGOL 68}}

'''ALGOL 68''' code was published with reserved words typically in lowercase, but bolded or underlined.
 '''begin'''
   printf(($gl$,&quot;Hello, world!&quot;))
 '''end'''
In the language of the &quot;Algol 68 Report&quot; the [[input/output]] facilities were collectively called the &quot;Transput&quot;.

}}
The ALGOLs were conceived at a time when character sets were diverse and evolving rapidly; also, the ALGOLs were defined so that only ''uppercase'' letters were required.

1960: [[IFIP]] – The Algol 60 language and report included several mathematical symbols which are available on modern computers and operating systems, but, unfortunately, were unsupported on most computing systems at the time. For instance: ×, ÷, ≤, ≥, ≠, ¬, ∨, ∧, ⊂, ≡, ␣ and ⏨.

1961 September: ASCII – The [[ASCII]] character set, then in an early stage of development, had the [[\]] (Back slash) character added to it in order to support ALGOL's [[boolean data type|boolean]] operators [[ALGOL 68#Dyadic operators with associated priorities|/\]] and [[ALGOL 68#Dyadic operators with associated priorities|\/]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobbemer.com/BACSLASH.HTM How ASCII Got Its Backslash] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711225835/http://bobbemer.com/BACSLASH.HTM |date=11 July 2014}}, Bob Bemer&lt;/ref&gt;

1962: [[ALCOR]] – This character set included the unusual &quot;᛭&quot;&lt;!-- U+16ED --&gt; runic cross&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/16ed/ iron/runic cross]&lt;/ref&gt; character for multiplication and the &quot;⏨&quot; Decimal Exponent Symbol&lt;ref&gt;[http://mailcom.com/unicode/DecimalExponent.ttf Decimal Exponent Symbol]&lt;/ref&gt; for floating point notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baumann |first=R. |title=ALGOL Manual of the ALCOR Group, Part 1 |journal=Elektronische Rechenanlagen |date=October 1961 |pages=206–212 |language=German|trans-title=ALGOL Manual of the ALCOR Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baumann |first=R. |title=ALGOL Manual of the ALCOR Group, Part 2 |journal=Elektronische Rechenanlagen |volume=6 |date=December 1961 |pages=259–265 |language=German|trans-title=ALGOL Manual of the ALCOR Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baumann |first=R. |title=ALGOL Manual of the ALCOR Group, Part 3 |journal=Elektronische Rechenanlagen |volume=2 |date=April 1962 |language=German|trans-title=ALGOL Manual of the ALCOR Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1964: [[GOST]] – The 1964 Soviet standard [[GOST 10859]] allowed the encoding of 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit and 7-bit characters in ALGOL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOST 10859 standard |url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html#gost10859 |access-date=5 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616201227/http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/codes/stand.html |archive-date=16 June 2007 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1968: The &quot;Algol 68 Report&quot; – used extant ALGOL characters, and further adopted →, ↓, ↑, □, ⌊, ⌈, ⎩, ⎧, ○, ⊥, and ¢ characters which can be found on the [[IBM 2741]] keyboard with ''[[IBM Selectric typewriter|typeball]]'' (or ''golf ball'') [[Printer (computing)#Typewriter-derived printers|print heads]] inserted (such as the [[APL (programming language)#Hardware|APL golf ball]]). These became available in the mid-1960s while ALGOL 68 was being drafted.  The report was translated into Russian, German, French, and Bulgarian, and allowed programming in languages with larger character sets, e.g., [[Cyrillic]] alphabet of the Soviet [[BESM]]-4. All ALGOL's characters are also part of the [[Unicode]] standard and most of them are available in several popular [[font]]s.

2009 October: [[Unicode]] – The &lt;code&gt;⏨&lt;/code&gt; (Decimal Exponent Symbol) for floating point notation was added to Unicode 5.2 for backward compatibility with historic [[Buran programme]] ALGOL software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
