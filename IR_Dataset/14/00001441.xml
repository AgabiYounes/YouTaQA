'''Abydos''' ({{lang-grc|Ἄβυδος}}, {{lang-la|Abydus}}) was an ancient city and bishopric in [[Mysia]].{{refn|Abydos is placed either within Mysia,&lt;ref&gt;For Abydos within Mysia, see

&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Troad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brill&quot;/&gt;|group=nb}} It was located at the [[Nara Burnu]] promontory on the Asian coast of the [[Dardanelles|Hellespont]], opposite the ancient city of [[Sestos]], and near the city of [[Çanakkale]] in [[Turkey]]. Abydos was founded in c. 670 at the most narrow point in the straits,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen993&quot; /&gt; and thus was one of the main crossing points between Europe and Asia, until its replacement by the crossing between [[Lampsacus]] and [[Gelibolu|Kallipolis]] in the 13th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kazhdan_Kallipolis&quot;/&gt; and the abandonment of Abydos in the early 14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leveniotis13-14&quot;/&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], Abydos is presented in the myth of [[Hero and Leander]] as the home of Leander.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkinson (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also mentioned in ''Rodanthe and Dosikles'', a novel written by [[Theodore Prodromos]], a 12th-century writer, in which Dosikles kidnaps Rodanthe at Abydos.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan &amp; Wharton (1985), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
In 1675, the site of Abydos was first identified, and was subsequently visited by numerous classicists and travellers, such as [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]], [[Richard Chandler]], and [[Lord Byron]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunter&quot;&gt;Gunter (2015), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The city's acropolis is known in Turkish as Mal Tepe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt;

Following the city's abandonment, the ruins of Abydos were scavenged for building materials from the 14th to the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Leveniotis (2017), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and remains of walls and buildings continued to be reported until at least the 19th century, however, little remains and the area was declared a restricted military zone in the early 20th century, thus little to no excavation has taken place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ancientportsantiques.com/wp-content/uploads/Documents/PLACES/Bosphorus-BlackSea/ChersonneseThracian-Gazetteer.pdf Archivum Callipolitanum II]''.

==History==

===Classical period===
[[File:Thracian chersonese.png|thumb|left|200px|The environs of Abydos in Antiquity]]
Abydos is mentioned in the ''[[Iliad]]'' as a [[Troy|Trojan]] ally,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;&gt;Mitchell (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to [[Strabo]], was occupied by [[Bebryces]] and later [[Thracians]] after the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;Leveniotis (2017), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the city was originally a [[Phoenicia]]n colony as there was a temple of [[Aphrodite]] Porne (Aphrodite the Harlot) within Abydos.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (2014), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gorman (2001), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Abydos was settled by [[Miletus|Milesian]] colonists contemporaneously with the foundation of the cities of [[Karabiga|Priapos]] and [[Marmara Island|Prokonnesos]] in {{circa|670 BC}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen993&quot;&gt;Hansen &amp; Nielsen (2004), p. 993&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo related that [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]], King of [[Lydia]], granted his consent to the Milesians to settle Abydos;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;&gt;Bean (1976), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; it is argued that this was carried out by Milesian mercenaries to act as a garrison to prevent Thracian raids into Asia Minor.&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1983), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The city became a thriving centre for tuna exportation as a result of the high yield of tuna in the Hellespont.&lt;ref&gt;Roesti (1966), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Abydos was ruled by Daphnis, a pro-Persian [[tyrant]], in the 520s BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;&gt;Hansen &amp; Nielsen (2004), p. 1003&lt;/ref&gt; but was occupied by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 514.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt; [[Darius I]] destroyed the city following his [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|Scythian campaign]] in 512.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;/&gt; Abydos participated in the [[Ionian Revolt]] in the early 5th century BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brill&quot;/&gt; however, the city returned briefly to Persian control as, in 480, at the onset of the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], [[Xerxes I]] and the Persian army passed through Abydos on their march to Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt; After the failed Persian invasion, Abydos became a member of the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]]-led [[Delian League]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell&quot;/&gt; and was part of the [[Members of the Delian League#Hellespontine phoros|Hellespontine district]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;/&gt; Ostensibly an ally, Abydos was hostile to Athens throughout this time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt; and contributed a ''[[phoros]]'' of 4-6 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brill&quot;/&gt; [[Xenophon]] documented that Abydos possessed gold mines at Astyra or Kremaste at the time of his writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Second Peloponnesian War]], a [[Sparta]]n expedition led by [[Dercylidas]] arrived at Abydos in early May 411 BC and successfully convinced the city to defect from the Delian League and fight against Athens,&lt;ref&gt;Kagan (2013), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; at which time he was made [[harmost]] (commander/governor) of Abydos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodkinson &quot;&gt;Hodkinson (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; A Spartan fleet was [[Battle of Abydos|defeated]] by Athens at Abydos in the autumn of 411 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Westlake (1985), p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Abydos was attacked by the Athenians in the winter of 409/408 BC, but was repelled by a Persian force led by [[Pharnabazus II|Pharnabazus]], [[satrap]] (governor) of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kagan (2013), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Dercylidas held the office of harmost of Abydos until at least {{circa|407}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodkinson &quot; /&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], Abydos had an [[oligarchic]] constitution at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;/&gt; At the beginning of the [[Corinthian War]] in 394 BC, [[Agesilaus II]], King of Sparta, passed through Abydos into Thrace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phang&quot;/&gt; Abydos remained an ally of Sparta throughout the war and Dercylidas served as harmost of the city from 394 until he was replaced by [[Anaxibius]] in {{circa|390}}; the latter was killed in an ambush near Abydos by the Athenian general [[Iphicrates]] in {{circa|389/388}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phang&quot;&gt;Phang et al. (2016), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the Corinthian War, under the terms of the [[Peace of Antalcidas]] in 387 BC, Abydos was annexed to the Persian Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt; Within the Persian Empire, Abydos was administered as part of the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and was ruled by the tyrant [[Philiscus of Abydos|Philiscus]] in 368.&lt;ref&gt;Fine (1983), p. 584&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maffre (2007), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; In {{circa|360 BC}}, the city came under the control of the tyrant Iphiades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hansen1003&quot;/&gt;

===Hellenistic period===
Abydos remained under Persian control until it was seized by a [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] army led by [[Parmenion]], a general of [[Alexander the Great]], in the spring of 336 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot;&gt;Ashley (2004), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; In 335, whilst Parmenion besieged the city of [[Pitane (Aeolis)|Pitane]], Abydos was besieged by a Persian army led by [[Memnon of Rhodes]], forcing Parmenion to abandon his siege of Pitane and march north to relieve Abydos.&lt;ref&gt;Freely (2010), pp. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander ferried across from Sestos to Abydos in 334 and travelled south to the city of Troy, after which he returned to Abydos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt; The following day, Alexander left Abydos and led his army north to [[Percote]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashley&quot; /&gt; Alexander later established a royal mint at Abydos, as well as at other cities in [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;Dmitriev (2011), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Abydos, as part of the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia, came under the control of [[Leonnatus]] as a result of the [[Partition of Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Partition of Triparadisus]] in 321 BC, [[Arrhidaeus]] succeeded Leonnatus as satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia.&lt;ref&gt;Roisman (2012), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

In 302, during the [[Fourth War of the Diadochi]], [[Lysimachus]], King of Thrace, crossed over into Asia Minor and invaded the kingdom of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus I]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie89&quot;&gt;Magie (2015), p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the neighbouring cities of [[Parium]] and Lampsacus which surrendered, Abydos resisted Lysimachus and was besieged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie89&quot; /&gt; Lysimachus was forced to abandon the siege, however, after the arrival of a relief force sent by [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius]], son of King Antigonus I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magie89&quot; /&gt; According to [[Polybius]], by the third century BC, the neighbouring city of [[Baris in Hellesponto|Arisbe]] had become subordinate to Abydos.&lt;ref&gt;Spawforth (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Dardanus (city)|Dardanus]] also came under the control of Abydos at some point in the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackay&quot;&gt;Mackay (1976), p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; Abydos became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] after 281 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brill&quot;&gt;''[https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/abydus-e101490 Abydus]''.

During the [[Second Macedonian War]], Abydos was besieged by [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], King of Macedonia, in 200 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques&quot;&gt;Jaques (2007), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; during which many of its citizens chose to commit suicide rather than surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Magie (2015), pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] met with Philip V during the siege to deliver an ultimatum on behalf of the [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Roman senate]].&lt;ref&gt;Briscoe (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the city was forced to surrender to Philip V due to a lack of reinforcements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques&quot;/&gt; The Macedonian occupation ended after the Peace of Flamininus at the end of the war in 196 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaques&quot;/&gt; At this time, Abydos was substantially depopulated and partially ruined as a result of the Macedonian occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Grainger (2002), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 196 BC, Abydos was seized by [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]], ''[[Basileus|Megas Basileus]]'' of the Seleucid Empire,&lt;ref&gt;Magie (2015), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; who refortified the city in 192/191 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phang&quot;/&gt; Antiochus III later withdrew from Abydos during the [[Roman-Seleucid War]], thus allowing for the transportation of the Roman army into Asia Minor by October 190 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Errington (1989), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Dardanus was subsequently liberated from Abydene control,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackay&quot; /&gt; and the [[Treaty of Apamea]] of 188 BC returned Abydos to the Kingdom of Pergamon.&lt;ref&gt;Errington (1989), pp. 287-288&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] was active at Abydos in the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/education-culture-e217200#p2560 Education / Culture]''. Brill Reference Online&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman period===
[[Attalus III]], King of Pergamon, bequeathed his kingdom to Rome upon his death in 133 BC, and thus Abydos became part of the [[Asia (Roman province)|province of Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Dmitriev (2005), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The gold mines of Abydos at Astyra or Kremaste were near exhaustion at the time was Strabo was writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bean&quot;/&gt; The city was counted amongst the ''telonia'' (custom houses) of the province of Asia in the ''lex portorii Asiae'' of 62 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Leveniotis (2017), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and formed part of the ''[[conventus iuridicus]] [[Adramyttium|Adramytteum]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leveniotis8&quot; /&gt; Abydos is mentioned in the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' and [[Antonine Itinerary]].&lt;ref&gt;Magie (2017), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The mint of Abydos ceased to function in the mid-3rd century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leveniotis8&quot;&gt;Leveniotis (2017), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Abydos, with Sestos and Lampsacus, is referred to as one of the &quot;three large capital cities&quot; of the Roman Empire in ''[[Weilüe]]'', a 3rd-century AD Chinese text.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie &amp; Gardiner (1995), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The city was the centre for customs collection at the southern entrance of the [[Sea of Marmara]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;/&gt; and was administered by an ''komes ton Stenon'' (count of the Straits) or an ''[[archon#Byzantine Empire|archon]]'' from the 3rd century to the 5th century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leveniotis12&quot; &gt;Leveniotis (2017), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century AD, Emperor [[Justinian I]] introduced the office of ''komes Abydou'' with responsibility for collecting customs duty in Abydos.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foss&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|ODB|loc=&quot;[http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezproxy01.rhul.ac.uk/view/10.1093/acref/9780195046526.001.0001/acref-9780195046526-e-0024?rskey=9rYfUw&amp;result=1 Abydos]&quot; (C.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The [[bishopric]] of Abydus appears in all the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the mid-7th century until the time of [[Andronikos III Palaiologos]] (1341), first as a [[suffragan]] of [[Cyzicus]] and then from 1084 as a [[metropolitan see]] without suffragans. The earliest bishop mentioned in extant documents is Marcian, who signed the joint letter of the bishops of Hellespontus to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] in 458, protesting about the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]]. A letter of [[Peter the Fuller]] (471–488) mentions a bishop of Abydus called Pamphilus. Ammonius signed the decretal letter of the Council of Constantinople in 518 against [[Severus of Antioch]] and others. Isidore was at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] (680–681), John at the [[Trullan Council]] (692), Theodore at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787). An unnamed bishop of Abydus was a counsellor of Emperor [[Nikephoros II]] in 969.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lequien.

Dumbarton Oaks&lt;/ref&gt; Abydos remained a metropolitan see until the city fell to the Turks in the 14th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nesbitt &quot;/&gt; The diocese is currently a [[titular see]] of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Gerasimos Papadopoulos was titular Bishop of Abydos from 1962 until his death in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.goarch.org/-/gerasimos-papadopoulos-bishop-of-abydos-the-wise-abba-of-america Gerasimos Papadopoulos: Bishop of Abydos, the Wise Abba of America]''.

In 1222, during the Latin occupation, the [[papal legate]] [[Giovanni Colonna (died 1245)|Giovanni Colonna]] united the dioceses of Abydos and [[Madytos (Thrace)|Madytos]] and placed the see under direct Papal authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leveniotis13-14&quot;&gt;Leveniotis (2017), pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; No longer a residential [[bishopric]], Abydus is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a titular see, and has had the following incumbents:
